    "story": [
      "Hip hop superstar Drake is now complaining about rival rapper Kendrick Lamar\u2019s performance of \u201cNot Like Us\u201d at this year\u2019s Super Bowl",
      "Hip hop superstar Drake is now complaining about rival rapper Kendrick Lamar's performance of \u201cNot Like Us\u201d at this year's Super Bowl, adding it to his defamation lawsuit against Universal Music Group over the diss track and its allegations of pedophilia against Drake.",
      "\u201cThe Recording was performed during the 2025 Super Bowl and broadcast to the largest audience for a Super Bowl halftime show ever, over 133 million people, including millions of children, and millions more who had never before heard the song or any of the songs that preceded it,\" says the amended lawsuit filed Wednesday in federal court in Manhattan.",
      "It adds, \"It was the first, and will hopefully be the last, Super Bowl halftime show orchestrated to assassinate the character of another artist.\u201d",
      "Although Lamar removed the word \u201cpedophile\u201d that's in the track during the halftime show, the fact that it was omitted showed that \u201cnearly everyone understands that it is defamatory,\u201d the suit says. It also alleges Universal Music used financial benefits and leveraged business relationships to secure the headliner spot for Lamar at the Super Bowl, and promoted the performance.",
      "\u201cDrake\u2019s amended complaint makes an already strong case stronger,\u201d his lawyer, Michael Gottlieb, said in a statement. \"Drake will expose the evidence of UMG\u2019s misconduct, and UMG will be held accountable for the consequences of its ill-conceived decisions.\u201d",
      "This year's Super Bowl and its halftime show were the most-watched ever, according to Nielsen.",
      "In a statement responding to the court filing, Universal Music, the parent record label of both artists, continued to deny Drake's allegations.",
      "\u201cDrake, unquestionably one of the world\u2019s most accomplished artists and with whom we\u2019ve enjoyed a 16-year successful relationship, is being misled by his legal representatives into taking one absurd legal step after another,\" the company said. \u201cIt is shameful that these foolish and frivolous legal theatrics continue.\u201d",
      "The amended lawsuit also adds that defamatory portions of \u201cNot Like Us\" were played at the Grammy Awards in February, when the single won five awards, including song and record of the year. The suit claims that Universal Music also helped secure the Grammy nominations and allowed the song to be played at the ceremony.",
      "Drake sued Universal Music, but not Lamar, for undisclosed damages in January, saying the company published and promoted \u201cNot Like Us\u201d despite its false pedophilia allegations and suggestions that listeners should resort to vigilante justice.",
      "The result, the suit says, was intruders shooting a security guard at Drake\u2019s Toronto home and two attempted break-ins there, online hate and harassment, a hit to his reputation and a decrease in his brand\u2019s value before his contract renegotiation with UMG this year. The amended lawsuit also adds more online comments indicating people believe the pedophilia allegations.",
      "Drake, a 38-year-old Canadian rapper and singer and five-time Grammy winner, and Lamar, a 37-year-old Pulitzer Prize winner with 22 Grammy wins, have been beefing for years. The feud is among the biggest in hip hop in recent years.",
      "The two were occasional collaborators more than a decade ago, but Lamar began taking public jabs at Drake starting in 2013. The fight escalated steeply last year, as both launched diss tracks at each other, including Lamar's \u201cNot Like Us.\u201d",
      "\u201cSay, Drake, I hear you like \u2019em young / You better not ever go to cell block one,\u201d Lamar raps.",
      "In its motion to dismiss the lawsuit, Universal Music says Drake helped fuel the beef with his own inflammatory diss tracks aimed at Lamar.",
      "\u201cPlaintiff, one of the most successful recording artists of all time, lost a rap battle that he provoked and in which he willingly participated,\" the motion says. \"Instead of accepting the loss like the unbothered rap artist he often claims to be, he has sued his own record label in a misguided attempt to salve his wounds.\u201d",

His final broadcast will be Aug. 30 \u2014 Week 1 of the 2025 college football season \u2014 and the network said additional programming to celebrate Corso is also planned.",
      "\"My family and I will be forever indebted for the opportunity to be part of ESPN and \u2018College GameDay\u2019 for nearly 40 years,\u201d Corso said in a statement to ESPN. \u201cI have a treasure of many friends, fond memories and some unusual experiences to take with me into retirement.\u201d",
      "Corso, who turns 90 in August, began his popular headgear segment in October 1995 at a game at Ohio State. Since then, he has gone 286-144 in 430 selections wearing everything from helmets and mascot heads to dressing up as the Fighting Irish leprechaun from Notre Dame, the Stanford tree and historic figures James Madison and Benjamin Franklin.",
      "\u201cNot so fast, my friend\u201d is one of his most well-known comments and his good humor alongside Kirk Herbstreit, Rece Davis and Desmond Howard and many others going back more than three decades helped make Corso and the show a beloved staple for millions on college football Saturdays.",
      "Corso's career has lasted through a health scare in 2009, when he suffered a stroke that left him unable to speak for a while. He returned to \u201cCollege GameDay \u201dlater that year. Though he hasn't joined his colleagues as much on the road in recent years, Corso was at the site of last year's national title game between Ohio State and Notre Dame in Atlanta.",
      "Corso was a college and pro football coach for 28 years before transitioning to broadcasting. He coached 15 years in college at Louisville, Indiana and Northern Illinois.",

      "Martindale said his many years as a radio DJ were helpful to him as a game show host because radio calls for constant ad-libs and he learned to handle almost any situation in the spur of the moment. He estimated that he hosted nearly two dozen game shows during his career.",
      "Martindale wrote in his memoir that the question he got asked most often was \u201cIs Wink your real name?\u201d The second was \u201cHow did you get into game shows?\u201d",
      "He got his nickname from a childhood friend. Martindale is no relation to University of Michigan defensive coordinator Don Martindale, whose college teammates nicknamed him Wink because of their shared last name.",
      "Born Winston Conrad Martindale on Dec. 4, 1933, in Jackson, Tennessee, he loved radio since childhood and at age 6 would read aloud the contents of advertisements in Life magazine.",
      "He began his career as a disc jockey at age 17 at WPLI in his hometown, earning $25 a week.",
      "After moving to WTJS, he was hired away for double the salary by Jackson\u2019s only other station, WDXI. He next hosted mornings at WHBQ in Memphis while attending Memphis State. He was married and the father of two girls when he graduated in 1957.",
      "Martindale was in the studio, although not working on-air that night, when the first Presley record \u201cThat\u2019s All Right\u201d was played on WHBQ on July 8, 1954.",
      "Martindale approached fellow DJ Dewey Phillips, who had given Presley an early break by playing his song, to ask him and Presley to do a joint interview on Martindale\u2019s TV show \u201cTop Ten Dance Party\u201d in 1956. By then, Presley had become a major star and agreed to the appearance.",
      "Martindale and Presley stayed in touch on occasion through the years, and in 1959 he did a trans-Atlantic telephone interview with Presley, who was in the Army in Germany. Martindale\u2019s second wife, Sandy, briefly dated Presley after meeting him on the set of \u201cG.I. Blues\u201d in 1960.",
      "In 1959, Martindale moved to Los Angeles to host a morning show on KHJ. That same year he reached No. 7 on the Billboard Hot 100 chart with a cover version of \u201cDeck of Cards,\u201d which sold over 1 million copies. He performed the spoken word wartime story with religious overtones on \u201cThe Ed Sullivan Show.\u201d",
      "\u201cI could easily have thought, \u2019Wow, this is easy! I come out here, go on radio and TV, make a record and everybody wants to buy it!\u201d he wrote. \u201cEven if I entertained such thoughts, they soon dissipated. I learned in due time that what had happened to me was far from the ordinary.\u201d",
      "A year later he moved to the morning show at KRLA and to KFWB in 1962. Among his many other radio gigs were two separate stints at KMPC, owned by actor Gene Autry.",
      "His first network hosting job was on NBC\u2019s \u201cWhat\u2019s This Song?\u201d where he was credited as Win Martindale from 1964-65.",
      "He later hosted two Chuck Barris-produced shows on ABC: \u201cDream Girl \u201967\u201d and \u201cHow\u2019s Your Mother-in-Law?\u201d The latter lasted just 13 weeks before being canceled.",
      "\u201cI\u2019ve jokingly said it came and went so fast, it seemed more like 13 minutes!\u201d Martindale wrote, explaining that it was the worst show of his career.",
      "Martindale later hosted a Las Vegas-based revival of \u201cGambit\u201d from 1980-81.",
      "He formed his own production company, Wink Martindale Enterprises, to develop and produce his own game shows. His first venture was \u201cHeadline Chasers,\u201d a coproduction with Merv Griffin that debuted in 1985 and was canceled after one season. His next show, \u201cBumper Stumpers,\u201d ran on U.S. and Canadian television from 1987-1990.",
      "He hosted \u201cDebt\u201d from 1996-98 on Lifetime cable and \u201cInstant Recall\u201d on GSN in 2010.",
      "Martindale returned to his radio roots in 2012 as host of the nationally syndicated \u201cThe 100 Greatest Christmas Hits of All Time.\u201d In 2021, he hosted syndicated program \u201cThe History of Rock \u2018n\u2019 Roll.\u201d",
      "In 2017, Martindale appeared in a KFC ad campaign with actor Rob Lowe.",
      "He is survived by Sandy, his second wife of 49 years, and children Lisa, Madelyn ad Laura and numerous grandchildren. He was preceded in death by his son, Wink Jr. Martindale's children are from his first marriage which ended in divorce in 1972.",

      "Swedish slow TV hit \u201cThe Great Moose Migration\u201d has become a phenomenon",
      "Before Swedish slow TV hit \u201cThe Great Moose Migration\u201d began airing Tuesday, Ulla Malmgren stocked up on coffee and prepared meals. She doesn't want to miss a moment of the 20-day, 24-hour event.",
      "\u201cSleep? Forget it. I don\u2019t sleep,\u201d she said.",
      "Malmgren, 62, isn't alone. The show, called \u201c Den stora \u00e4lgvandringen \u201d in Swedish and sometimes translated as \u201cThe Great Elk Trek\u201d in English, began in 2019 with nearly a million people watching. In 2024, the production hit 9 million viewers on SVT Play, the streaming platform for national broadcaster SVT.",
      "The livestream kicked off a week ahead of schedule due to warm weather and early moose movement. Malmgren was ready.",
      "From now until May 4, the livestream's remote cameras will capture dozens of moose as they swim across the \u00c5ngerman River, some 300 kilometers (187 miles) northwest of Stockholm, in the annual spring migration toward summer grazing pastures.",
      "Not much happens for hours at a time, and fans say that's the beauty of it.",
      "\u201cI feel relaxed, but at the same time I\u2019m like, \u2018Oh, there\u2019s a moose, oh! What if there\u2019s a moose? I can\u2019t go to the toilet!\u2019\u201d said William Garp Liljefors, 20, who has collected more than 150 moose plush toys since 2020.",
      "\u201cThe Great Moose Migration\" is part of a trend that began in 2009 with Norwegian public broadcaster NRK's minute-by-minute airing of a seven-hour train trip across the southern part of the country.",
      "The slow TV style of programming has spread, with productions in the United Kingdom, China and elsewhere. The central Dutch city of Utrecht, for example, installed a \u201c fish doorbell \u201d on a river lock that lets livestream viewers alert authorities to fish being held up as they migrate to spawning grounds.",
      "Annette Hill, a professor of media and communications at J\u00f6nk\u00f6ping University in Sweden, said slow TV has roots in reality television but lacks the staging and therefore feels more authentic for viewers. The productions allow the audience to relax and watch the journey unfold.",
      "\u201cIt became, in a strange way, gripping because nothing catastrophic is happening, nothing spectacular is happening,\" she said. \"But something very beautiful is happening in that minute-by-minute moment.\u201d",
      "As an expert and a fan of \u201cThe Great Moose Migration,\u201d Hill said the livestream helps her slow down her day by following the natural rhythms of spring.",
      "\u201cThis is definitely a moment to have a calm, atmospheric setting in my own home, and I really appreciate it,\u201d she said.",
      "The calming effect extends to the crew, according to Johan Erhag, SVT's project manager for \u201cThe Great Moose Migration.\u201d",
      "\u201cEveryone who works with it goes down in their normal stress,\u201d he said.",
      "The moose have walked the route for thousands of years, making it easy for the crew to know where to lay some 20,000 meters (almost 12 miles) of cable and position 26 remote cameras and seven night cameras. A drone is also used.",
      "The crew of up to 15 people works out of SVT\u2019s control room in Ume\u00e5, producing the show at a distance to avoid interfering with the migration.",
      "SVT won't say how much the production costs, but Erhag said it's cheap when accounting for the 506 hours of footage aired last year.",
      "Erhag said Swedes have always been fascinated by the roughly 300,000 moose roaming in their woods. The Scandinavian country's largest animal is known as \u201cKing of the Forest.\u201d A bull moose can reach 210 centimeters (6 feet 10 inches) at shoulder height and weigh 450 kilograms (992 pounds).",
      "Despite their size, the herbivores are typically shy and solitary.",
      "\u201cWe actually don\u2019t see it very often. You often see it when you\u2019re out driving maybe once or twice in your life,\u201d Erhag said. \u201cI think that\u2019s one thing why it has been so, so popular. And then you bring in the nature to everyone\u2019s living room.\"",
      "Hanna Sandberg, 36, first began watching the show in 2019, though she didn't spot any moose. She tuned in the following year, finally saw some and got hooked.",
      "\u201cYou can watch them and be a part of their natural habitat in a way that you could never be otherwise,\u201d she said.",
      "After hours of showing an empty forest, a camera captures footage of a moose approaching the riverbank. Suddenly, slow TV turns urgent.",
      "The push alert hits SVT's app \u2014 \u201cF\u00f6rsta \u00e4lgarna i bild!\u201d which translates to \u201cFirst moose on camera!\u201d \u2014 as viewers worldwide tune in. The livestream's chat explodes as commenters type encouragement for the animal, now making its way into the water.",
      "\u201dI would actually like to be a little fly on the wall in every household that watches the moose migration. Because I think there is about a million people saying about the same thing: \u2018Go on! Yes, you can do it!\u2019\" Malmgren said.",
      "Mega-fans like Malmgren, who is in a Facebook group of 76,000-plus viewers, are committed to watching as many hours as possible.",
      "\u201cI was late to school because I saw moose and my teacher was like, \u2018What, you saw moose in the city?\u2019 And I was like, \u2018No, it\u2019s on the TV,\u2019\u201d Garp Liljefors said.",
      "Malmgren said friends and family have learned not to bother her when the moose are on the move.",
      "\u201cWhen someone asks me, \u2018What are you doing? Oh, never mind, it\u2019s the great migration,\u2019\" she said. \"They know.\u201d",

      "Five years after Harvey Weinstein was convicted of rape and hauled to jail in handcuffs, the disgraced movie mogul returns to a Manhattan courthouse Tuesday for a new trial covering the very same allegations",
      "NEW YORK -- Five years after Harvey Weinstein was convicted of rape and hauled to jail in handcuffs, the former movie mogul returns to a Manhattan courthouse Tuesday for a new trial covering the very same allegations \u2014 plus one that hasn't been tried before.",
      "It isn\u2019t double jeopardy, but rather a legal redo after a New York appeals court overturned the landmark #MeToo verdict a year ago.",
      "The state\u2019s Court of Appeals threw out Weinstein\u2019s convictions and 23-year prison sentence and ordered a new trial after finding that the original one was tilted by \u201cegregious\u201d judicial rulings and prejudicial testimony.",
      "Jury selection could take a few days. Opening statements and the start of testimony are expected next week. Judge Curtis Farber said that in addition to 12 jurors, six alternates will be picked. Prosecutors expect the retrial to last a month.",
      "Here\u2019s what you need to know about Weinstein\u2019s retrial:",
      "In some ways, the new trial will be two trials spliced into one.",
      "Weinstein, 73, faces charges involving two women from his original trial in 2020, Jessica Mann and Miriam Haley, and he\u2019s being tried for the first time on an allegation from a woman who wasn\u2019t in the first case.",
      "Weinstein has pleaded not guilty and denies that he raped or sexually assaulted anyone. Prosecutors are not allowed to retry Weinstein on certain counts that he was acquitted of during his first trial, including charges of predatory sexual assault and one count of first-degree rape.",
      "The judicial reboot will play out in a different climate than Weinstein\u2019s first trial, which drew intense media attention and saw protesters chanting \u201crapist\u201d outside the courthouse.",
      "The #MeToo movement, spawned by scores of allegations in 2017 against the ex-studio boss, has evolved and ebbed over time, and Weinstein has since been convicted in a separate rape case in Los Angeles \u2014 a verdict he is also appealing.",
      "While some stars are still facing a legal reckoning for alleged sexual misconduct \u2013 like Sean \u201cDiddy\u201d Combs, who is set to go to trial next month \u2013 the drumbeat of allegations against powerful figures has abated from #MeToo\u2019s early days.",
      "Weinstein is being retried on two charges from his original trial: one count of criminal sex act for allegedly forcibly performing oral sex on a movie and TV production assistant in 2006 and one count of third-degree rape for allegedly assaulting an aspiring actor in a Manhattan hotel room in 2013.",
      "Haley, a former production assistant on the Weinstein-produced \u201cProject Runway,\u201d testified at the 2020 trial that he pushed her onto a bed at his Manhattan apartment in June 2006 and forced oral sex on her, undeterred by her kicks and pleas of, \u201cNo, please don\u2019t do this, I don\u2019t want it.\u201d",
      "Haley, who has also gone by the name Mimi Haleyi, acknowledged that she kept in touch with Weinstein, exchanged warm messages with him, and accepted an invitation to his hotel room two weeks after the alleged assault, where he pulled her into bed for sex. Under New York law applicable at the time, Weinstein has not being charged with rape in connection with Haley\u2019s allegations.",
      "Mann, who said she saw Weinstein as a \u201cpseudo father\u201d figure as she pursued an acting career after a rough upbringing, testified at the 2020 trial that he trapped her in a hotel room in March 2013, ordered her to undress as he loomed over her, and then raped her. She alleges that Weinstein raped her again eight months later at a Beverly Hills hotel, where she worked as a hairdresser.",
      "Mann also kept in touch with Weinstein after the alleged assault, testifying that she sent him flattering emails, because \u201chis ego was so fragile,\u201d she said, and it \u201cmade me feel safe, worshipping him in this sense.\u201d",
      "In addition to Haley and Mann, Weinstein is also charged with one count of criminal sex act for allegedly forcing oral sex on a different woman at a Manhattan hotel in 2006.",
      "That woman, who was not part of Weinstein\u2019s first trial, has not been named publicly. The Associated Press does not generally identify people alleging sexual assault unless they consent to be named, as Haley and Mann have done.",
      "Prosecutors said that the woman came forward to them just days before the start of Weinstein\u2019s first trial but was not part of that case. They said they did not pursue the women\u2019s allegations after Weinstein's conviction, but revisited them and secured a new indictment after the first verdict was thrown out.",
      "Weinstein\u2019s lawyers contend that prosecutors shouldn't have waited nearly five years to bring the additional charge.",
      "New York\u2019s highest court, the Court of Appeals, threw out Weinstein\u2019s conviction in April 2024.",
      "In a 4-3 decision, the court said then-Judge James Burke had denied Weinstein a fully fair trial by letting three women testify about allegations that weren\u2019t part of the case and his decision to let prosecutors confront Weinstein, if he had testified, over his history of brutish behavior.",
      "The court labeled the allegations against Weinstein \u201cappalling, shameful, repulsive conduct\u201d but warned that \u201cdestroying a defendant\u2019s character under the guise of prosecutorial need\u201d did not justify some trial evidence and testimony. Burke\u2019s term expired at the end of 2022, and he is no longer a judge.",
      "In a dissenting opinion, Court of Appeals Judge Madeline Singas wrote that her colleagues in the majority were continuing a \u201cdisturbing trend of overturning juries\u2019 guilty verdicts in cases involving sexual violence.\u201d",
      "The ruling came at \u201cthe expense and safety of women,\u201d she wrote.",

      "McIntyre\u2019s attorneys had criticized the police investigation of the shooting, alleging the case relied too much on self-serving statements from witnesses in the car when the shooting happened.",
      "\u201cTaymor McIntyre is not guilty of capital murder, murder, or manslaughter, and the reason for that is very simple,\u201d John Hunter, one of McIntyre\u2019s attorneys, told jurors during closing arguments last week. \u201cYou have to do it right. You have to do the work. And this case clearly demonstrates the work wasn\u2019t done.\u201d",
      "The jury found McIntyre not guilty of capital murder, which would have meant a life sentence without the chance of parole. The jury will now hear evidence in the trial\u2019s punishment phase before deciding on a sentence.",

      "In its vaults, the museum preserves 15,000 artifacts seized or confiscated from the black market over the years by a police unit focused on the protection of cultural heritage. It is the loot of raiders who for decades have targeted sites from classical antiquity in southern Italy, such as Pompeii and Herculaneum. Some even used underwater metal detectors, GPS, sonar and drones to extract treasures from the shipwrecks and archaeological sites submerged in the Mediterranean Sea.",
      "From its repository, the museum selected 600 pieces to display for visitors. Among them is a statue that had been in an apartment building's courtyard since the early 20th century until its theft in the 1980s, and which was found in 2009. There are artifacts from Pompeii that a French archaeologist bought from a local farmer in the 1990s for 50,000 lire (about $28 today). There are also ancient ceramics, coins, bronzes, marbles, pottery, furnishings, weapons and armor dating from the Archaic Period (approximately 650 to 480 BC) to the Middle Ages.",

      "In 2023, the latest year for which there are complete records, the police unit recovered over 100,000 artifacts which it estimates are worth a total 264 million euros ($299 million).",

We are all made of stardust and we all come from the stars.\u201d",

On Monday, she will join Jeff Bezos\u2019 fiancee Lauren Sanchez, journalist Gayle King and three other women on an all-female Blue Origin spaceflight.

      "An all-female spaceflight seems an apt endeavor for the 40-year-old Perry, whose collection of hits include songs about extraterrestrials (\u201cE.T.\u201d) and fireworks shooting across the sky (\u201cFirework\u201d), as well as feminist anthems like her 2013 hit, \u201cRoar,\u201d and \u201cWOMAN\u2019S WORLD,\u201d off her most recent album.",

      "Bezos\u2019 rocket company Blue Origin announced the crew in February. Sanchez, a helicopter pilot and former TV journalist, picked the women who will join her on a 10-minute spaceflight from West Texas aboard a New Shepard rocket. Perry, Sanchez and King will be joined by Aisha Bowe, a former NASA rocket scientist who now heads an engineering firm, research scientist Amanda Nguyen and movie producer Kerianne Flynn.",

      "Blue Origin has flown tourists on short hops to space since 2021, after Bezos climbed aboard with his brother for the inaugural trip; the upcoming trip will be the company's 11th human spaceflight.

      "The news of the upcoming trip has not been without critiques, most recently from actor Olivia Munn, who bemoaned the mission's cost and publicity. But Perry believes an all-women crew \u2014 the first since Valentina Tereshkova\u2019s solo spaceflight in 1963 \u2014 has historic ramifications.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s an important moment for the future of commercial space travel and for humanity in general and for women all around,\u201d she said, citing the fact that only about 11% of the people who have gone to space have been women. \u201cI\u2019m excited for that number to be even more equal after this flight. And I just feel like, \u2018Put us in coach.\u2019\u201d",

P\u00e9rez had been performing on stage at the packed Jet Set club early Tuesday when dust began falling from the ceiling and, seconds later, the roof caved.",

Some mourners doubled over in tears as a recording of P\u00e9rez singing the national anthem played. Renowned Dominican musician Juan Luis Guerra was among those gathered to pay their respects.",

      "NEW YORK -- Her first panic attack came at a company-wide meeting, right before her scheduled presentation. Carolina Lasso had given many similar talks about her marketing team's accomplishments. When her name was called this time, she couldn\u2019t speak.",
      "\u201cI felt a knot in my throat,\u201d Lasso said. \u201cMy head, it felt like it was inside a bubble. I couldn\u2019t hear, I couldn\u2019t see, and it felt like an eternity. It was just a few seconds, but it was so profound, and in a way earth-shattering to me.\u201d",
      "Lasso was struggling after a cross-country move followed by a divorce. Her boss suggested a mental health leave, a possibility she didn\u2019t know existed. She worried whether taking time off would affect how her team viewed her or cost her a future promotion, but in the end she did.",
      "\u201cI\u2019m thankful for that opportunity to take the time to heal,\" Lasso, 43, said. \u201cMany people feel guilty when they take a leave of absence when it\u2019s mental health-related. ... There is some extra weight that we carry on our shoulders, as if it had been our fault.\u201d",
      "Despite a fear of repercussions, more adults are recognizing that stepping back from work to deal with emotional burdens or psychological conditions that get in the way of their lives is a necessary choice, one that a growing number of employers recognize.",
      "ComPsych Corp., a provider of employee mental health programs and absence management services, encourages its business clients to make the well-being of workers a priority before individuals get to a breaking point while also having processes in place for those who require leaves of absence.",
      "\u201cSince the start of the COVID-19 pandemic, collectively we\u2019ve just been in this constant state of turmoil,\u201d Jennifer Birdsall, the senior clinical director at ComPysch, said. \u201cWe just have had this barrage of change and uncertainty.\u201d",
      "Depression, anxiety and adjustment disorder, which involves excessive reactions to stress, were the top three diagnoses of employees who took mental health leaves in the past two years among clients of Alight, a Chicago-based technology company which administers leaves and benefits for large employers.",
      "A mental health leave can last weeks or months. In some cases, workers get approval to work a reduced schedule or to take short periods of time off when needed, using an approach called \u201cintermittent leave.\u201d",
      "At most U.S. organizations with 50 or more employees, people can request leaves through the Family and Medical Leave Act. The federal law entitles workers with serious health conditions to paid or unpaid leaves of up to 12 weeks, depending on state and local laws.",
      "Some employers require people to use sick days or accumulated vacation days to continue receiving a paycheck while out. For longer leaves, workers can access short-term disability plans, if their employer offers one.",
      "Lasso's leave lasted six months, and included therapy and travel to India for additional treatment. She returned to her job but decided after a year to leave for good. She later launched a business to train people on fostering a more humane work culture.",
      "A mental health leave is \u201cnot only OK, but it can really unlock new possibilities once we have the time to do the work \u2014 therapy, medication, whatever it is \u2014 and have enough distance from work to be able to reconnect with ourselves,\u201d Lasso said.",
      "A social stigma around mental health challenges causes many people to avoid seeking treatment or requesting a leave of absence. Newton Cheng, director of health and performance at Google, hopes to change that by sharing his own struggles.",
      "His first self-disclosure happened during the pandemic, when a senior manager invited employees at a meeting to share how they were doing. When it was his turn, Cheng started crying.",
      "He explained he was struggling to live up to his expectations of himself as a father and didn't know how to turn things around.",
      "\u201cIt was just totally horrifying to me because, one, I had just cried in front of my coworkers and I was definitely taught as a professional \u2014 and as a man \u2014 you do not do that,\" Cheng recalled. \"And then two, I had never really articulated and said out loud those words. I hadn\u2019t even allowed myself to think that. But now they\u2019re out there and I had to face them.\u201d",
      "Colleagues responded by relaying their own struggles, but Cheng's difficulties continued. By February 2021, he couldn't get out of bed because he felt paralyzed by dread, he said. A therapist said he was showing symptoms of major depression and anxiety.",
      "\u201cI just realized, \u2018I\u2019m struggling a lot and this goes pretty deep. I don\u2019t think I can keep just putting duct tape on this. I probably need to take some leave,\u2019\u201d Cheng recalled.",
      "Hoping his decision would benefit others, he announced to 200 people at a conference that he planned to take mental health leave. Instead of derailing the gathering as he feared, his honesty inspired fellow conference attendees to open up.",
      "\"It was like a fireworks show,\u201d Cheng said. \u201cThey\u2019re like, \u2018Wow, I can\u2019t believe he did that.\u2019 Then they forgot about me. But the tone was set. It was like \u2019Oh, this is what we\u2019re doing. Let me talk about what\u2019s going on with me, too.'\u201d",
      "While balancing classes and a full-time job during her last year of college, Rosalie Mae began struggling to get out of bed and crying uncontrollably. Yet she felt like she had \u201cto keep it together\u201d to avoid burdening her colleagues at the University of Utah bookstore, where Mae worked as an accounting clerk.",
      "Then she found herself calling a suicide hotline. \u201cOnce it reached that point, I knew, especially at the urging of my husband, we need to do something more,\u201d Mae, 24, said.",
      "In her case, that meant taking a five-week work leave to put her own health and well-being first. She recommends the same for others who find themselves in a similar position.",
      "\u201cTaking a mental health leave is not necessarily a cure-all, but it is important to give yourself a break and allow yourself to regroup, make a plan of how to proceed and take the steps to work towards feeling better,\" Mae said.",
      "Before broaching the subject of a mental health leave with a manager, consider the workplace culture and the strength of your professional relationships, Cheng said. He recalls saying, \u201cFor my health and well-being, and the sake of my family and what's best for the business, the least risky thing for me to do is to go on leave soon.\u201d",
      "Individuals who suspect an unsympathetic reception can simply say, \u201cI need to go on medical leave. I need time to recover,\u201d he advised.",
      "There's also no legal or ethical requirement to tell everyone you work with the nature of your leave.",
      "\u201cYour coworkers don't need to know why,\u201d said Seth Turner, co-founder of AbsenceSoft, a leave and accommodation management solutions provider. \u201cThey just need to know, 'I\u2019m going to be here at this time, and I'm going to be gone at this time, and I'll be back.'\u201d",

    "story": [
      "The U.K. Supreme Court has ruled that a woman is someone born biologically female and that transgender women are excluded from that legal definition",
      "LONDON -- In a judgment with far-reaching implications, the U.K. Supreme Court ruled Wednesday that a woman is someone born biologically female and that transgender women are excluded from that legal definition.",
      "The ruling was cheered by some feminists who have campaigned to safeguard rights for women on the basis of biological sex. Trans rights campaigners were disappointed, and worry about the ruling's implications for transgender women.",
      "The court was asked to determine the definition of a woman under Britain\u2019s 2010 Equality Act, which sets out protections against discrimination on the basis of sex, sexual orientation, race, religion and other traits.",
      "The case stems from a 2018 law passed by the Scottish Parliament calling for 50% female representation on the boards of Scottish public bodies. Its definition of women included trans women whose gender is legally affirmed with a Gender Recognition Certificate.",
      "A feminist group, For Women Scotland, challenged that in court, saying the Scottish government had overstepped its powers by effectively redefining the meaning of \u201cwoman.\u201d",
      "The group lost a ruling in a Scottish court in 2022 but was later granted permission to take its case to the Supreme Court, which held hearings in November.",
      "Justice Patrick Hodge said he and four other judges ruled unanimously that \u201cthe terms woman and sex in the Equality Act refer to a biological woman.\u201d",
      "In the law, \u201cthe words \u2018sex,\u2019 \u2018woman\u2019 and \u2018man\u2019 \u2026 mean (and were always intended to mean) biological sex, biological woman and biological man,\u201d the judges wrote.",
      "The judges argued that a broader definition that includes transgender people would make the Equality Act \u201cincoherent and unworkable.\u201d",
      "\u201cWe can identify no good reason why the legislature should have intended that sex-based rights and protections under the (Equality Act) should apply to these complex, heterogenous groupings, rather than to the distinct group of (biological) women and girls (or men and boys) with their shared biology leading to shared disadvantage and discrimination faced by them as a distinct group,\u201d they wrote.",
      "The ruling makes no mention of intersex people, who also are not explicitly protected under the Equality Act.",
      "As in other countries, the issue has polarized opinion, pitting transgender rights campaigners against \u201cgender critical\u201d feminists, who argue that trans women's rights should not come at the expense of those who are born biologically female.",
      "For Women Scotland said it was \u201cabsolutely jubilant\u201d at the ruling. \u201cHarry Potter\u201d author J.K. Rowling, a prominent supporter of the group, said the court victory had \u201cprotected the rights of women and girls across the U.K.\u201d",
      "But LGBTQ+ charity Stonewall said there is \u201cdeep concern\u201d surrounding the ruling's consequences.",
      "Vic Valentine, manager of the group Scottish Trans, said the judgment \u201cseems to have totally missed what matters to trans people \u2014 that we are able to live our lives, and be recognized, in line with who we truly are.\u201d",
      "Amnesty International U.K. described the ruling as \u201cdisappointing,\u201d but said it is \u201cimportant to stress that the court has been clear that trans people are protected under the Equality Act against discrimination and harassment.\u201d",
      "The Supreme Court judges stressed that their ruling should not be seen as an attack on transgender people. They said it \u201cdoes not remove or diminish the important protections \u2026 for trans people\u201d under the Equality Act, which bans discrimination against transgender people.",
      "It\u2019s unclear what the ruling will mean in practice.",
      "The judgment highlights a range of spaces and services that could be intended just for women, including \u201crape or domestic violence counselling, domestic violence refuges, rape crisis centers, female-only hospital wards and changing rooms.\u201d The law already allowed for trans women to be excluded from single-sex spaces under certain circumstances, but Wednesday\u2019s ruling appears to make such a ban easier.",
      "The ruling could also see transgender female athletes excluded from participating in women\u2019s and girls sports, and there could also be ramifications in workplaces.",
      "But much depends on how the ruling is interpreted and implemented.",
      "Hannah Ford, an employment partner at law firm Stevens & Bolton, told the BBC that because of the ruling, ensuring workplaces are welcoming places for trans people will be \u201can uphill battle.\u201d",
      "She said one positive aspect was that \u201cat least we have simplicity and clarity. So it is in one sense a triumph of sense over legal incoherency and legal fiction.\u201d",

      "The first-of-its-kind clinical trial has been cleared by the Food and Drug Administration, according to pig producer eGenesis, which announced the step Tuesday with its partner OrganOx.",
      "An estimated 35,000 people in the U.S. are hospitalized each year when their liver suddenly fails. There are few treatment options and death rates as high as 50%. Many don't qualify for a liver transplant or can't get a match in time.",
      "The new study, which is expected to get underway later this spring, is a twist on the quest for animal-to-human organ transplants. Researchers won't transplant the pig liver but instead will attach it externally to study participants.",

      "In experiments with four deceased bodies, that \u201cbridge\u201d attempt showed the pig liver could support some functions of a human liver for two or three days, said Mike Curtis, CEO of Massachusetts-based eGenesis, which genetically modifies pigs so their organs are more humanlike.",

      "Fewer people crossed state lines to obtain abortions in 2024 than a year earlier, a new survey has found.",
      "The Guttmacher Institute, a research organization that supports abortion rights, estimates in a report released Tuesday that the overall number of clinician-provided abortions in states where it's legal rose by less than 1% from 2023 to 2024.",
      "But the number of people crossing state lines for abortions dropped by about 9%.",
      "The report, based on a monthly survey of providers, is the latest look at how the abortion landscape in the U.S. has evolved since the Supreme Court reversed Roe v. Wade in 2022 in a ruling that eliminated a national constitutional right to abortion and opened the door to state bans and restrictions.",
      "Guttmacher estimates there were 1.04 million abortions in 2024, up about 1% from its total the previous year.",
      "Multiple studies have found that the total number of abortions in the U.S. has risen since Dobbs, despite some states implementing bans.",
      "Twelve states currently enforce abortion bans with limited exceptions at all stages of pregnancy. Four more have bans that kick in after about six weeks, which is before many women know they\u2019re pregnant.",
      "Guttmacher's tally does not capture self-managed abortions such as people obtaining abortion pills from community networks, foreign pharmacies or through telehealth from medical providers in states that have laws intended to protect those who send pills into places with bans. There\u2019s a court battle over the constitutionality of such laws. But another survey found that the number of telehealth pills being sent into states with bans has been growing and accounted for about 1 in 10 abortions in the U.S. by the summer of 2024.",
      "Isaac Maddow-Zimet, a data scientist at Guttmacher, said even though the number of abortions is up, it's likely some people who would like to end their pregnancies are not able to.",
      "\u201cWe know that some people are accessing abortion through telehealth,\u201d he said. \u201cAnd we know it\u2019s not an option for everybody.\u201d",

By the second half of 2024 \u2014 when a ban on abortions after the first six weeks of pregnancy took effect \u2014 only about 1 in 50 were for people from another state.",
      "More people traveled to states including Virginia and New York after the Florida law took hold.",
      "A drop in people traveling to Minnesota could be linked to abortions being offered again in clinics in Wisconsin.",
      "Most abortions in Kansas are provided to people from elsewhere and the number grew as clinic capacity expanded.",
      "A working paper released in March provided different insight into the impact of the bans.",
      "It found that birth rates rose from 2020 to 2023 in counties farther from abortion clinics. Rates rose faster for Black and Hispanic women, those with lower education levels, and people who are unmarried.",
      "\u201cThe takeaway is that distance still matters,\u201d said Caitlin Myers, a Middlebury College economic professor and one of the authors of the working paper published by the National Bureau of Economic Research. \u201cIt really wasn\u2019t obvious that that would be the case.\u201d",

      "An Associated Press and Side Effects Public Media data analysis shows one in six visits to the emergency department in 2022 that resulted in hospital admission had a wait of four or more hours",
      "AURORA, Ill. -- At her mother\u2019s home in Illinois, Tracy Balhan flips through photos of her dad, Bill Speer. In one picture, he\u2019s smiling in front of a bucket of sweating beers and wearing a blue T-shirt that reads, \u201cPops. The man. The myth. The legend.\u201d",
      "Balhan\u2019s father died last year after struggling with dementia. During one episode late in his life, he became so agitated that he tried to exit a moving car. Balhan recalls her dad \u2014 larger than life, steady and loving \u2014 yelling at the top of his lungs.",
      "His geriatric psychiatrist recommended she take him to the emergency room at Endeavor Health\u2019s Edward Hospital in the Chicago suburb of Naperville because of its connection to an inpatient behavioral care unit. She hoped it would help get him a quick referral.",
      "But Speer spent 12 hours in the emergency room \u2014 at one point restrained by staff \u2014 waiting for a psych evaluation. Balhan didn\u2019t know it then, but her dad\u2019s experience at the hospital is so common it has a name: ER boarding.",
      "One in six visits to the emergency department in 2022 that resulted in hospital admission had a wait of four or more hours, according to an Associated Press and Side Effects Public Media data analysis. Fifty percent of the patients who were boarded for any length of time were 65 and older, the analysis showed.",
      "Some people who aren\u2019t in the middle of a life-threatening emergency might even wait weeks, health care experts said.",
      "ER boarding is a symptom of the U.S. health care system\u2019s struggles, including shrinking points of entry for patients seeking care outside of ERs and hospitals prioritizing beds for procedures insurance companies often pay more for.",
      "Experts also warn the boarding issue will worsen as the number of people 65 and older in the U.S. with dementia grows in the coming decades. Hospital bed capacity in the U.S. may not keep up. Between 2003 and 2023, the number of staffed hospital beds was static, even as emergency department visits shot up 30% to 40% over that same period.",
      "For older people with dementia, boarding can be especially dangerous, Chicago-based geriatric psychiatrist Dr. Shafi Siddiqui said. One research letter published in June 2024 in the Journal of the American Medical Association looked at more than 200,000 patients and found long ER stays could be linked to a higher risk of dementia patients developing delirium \u2014 a temporary state of mental confusion and sometimes hallucinations.",
      "\u201cPeople need to be enraged about (boarding),\u201d said Dr. Vicki Norton, president-elect of the American Academy of Emergency Medicine.",
      "National emergency physician groups have lobbied for years to keep boarding under control. While they\u2019ve made some progress, nothing substantial has changed, despite concerns that it leads to worse patient outcomes.",
      "Dr. Alison Haddock, president of the American College of Emergency Physicians, said that\u2019s because boarding is a failing of the entire health care system that manifests in the ER, so solving it demands a systemic approach.",
      "Federal and state policy decisions made nearly 40 years ago limited the number of hospital beds, said Arjun Venkatesh, who studies emergency medicine at Yale. People are now living longer, he said, resulting in more complicated illnesses.",
      "In 2003, there were 965,000 staffed hospital beds compared to 913,000 in 2023, according to the American Hospital Association. And another JAMA research letter published in February shows there are 16% fewer staffed beds in the U.S. post-pandemic.",
      "The ones available may be prioritized for \u201cscheduled care\u201d patients who need non-urgent procedures, like cancer care or orthopedic surgeries. Insurance companies pay hospitals more for those surgeries, Haddock said, so hospitals aren\u2019t likely to move patients into those beds \u2014 even as emergency rooms fill up.",
      "Though long stays in the emergency department are common, there isn\u2019t good data that tracks the extremes, emergency medicine experts said.",
      "The Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services recently ended a requirement that hospitals track the \u201cmedian\u201d wait times in their emergency departments. An advisory group that develops quality measures for CMS recommended that the agency try to more accurately capture long emergency department stays. That measure has recently been submitted to CMS, which can choose to adopt it.",
      "Patients\u2019 families worry that long emergency room stays may make things worse for their loved ones, forcing some to search for limited alternatives to turn for support and care.",
      "Nancy Fregeau lives in Kankakee, Illinois, with her husband Michael Reeman, who has dementia.",
      "Last year, she said he visited the Riverside Medical Center emergency department several times, often staying more than four hours and in one case more than 10, before finally getting access to a behavioral care bed. Riverside declined to comment on Reeman\u2019s case.",
      "During long waits, Fregeau doesn\u2019t know what reassurance she can offer her husband.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s hard enough for anyone to be in the ER but I cannot imagine someone with dementia being in there,\u201d she said. \u201cHe just kept saying \u2018When am I going? What\u2019s happening?\u2019\u201d",
      "Since November, Reeman has been going to the MCA Senior Adult Day Center in Kankakee. Fregeau said Reeman treats the day center like it\u2019s his job, offering to vacuum and clean, but comes home happier after having time around other people and away from the house.",
      "In Illinois, there are fewer adult day centers than there are counties, and other resources for people with dementia are shrinking, too. A report from the American Health Care Association and the National Center for Assisted Living found that 1,000 nursing homes in the U.S. closed between 2015 and 2022. At least 15 behavioral health centers, which are facilities that specialize in treating mental health issues, closed in 2023.",
      "With fewer places for patients to go after being discharged, hospital beds are being used for longer, exacerbating the boarding problem. It\u2019s becoming more difficult to get a specialty hospital bed, especially when patients\u2019 dementia causes aggression.",
      "That was the case for Balhan\u2019s father, who became increasingly agitated during his ER stay. Hospital staff told Balhan the behavioral care unit wasn\u2019t taking dementia patients, so Speer was stuck in the ER for 24 hours until they found a behavioral health facility, separate from the health system, that would take him.",
      "While the hospital couldn\u2019t comment on Speer\u2019s specific situation, Endeavor Health spokesperson Spencer Walrath said its behavioral care unit typically admits geriatric psychiatry patients, including those with dementia, but it depends on factors like bed availability and the patient\u2019s specific medical needs.",
      "Balhan feels that the U.S. health care system failed to treat her dad as a human being.",
      "\"It didn\u2019t feel to me like he was being treated with any dignity as a person,\u201d she said. \u201cIf anything could change, that would be the change that I would want to see.\"",

      "A man has been arrested near UnitedHealthcare\u2019s headquarters after threatening violence",
      "MINNEAPOLIS -- A man was arrested near UnitedHealthcare\u2019s headquarters in Minnesota after threatening violence, months after the company's CEO was killed, authorities said Monday.",
      "The man was spotted around 11 a.m. in a parking lot outside of the UnitedHealthcare corporate campus in the Minneapolis suburb of Minnetonka. City spokesman Andy Wittenborg said the man contacted the FBI's field office in Minneapolis once he arrived, and an FBI negotiator made contact with him by phone.",
      "\u201cWhile the investigation is still in its early stages, there is currently no indication that the individual had specific grievances against UnitedHealthcare,\u201d Wittenborg said in a statement.",
      "City police and the FBI coordinated their response and had steady contact with the man, successfully encouraging him to peacefully surrender to authorities after about an hour with no threat to the public, Wittenborg said. The man, who'd had previous contacts with Minnetonka police, had showed up at a security checkpoint where he was not supposed to be.",
      "Wittenborg said the incident had nothing to do with the killing of UnitedHealthcare CEO Brian Thompson, who was shot to death in New York City on Dec. 4 as he was walking to an investor conference in midtown Manhattan. The man accused of killing him, Luigi Mangione, 26, pleaded not guilty in December to state murder and terror charges.",
      "News helicopter video of the aftermath showed over a dozen law enforcement vehicles from multiple agencies at the scene, as well as an ambulance that was standing by. There were no reports of injuries.",
      "The CEO\u2019s killing and ensuing manhunt leading to Mangione\u2019s arrest rattled the business community, with some health insurers hastily switching to remote work or online shareholder meetings. It also galvanized health insurance critics \u2014 some of whom rallied around Mangione as a stand-in for frustrations over coverage denials and hefty medical bills.",
      "Surveillance video showed a masked gunman shooting Thompson from behind. Police say the words \u201cdelay,\u201d \u201cdeny\u201d and \u201cdepose\u201d were scrawled on the ammunition, mimicking a phrase commonly used to describe insurer tactics to avoid paying claims.",
      "Mangione also faces federal charges, and U.S. Attorney General Pam Bondi said earlier this month she has directed federal prosecutors to seek the death penalty.",

    "story": [
      "The measles outbreak in West Texas didn\u2019t happen just by chance",
      "The measles outbreak in West Texas didn\u2019t happen just by chance.",
      "The easily preventable disease, declared eliminated in the U.S. in 2000, ripped through communities sprawling across more than 20 Texas counties in part because health departments were starved of the funding needed to run vaccine programs, officials say.",
      "\u201cWe haven\u2019t had a strong immunization program that can really do a lot of boots-on-the-ground work for years,\u201d said Katherine Wells, the health director in Lubbock, a 90-minute drive from the outbreak's epicenter.",
      "Immunization programs nationwide have been left brittle by years of stagnant funding by federal, state and local governments. In Texas and elsewhere, this helped set the stage for the measles outbreak and fueled its spread. Now cuts to federal funding threaten efforts to prevent more cases and outbreaks.",
      "Health departments got an influx of cash to deal with COVID-19, but it wasn\u2019t enough to make up for years of neglect. On top of that, trust in vaccines has eroded. Health officials warn the situation is primed to get worse.",
      "Recent cuts by the Trump administration have pulled billions of dollars in COVID-19 related funding \u2014 $2 billion of it slated for immunization programs for various diseases. Overseeing the cuts is Health Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr., who rose to prominence leading an anti-vaccine movement. While Kennedy has said he wants his agency to prevent future outbreaks, he's also declined to deliver a consistent and forceful message that would help do so \u2014 encouraging people to vaccinate their children against measles while reminding them it is safe.",
      "At the same time, lawmakers in Texas and about two-thirds of states have introduced legislation this year that would make it easier to opt out of vaccines or otherwise put up barriers to ensuring more people get shots, according to an analysis by The Associated Press. That further undercuts efforts to keep infectious diseases at bay, health officials said.",
      "The more than 700 measles cases reported this year in the U.S. have already surpassed last year\u2019s total. The vast majority \u2014 more than 540 \u2014 are in Texas, but cases have popped up in 23 other states. Two Texas children have died. A 6-year-old girl from Gaines County, the center of the outbreak, died in February, the first measles death in the U.S. in a decade. An 8-year-old girl from the same town, Seminole, died earlier this month.",
      "Children in the U.S. are generally required to be vaccinated to go to school, which in the past ensured vaccination rates stayed high enough to prevent infectious diseases like measles from spreading. But a growing number of parents have been skipping the shots for their kids. The share of children exempted from vaccine requirements has reached an all-time high, and just 92.7% of kindergartners got their required shots in 2023. That\u2019s well below the 95% coverage level that keeps diseases at bay.",
      "Keeping vaccination rates high requires vigilance, commitment and money.",
      "Though the outbreak in Texas started in Mennonite communities that have been resistant to vaccines and distrustful of government intervention, it quickly jumped to other places with low vaccination rates. There are similar under-vaccinated pockets across the country that could provide the tinder that sparks another outbreak.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s like a hurricane over warm water in the Caribbean,\u201d said Dr. Peter Hotez, co-director of the Texas Children\u2019s Hospital Center for Vaccine Development in Houston. \u201cAs long as there\u2019s warm water, the hurricane will continue to accelerate. In this case, the warm water is the unvaccinated kids.\u201d",
      "Lubbock receives a $254,000 immunization grant from the state annually that can be used for staff, outreach, advertising, education and other elements of a vaccine program. That hasn\u2019t increased in at least 15 years as the population grew.",
      "It used to be enough for three nurses, an administrative assistant, advertising and even goodies to give out at health fairs, Wells said. \u201cNow it covers a nurse, a quarter of a nurse, a little bit of an admin assistant, and basically nothing else.\u201d",
      "Texas has among the lowest per capita state funding for public health in the nation, just $17 per person in 2023, according to the State Health Access Data Assistance Center.",
      "Vaccines are among the most successful tools in public health\u2019s arsenal, preventing debilitating illnesses and lowering the need for expensive medical care. Childhood vaccines prevent 4 million deaths worldwide each year, according to the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, which says the measles vaccine will save some 19 million lives by 2030.",
      "U.S. immunization programs are funded by a variable mix of federal, state and local money. Federal money is sent to every state, which then decides how much to send to local health departments.",
      "The stagnant immunization grant funding in Texas has made it harder for local health departments to keep their programs going. Lubbock\u2019s health department, for example, doesn't have the money to pay for targeted Facebook ads to encourage vaccinations or do robust community outreach to build trust.",
      "In Andrews County, which borders Gaines County, the biggest cost of its immunization program is personnel. But while everything has gotten more expensive, the grant hasn't changed, Health Director Gordon Mattimoe said. That shifts the burden to county governments. Some kick in more money, some don\u2019t. His did.",
      "The problem: keeping people safe from outbreaks requires high vaccination rates across a broad region, and germs don\u2019t stop at county borders.",
      "Andrews County, population 18,000, offers a walk-in vaccine clinic Monday through Friday, but other West Texas communities don\u2019t. More than half the people who come to the clinic travel from other counties, Mattimoe said, including much larger places and Gaines County.",
      "Some had to drive an hour or more. They did so because they had trouble getting shots in their home county due to long waits, lack of providers and other issues, Mattimoe said.",
      "\u201cThey\u2019re unable to obtain it in the place that they live. ... People are overflowing, over to here,\u201d Mattimoe said. \u201cThere\u2019s an access issue.\u201d",
      "That makes it more likely people won\u2019t get their shots.",
      "In Gaines County just 82% of kindergartners were vaccinated against measles, mumps and rubella. Even in Andrews County, where, at 97%, the vaccination rate is above the 95% threshold for preventing outbreaks, it has slipped two percentage points since 2020.",
      "The health departments millions of Americans depend on for their shots largely rely on two federal programs: Vaccines for Children and Section 317 of the Public Health Services Act. Vaccines for Children mostly provides the actual vaccines. Section 317 provides grants for vaccines but also to run programs and get shots into arms.",
      "About half of kids qualify for Vaccines for Children, a safety-net program created in response to a 1989-1991 measles epidemic that sickened 55,000 people and killed 123. Section 317 money sent to state and local health departments pays for vaccines as well as nurses, outreach and advertising.",
      "Health departments generally use the programs in tandem, and since the pandemic they\u2019ve often been allowed to supplement it with COVID-19 funds.",
      "The 317 funds have been flat for years, even as costs of everything from salaries to vaccines went up. A 2023 CDC report to Congress estimated $1.6 billion was needed to fully fund a comprehensive 317 vaccine program. Last year, Congress approved less than half that: $682 million.",
      "This, along with insufficient state and local funding, forces hard choices. Dr. Kelly Moore, a preventive medicine specialist, said she faced this dilemma when directing Tennessee's immunization program from 2004 to 2018.",
      "\u201cWhat diseases can we afford to prevent and how many people can we afford to protect? Those decisions have to be made every year by every state,\u201d said Moore, who now runs the advocacy group Immunize.org.",
      "A rural clinic may have to be closed, or evening and weekend hours eliminated, she said. \u201cIt becomes difficult for them to staff the clinics they have and difficult for the people in those communities to access them, especially if they\u2019re the working poor.\u201d",
      "At the same time, health officials say more funding is needed to fight misinformation and mistrust about vaccines. In a 2023 survey by the National Association of County and City Health Officials, 80% of local health departments reported vaccine hesitancy among patients or their parents in the previous year, up from 56% in 2017.",
      "\u201cIf we don\u2019t invest in education, it becomes even more difficult to get these diseases under control,\" Moore said.",
      "Facing these headwinds, things got much worse in March when Kennedy\u2019s health department canceled billions of dollars in state and local funding. After 23 states sued, a judge put a hold on the cuts for now in those states but not in Texas or other states that didn\u2019t join the lawsuit.",
      "But local health departments are not taking chances and are moving to cut services.",
      "HHS said the money, allocated through COVID-19 initiatives, was cut because the pandemic was over. But CDC had allowed the money to be used to shore up public health infrastructure generally, including immunization programs.",
      "Before he was confirmed as health secretary, Kennedy vowed not to take vaccines away. But in Texas, his department\u2019s cuts mean state and local health departments are losing $125 million in immunization-related federal funding as they deal with the measles outbreak. A spokesperson for the federal health department did not respond to an AP request for comment.",
      "Dallas County, 350 miles from where the outbreak began, had to cancel more than 50 immunization clinics, including at schools with low measles vaccination rates, said Dr. Philip Huang, the county\u2019s health director.",
      "Near the center of the outbreak, Lubbock\u2019s health department said seven jobs are on the line because they were paid by those grants. Included in the affected work are immunizations.",
      "Across the border in New Mexico, where the outbreak has spread, the state lost grants that funded vaccine education.",
      "It's still unclear how the recently announced $2 billion in cuts will affect immunization programs across the country, but details are starting to trickle out from some states.",
      "Washington state, for example, would lose about $20 million in vaccination-related funding. Officials were forced to pause mobile vaccine efforts on their \u201cCare-A-Van,\u201d which has administered more than 6,800 COVID-19 vaccines, 3,900 flu vaccines and 5,700 childhood vaccines since July. The state also had to cancel more than 100 vaccine clinics scheduled through June, including more than 35 at schools.",
      "Connecticut health officials estimate if the cuts stand, they will lose $26 million for immunization. Among other reductions, this means canceling 43 contracts with local health departments to increase vaccination rates and raise confidence in vaccines, losing vaccination clinics and mobile outreach in underserved neighborhoods, and stopping the distribution of vaccine-related educational materials.",
      "Several of the 23 states suing the federal government, including Minnesota, Rhode Island and Massachusetts, cite losses to vaccine programs.",
      "As the cuts further cripple already struggling health departments, alongside increasingly prominent and powerful anti-vaccine voices, doctors worry that vaccine hesitancy will keep spreading. And measles and other viruses will too.",
      "\u201cMy whole life\u2019s purpose is to keep people from suffering. And vaccines are a tremendous way to do that,\u201d Moore said. \u201cBut if we don\u2019t invest in them to get them in arms, then we don\u2019t see their benefits.\u201d",

      "A key program using traditional medicine and foods to tackle chronic disease in Native American and Alaska Native communities has been gutted in the federal health layoffs",
      "CHANDLER, Ariz. -- CHANDLER, Ariz. (AP) \u2014 Health Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. spent time in tribal communities in Arizona and New Mexico this week highlighting ways they are trying to prevent chronic disease among Native Americans and Alaska Natives, something he has said is one of his top priorities.",
      "But Kennedy didn't appear to publicly address a Native health program using traditional medicine and foods to tackle disproportionate rates of conditions like diabetes and liver disease. The program, called Healthy Tribes, was gutted in this month's federal health layoffs.",
      "Some Native leaders say they are having trouble grasping the dissonance between Kennedy's words and his actions. With little information, they wonder if Healthy Tribes is part of the Trump administration's push to end diversity, equity and inclusion efforts. There also is confusion about what and who is left at the 11-year-old program, which was part of the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, under Kennedy's agency, and doled out $32.5 million a year.",
      "Tribal leaders and health officials told The Associated Press that cuts to the Healthy Tribes program are another violation of the federal government\u2019s legal obligation, or trust responsibility, to tribal nations under treaties, law and other acts. That includes funding for health care through the Indian Health Service, as well as education and public safety for citizens of the 574 federally recognized tribes.",
      "But federal funding has long fallen short of meeting those needs, leaving tribal governments to rely on additional grants and programs like Healthy Tribes.",
      "\u201cSo many layers of communications of collaboration and partnerships have just been turned off,\u201d said Onawa Miller, a Quechan Indian Nation citizen and director of tribal public health for United South and Eastern Tribes, which serves 33 tribes in those regions of the U.S. She said her organization already has received its annual $2 million in Healthy Tribes funding.",
      "Several tribal facilities received an email from a CDC employee April 1 notifying them that the positions of many people who staffed the Healthy Tribes program had been eliminated \u201cas part of the reduction in force efforts at CDC.\u201d",
      "The American Federation of Government Employees union, which represents thousands of workers at the CDC in Atlanta, said more than 30 civil servant jobs were or are being eliminated. That includes 11 positions in the Healthy Tribes program and others in the larger Division of Population Health.",
      "An email sent to the account of Healthy Tribes director Dr. Julianna Reece, an enrolled member of the Navajo Nation, was met with an automated reply: \u201cDue to the recent HHS reduction in force, I have been placed on administrative leave and will be separated from the agency on June 2nd.\u201d Reece did not respond to requests for comment sent to her federal and personal email accounts.",
      "Part of the government upheaval in the past several weeks includes top officials at the National Institutes of Health being offered transfers to Indian Health Service offices far from Washington, D.C. The National Indian Health Board also has said the government eliminated key staff and programs at the Office of the Assistant Secretary for Health\u2019s Center for Indigenous Innovation and Health.",
      "The government is required to consult with tribes on decisions impacting them, like mass layoffs in February at the Indian Health Service that were rescinded hours later, and tribal leaders have warned the Trump administration that such consultations are not happening. In some cases tribes can take legal action against the U.S. for failing to meet its trust responsibilities.",
      "\u201cIt is a violation of trust, without a doubt,\u201d said W. Ron Allen, chairman of the Jamestown S\u2019Klallam Tribe in Washington state.",
      "The U.S. Department of Health and Human Services did not answer questions related to the Healthy Tribes cuts but told the AP in an email that the Indian Health Service was not impacted by this month's workforce reductions and there are no plans to consolidate any of its offices.",
      "Kennedy's swing through the Southwest included a visit to a community health center in metro Phoenix that provides physical and mental health care to Native people and a hike with the Navajo Nation president.

      "Allen said he had a constructive conversation with Kennedy, reminding him IHS is already underfunded and understaffed and that tribes rely on additional federal grants and programs.",
      "\u201cYour issue is to reduce the central office, and so we\u2019re OK with that, but move the functions that serve the tribes out to the tribes,\u201d Allen said he told Kennedy. \u201cBecause if we don\u2019t have those resources, how are we gonna make our communities healthy? He agrees.\u201d",

      "Seattle Indian Health Board President Esther Lucero, a descendant of the Navajo Nation, said her staff meets with people from the CDC and other Healthy Tribes grantees bimonthly to discuss project updates and ensure compliance with grants. But after last week's layoffs, they are having trouble contacting anyone.",

      "Lycia Ortega, interim CEO of Los Angeles-based United American Indian Involvement, echoed concerns about the ambiguous and somewhat confusing messages. Her organization uses Healthy Tribes money to foster connections between younger people and elders in Native American and Alaska Native communities.",
      "Native communities have had to push back against the Trump administration\u2019s efforts to cut programs that might be considered DEI initiatives, she said, with the help of lawyers, policy experts and watchdogs who point out areas where the government might not be honoring the trust responsibility.",
      "Native people \u201chave a distinct political power,\u201d said Ortega, a citizen of the Fort Yuma Quechan Indian Tribe, but \u201cthere are policymakers who see tribes as a threat rather than a partner.\u201d",

      "A woman in Australia unknowingly gave birth to a stranger's baby after an IVF clinic mistakenly transferred the wrong embryo, the clinic said",
      "WELLINGTON, New Zealand -- A woman in Australia unknowingly gave birth to a stranger\u2019s baby after she received another patient's embryo from her in vitro fertilization clinic due to \u201chuman error,\u201d the clinic said.",
      "The mix-up was discovered in February when the clinic in the city of Brisbane found that the birth parents had one too many embryos in storage, said the provider, Monash IVF, in a statement supplied Friday. Staff discovered an embryo from another patient had been mistakenly thawed and transferred to the birth mother, a spokesperson said.",
      "Australia news outlets reported the baby was born in 2024.",
      "The company, one of Australia\u2019s biggest IVF providers, said an initial investigation had not uncovered any other such errors. Its statement didn\u2019t identify the patients involved or divulge details about the child's custody.",
      "\u201cAll of us at Monash IVF are devastated and we apologise to everyone involved,\u201d said CEO Michael Knaap. \u201cWe will continue to support the patients through this extremely distressing time.\u201d",
      "The \u201chuman error\u201d was made \u201cdespite strict laboratory safety protocols being in place,\u201d the statement said. The company said it had reported the episode to the relevant regulator in the state of Queensland.",
      "Monash IVF opened in 1971 and sees patients in dozens of locations throughout Australia. Last year, the firm settled a class action lawsuit from more than 700 patients, making no admission of liability, after claims its clinics destroyed potentially viable embryos.",
      "The clinic paid a settlement of 56 million Australian dollars ($35 million).",
      "Rare cases of embryo mix-ups have been reported before, including in the United States, Britain, Israel and Europe. A woman in the U.S. state of Georgia in February filed a lawsuit against a fertility clinic after she gave birth to a stranger\u2019s baby.",
      "Krystena Murray realized the error after the baby's birth because she and her sperm donor were both white and the child was Black. Murray said she wanted to raise the baby but voluntarily gave the 5-month-old to his biological parents after she was told she would not win a legal fight for his custody.",
      "In Australia, each state makes its own laws and rules governing the use of IVF, which advocates say puts patients at risk of error or oversight failings. Queensland\u2019s parliament passed its first laws regulating the sector in 2024.",
      "The measures will establish a registry for all people conceived at a clinic and made the destruction of donors\u2019 medical histories illegal. The change followed an official report that lambasted the storage of frozen sperm donations in Queensland, finding nearly half of samples checked were at medium or high risk of misidentification and recommending thousands be destroyed.",
      "Australia\u2019s states and territories \u201cneed to see if their regulations are up to scratch,\u201d the Minister for Social Services Amanda Rishworth told the Today news program Friday.",

    "story": [
      "The head of the U.K. Equality and Human Rights Commission says a Supreme Court ruling will exclude transgender women from women\u2019s toilets, hospital wards and sports teams",
      "LONDON -- Transgender women will be excluded from women\u2019s toilets, hospital wards and sports teams after a U.K. Supreme Court ruling, the head of the Equality and Human Rights Commission said Thursday, as trans groups digested a judgment that could have a broad and detrimental impact on daily life.",
      "While Britain\u2019s highest court said there was no clear winner in its ruling defining a woman for anti-discrimination purposes as someone born biologically female, noting that transgender people remain protected from discrimination, trans groups said the decision would undermine their rights.",
      "Equality Commission Chairwoman Kishwer Falkner said the \u201cenormously consequential\u201d ruling brought clarity and would prompt her organization to update public codes by summer to comply.",
      "\u201cSingle-sex services like changing rooms must be based on biological sex,\" she told the BBC. \u201cIf a male person is allowed to use a women-only service or facility, it isn\u2019t any longer single-sex, then it becomes a mixed-sex space.\"",
      "The ruling Wednesday came in a case that had nothing to do with those spaces, but stemmed from a 2018 law passed by the Scottish Parliament that required at least 50% women on boards of Scottish public bodies. Transgender women with gender recognition certificates were to be included in meeting the quota.",
      "But the court said that using a certificate to interpret someone's sex would clash with definitions of man and woman and, therefore, the anti-discrimination provisions of the 2010 Equality Act could \u201conly be interpreted as referring to biological sex.\u201d",
      "Out of some 66 million people in England, Scotland and Wales, about 116,000 identified as trans in the latest census count. About 8,500 gender recognition certificates have been issued.",
      "The feminist group that brought the court case said the outcome provided common sense, protected same-sex spaces for women and brought clarity to the thorny issue. But trans groups said it had caused fear and uncertainty.",
      "Trans activist jane fae, a director of the group TransActual, said she worried the ruling would mean \u201ctotal exclusion and segregation\u201d of trans women.",
      "\u201cNo trans women in women\u2019s changing rooms, no trans women in women\u2019s loos, no trans women in women\u2019s sports,\" fae said.",
      "\u201cThe number of people I have come across on social platforms, on forums, etc., saying \u2018How do I go on? I am in tears, I\u2019m in pieces. I am shattered. I am broken,\u2019\" fae said. \"That seems to be pretty much a unanimous reaction.\u201d",
      "Gendered Intelligence, a charity dedicated to understanding of gender diversity and improving trans lives, said it remained unclear how the ruling would be implemented, but said it could affect equal pay and access to rape crisis centers and domestic abuse services.",
      "\u201cUltimately, people who want to exclude trans women from services and institutions will likely feel empowered to do so,\u201d the group said. \u201cWe encourage everyone to look past the despair at this judgement and the divisive responses to it, and to continue to live and work together in solidarity and community.\u201d",
      "Falkner noted that there was no law requiring single-sex spaces and she encouraged trans groups to advocate for neutral spaces such as unisex toilets or changing rooms.",
      "Gender identity has not been as divisive in the U.K. as the U.S., where it has created political firestorms in some states, but the topic factors into Britain's own culture wars.",
      "Newspapers have reported on a group of female nurses who sued their employer after they had to share a changing room with a male colleague who identifies as female, and about a nurse who was suspended for calling a transgender pedophile \u201cmister.\u201d",
      "Chris Evans, editor of The Telegraph, a politically conservative London newspaper, said in its morning newsletter Thursday that the court had \u201cdeclared that transgender women are not legally women,\u201d and said it was looking into what the ruling means for \u201cpublic bodies who have sacrificed women\u2019s rights on the altar of inclusivity.\u201d",
      "British Transport Police announced it was reviewing its policies in light of the ruling and would temporarily change the way it conducts strip searches of transgender people in custody by assigning an officer of the same biological birth sex.",
      "Falkner said her group would continue to defend the rights of trans people.",
      "\u201cThey have rights, and their rights must be respected,\" she said. \u201cIt\u2019s not a victory for an increase in unpleasant actions against trans people. We will not tolerate that.\"",

      "PARIS -- French President Emmanuel Macron said Thursday that historic injustice was imposed on Haiti when it was forced to pay a colossal indemnity to France in exchange for its independence 200 years ago.",
      "Macron also announced the creation of a joint French-Haitian historical commission to \u2018\u2019examine our shared past'' and assess relations, but did not directly address longstanding Haitian demands for reparations.",
      "France \u2033subjected the people of Haiti to a heavy financial indemnity, ... This decision placed a price on the freedom of a young nation, which was thus confronted with the unjust force of history from its very inception,'' Macron said in a statement.",
      "It comes on the 200th anniversary of the April 17, 1825 document issued by King Charles X of France, which recognized Haiti\u2019s independence after a slave revolt \u2014 but also imposed a 150 million gold francs debt as compensation for the loss of France\u2019s colony and enslaved labor force.",
      "Although the indemnity was later reduced to 90 million gold francs, the debt crippled the Caribbean nation, which continued to pay it off through French and American banks until 1947. Economists estimate it's the equivalent of billions of dollars today.",
      "Experts have said Haiti\u2019s current situation can be traced back to its past. Gangs have flourished in the poorest country in the Western Hemisphere, with a growing number of children becoming members as families struggle to find food.",
      "Violence has surged since last year, with gangs that control 85% of the capital, Port-au-Prince, attacking new communities daily in a bid to control even more territory. More than 5,600 people were reported killed last year, with gang violence leaving more than one million people homeless in recent years.",
      "\u2033Acknowledging the truth of history means refusing to forget or erase it,\u2033 Macron said.",
      "The new commission will be made up of historians from both countries, and will aim to propose recommendations to both governments, \u2019\u2019so that they can learn from them and build a more peaceful future.\u2033",
      "Since taking office in 2017, Macron has already addressed France\u2019s role in past colonial conflicts, including in Algeria, Cameroon, and Rwanda.",

      "SAN JUAN, Puerto Rico -- SAN JUAN, Puerto Rico (AP) \u2014 An island-wide blackout hit Puerto Rico this week, leaving 1.4 million customers without power and more than 400,000 without water.",
      "It was the second massive outage to hit Puerto Rico since New Year\u2019s Eve, when a blackout left 90% of clients without power.",
      "Crews on Thursday scrambled to restore power as a growing number of Puerto Ricans called on the governor to cancel the contracts of two companies that oversee the generation, transmission and distribution of power on the U.S. territory of 3.2 million residents.",
      "At 12:38 p.m. on Wednesday, massive generating plants began to shut down across Puerto Rico after a transmission line failed.",
      "Refrigerators stopped humming, air conditioners fell silent and traffic lights went dark.",
      "People started realizing the magnitude of the outage when they began calling friends and family that live on the other side of the island who said that they, too, were without power.",
      "Hundreds of businesses closed, including the biggest mall in the Caribbean. Hospitals and the main international airport began running on generators while dozens of passengers using a rapid transit system that serves the capital, San Juan, were forced to walk on an overpass next to the train\u2019s rails to evacuate.",
      "Incredulous, Puerto Ricans began demanding answers from the government as crews scrambled to find out what happened.",
      "\u201cWhen are we going to do something?\u201d reggaeton superstar Bad Bunny wrote on X, reflecting people\u2019s collective rage.",
      "Anger grew as people began posting pictures of those affected by the blackout, including one of a woman who had plugged a small machine into the outlet of a grocery store to give herself medical treatment for a lung condition.",
      "Authorities are still investigating the causes of the blackout. One possibility is that overgrown vegetation may have affected the grid and caused a transmission line to fail, officials said.",
      "Luma Energy, the company responsible for overseeing transmission and distribution of power in Puerto Rico, is supposed to do frequent air patrols over certain lines to ensure they remain free of vegetation.",
      "Pedro Mel\u00e9ndez, a Luma engineer, said in a news conference Thursday that he did not immediately have details on when the company last did an air patrol, but added that those occur with the frequency established in its contract.",
      "Josu\u00e9 Col\u00f3n, the island\u2019s energy czar and former executive director of Puerto Rico\u2019s Electric Power Authority, said Luma also needs to explain why all the generators shut down after there was a failure in the transmission system, when only one was supposed to go into protective mode.",
      "It\u2019ll likely take weeks to find a precise reason for the blackout, although Gov. Jenniffer Gonz\u00e1lez said Thursday that she expects to have a very preliminary report within three days.",
      "For decades, Puerto Rico\u2019s Electric Power Authority did not give the grid the maintenance and investment it required.",
      "It began crumbling throughout the years, and then on Sept. 20, 2017, Hurricane Maria hit the U.S. territory as a powerful Category 4 storm. It snapped power lines, toppled transmission towers and broke flimsy wooden light posts, leaving some people nearly a year without power.",
      "In the months that followed, crews focused on emergency repairs. It wasn\u2019t until a couple years after the hurricane that actual reconstruction began.",
      "In June 2021, the Electric Power Authority contracted Luma as it struggled to restructure its more than $9 billion debt, with negotiations still ongoing.",
      "In January 2023, the authority contracted Genera PR to oversee the generation of power on the island as part of another public-private partnership.",
      "Puerto Rico has been plagued by chronic power outages since Maria, with pictures and videos of transmission lines on fire becoming increasingly common.",
      "Gonz\u00e1lez has said that providing consistent energy is a priority and distanced herself from renewable energy goals set by the previous governor.",
      "Her administration recently extended the operations of Puerto Rico\u2019s lone coal-fired plant.",
      "Meanwhile, with a poverty rate exceeding 40%, many on the island cannot afford solar panels or generators.",
      "Roughly 117,000 homes and businesses on the island have solar rooftops. Petroleum-fired power plants provide 62% of Puerto Rico\u2019s power, natural gas 24%, coal 8% and renewables 7%, according to the U.S. Energy Information Administration.",
      "A growing number of Puerto Ricans have demanded that the governor cancel Luma\u2019s contract, and she has pledged to do so.",
      "\u201cPeople must be fed up with us having such a mediocre system. If it\u2019s not the transmission, it\u2019s the generation,\u201d Gonz\u00e1lez said. \u201cOf course there will be consequences.\u201d",
      "However, she noted that canceling the contract and finding a new company takes time.",
      "Officials also previously warned that there would not be sufficient generation come summer, when demand peaks.",
      "Given that concern, Gonz\u00e1lez said the government is seeking to contract a company that can provide more than 800 megawatts of energy in the upcoming months. The request-for-proposal process began on March 25 and ends this month. Sixty companies have submitted proposals.",

      "Foreign ministry officials from Bangladesh\u2019s interim government and Pakistan have resumed talks after a 15-year gap, as the two South Asian Muslim-majority nations attempted to ease strained relations",
      "DHAKA, Bangladesh -- Foreign ministry officials from Bangladesh's interim government and Pakistan resumed talks on Thursday after a 15-year gap, as the two South Asian Muslim-majority nations attempted to ease strained relations.",
      "Under former Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina, who was ousted in August in a students-led mass uprising, Bangladesh expanded relations with neighboring India in every sector.",
      "But ties with India have become increasingly tense. Bangladesh\u2019s interim leader, Nobel Peace Prize laureate Muhammad Yunus, has criticized India for sheltering Hasina in the country and sought her extradition without any positive response from India.",
      "Yunus has meanwhile sought to improve relations with Pakistan, India's rival. In recent months he met Pakistan\u2019s Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif several times, and a high-level Bangladeshi military delegation made a rare visit to Pakistan in January and held talks with Pakistan\u2019s army chief General Asim Munir. In February, Bangladesh's navy took part in a multinational maritime exercise organized by Pakistan off the Karachi coast.",
      "After Hasina\u2019s exit, Bangladesh and Pakistan resumed direct trading for the first time in years. Direct flights between the countries are expected to resume soon and visa procedures have been eased while India stopped visas for Bangladeshis, except for medical emergencies.",
      "After Thursday's talks in Dhaka between Bangladesh\u2019s Foreign Secretary Jashim Uddin and his Pakistani counterpart, Uddin said Bangladesh raised historically \u201cunsettled issues\u201d with Pakistan, including a formal public apology for atrocities allegedly committed by Pakistani troops in 1971 during Bangladesh's war of independence.",
      "India helped Bangladesh win independence through a nine-month war against then West Pakistan, now Pakistan. Hasina\u2019s Awami League party regularly criticizes Pakistan for alleged atrocities during the war, when Bangladesh says about 3 million people were killed and about 200,000 women were raped by Pakistani soldiers. Pakistan rejects the claims and has never officially apologized.",
      "Local media reported earlier that Yunus' government was preparing to formally raise its demand for $4.52 billion in financial compensation from Pakistan.",
      "Uddin said the issue of the compensation was raised in Thursday\u2019s meeting.",
      "\u201cThese issues need to be resolved for having a solid foundation of our relations,\u201d Uddin said Thursday. The two sides also discussed expansion of trade and commerce and increasing cooperation in agriculture and other sectors, he added.",
      "Yunus\u2019 office said in a statement late Thursday that he held a separate meeting with the Pakistani foreign secretary and emphasized \u201cstrengthening ties with Pakistan to boost mutual cooperation and explore trade and business potentials.\u201d",
      "\u201cThere are certain hurdles. We have to find ways to overcome those and move forward,\u201d Yunus told Pakistan\u2019s Foreign Secretary Amna Baloch.",
      "The last such consultation between the two countries was held in Islamabad in 2010 after Hasina came to power in a 2008 election with a landslide victory.",
      "Baloch said Bangladesh and Pakistan must find ways to \u201charness the potentials between the two countries,\" the statement said.",
      "\u201cWe have huge intra regional markets ... we should use it,\u201d Baloch said.",

      "MOSCOW -- Russia\u2019s Supreme Court on Thursday lifted a ban on Afghanistan\u2019s ruling Taliban, a group that was designated as a terrorist organization more than two decades ago.",
      "The move was a diplomatic victory for the Taliban, who were put on Russia\u2019s list of terrorist organizations in 2003, making any contact with them punishable under Russian law.",
      "At the same time, Taliban delegations have attended various forums hosted by Russia as Moscow has sought to position itself as a regional power broker.",
      "The court\u2019s ruling on a request by the Prosecutor General\u2019s Office followed last year\u2019s adoption of a law stipulating that the official designation as a terrorist organization could be suspended by a court.",

      "The Taliban seized power in Afghanistan in August 2021 as U.S. and NATO troops were in the final weeks of withdrawing from the country after two decades of war.",
      "The Taliban initially promised a more moderate rule than during their first stint in power from 1996 to 2001, but started to enforce restrictions on women and girls soon after the 2021 takeover. Women are barred from most jobs and public places, including parks, baths and gyms, while girls are banned from education beyond sixth grade.",
      "Such measures have isolated the Taliban on the world stage, although their government has established diplomatic ties with countries including China and the United Arab Emirates.",
      "The U.N. this year renewed its call for the Taliban to lift the bans.",
      "The group\u2019s decrees limiting the participation of girls and women have affected foreign aid to the country. The Taliban also have brought back their strict interpretation of Islamic law, or Shariah, including public executions.",
      "Some Taliban want greater engagement with the international community and want to scrap harsher policies to attract more outside support. In recent months, there has been increased engagement between the Taliban and the U.S. under President Donald Trump, mostly because of prisoner exchanges and releases.",
      "Ibraheem Bahiss, a senior analyst with Crisis Group\u2019s Asia Program, said the Taliban\u2019s listing as a terrorist group was a legal impairment for trade and political ties with Kabul and its lifting reflected Moscow\u2018s desire to improved relations.",

      "For Russia, he said it would serve as a confidence-building measure helping pave the way for more engagement and enabling Moscow to better protect its interests in Afghanistan, particularly concerns about anti-Russia terror groups like Islamic State-Khorasan.",

      "\"And it may drag down investment and consumption,\" she said.",
      "The bank\u2019s rate-setting council decided at a meeting in Frankfurt to lower its benchmark rate by a quarter percentage point to 2.25%. The bank has been steadily cutting rates after raising them sharply to combat an outbreak of inflation from 2022 to 2023.",
      "Now that inflation has fallen, growth worries have taken center stage. The economy in the 20 countries that use the euro grew a modest 0.2% in the last three months of 2024. Inflation was 2.2% in March, close to the bank\u2019s target of 2%.",
      "The cut was widely expected by analysts given the sudden shadow cast over the eurozone\u2019s growth outlook by Trump\u2019s April 2 announcement of unexpectedly high tariffs, or import tax, on goods from other countries starting at 10% and ranging as high as 49%. The European Union faces a 20% tariff.",
      "At the bank\u2019s last meeting on March 6, Lagarde had raised the possibility of an upcoming \u201cpause\u201d in the bank\u2019s series of rate cuts. But that option was practically eliminated by Trump\u2019s announcement.",
      "The bank\u2019s benchmark steers rates throughout the economy. Lower interest rates make it less expensive to borrow money and buy goods ranging from homes to new factory equipment. That supports spending, business investment and hiring.",
      "Trump has suspended the tariffs for 90 days, but the possibility of the 20% tariff rate he has proposed for Europe left economists and policymakers concerned that the higher costs will weigh on business activity \u2014 and lead to slower growth or even a recession if he carries through. The U.S. is Europe\u2019s largest trade partner with some 4.4 billion euros ($5 billion) in goods and services crossing the Atlantic every day in both directions.",
      "Uncertainty is another factor that could slow the economy since Trump\u2019s pause for negotiations leaves it unclear where the tariff rate will actually settle. Businesses may hold off on making decisions if they don\u2019t know what their costs will be.",
      "European Union officials have offered Trump a \u201czero for zero\u201d option that would see both sides dropping tariffs on industrial goods including cars. But Trump has said that won't be enough, and raised the possibility of Europe importing large additional quantities of US liquefied natural gas.",
      "Economists at Berenberg bank think that by midyear some of the tariffs will be negotiated away, ending at around 12%. However that is still around 10 percentage points higher than average tariffs before Trump. in addition to that comes a separate 25% tariff on autos, aluminum and steel from all countries. The auto tariff will hit Europe\u2019s prominent auto industry hard - and Trump has indicated it is is not up for negotiation.",
      "Lagarde said the \u201ccloud of uncertainty\u201d over tariffs meant that rate decisions going forward would have to be taken on a meeting by meeting basis depending on what happens during the 90-day tariff truce.",
      "\u201cThere is a negotiation which is ongoing, players around the tables have stated their position, proposals have been made, at least on one side, but all of that could change,\" she said.",

      "In 2018, an American missionary who landed illegally on the beach was killed by North Sentinelese Islanders who apparently shot him with arrows and then buried his body on the beach. In 2006, the Sentinelese had killed two fishermen who had accidentally landed on the shore.",

      "On his return he was spotted by local fishermen, who informed the authorities and Polyakov was arrested in Port Blair, an archipelago nearly 750 miles (1,207 kilometers) east of India\u2019s mainland.",

      "Talks between Iran and the United States over Tehran\u2019s rapidly advancing nuclear program are \u201cin a very crucial\u201d stage",
      "DUBAI, United Arab Emirates -- Talks between Iran and the United States over Tehran's rapidly advancing nuclear program are \u201cin a very crucial\u201d stage, the head of the United Nations' nuclear watchdog said Thursday while on a visit to the Islamic Republic.",
      "The comments by Rafael Mariano Grossi of the International Atomic Energy Agency in Tehran included an acknowledgment his agency likely would be key in verifying compliance by Iran should a deal be reached. Iran and the U.S. will meet again Saturday in Rome for a new round of talks after last weekend's first meeting in Oman.",
      "Grossi's visit also coincided with Saudi Arabia's defense minister, Prince Khalid bin Salman, visiting Tehran as the highest-ranking official from the kingdom to visit Iran since the two countries reached a Chinese-mediated d\u00e9tente in 2023. That's as Saudi Arabia tries to end its decadelong war against the Iranian-backed Houthi rebels in Yemen \u2014 even as a new, intense campaign of U.S. airstrikes targets them.",
      "The stakes of the negotiations Saturday and the wider geopolitical tensions in the Mideast couldn't be higher, particularly as the Israel-Hamas war rages on in the Gaza Strip. U.S. President Donald Trump repeatedly has threatened to unleash airstrikes targeting Iran\u2019s nuclear program if a deal isn\u2019t reached. Iranian officials increasingly warn that they could pursue a nuclear weapon with their stockpile of uranium enriched to near weapons-grade levels.",
      "Grossi arrived in Iran on Wednesday night and met with Iranian Foreign Minister Abbas Araghchi, who now is in Moscow for separate talks likely over the negotiations. On Thursday, Grossi met with Mohammad Eslami, the head of the Atomic Energy Organization of Iran, then later toured a hall featuring some of Iran's civilian nuclear projects.",
      "\u201cWe know that we are in a very crucial, I would say, stage of this important negotiation, so I want to concentrate on the positive,\u201d Grossi told Iranian media. \u201cThere is a possibility of a good outcome. Nothing is guaranteed. We need to make sure that we put all of the elements in place ... in order to get to this agreement.\"",
      "He added: \u201cWe know we don't have much time. So this is why I'm here. This is why I'm in contact with the United States as well.\u201d",
      "Asked about Trump's threats to attack Iran, Grossi urged people to \u201cconcentrate on our objective.\u201d",
      "\u201cOnce we get to our objective, all of these things will evaporate because there will be no reason for concern,\u201d he said.",
      "For his part, Eslami said Iran expected the IAEA to \u201cmaintain impartiality and act professionally,\u201d a report from the state-run IRNA news agency said.",
      "Since the nuclear deal\u2019s collapse in 2018 with Trump\u2019s unilateral withdrawal of the U.S. from the accord, Iran has abandoned all limits on its program, and enriches uranium to up to 60% purity \u2014 near weapons-grade levels of 90%.",
      "Surveillance cameras installed by the IAEA have been disrupted, while Iran has barred some of the Vienna-based agency\u2019s most experienced inspectors. Iranian officials also have increasingly threatened that they could pursue atomic weapons, something the West and the IAEA have been worried about for years since Tehran abandoned an organized weapons program in 2003.",
      "Despite tensions between Iran and the agency, its access has not been entirely revoked.",
      "Prince Khalid bin Salman, the son of King Salman and the brother of Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman, arrived in Tehran on Thursday. Iran\u2019s joint chief of staff, Gen. Mohammad Bagheri, greeted the prince on his arrival and an honor guard played for the two men.",
      "Prince Khalid, a fighter pilot, has become the first Saudi defense minister to visit Iran since the 1979 Islamic Revolution. He's also the highest-ranking Saudi royal to visit in decades. The last was King Abdullah bin Abdulaziz, who did so as crown prince in 1997 for an Organization of Islamic Cooperation meeting held in Tehran.",
      "The state-run Saudi Press Agency, announcing the prince's arrival, said his trip would include \u201ca number of meetings to discuss bilateral relations between the two countries and issues of common interest,\u201d without elaborating.",
      "The visit is significant, particularly given the decades of enmity between the two countries. Saudi Arabia has been for years trying to get a peace deal agreed to with the Houthis. A de facto ceasefire broadly has halted hostilities in the war, though the Houthis increasingly have threatened both Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates amid the U.S. airstrikes.",

Lebanon\u2019s Hezbollah group denied at the time it was behind the firing of rockets.",
      "The army said that a vehicle and other equipment used in the rockets attacks were confiscated and the detainees were referred to judicial authorities. The army said it had carried out raids in different parts of Lebanon to detain the suspects without giving further details.",

      "Hezbollah started launching attacks on Israel a day after the Israel-Hamas war erupted on Oct. 7, 2023 with the Palestinian militants\u2019 attack on southern Israel. The war that left more than 4,000 people dead in Lebanon and caused wide destruction ended in late November with a U.S.-brokered ceasefire.",

      "The Vatican is opening the most solemn period of Holy Week with a recovering Pope Francis largely on the sidelines",
      "VATICAN CITY -- The Vatican on Thursday opened the most solemn period of Holy Week with a recovering Pope Francis largely on the sidelines, as cardinals were designated to take his place presiding over the most important liturgical services leading up to Easter.",
      "The 88-year-old Francis, who survived a life-threatening bout of double pneumonia this winter, is expected to make some appearances, however. He made a surprise cameo at the end of Palm Sunday Mass last weekend and in recent days has made some unannounced visits \u2014 including one in which he wasn\u2019t dressed in his papal white cassock \u2014 to pray in St. Peter\u2019s Basilica and St. Mary Major basilica across town.",
      "By all indications he is continuing to improve after his five-week hospital stay and is slowly resuming some of his normal activities. In recent outings, he has been seen without the nasal tubes that provide supplemental oxygen and Vatican officials say he is increasingly less reliant on the therapy.",
      "On Wednesday, Francis held his first formal group audience since returning to the Vatican on March 23, meeting with the medical staff of the Gemelli hospital who cared for him during his 38-day stay. Gathered in a Vatican audience hall, Francis thanked the 70-plus doctors, nurses and administrators and asked them for their continued prayers.",
      "\u201cThank you for everything you did,\u201d Francis said, his voice still labored but seemingly stronger as he continues respiratory and physical therapy.",
      "He gave special thanks to the rector of Gemelli\u2019s affiliated Catholic University of the Sacred Heart, Elena Beccalli, whom he praised for her strong leadership. \u201cWhen women command, things go well,\u201d he said in his longest public remarks since his hospitalization.",
      "Francis has delegated the demanding Holy Week liturgical celebrations to hand-picked cardinals, but the Vatican says the pope himself composed the meditations that will be read aloud by others during the Via Crucis (Way of the Cross) procession on Friday night at Rome\u2019s Colosseum.",
      "The Holy Thursday Mass, for example, during which the oils used in liturgical rituals throughout the year are blessed, was being celebrated by the retired head of the Vatican\u2019s patrimony office, Cardinal Domenico Calcagno. Friday\u2019s solemn commemoration of the crucifixion of Christ was assigned to Cardinal Claudio Gugerotti, who heads the Vatican office in charge of eastern rite Catholics. Easter Sunday was assigned to the retired administrator of St. Peter\u2019s, Cardinal Angelo Comastri.",
      "It remains to be seen how Francis will handle Easter Sunday\u2019s traditional \u201cUrbi et Orbi\u201d speech and blessing (Latin for \u201cto the city and the world\u201d). Normally the pope delivers a sometimes lengthy discourse on the state of the world from the loggia of St. Peter\u2019s, and then imparts a special blessing to the faithful in the piazza below. In theory someone else could read the speech while Francis could impart the blessing.",
      "Francis was admitted to Gemelli on Feb. 14 with bronchitis that quickly developed into a life-threatening case of double pneumonia. Upon his release March 23, doctors proscribed two months of convalescence at the Vatican with daily respiratory and physical therapy to improve his breathing and vocal function. With time, they have predicted he will be able to resume his normal activities.",

      "Chinese President Xi Jinping has arrived in Cambodia for a two-day state visit that serves as an opportunity to further strengthen already robust relations",
      "PHNOM PENH, Cambodia -- Chinese President Xi Jinping arrived in Cambodia on Thursday for a two-day state visit that serves as an opportunity to further strengthen already robust relations.",
      "The visit, Xi\u2019s first since 2016, will conclude a three-nation Southeast Asian tour that included stops in Vietnam and Malaysia. China has been increasing its influence in the region over the past decade, largely by exercising its substantial economic leverage.",
      "Cambodian Prime Minister Hun Manet recently described Beijing as \u201can important and indispensable friend of Cambodia that has helped support the country\u2019s economic and social development.\u201d",
      "Xi was formally greeted at the airport in Cambodia's capital Phnom Penh by head of state King Norodom Sihamoni. During his visit, Xi is also scheduled to meet Prime Minister Hun Manet and Senate President Hun Sen, who is Hun Manet\u2019s father and predecessor as prime minister.",
      "In a statement at Phnom Penh International Airport after his arrival on his presidential aircraft, an American-made Air China Boeing 747, Xi said he was \u201cdelighted\u201d to visit again.",
      "\u201cCambodia is a priority in China\u2019s neighborhood diplomacy. China will unswervingly support Cambodia in upholding strategic autonomy and in pursuing a development path suited to its national conditions,\u201d he said according to a transcript of his remarks distributed by the Chinese embassy.",
      "Trade will likely be a major topic of Xi\u2019s discussions in Cambodia, which faces among the highest tariff rates proposed by Washington. In addition to Trump's universal 10% tariff, the country faces the threat of a 49% tax on exports to the U.S. once his 90-day pause expires.",
      "In addition to discussions on strengthening bilateral ties and regional and international issues, several agreements are expected to be signed on cooperation in various sectors.",
      "In both countries, Xi emphasized strengthening ties, particularly in trade and investment, amid global economic uncertainties and the backdrop of trade tensions with the United States. He underscored the need to oppose unilateralism and protectionism and uphold the multilateral trading system.",
      "China is presenting itself as a source of stability and certainty as Southeast Asia scrambles to respond to tariffs imposed by U.S. President Donald Trump, which threaten the region export-oriented economies whose largest markets are generally the United States.",
      "The visit comes on the 50th anniversary of the April 17, 1975 takeover of Cambodia by the communist Khmer Rouge, which imposed a reign of terror with Maoist-inspired policies that saw an estimated 1.7 million Cambodians die of starvation, overwork or executions.",
      "Beijing was the main foreign backer of the Khmer Rouge and supported the group in carrying on a guerrilla war after it was ousted from power in 1979 by an invasion from Vietnam, though such history is rarely discussed by either country.",
      "Cambodia's rapid growth in recent decades has been fueled largely by Beijing.",
      "In Hun Manet\u2019s remarks earlier this month at the inauguration of a Chinese-funded road, he called China \u201ca first-class partner country,\u201d pointing to achievements like the inauguration of the Chinese-named Angkor Siem Reap Airport and a Phnom Penh ring road named after Xi as evidence of continued strong relations and gratitude, and noted China\u2019s continued ranking as the top investor in Cambodia in 2024.",
      "China is Cambodia\u2019s largest trading partner, surpassing $15 billion in 2024 and representing nearly 30% of Cambodia\u2019s total trade volume, though greatly in Beijing\u2019s favor.",
      "Beijing also helped fund an expansion of the Ream Naval Base on Cambodia\u2019s southern coast, raising worries it could become a strategic outpost for the Chinese navy in the Gulf of Thailand. Cambodia has repeatedly denied any agreement granting China special privileges or the establishment of a foreign military base.",
      "Cambodia has stated that warships from all friendly countries are welcome to dock at its new pier, provided they comply with certain conditions. Japan announced on Tuesday that two of its minesweepers will visit the Ream base this weekend in the first foreign navy visit since the expansion project was completed.",

      "Senior Gen. Min Aung Hlaing, the head of the ruling military council, pardoned 4,893 prisoners, MRTV reported. Thirteen foreigners will also be released and deported from Myanmar, it said in a separate statement.",
      "Other prisoners received reduced sentences, except for those convicted of serious charges such as murder and rape, or those jailed on charges under various other security acts.",
      "If the freed detainees violate the law again they will have to serve the remainder of their original sentences in addition to any new sentence, according to the terms of their release.",
      "Mass amnesties on the holiday are not unusual in Myanmar. The releases will occur at prisons nationwide.",
      "Dozens of relatives and friends of prisoners waited early Thursday outside the main gate of Insein Prison, on the northern outskirts of Yangon, the country\u2019s largest city. No details were available about the number of prisoners released from Insein as part of the amnesty.",
      "Myanmar has been under military rule since Feb. 1, 2021, when its army ousted civilian leader Aung San Suu Kyi\u2019s elected government. The takeover was met with massive nonviolent resistance, which has since become a widespread armed struggle. The country is now in civil war.",
      "Some 22,197 political detainees, including Suu Kyi, were in detention as of last Friday, according to the Assistance Association for Political Prisoners, an independent organization that keeps detailed tallies of arrests and casualties linked to the nation\u2019s political conflicts.",
      "Many political detainees had been held on a charge of incitement, a catch-all offense widely used to arrest critics of the government or military, and punishable by up to three years in prison.",
      "This year\u2019s celebrations of Thingyan, the New Year\u2019s holiday, were more reserved than usual due to a nationwide grieving period following a devastating earthquake last month. The country is struggling to recover from the 7.7 magnitude quake on March 28 that hit its central heartland, killing about 3,725 people and leveling structures from new condos to ancient pagodas.",
      "In a New Year\u2019s speech broadcast Thursday, Min Aung Hlaing said his government will carry out reconstruction and rehabilitation measures in the quake-affected areas as quickly as possible.",
      "He also reaffirmed plans to hold a general election by the end of the year and called on opposition groups fighting the army to resolve the conflicts in political ways.",
      "During the holiday, the violent struggle between the army and pro-democracy forces continued. There were armed clashes in the countryside but the number of casualties was unclear.",

      "Officials say Egypt\u2019s revenue from the Suez Canal plunged by almost two thirds last year, attributing the sharp drop to regional tensions and wars in the Middle East that have impacted traffic through the key waterway",
      "CAIRO -- Egypt's revenue from the Suez Canal plunged by almost two thirds last year, officials said Wednesday, attributing the sharp drop to regional tensions and wars in the Middle East that have impacted traffic through the key waterway.",
      "The canal is a major source of foreign currency for the Egyptian government, with about 10% of world trade flowing through the waterway in recent years.",
      "The Suez Canal Authority, which runs the waterway, said the canal generated an annual revenue of $3.991 billion in 2024, down from a historic high of $10.25 billion in 2023, according to a statement posted on its Facebook page.",
      "Canal traffic has been significantly disrupted after Yemen\u2019s Iran-backed Houthi rebels started to threaten maritime trade and targeting vessels heading to Israel through the Suez Canal to pressure Israel to stop the war in Gaza, which started on Oct. 7, 2023.",
      "Between November 2023 and January 2024, the Houthis targeted over 100 merchant vessels with missiles and drones, sinking two ships and killing four sailors. The rebels insisted the attacks would continue as long as the wars go on and have devastated shipping through the region.",
      "According to the Egyptian canal authority, only 13,213 ships passed through the canal in 2024, marking a 50% decline compared to the number of ships in 2023, when over 26,000 ships passed through.",
      "Still, canal authority chief Osama Rabie said that the attacks challenge the region but have not prevented Egypt from continuing to provide its navigational and maritime services in the Suez.",
      "The International Monetary Fund reported in March 2024 that the Suez Canal trade dropped by 50% in the first two months of that year, compared to the previous year, citing attacks on vessels in the Red Sea.",
      "Egyptian President Abdel Fattah el-Sissi\u2019s government in 2015 completed a significant expansion of the Suez Canal, adding a second shipping lane and allowing it to handle some of the world\u2019s largest vessels.",
      "The canal, which connects the Mediterranean and the Red seas, was opened in 1869. It serves as a vital artery for global trade \u2014 a crucial link for oil, natural gas and cargo. The canal authority operates a system of convoys, consisting of one northbound and one southbound per day.",

      "Dozens of people were forced to walk next to the rails of the rapid transit system that serves the capital, San Juan, while scores of businesses including the biggest mall in the Caribbean were forced to close. Professional baseball and basketball games were cancelled as the hum of generators and smell of smoke filled the air.",
      "The last island-wide blackout occurred on New Year\u2019s Eve. Puerto Rico has struggled with chronic outages since September 2017 when Hurricane Maria pummeled the island as a powerful Category 4 storm, razing a power grid that crews are still struggling to rebuild.",
      "The grid already had been deteriorating as a result of decades of a lack of maintenance and investment.",

      "The chairman and CEO of French luxury conglomerate LVMH has called for a free trade zone between the European Union and the United States, saying that unresolved trade tensions could seriously hurt European industries",
      "PARIS -- PARIS (AP) \u2014 Bernard Arnault, chairman and CEO of French luxury conglomerate LVMH, called on Thursday for a free trade zone between the European Union and the United States and said that unresolved trade tensions could seriously hurt European industries.",
      "His remarks, in the wake of the tariffs announced by President Donald Trump, appeared to echo a similar call by Elon Musk on April 5 for a zero-tariff zone between the U.S. and EU. The EU has long pushed for a \u201czero-for-zero\u201d trade agreement \u2014 with both sides dropping tariffs \u2014 but Trump has rejected the offer.",
      "Speaking at LVMH\u2019s annual shareholder meeting, Arnault said European leaders should negotiate \u201ccleverly\u201d with the U.S. administration and that national governments should take a more prominent role instead of than leaving negotiations solely in the hands of Brussels, the center of EU\u2019s \u201cbureaucratic power.\u201d",
      "France\u2019s LVMH has for decades been the world\u2019s dominant luxury group \u2014 known for products such as Mo\u00ebt & Chandon Champagne, Hennessy Cognac, Louis Vuitton handbags and Dior perfumes \u2014 but this week lost its title as the world\u2019s largest luxury company to rival Herm\u00e8s.",
      "\u201cEurope is not run by a political power, but by a bureaucratic power that spends its time issuing regulations that are unfortunately imposed on all member states and that penalize our business sectors,\u201d the 76-year-old CEO said.",
      "The European Commission, the EU\u2019s executive branch, negotiates trade deals on behalf of all 27 member states. The bloc is the largest trading entity in the world.",
      "LVMH shares fell 7.8% earlier this week, following an unexpected drop in first-quarter sales.",
      "Arnault said the company may be forced to expand U.S. operations. \"We would be forced to increase our American production to avoid tariffs if Europe failed to negotiate with intelligence,\u201d he said.",
      "In 2019, LVMH shifted part of its production to the U.S. by opening a Louis Vuitton workshop in Alvarado, Texas, during Trump\u2019s first term. Trump and Arnault toured the facility together, promoting it as a symbol of U.S. manufacturing revival.",
      "But on Thursday, Arnault admitted the Texas site has underperformed so far. According to documents presented at the meeting, the U.S. accounts for 25% of LVMH\u2019s total sales.",
      "Arnault also criticized France\u2019s proposed corporate tax increases, calling them a \u201ctax on \u2018Made in France\u2019\u201d and warned they could push companies to relocate abroad.",
      "He praised the U.S. model, citing lower taxes and state-backed industrial investment. \u201cWhen you come back to France after spending a few days in the U.S., it\u2019s a bit of a cold shower,\u201d he said.",
      "Outside the Louvre Museum conference hall, where the meeting took place, dozens of protesters demanded higher taxes on the wealthy, carrying a \u201cTax the rich\u201d sign alongside and a large puppet of Arnault depicted as a thief, a rope around his chest and hands tied behind his back.",
      "\u201cA tax of 2% on the wealth of France\u2019s ultra-rich could bring in up to \u20ac25 billion a year,\u201d said Fanny Petitbon, a spokesperson for the group 350.org. \u201cThat would be enough to invest in public services and accelerate an energy transition that benefits everyone.\u201d",

      "The IMF\u2019s Managing Director, Kristalina Georgieva, said Thursday that the Trump administration\u2019s sharp increases in duties have caused global uncertainty to spike. The import taxes will slow global growth, but not cause a worldwide recession, she added. The details of the IMF\u2019s outlook will be issued Tuesday.",
      "The world economy\u2019s resilience is being tested \u201cby the reboot of the global trading system\u201d that threatens to cause turbulence in financial markets, Georgieva said.",

      "Georgieva added that tariffs cause uncertainty, which can be costly. Due to the complexity of supply chains, the cost of a single item can be affected by tariffs in dozens of countries, she said.",
      "Increased trade barriers also tend to immediately impact growth, and while it can lead to more domestic production, that takes time to implement, she added.",
      "In its most recent projections issued in January, the IMF forecast the world economy to grow nominally faster and for inflation to come down, though it warned that outlook was clouded by President Donald Trump's policies, including tax cuts and increased tariffs on foreign imports.",
      "The Washington-based lending agency said at the time that it expected the world economy to grow 3.3% this year and next, up from 3.2% in 2024.",
      "Global inflation, which had surged after the COVID-19 pandemic disrupted global supply chains and caused shortages and higher prices, was forecast to fall from 5.7% in 2024 to 4.2% this year and 3.5% in 2026.",
      "However, in a blog post that accompanied those projections, the fund\u2019s chief economist, Pierre-Olivier Gourinchas, wrote that the policies Trump has promised to introduce \u201care likely to push inflation higher in the near term.\u2019\u2019",
      "Those forecasts from January are expected to change \u2014 possibly significantly \u2014 as Trump's trade war has escalated in recent months, particularly with the U.S.'s biggest trade partner, China.",
      "Trump has paused or pulled back on many of his tariff threats \u2014 leading to more volatility in the stock market \u2014 but has been in a tit-for-tat tariff battle with China and has shown no sign of backing down. Each time Trump has raised tariffs on China, Beijing has retaliated with tariffs on U.S. imports.",

    "story": [
      "President Donald Trump's escalating trade war with China means hopeful solar buyers may have a much harder time getting systems installed in the U.S. in coming months",
      "Mike Summers was eager to install solar at his home in Ohio for years, and after he finally replaced his aging roof this year, his solar contractor swung into action. His system \u2014 including 19 panels and a battery backup \u2014 went up this week, and Summers considers himself lucky.",
      "\u201cI'm glad to have done it when I did,\u201d said Summers, a former mayor in his city of Lakewood just west of Cleveland. He'll get about $10,000 in tax credits on his $39,000 investment, but nearly as important is that all the equipment was readily available.",
      "Other hopeful solar buyers may have a much harder time in coming months. President Donald Trump's escalating trade war with China threatens to crimp a massive source of solar panels and parts, with experts saying the cost of projects will certainly rise as China retaliates.",
      "China accounted for at least 80% of the components of solar panels as recently as 2022, according to an International Energy Agency report, especially polysilicon, glass and solar cells. Solar also demands increasing critical mineral supplies, of which China is a key player across the globe, and electronics.",
      "In the U.S., private industry has poured $18.2 billion into developing a domestic supply chain in recent years, according to Atlas Public Policy, that includes everything from the ingots and wafers that make up panels to electrical and structural components to assembly of the panels themselves. Most of that came from the Inflation Reduction Act passed during former President Joe Biden's administration, with massive funding for clean energy investment.",
      "But that won\u2019t come close to replacing what China produces.",
      "\u201cReally everybody\u2019s losing when you think about it, because the systems are costing more for the customers and it\u2019s also just making it more difficult, in some ways, for us to do business,\u201d said Brian DiPaolo, assistant sales manager at Cleveland-based solar installer YellowLite, which is doing Summers\u2019 project. DiPaolo said some customers are holding off on plans until there is more clarity. The company still stocked up on solar panels, made in North America, a month ago to stay competitive in coming months.",
      "\u201cWe\u2019re seeing both international as well as domestic manufacturers of the equipment increasing their costs to prepare for the tariffs,\" DiPaolo said. \u201cYou think that the domestic manufacturers would keep their prices down because they don\u2019t get hit by the tariffs, but they\u2019re seeing this added demand for their equipment.\u201d",
      "It\u2019s supply and demand, said Martin Pochtaruk, CEO of Heliene, which focuses on large-scale solar projects. He described the price of a necessary glass component from China going up in February due to a tariff hike. Suppliers in other countries matched the higher price, meaning higher costs no matter the source.",
      "Alexis Abramson, dean of Columbia University's Climate School, said there's no doubt that residential solar is going to be more expensive. That will cut solar adoption, and small and mid-size installers will go under, she said.",
      "It\u2019s just \u201cextremely difficult to offer current and future customers pricing certainty\u201d when trade policy is changing so much, said James Hasselbeck, chief operating officer at New England-based solar company ReVision Energy.",
      "Solar has gotten significantly more affordable in recent years as the technology scales up, improves and gets cheaper to install. Systems can still cost thousands of dollars on average, but the average cost for a residential system is down more than 70% from 2010, according to the National Renewable Energy Laboratory. American consumers have also had a shot at credits that bring the cost down still further, although the future of those is uncertain under the Trump administration.",
      "Commercial and utility-scale project costs have also dropped dramatically.",
      "That's fed rapid growth across the U.S. over the past two decades. In 2024, the commercial segment grew 8% and utility grew 33%, according to an annual report from the association and consultancy Wood Mackenzie. The residential segment fell 32% last year, but experts attribute that to high interest rates and election uncertainty, and said they had expected continued growth before the tariffs hit.",
      "Solar is an important source of clean energy because it doesn't emit the harmful greenhouse gases that coal, natural gas and oil do. Those are massive contributors to Earth's warming.",
      "Trump imposed tariffs during his first term on imported solar cells and modules in 2018 in hopes of slashing reliance on China.",
      "But China subsidized its own domestic overproduction and some U.S. manufacturers accused it of essentially moving operations to four Southeast Asian countries that had a temporary exemption from tariffs.",
      "Abigail Ross Hopper, president and CEO of the Solar Energy Industries Association, said the U.S. is \u201cquickly taking back control of the supply chain from China to build the strongest solar manufacturing base in the world.\u201d The group reported that in 2024, module manufacturing capacity, largely concentrated in the South, grew 190%, and said cell manufacturing \u201cwas reshored for the first time in five years\u201d with company Suniva restarting production.",
      "But Hopper also said sudden changes in policy risk chilling investment and slowing job creation, especially for manufacturers. The group said during the first Trump administration that tariffs issued then were harmful to the industry.",
      "Ultimately, Abramson said she \u201cwould encourage anybody who has been really thinking about putting solar on their roof to really look into locking that in sooner rather than later.\u201d",

      "The bank said in a statement that \u201cthe outlook for growth has deteriorated due to rising trade tensions.\u201d",
      "It cited \u201cexceptional uncertainty\u201d about the future economic situation, saying future rate decisions would be taken on a meeting by meeting basis.",
      "The bank\u2019s move should support economic activity in the 20 countries that use the euro currency by making credit more affordable for consumers and businesses.",
      "The bank\u2019s rate-setting council decided at a meeting in Frankfurt to lower its benchmark rate by a quarter percentage point to 2.25%. The bank has been steadily cutting rates after raising them sharply to combat an outbreak of inflation from 2022 to 2023.",
      "Now that inflation has fallen, growth worries have taken center stage. The economy in the 20 countries that use the euro grew a modest 0.2% in the last three months of 2024. Inflation was 2.2% in March, close to the bank\u2019s target of 2%.",
      "The cut was widely expected by analysts given the sudden shadow cast over the eurozone\u2019s growth outlook by Trump\u2019s April 2 announcement of unexpectedly high tariffs, or import tax, on goods from other countries starting at 10% and ranging as high as 49%. The European Union faces a 20% tariff.",
      "At the bank\u2019s last meeting on March 6, ECB President Christine Lagarde had raised the possibility of an upcoming \u201cpause\u201d in the bank\u2019s series of rate cuts. But that option was practically eliminated by Trump\u2019s announcement.",
      "The bank\u2019s benchmark steers rates throughout the economy. Lower interest rates make it less expensive to borrow money and buy goods ranging from homes to new factory equipment. That supports spending, business investment and hiring.",
      "Trump has suspended the tariffs for 90 days, but the possibility of the 20% tariff rate he has proposed for Europe left economists and policymakers concerned that the higher costs will weigh on business activity \u2014 and lead to slower growth or even a recession if he carries through. The U.S. is Europe\u2019s largest trade partner with some 4.4 billion euros ($5 billion) in goods and services crossing the Atlantic every day in both directions.",
      "As the European Commission puts it, \u201cthe trans-Atlantic trade relationship is the most important commercial relationship in the world.\u201d",
      "Uncertainty is another factor that could slow the economy since Trump\u2019s pause for negotiations leaves it unclear where the tariff rate will actually settle. Businesses may hold off on making decisions if they don\u2019t know what their costs will be.",
      "Economists at Berenberg bank think that by midyear some of the tariffs will be negotiated away, ending at around 12%. However that is still around 10 percentage points higher than average tariffs before Trump. On top of that comes a separate 25% tariff on autos from all countries which will hit Europe\u2019s prominent auto industry hard.",

But that option was practically eliminated on April 2, when Trump shocked global markets with proposals for unexpectedly high new tariffs, or import taxes, of 10% to 49% on global trading partners.",
      "Analysts say Thursday's meeting of the bank's rate-setting council in Frankfurt should see a quarter-point cut in the bank's benchmark rate to 2.25%. The bank has been steadily cutting rates after raising them sharply to combat an outbreak of inflation from 2022 to 2023.",
      "Now that inflation has fallen, growth worries have taken center stage. The economy in the 20 countries that use the euro grew a modest 0.2% in the last three months of 2024. Inflation was 2.2% in March, close to the bank's target of 2%.",
      "The bank's benchmark steers rates throughout the economy. Lower interest rates make it less expensive to borrow money and buy goods ranging from homes to new factory equipment. That supports spending, business investment and hiring.",
      "Trump has suspended the tariffs for 90 days, but the possibility of the 20% tariff rate he has proposed for Europe left economists and policymakers concerned that the higher costs will weigh on business activity \u2014 and lead to slower growth or even a recession if he carries through. The U.S. is Europe's largest trade partner with some 4.4 billion euros ($5 billion) in goods and services crossing the Atlantic every day in both directions.",
      "As the European Commission puts it, \u201cthe transatlantic trade relationship is the most important commercial relationship in the world.\u201d",
      "Uncertainty is another factor that could slow the economy since Trump's pause for negotiations leaves it unclear where the tariff rate will actually settle. Businesses may hold off on making decisions if they don't know what their costs will be.",
      "Economists at Berenberg bank think that by mid-year some of the tariffs will be negotiated away, ending at around 12%. However that is still around 10 percentage points higher than average tariffs before Trump. On top of that comes a separate 25% tariff on autos from all countries which will hit Europe's prominent auto industry hard.",

      "SAN JUAN, Puerto Rico -- Crews worked early Thursday to restore power to Puerto Rico after a blackout across the entire island that affected the main international airport, several hospitals and hotels filled with Easter vacationers",
      "The outage that began past noon Wednesday left 1.4 million customers without electricity and 328,000 without water. At least 175,000 customers, or 12%, had power back at the end of the day. Officials expected 90% of customers to have power back within 48 to 72 hours after the outage.",
      "\u201cThis is a shame for the people of Puerto Rico that we have a problem of this magnitude,\u201d said Gov. Jenniffer Gonz\u00e1lez, who cut her weeklong vacation short and returned to Puerto Rico on Wednesday evening.",
      "The blackout snarled traffic, forced hundreds of businesses to close and left those unable to afford generators scrambling to buy ice and candles.",
      "It\u2019s the second islandwide blackout to hit Puerto Rico in less than four months, with the previous one occurring on New Year\u2019s Eve.",
      "\u201cWhy on holidays?\u201d griped Jos\u00e9 Luis Richardson, who did not have a generator and kept cool by splashing water on himself every couple of hours.",
      "The roar of generators and smell of fumes filled the air as a growing number of Puerto Ricans renewed calls for the government to cancel the contracts with Luma Energy, which oversees the transmission and distribution of power, and Genera PR, which oversees generation.",
      "Gonz\u00e1lez promised to heed those calls.",
      "\u201cThat is not under doubt or question,\u201d she said, but added that it\u2019s not a quick process. \u201cIt is unacceptable that we have failures of this kind.\u201d",
      "Gonz\u00e1lez said a major outage like the one that occurred Wednesday leads to an estimated $230 million revenue loss daily.",
      "Ram\u00f3n C. Barqu\u00edn III, president of the United Retail Center, a nonprofit that represents small- and medium-sized businesses, warned that ongoing outages would spook potential investors at a time that Puerto Rico urgently needs economic development.",
      "\u201cWe cannot continue to repeat this cycle of blackouts without taking concrete measures to strengthen our energy infrastructure,\u201d he said.",
      "Many also were concerned about Puerto Rico\u2019s elderly population, with the mayor of Can\u00f3vanas deploying brigades to visit the bedridden and those who depend on electronic medical equipment.",
      "Meanwhile, the mayor of Vega Alta opened a center to provide power to those with lifesaving medical equipment.",
      "It was not immediately clear what caused the shutdown, the latest in a string of major blackouts on the island in recent years.",
      "Daniel Hern\u00e1ndez, vice president of operations at Genera PR, said Wednesday that a disturbance hit the transmission system shortly after noon, a time when the grid is vulnerable because there are few machines regulating frequency at that hour.",
      "Puerto Rico has struggled with chronic outages since September 2017 when Hurricane Maria pummeled the island as a powerful Category 4 storm, razing a power grid that crews are still struggling to rebuild.",
      "The grid already had been deteriorating as a result of decades of a lack of maintenance and investment.",

      "Cocoa has long provided a lifeline in Ivory Coast but adverse weather and plant diseases have hurt harvests in recent years",
      "N'GATTAKRO, Ivory Coast -- Jean Mari Konan Yao says he's struggling as a cocoa farmer in the west African nation of Ivory Coast, which produces almost half the world\u2019s cocoa supply of the raw ingredient used in chocolate.",
      "Like many in Ivory Coast \u2014 the world's biggest cocoa producer \u2014 Konan Yao says cocoa has long provided a lifeline for him, but adverse weather and plant diseases have hurt harvests in recent years.",
      "Now, cocoa farmers worry even more over President Donald Trump\u2019s plans to impose a 21% tariff on products from Ivory Coast \u2014 the highest among West African nations.",
      "Although Trump has suspended the tariff plans for 90 days pending further review, authorities in Ivory Coast have warned that such tariffs could send the price of cocoa even higher and destabilize the local market by slowing their sales.",
      "Ivory Coast produces between 2 million and 2.5 million metric tons of cocoa annually, with around 200,000 to 300,000 metric tons exported to the United States, according to the Coffee and Cocoa Council.",
      "In 2023, Ivory Coast exported $3.68 billion worth of cocoa beans, its second biggest export after gold. The U.S. was its fourth-largest importer of cocoa beans, after the Netherlands, Malaysia and Belgium, according to the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development.",
      "For most local cocoa growers, any U.S. tariff could further shake a market already struggling with decreasing yields and shrinking funding that has limited farmers\u2019 ability to meet global demands for chocolate.",
      "\u201cIf we hear the American president is going to put a tax on the price of cocoa, it\u2019s really not good for us, it doesn\u2019t help us,\u201d said another cocoa farmer, Salif Traor\u00e9.",
      "Already, cocoa prices were rising in the country, in part because of insufficient and irregular rainfall in Ivory Coast.",
      "The U.K.-based Energy and Climate Intelligence Unit research firm has noted a 32% rise in the price of cocoa imported into the United Kingdom over the last three years, partially due to extreme weather conditions in parts of Africa where it\u2019s mainly grown. Together, Ivory Coast, Ghana, Nigeria and Cameroon produce about three-quarters of the world\u2019s cocoa.",
      "Cocoa is traded on a regulated, global market. In Ivory Coast, the government usually sets cocoa prices at the onset of each season, with prices reflecting market trends and global prices. The local prices are, however, lower than the global market rates, thereby limiting the farmers' profit from high global prices.",
      "Authorities say they are already considering cocoa price increases if the U.S. tariff comes into effect.",
      "\u201cDonald Trump\u2019s customs tax is causing us problems. We are already feeling the effects,\u201d said Boss Diarra, coordinator of the local cocoa farmers\u2019 union in Bouafl\u00e9 in central Ivory Coast. He pointed to bags of cocoa that he said farmers have been unable to sell.",
      "Meanwhile, a U.S. tariff could mean more cocoa for European markets, said Bruno Marcel Iriti\u00e9, researcher at the Ivorian F\u00e9lix Houphou\u00ebt-Boigny Polytechnic Institute. Some of the top importers of Ivory Coast cocoa are in Europe, market data show.",
      "European customers \"will inevitably buy cheaper because when there is too much, the customer is king,\u201d Iriti\u00e9 said.",

      "Italian Premier Giorgia Meloni will test her mettle as an EU facilitator when she meets with Donald Trump in the White House",
      "MILAN -- Italian Premier Giorgia Meloni will test her mettle as a bridge between the EU and the United States when she meets with U.S. President Donald Trump in the White House on Thursday, the first European leader to have a face-to-face with Trump since he announced, and then suspended, 20% tariffs on European exports.",
      "Meloni secured the meeting at a critical juncture in the trade war as Italy\u2019s leader, but she also has, in a sense, been \u201cknighted\u201d to represent the European Union. She has been in close contact with EU Commission President Ursula von der Leyen ahead of the trip, and \"the outreach is \u2026 closely coordinated,\" a commission spokeswoman said this week.",
      "\u201cWe know we are in a difficult moment,\" Meloni said this week in Rome. \"Most certainly, I am well aware of what I represent, and what I am defending.\"",
      "The European Union is defending what it calls \u201cthe most important commercial relationship in the world,\u2019\u2019 with annual trade reaching 1.6 trillion euros ($1.8 trillion).",
      "Trade negotiations fall under the European Commission\u2019s authority, which is pushing for a zero-for-zero tariff deal with the U.S. However, Trump administration officials in talks with the EU have yet to publicly show signs of relenting on Trump\u2019s insistence that a baseline 10% tariff be charged on all foreign imports. He paused for 90 days a retaliatory increase to 20%.",
      "The pause has raised some hopes for negotiations, and Meloni\u2019s margins for progress are more in gaining clarity on Trump's goals rather than outright concessions, experts say.",
      "\u201cIt is a very delicate mission,\u201d said Fabian Zuleeg, chief economist at the European Policy Center think tank in Brussels. \u201cThere is the whole trade agenda, and while she\u2019s not officially negotiating, we know that Trump likes to have this kind of informal exchange, which in a sense is a negotiation. So it\u2019s a lot on her plate.\"",
      "As the leader of a far-right party, Meloni is ideologically aligned with Trump on issues including curbing migration, promoting traditional values and skepticism toward multilateral institutions. But stark differences have emerged in Meloni\u2019s unwavering support for Ukraine.",
      "After being the only European leader to attend the Jan. 20 inauguration, Meloni has responded with studied restraint as abrupt shifts in U.S. policy under Trump have frayed the trans-Atlantic alliance. She has denounced the tariffs as \"wrong\" and warned that \u201cdividing the West would be disastrous for everyone,\u201d after Trump\u2019s heated White House exchange with Ukraine\u2019s president.",
      "\u201cShe has been very cautious,\u2019\u2019 said Wolfango Piccoli, an analyst at the London-based Teneo consultancy. \u201cIt is what we need when we have a counterpart that is changing every day.\u2019\u2019",
      "Italy maintains a 40 billion euro trade surplus with the United States, its largest with any country, fueled by Americans\u2019 appetite for Italian sparkling wine, foodstuffs like Parmigiano Reggiano hard cheese and Parma ham, and Italian luxury fashion. These are all sectors critical to the Italian economy, and mostly supported by small- and medium-sized producers who are core center-right voters.",
      "\u201cAll in all, I think she will focus on the very strong economic and trade relations that Italy has with the United States, not just in terms of exports, but also services and energy,\" said Antonio Villafranca, vice president of the ISPI think tank in Milan. \u201cFor example, Italy could even consider importing more gas from the U.S.\u201d",
      "The meeting comes against the backdrop of growing concerns over global uncertainty generated by the escalating tariff wars. Italy\u2019s growth forecast for this year has already been slashed from 1% to 0.5% as a result.",
      "Meloni is also expected to address Trump's demand for NATO partners to increase military spending to 2% of gross domestic product. Italy\u2019s spending, at 1.49% of GDP, is among the lowest in Europe.",
      "Experts cautioned, however, against raising expectations over any concrete progress.",
      "\u201cThe best strategy has been to be very circumspect: Get there, get the meeting, get the photo opportunity,\u201d Piccoli said. \u201cIf she is able to come back, and give a sense of how Washington wants to frame future relations on trade, defense and Ukraine policy, that would be a huge win.\"",

      "President Donald Trump joined his economic advisers for White House negotiations Wednesday over tariffs and trade with a Japanese official",
      "WASHINGTON -- WASHINGTON (AP) \u2014 President Donald Trump on Wednesday inserted himself directly into trade talks with Japanese officials, a sign of the high stakes for the United States after its tariffs rattled the economy and caused the administration to assure the public that it would quickly reach deals.",
      "The Republican president attended the meeting alongside Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent and Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick, top economic advisers with a central role in his trade and tariff policies.",
      "\u201cHopefully something can be worked out which is good (GREAT!) for Japan and the USA!\u201d Trump wrote in a social media post ahead of the meeting.",
      "Afterward, he posted: \u201cA Great Honor to have just met with the Japanese Delegation on Trade. Big Progress!\u201d",
      "Japanese Prime Minister Shigeru Ishiba told reporters Thursday in Tokyo that his chief trade negotiator, Ryosei Akazawa, told him from Washington that the talks were \u201cvery candid and constructive.\u201d",
      "\u201cOf course the talks are not easy, but President Trump stated his intention to make this negotiation a top priority,\u201d Ishiba said. \u201cI believe we had talks that lead to a next step.\u201d",
      "Ishiba said he will closely watch how ministerial talks go and plans to visit Washington to meet with Trump at an appropriate time.",
      "Trump's choice to get directly involved in negotiations points to his desire to quickly finalize a slew of trade deals as China is pursuing its own set of agreements. It's an open test of Trump's reputation as a dealmaker as countries around the world seek to limit the potential damage unleashed by his import taxes.",
      "The sweeping tariffs that Trump announced on April 2 triggered panic in the financial markets and generated recession fears, causing the U.S. president to quickly put a partial 90-day hold on the import taxes and increase his already steep tariffs against China to as much as 145%.",
      "The pause temporarily spared Japan from 24% across-the-board tariffs, but there continues to be a 10% baseline tariff and a 25% tax on imported cars, auto parts, steel and aluminum exports.",
      "With Japan charging an average tax rate of 1.9% on other countries' goods and having a longstanding alliance with the U.S., the talks on Wednesday are a crucial indicator of whether the Trump administration can achieve a meaningful deal that reassures the markets, American voters and foreign allies.",
      "U.S. economic rival China, meanwhile, is trying to capitalize on the turmoil around Trump's announcements, with its leader, President Xi Jinping, touring nations of Southeast Asia and promoting his country as a more reliable trade partner.",
      "Japan is among the first countries to start open negotiations with the U.S. Trump and other administration officials have said the phones have been \u201cringing off the hook\u201d with dozens of countries calling, eager to strike deals with a president who views himself as a master negotiator to avoid tariffs when the 90-day pause ends. Israel and Vietnam have offered to zero out their tariff rates, but Trump has been noncommittal as to whether that would be sufficient.",
      "On Thursday, Trump is scheduled to meet with Italian Prime Minister Giorgia Meloni, who will likely be carrying messages on behalf of the European Union about how to resolve the tariffs Trump placed on the 27-state group.",
      "Still, the U.S. president may also be feeling increased domestic pressures to settle any tariffs as many voters say they returned Trump to the White House with the specific goal of improving the economy. California Gov. Gavin Newsom filed a lawsuit Wednesday that argues that Trump overstepped his authority by declaring an economic emergency to levy his tariffs, with the Democrat saying in a statement that the tariffs have caused economic chaos.",
      "Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell said Wednesday that Trump's tariff policies would hurt the U.S. economy, a direct warning to a White House trying to sell the import taxes as a long-term positive for the country.",
      "\u201cThe level of tariff increases announced so far is significantly larger than anticipated, and the same is likely to be true of the economic effects which will include higher inflation and slower growth,\u201d Powell said at the Economic Club of Chicago.",
      "Japan, like many other nations trying to minimize the possible economic fallout from Trump's tariffs, has been scrambling to respond. It has set up a special task force to assess the impact of the tariffs and offer loans to anxious companies.",
      "Although Ishiba has been working hard to coax exemptions out of Trump, the government has said little officially on what concessions it might offer during these talks.",
      "Nor has the administration been transparent about its asks. The Trump administration is seeking to close the $68.5 billion trade deficit with Japan and seeking greater access for U.S. goods in foreign markets, yet the president has also insisted that tariff revenues can be used to pay down the federal budget deficit.",
      "\u201cJapan is coming in today to negotiate Tariffs, the cost of military support, and \u2018TRADE FAIRNESS,\u2019\u201d Trump posted Wednesday.",
      "Japan has contended that Trump's tariff measures are likely to violate bilateral trade agreements or World Trade Organization rules. While Ishiba has said he opposes retaliatory tariffs, he also has said he is in no rush to push for a settlement because he doesn't want concessions.",
      "Xi, meanwhile, stopped in Malaysia on Wednesday and told its leader that China will be a collaborative partner and stand with its Southeast Asian neighbors after the global economic shocks.",

      "\u201cIn the face of shocks to global order and economic globalization, China and Malaysia will stand with countries in the region to combat the undercurrents of geopolitical ... confrontation, as well as the counter-currents of unilateralism and protectionism,\u201d Xi said in remarks at a dinner with Malaysian Prime Minister Anwar Ibrahim.",

      "SUVs are typically larger, heavier, harder to control and slower to brake than a standard coupe or sedan",
      "This is the time of year when many parents are thinking about buying a used vehicle for their teen drivers. The vehicle may be a graduation gift or a needed set of wheels for a summer job or trip to college. These days, SUVs are a common choice because of their sales popularity. But which one to get?",
      "Edmunds\u2019 auto experts have rounded up five used SUV recommendations for your teen driver. We considered Edmunds\u2019 evaluations of helpful qualities for teen drivers such as outward visibility, technology features and driving satisfaction. We also considered reliability data and crash test results. Here are Edmunds\u2019 top picks for $20,000 or less. The prices listed are estimates of what you might expect to pay at a nationwide dealership such as CarMax or Carvana.",
      "The last-generation Equinox is a top compact SUV value. It\u2019s affordably priced and has roomy seating, a smooth ride and useful tech features. The standard Teen Driver feature, for example, can remind young drivers to buckle up, and it limits stereo volume and lets parents monitor driving habits. Downmarket interior quality and small cargo space narrow the Equinox\u2019s appeal, but overall the Equinox is a no-nonsense choice.",
      "Look for: Picking an Equinox is pretty easy because it didn\u2019t change much from 2018 to 2024. There\u2019s a lot of Equinox inventory to pick from too. Consider a 2019-and-later model to get a newer infotainment system.",
      "2018-2022 Equinox pricing: approximately $14,000 to $20,000",
      "Lively handling and a high-quality interior make the Mazda CX-5 a fun compact SUV. And while sporty performance isn\u2019t a priority for most parents, going with a CX-5 will neatly circumvent any complaints about an SUV being boring to drive. Other high points include excellent crash test safety ratings and a high predicted RepairPal reliability score. Rear seat and cargo space come up short compared to rivals, but the CX-5 remains an excellent choice.",
      "Look for: Mazda made some improvements during this time. Young drivers will likely appreciate the standard Apple CarPlay and Android Auto smartphone integration that became standard in 2019.",
      "2017-2020 CX-5 pricing: approximately $16,000 to $20,000",
      "Is your teen an outdoorsy type? Someone who enjoys camping, surfing, snowboarding or biking? The half-wagon, half-SUV Outback shines here. It has standard all-wheel drive for sure-footed traction in rough or wet terrain. Tall ground clearance lets it go places sportier SUVs can\u2019t, while its lower roof height makes for easy cargo loading. The Outback also gets excellent safety scores from the Insurance Institute for Highway Safety.",
      "Look for: Subaru redesigned the Outback for 2020, but we think an older Outback is just as good. Subaru made more advanced safety aids, including automatic braking and adaptive cruise control, standard starting in 2019.",
      "2015-2018 Outback pricing: approximately $15,000 to $20,000",
      "Your teen driver needs a larger three-row SUV? Consider an older Highlander. The third row isn\u2019t palatial, but it\u2019s handy enough for a teen who might need to shuttle siblings around. The third row also folds down to create ample cargo space. Crash test scores and predicted RepairPal reliability are favorable too. The biggest complaint your teen might have is that a Highlander is just too sensible and boring.",
      "Look for: the four-cylinder gets the job done, Highlanders with the more powerful V6 are better at accelerating quickly with multiple passengers aboard.",
      "2015-2016 Highlander pricing: approximately $16,000 to $20,000",
      "Like the Outback, the Wrangler isn\u2019t quite an SUV, truck or wagon. It\u2019s its own category. Yes, a four-door Wrangler lacks much of what other SUVs offer. It\u2019s bouncy, loud, gulps fuel and hardly impresses in crash test safety or RepairPal reliability. But its emotional appeal is undeniable. From its legendary off-road capability, and removable doors and roof, the Wrangler scratches a teenage itch for freedom like no other.",
      "Look for: There are two-door and four-door versions of the Wrangler; young drivers will likely enjoy the more personal vibe of the two-door. Regardless of type, the Sport or Sport S trims offer the best combination of features, fun and frugality.",
      "2015-2016 Wrangler pricing: approximately $17,000 to $20,000",
      "Whether your teen driver likes the outdoors, motorsports or simply having enough space for friends and family, there are several good choices for a used SUV to suit your teen\u2019s needs and style.",

      "However, inflation remains above the Bank of England's target of 2% and is set to rise to over 3% in April due to a confluence of factors, including higher domestic energy bills as well as the potential impact of higher taxes and labor costs for businesses, which are likely to pass some costs on to customers.",
      "Still, most economists think the bank can lower its main interest rate from 4.50%, as the peak in inflation is likely to be lower than previously thought, not least because U.S. President Donald Trump's tariff policies are likely to depress global growth and hence prices. One impact of Trump's tariff plans has been lower oil prices, which will have a downward effect on inflation.",

      "Inflation is way down from levels seen a couple of years ago, partly because central banks have dramatically increased borrowing costs from near zero during the coronavirus pandemic. Prices then began to shoot up, first as a result of supply chain issues and later because of Russia\u2019s full-scale invasion of Ukraine, which pushed energy costs higher.",
      "As inflation rates have declined from multidecade highs, central banks, including the U.S. Federal Reserve have started cutting interest rates, though few, if any, economists think that rates will fall back to the super-low levels that persisted in the years after the global financial crisis of 2008-2009 and during the pandemic.",

      "Making maple syrup in New England\u2019s fickle spring weather can be an unpredictable business",
      "MORGAN, Vt. -- Making maple syrup in New England's fickle spring weather can be an unpredictable business. Now President Donald Trump's ever-changing tariff policies are adding anxiety about an industry that depends on multinational trade.",
      "\u201cAny kind of disruption with our cross border enterprise, we feel it,\u201d said Jim Judd, a fourth-generation sugarer who owns Judd\u2019s Wayeeses Farms in Morgan, Vermont. \u201cIt\u2019s uncertain enough making maple syrup.\u201d",
      "Judd, who has been making Vermont\u2019s signature product since the 1970s, says multiple countries contribute to each container of the sticky sweetener. Stainless steel fixtures used connect sap lines and boil the liquid into syrup can originate in China. Packaging often comes from Italy. And the vast majority of equipment is sold by Canada, which produces about four-fifths of the planet's maple syrup \u2014 and sells nearly two-thirds of it to U.S. consumers.",
      "That's why this spring's whiplash is so concerning to Judd and many other U.S. producers in Vermont as well as New York, Maine and Wisconsin.",
      "Trump backed off the stiffest tariffs on most nations for 90 days earlier this month while increasing the taxes on Chinese imports to 145% and engaging in a lengthy back and forth with Canada and Mexico about tariffs on their countries' goods.",
      "Allison Hope, executive director of the Vermont Maple Sugar Makers' Association, said they're assuming that Trump's latest position means there is no tariff on finished maple products for now \u2014 but the situation gets murkier when considering that necessary packaging, equipment and materials may originate in China.",
      "\u201cIt's like the weather in New England. You wait five minutes and it might change,\u201d Hope said. \u201cNow it matters how Canada makes its equipment and gets its materials. ... It's hard for businesses to run on a growth mentality when there's no sense of what the industry is going to look like in a way, in a year.\u201d",
      "The uncertainty is arriving in a time of relative growth for syrup producers in the U.S. as well as Canada. Vermont has seen an increase in production of nearly 500% over the last 20 years as producers scaled up, new businesses formed and U.S. consumers sought local and natural alternatives to refined sugars, Hope said.",
      "But disrupting trade with Canada, the maple syrup powerhouse, could be devastating. Judd, for one, said he has spent \u201ccountless amounts of hours and lots and lots of money\u201d buying equipment in Canada over the decades. Import taxes could sharply increase his costs, and since syrup is, at essence, a luxury good, he thinks he can't raise prices.",
      "\u201cWe can't do this without Canadian help. We can't buy what we need at another outlet because it's all in Canada,\u201d Judd said. \u201cWe've been crossing this border all my life. The recent changes we see being imposed on the people here \u2014 we're not sure that they're all necessary.\"",

      "A recent amendment to Peru\u2019s Forestry and Wildlife Law has sparked intense backlash from environmental groups and Indigenous organizations",
      "BOGOTA, Colombia -- A recent amendment to Peru\u2019s Forestry and Wildlife Law is drawing fierce backlash from environmental groups and Indigenous groups that warn it could accelerate deforestation in the Amazon rainforest under the guise of economic development.",
      "The amendment eliminates the requirement that landowners or companies get state authorization before converting forested land to other uses. Critics say the change could legitimize years of illegal deforestation.",
      "\u201cTo us, this is gravely concerning,\u201d said Alvaro Masquez Salvador, a lawyer with the Indigenous Peoples program at Peru\u2019s Legal Defense Institute.",
      "Masquez added that the reform sets a troubling precedent by \u201ceffectively privatizing\u201d land that Peru's constitution defines as national patrimony. \u201cForests are not private property\u2014they belong to the nation,\u201d he said.",
      "Supporters of the amendment, enacted in March, say it will stabilize Peru\u2019s agricultural sector and provide farmers with greater legal certainty.",
      "The Associated Press sought comment from multiple representatives of Peru\u2019s agribusiness sector, as well as Congresswoman Maria Zeta Chunga, a vocal supporter of the law. Only one person in the agribusiness sector responded, saying they did not want to comment.",
      "Peru holds the second-largest share of Amazon rainforest after Brazil, with over 70 million hectares\u2014about 60% of Peru's territory, according to nonprofit Rainforest Trust. It\u2019s one of the most biodiverse regions on the planet and home to more than 50 Indigenous peoples, some living in voluntary isolation. These communities are vital guardians of ecosystems and the rainforests they protect help stabilize the global climate by absorbing large quantities of carbon dioxide, a greenhouse gas that is the main driver of climate change.",
      "Passed in 2011, the original Forestry and Wildlife Law required state approval and environmental studies before any change in forest land use. But recent reforms have steadily weakened those protections. The latest amendment allows landowners and companies to bypass that approval, even retroactively legalizing past deforestation.",
      "Peru\u2019s Constitutional Court upheld the amendment after a group of lawyers filed a constitutional challenge. Although the court struck down some parts of the amendment, it left intact the law\u2019s final provision, which validates past illegal land-use changes. Legal experts say this is the most dangerous part.",
      "In its ruling, the court acknowledged that Indigenous communities should have been consulted on reforms to the law and affirmed the Environment Ministry\u2019s role in forest zoning.",
      "Environmental lawyer C\u00e9sar Ipenza summed it up like this: \u201cThe court admits the law violated Indigenous rights and (tribes) should have been consulted but it still endorses the most harmful part.\u201d",
      "The push behind the reform mirrors dynamics seen under former President Jair Bolsonaro in Brazil, where political and economic forces aligned to weaken environmental protections to favor agribusiness. While Brazil\u2019s effort was led by a highly organized, industrial agribusiness lobby, Peru\u2019s version involves a looser but powerful coalition.",
      "In Peru, support comes from agribusiness interests, land grabbers and figures linked to illegal mining and drug trafficking. Small and medium farmers with concerns about securing their land have also been swept into the effort.",
      "\u201cWhat we\u2019re seeing is a convergence of both legal and illegal interests,\u201d said Vladimir Pinto, the Peru field coordinator for Amazon Watch, an environmental advocacy group.",
      "Julia Urrunaga, Peru director at nonprofit Environmental Investigation Agency, warned that the Peruvian government is now \u201cfalsely arguing\u201d that the amendments are necessary to comply with the European Union\u2019s regulations, which will soon require companies importing products like soy, beef, and palm oil to prove their goods were not sourced from illegally deforested land.",
      "If products tied to illegal deforestation are later legalized and allowed into the market, that will weaken the effectiveness of demand-side regulations like those in the EU, she said.",
      "\u201cThis sends the wrong message to global markets and undercuts efforts to curb deforestation through trade restrictions,\u201d Urrunaga said.",
      "Olivier Coupleux, head of the Economic and Trade Section of the EU in Peru, has denied that recent changes to the law are linked to the EU\u2019s deforestation-free regulation.",
      "In interviews with Peruvian media, Coupleux has said the regulation aims to prevent the purchase of products linked to deforestation and does not require legal reforms, but rather traceability and sustainability in goods like coffee, cocoa, and timber.",
      "With no further recourse in domestic courts, civil society groups are preparing to take the case to international tribunals, warning that the ruling sets a dangerous precedent for other countries seeking to circumvent environmental law under the banner of reform.",
      "For many Indigenous leaders, the law represents a direct threat to their territories, communities, and ways of life.",
      "Julio Cusurichi, board member of the Interethnic Association for the Development of the Peruvian Rainforest, said the measure will embolden land-grabbing and worsen environmental oversight in already vulnerable areas.",

Officials are focusing on providing low-cost loans, subsidies, and other financial incentives to stimulate investment in the semiconductor sector. The government aims to facilitate the development of advanced chips by expanding financial assistance for research and development activities and high-tech manufacturing equipment",

      "BANGKOK -- Chinese leader Xi Jinping is making the case for free trade as he tours Southeast Asia this week, presenting China as a source of \u201cstability and certainty.\"",
      "On Monday, he was welcomed to Hanoi with pomp and ceremony by Vietnam's President Luong Cuong.",
      "He arrived in Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia's capital, later Tuesday, for a three-day visit and will end his tour with a stop in Cambodia.",
      "In Hanoi, Xi had a meeting with Vietnam\u2019s Communist Party General Secretary To Lam, where he said the two countries \u201chave brought the world valuable stability and certainty\u201d in a \u201cturbulent world.\u201d He also paid respects at the mausoleum of Ho Chi Minh, the founder of the Vietnamese Communist Party.",
      "\u201cAs beneficiaries of economic globalization, both China and Vietnam should strengthen strategic resolve, jointly oppose unilateral bullying acts, uphold the global free trade system, and keep global industrial and supply chains stable,\u201d he added, according to a statement from China's Ministry of Foreign Affairs.",
      "China and Vietnam signed a series of memorandums on cooperation in supply chains and a joint railway project, and Xi also promised greater access for Vietnamese agricultural exports to China, although few details were made public about the agreements.",
      "U.S. President Donald Trump complained about the meeting, which comes days after his tariffs upended global markets and left governments across the world scrambling. Reacting to the meeting Monday, Trump said China and Vietnam were trying \u201cto figure out how do we screw the United States of America.\u201d",
      "In Malaysia, Xi is expected to discuss a free trade agreement between China and 10-member Association of Southeast Asian Nation, as Malaysia is chair of the association this year. Xi will meet with King Sultan Ibrahim on Wednesday morning and Prime Minister Anwar Ibrahim later in the day.",
      "ASEAN Secretary-General Kao Kim Hourn told Chinese state media that the agreement will eliminate many tariffs between China and the bloc's members. \"We will bring more tariffs down to zero in many cases, and then expand to all the areas,\u201d he said in an interview with CGTN, the state broadcaster's English channel.",
      "Malaysia is home to several Belt and Road Initiative projects, including a $11.2 billion Chinese railway project. China is also its largest trading partner and a top source of foreign direct investment.",
      "Xi's tour was likely planned before the tariff announcements had disrupted the global economy.",
      "\u201cFrom the Chinese perspective, it\u2019s mostly about ensuring China\u2019s influence in the region remains strong and vibrant, with Southeast Asia being China\u2019s major trading partner,\u201d said Oh Ei Sun, a senior fellow at Singapore's Institute of International Affairs.",
      "However, the trip's timing and the fact that Vietnam, Malaysia, and Cambodia, were all countries impacted by Trump's tariffs, provides Beijing an opportunity to project how it would act as a \u201cresponsible\u201d superpower, one of China's long-time stances.",
      "\u201cChina can offer a lot to Vietnam and other ASEAN countries during this volatile period,\u201d said Nguyen Thanh Trung, a professor of Vietnamese studies at Fulbright University Vietnam. \u201cI think China can be a leader.\u201d",
      "Anwar called China a \u201ctrue friend\u201d during Li Qiang\u2019s visit in June and has visited China three times since he took power in November 2022.",
      "China's claims to the South China Sea are a point of contention with both Vietnam and Malaysia. Anwar vowed last September that Malaysia will not bow to demands by China to stop its oil and gas exploration in an oil-rich maritime area in the South China Sea as the activities are within the country\u2019s waters.",

      "Ukrainian tennis player Lesia Tsurenko has filed an amended lawsuit that accuses the WTA Tour and its chairman, Steve Simon, of a breach of contract, negligence and the \u201cnegligent infliction of emotional distress.\"",
      "NEW YORK -- Ukrainian tennis player Lesia Tsurenko has filed an amended lawsuit that accuses the WTA Tour and its chairman, Steve Simon, of a breach of contract, negligence and the \u201cnegligent infliction of emotional distress\u201d because of the way it has handled Russian and Belarusian players amid the war in Ukraine.",
      "Tsurenko, who was once among the world's top 25, claims in the lawsuit that WTA executives \u2014 including Simon, who was its CEO at the time \u2014 failed to follow through on assurances made in a meeting with Ukrainian players that the organization would ban Russian or Belarussian players who publicly supported the war with Ukraine.",
      "The amended lawsuit, filed Tuesday in federal court for the Southern District of New York, cited examples such as Russian player Veronika Kudermetova wearing a patch at the French Open for sponsor Taneft, a subsidiary of a company that was sanctioned by the European Union for helping to supply the Russian army.",
      "\u201cDespite this promise,\u201d the lawsuit from Tsurenko claims, \u201cneither Defendant Steve Simon nor Defendant WTA banned Russian and Belarus players who publicly supported the war.\u201d",
      "The WTA said in a statement to The Associated Press on Wednesday that it has been \u201csteadfast and clear in its condemnation of Russia\u2019s war on Ukraine and the actions of the Russian government against the Ukrainian people.\u201d",
      "\u201cConsistent with our position,\" the statement said, \"the WTA has taken numerous steps to assist our Ukrainian player members, who have faced great challenges as professional athletes. The WTA has been equally clear that it was founded on principles of equality and non-discrimination and its rules provide that competitions are open to all women players who qualify based on their merit, and without discrimination. Consistent with those principles, and in common with other tennis organizations, the WTA has taken the position that individual athletes should not be penalized for the actions of their governments.\u201d",
      "Shortly after Russia's full-scale invasion of Ukraine in February 2022, the WTA Tour, ATP Tour and International Tennis Federation issued a joint statement in which it said Russian and Belarusian athletes would be allowed to compete as long as they did not compete under their nation\u2019s flags. That policy remains in place with Russian and Belarusian athletes competing at last year\u2019s Paris Olympics as \u201cIndividual Neutral Athletes;\u201d Russian players Mirra Andreeva and Diana Shnaider won silver in women\u2019s doubles.",
      "Tsurenko's lawsuit states that she was forced to withdraw from an event at Indian Wells because of a panic attack from having to potentially play against Russians and Belarusians, and that she had \u201cdeveloped excessive stress, loss of concentration affecting her performance at tennis games, mortification and injury to her feelings.\u201d",
      "Lindsay Brandon, the WTA director of safeguarding, informed Tsurenko in 2023 that Simon would be investigated for violating its code of conduct. But that October, the organization informed her that Simon had not violated its code nor any provision of the employee handbook. Tsurenko tried to appeal but was unsuccessful.",
      "\u201cEven in my worst nightmares, I couldn\u2019t imagine that the professional tour, which I considered my home, would become a terrifying and alien place, where the (former) CEO of the organization consciously committed an act of moral abuse against me, leading to a panic attack and my inability to do my job,\u201d Tsurenko wrote Tuesday on social media.",
      "The initial complaint filed in November requests a trial by jury.",
      "Proskaeur Rose, the law firm representing the WTA, filed a motion last month to dismiss the case on the grounds that Tsurenko\u2019s claims were \u201clegally defective.\u201d The WTA has until April 30 to decide whether it will continue with its motion to dismiss.",
      "\u201cWhile the WTA has the greatest sympathy for the significant challenges that Ms. Tsurenko and our other Ukrainian athletes have faced,\u201d its statement said Wednesday, \"we are disappointed that she has decided to engage in litigation to seek to hold the WTA responsible for her distress. At all times, the WTA and its management acted appropriately and in accordance with our rules, and we are confident that we will prevail in this litigation.\u201d",

      "Rodgers was released by the New York Jets in March. The 41-year-old four-time NFL MVP has visited the Pittsburgh Steelers and talked with the Minnesota Vikings in recent weeks, but said there are certain things going on in his personal life that are currently taking precedence over anything related to football.",
      "\u201cI have a couple people in my inner circle that are battling some difficult stuff,\u201d Rodgers said. \"I have a lot of things that are taking my attention and have, beginning in January, away from football.\u201d",

He did cut down rumors that he was holding out for a multi-year contract or a big payday, saying that $10 million for one season would be enough to get him to sign.",
      "\u201cI told every single one of the teams I talked to (that) it wasn\u2019t about the money,\u201d Rodgers said.",
      "The Steelers currently have plenty of cap space and plenty of room on the roster for Rodgers. Mason Rudolph and Skylar Thompson are the only two quarterbacks currently under contact. Rodgers tried to surreptitiously visit Pittsburgh's facility last month, flying into a regional airport and renting a Chevy Malibu in an effort not to draw attention to himself.",
      "Rodgers said it was important to meet with Steelers coach Mike Tomlin and general manager Omar Khan and get a feel for the city. He left without an agreement, though everyone from Tomlin to team president Art Rooney II has indicated the meeting was productive. Rodgers also has relationships with Pittsburgh offensive coordinator Arthur Smith and quarterbacks coach Tom Arth, who worked alongside Rodgers in Green Bay during the 2006 offseason.",

      "The opening of the college football transfer portal has created a dash for cash.",
      "The delay in approving the House vs. NCAA antitrust settlement means the rules around compensation are not yet in place, blowing up the market for the amount of money players can receive from their schools' name, image and likeness collectives or from third-party endorsement deals.",
      "More than 400 players have entered the portal since it opened Wednesday, according to tracking by 247Sports. Athletes have until April 25 to enter, and they clearly have leverage until the settlement is approved by U.S. District Judge Claudia Wilken in California.",
      "\u201cIt's basically a free pass to pay guys as much as you want to pay them right now,\u201d said Mit Winter, a Missouri sports law attorney who advises agents, collectives and schools. His advice to athletes: \u201cGet your deal signed now before the House settlement gets approved and make sure the payments are made from a collective before July 1.\u201d",
      "Once the House settlement is approved, any NIL deals with a collective or third party over $600 must be reported to a clearinghouse, where it will be vetted to determine if the pay is commensurate with the service provided by the athlete and that it is in line with the athlete's fair market value. July 1 is the expected date for the settlement to take effect.",
      "Jacob Piasecki and Stefan Aguilera, co-founders of the Austin, Texas-based A&P Sports Agency, have been busy since winter negotiating \u201cfrontloaded\u201d NIL contracts that will pay all or most of the money to their clients before July 1.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s like an 11th hour now,\u201d Piasecki said. \u201cWe're getting to the point where collectives are going to be highly scrutinized and everything is going to be under a microscope.\u201d",
      "Michael LeRoy, a University of Illinois labor and sports law professor, said it would have been advantageous for the schools if Wilken had given final approval to the settlement in the days between the April 7 settlement hearing and the opening of the portal this week.",
      "\u201cThe lack of closure,\u201d LeRoy said, \u201cadds one more element of chaos.\u201d",
      "The scramble for pay has disrupted college sports the past few seasons, particularly with athletes now free to transfer without having to sit out the following season. This past year alone, quarterback Nico Iamaleava left Tennessee when he was set to reportedly earn $2.2 million next season and QB Matthew Sluka left UNLV, saying the school didn't come through with $100,000.",
      "In addition to NIL, athletes also will be able to get paid through revenue sharing beginning July 1. Schools are now sending players term sheets or memorandums of understanding regarding pay. Each school will be allowed to distribute $20.5 million to their athletes this year, with football and men's basketball players likely to receive the lion's share.",
      "Considering some schools had unofficial NIL payrolls at or near $20 million just for football last year and that there soon will be greater policing of collective and third-party NIL deals, some of the highest-paid players will take pay cuts this year unless their current deals are renegotiated before House approval.",
      "Piasecki and Aguilera predicted a random Power Four quarterback who earned $2 million in 2024 might make only half that in 2025 because of the rev-share and NIL caps.",
      "Winter agreed some players could make less, \u201cbut they still will be able to negotiate within whatever budget a school has. There\u2019s still going to be collectives at a lot of schools that will come in to fill gaps or go over that cap as well.\u201d",
      "How would a collective fill a pay gap if any deal over $600 must go through the clearinghouse?",
      "\u201cThe way it\u2019s envisioned now, the athletes are responsible for reporting deals with collectives and boosters to the new enforcement entity,\u201d Winter said. \u201cProbably like now, there\u2019ll be lots of deals that don\u2019t get reported.\u201d",
      "Experts say lawsuits are a certainty, noting limits have been placed on rev-share and NIL pay without collective bargaining involving the athletes and their representatives. Because college athletes are not considered employees, collective bargaining is not required. Conferences and schools have lobbied Congress to codify the House settlement and bake in some level of antitrust protection.",
      "As the settlement is written, if the clearinghouse disallows an NIL deal, the athlete is ineligible if they go forward with it. Otherwise, they can renegotiate the deal or go to arbitration and try to show why the deal is within fair market value.",
      "Winter said the formula for determining fair market value is nebulous. He said it's his understanding the athlete's performance, social media followers and the market in which their school is located will be factors.",
      "\u201cWho\u2019s to say what\u2019s fair market value if someone wants to pay someone X?\u201d Winter said. \u201cHow can you say their fair market value is not X?\u201d",
      "As for enforcement, the power conferences are establishing an enforcement arm to oversee adherence to the salary cap and clearinghouse and levy penalties on violators.",
      "\u201cOne element that\u2019s in the background that\u2019s going to keep inserting itself into the foreground is these schools want to create a rules structure for everybody else except themselves,\" LeRoy said. \"That\u2019s always been the history of NCAA competition. We\u2019ll have a rules committee, we\u2019ll have enforcement. The underlying behavior is we find ways to shortcut the rules, spin the rules, even cheat on the rules.",
      "\"I look at this new regime as, \u2018We\u2019re setting up rules, everybody knows what the rules are.\u2019 And then everybody is thinking about how can you game it, how can you circumvent it?\u201d",

The LAFD base will remain fully operational during its visit from the Rams.",
      "\"Drafting from LAFD Air Operations is a powerful reminder of what it means to represent Los Angeles,\u201d Rams president Kevin Demoff said. \u201cSince the wildfires devastated our region in January, we have looked to bring LA together to help with the recovery efforts, raise the spirits of those impacted and shine a light on our first responders. We are humbled to partner with LAFD during one of the NFL\u2019s biggest moments to express gratitude for those who risk their lives daily to protect our city.\u201d",

      "The wildfires had a significant impact on the Rams franchise. The team's training complex in the Woodland Hills neighborhood of Los Angeles was within a few miles of the Kenneth Fire in the western end of the San Fernando Valley, and some players and team personnel had to evacuate their homes as a precaution.",
      "The fires were at their worst during the week before the start of the NFL postseason. The resulting smoke pollution and strain on public resources compelled the league to move the Rams' wild-card round home game against Minnesota to Glendale, Arizona.",
      "The Rams say they have donated nearly $2 million to fire relief efforts.

      "In 2021, the Rams began a tradition of moving their draft headquarters to a symbolic location in the Los Angeles area.

    "story": [
      "It took until the penultimate night of the regular season, but all the matchups are set for the first round of the NHL playoffs",
      "A month before NHL's playoff openers this weekend, Commissioner Gary Bettman was more than happy to defend the decision to not expand the bracket like other professional leagues around North America have done in recent years.",
      "\u201cIf you look at the races that we\u2019re having for the regular season, playoffs have started already,\u201d Bettman said then. \"We\u2019re in our play-in tournament, and I think it\u2019s terrific. What can be more compelling and exciting and entertaining than that?\u201d",
      "It took until the penultimate night of the season to lock in all 16 playoff teams and the eight first-round series.",
      "The defending Stanley Cup champion Florida Panthers open against the cross-state rival Tampa Bay Lightning. The Toronto Maple Leafs and Ottawa Senators face off in the first Battle of Ontario in more than two decades. The Dallas Stars and Colorado Avalanche collide in a matchup of two of the top three betting favorites to win it all. And Connor McDavid\u2019s Edmonton Oilers open the postseason against the Los Angeles Kings for a fourth year in a row.",
      "A look at the matchups, first in the East and then the West with division and seeding noted:",
      "The Maple Leafs and Senators last met in a playoff series in 2004. That was before the salary cap and rule changes designed to generate more offense.",
      "Along came Auston Matthews, Toronto's captain who reached 400 career goals and teammate William Nylander, who scored 45 this season. Goaltender Anthony Stolarz has won his past eight starts, three of the past four with a shutout, and the Leafs look capable of making a run if Matthews, Nylander and Mitch Marner can keep scoring.",
      "The pesky Senators are led by hard-nosed captain Brady Tkachuk. Retired Norris Trophy-winning defenseman P.K. Subban, who now works for ESPN, said the playoffs \"are tailor-made for Brady Tkachuk and his game and his mentality.\u201d",
      "Toronto is a slight series favorite, according to BetMGM Sportsbook. Ottawa has 2023 Vezina Trophy-winning goalie Linus Ullmark, and a rivalry like this has its ways of evening the scales.",
      "The Panthers have won seven of their past eight playoff series since trading for Brady's brother, Matthew Tkachuk, and hiring Paul Maurice as coach. Their only loss came to Vegas in the 2023 final when injuries took their toll, and Florida beat Edmonton last year in seven games to capture the first title in franchise history.",
      "The Lightning beating the Panthers in the second round in \u201822 led to that series of changes, and this will be the fourth Sunshine State Showdown in the past five years. Tampa Bay went through Florida in \u201921 on the way to its second of back-to-back Cup championships.",
      "Each team loaded up at the trade deadline. Florida added top-four defenseman Seth Jones and in-your-face winger Brad Marchand, while Tampa Bay picked up Yanni Gourde and Oliver Bjorkstrand, who is week to week with an injury.",
      "The difference-makers could be in net. Russian goalies Sergei Bobrovsky for the Panthers and Andrei Vasilevskiy for the Lightning have already backstopped their team to the Cup before.",
      "A rematch of the 2010 first round, when the Canadiens shocked the then-Presidents' Trophy-winning Capitals and made a surprise run to the Eastern Conference final. Washington did finish first in the East after a season that saw captain Alex Ovechkin set the career goals record.",
      "The Capitals were on cruise control much of the second half of the season but they lost starting goaltender Logan Thompson and forward Aliaksei Protas to injuries. They have not won a playoff series since hoisting the Cup in 2018.",
      "The Canadiens clinched a playoff spot in their 82nd and final game of the season. The underdogs have been red hot and can count on full and frenzied playoff crowds at the Bell Centre in Montreal for the first time since 2017.",
      "Carolina is a heavy favorite in large part because New Jersey is missing its best player, No. 1 center Jack Hughes, who underwent season-ending shoulder surgery last month.",
      "The Devils' biggest strength is their goaltending, with Jacob Markstrom filling a void in net that hasn't quite been the same since Hall of Famer Martin Brodeur. They also are expected to have top defenseman Dougie Hamilton back from his extended injury absence.",
      "Carolina does a lot of things right and defends incredibly well. The Hurricanes after some disappointing playoff exits hope they can put together a long run, though their biggest question might be in goal between Frederik Andersen and Pyotr Kochetkov.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s been, I\u2019m sure they would agree, up and down throughout the year for the goalies,\u201d captain Jordan Staal said. \u201cBut the playoffs, you just ride whoever\u2019s playing well and we\u2019re very confident with both of them. We know both can win games for us and even steal games.\u201d",
      "The Presidents' Trophy-winning Jets have been, in hockey terms, a wagon all season. They have the likely Vezina winner in goal in Connor Hellebuyck, a near-100-point producer in Kyle Connor and the kind of big, heavy game that wins this time of year.",
      "\u201cThey don\u2019t give up much,\u201d Blues captain Brayden Schenn said. \"They\u2019re a good defensive hockey team with a good goalie. It\u2019s going to be an exciting series, and we\u2019re looking forward to the challenge.\u201d",
      "St. Louis, like Montreal, got in by winning its final game of the season. The Blues were eight points out when play resumed in late February out of the 4 Nations Face-Off break, and they won 19 of 26 to qualify.",
      "Coach Jim Montgomery, hired in November to replace Drew Bannister fresh off being fired by Boston, turned things around even faster than he expected. The Blues with big-game goaltender Jordan Binnington, won't be an easy out.",
      "Under the old 1 to 8 conference playoff format, this easily could have been a West final. Instead, the Stars and Avalanche meet right away with one of them guaranteed to be going home early.",
      "\u201cLooking forward to the matchup,\u201d Colorado coach Jared Bednar said. \u201cYou\u2019ve got to get out of the gate, you\u2019ve got to play well right away and you\u2019re going to have to play your best hockey for two weeks in order to win.\u201d",
      "Both teams made significant trades this winter. Dallas acquired defenseman Cody Ceci and forward Mikael Granlund, then went even bigger by getting former Avalanche standout Mikko Rantanen from Carolina at the deadline.",
      "Colorado had traded Rantanen to the Hurricanes in January, flipping the pending free agent for younger forwards Martin Necas and Jack Drury. The Avs also added centers Brock Nelson and Charlie Coyle and brought back veteran defenseman Erik Johnson.",
      "Whoever wins this series likely becomes the Cup favorite.",
      "The Golden Knights were nearly as dominant as Winnipeg but somehow flew under the radar. Jack Eichel surpassed 90 points and showed off his defensive prowess as part of the best, most well-rounded season of his career.",
      "Vegas is only two years removed from winning the Cup. Adin Hill has grown into the starting role since, earning a long-term contract as the organization's goaltender of the present and future, and has valuable experience from 2023.",
      "Minnesota clinched the eighth and final spot in the West by tying its last game of the season with 20.9 seconds left. The Wild struggled in recent months but have scoring winger Kirill Kaprizov back healthy and might get a spark from newly signed prospect Zeev Buium.",
      "\u201cIt was up and down like crazy,\" defenseman Jake Middleton said. \"There was times we thought the world was ending. There was times we thought that we\u2019d already won the league.\u201d",
      "Yes, again. Connor McDavid, Leon Draisaitl and the Oilers won this series each of the past three years, but the defending West champs are banged up and won't have defenseman Mattias Ekholm at least for the first round because of injury. Edmonton let young Dylan Holloway and Philip Broberg go to St. Louis on offer sheets last summer and has missed that kind of play.",
      "\u201cI\u2019m sure LA and Edmonton are sick of seeing each other,\" said retired forward Paul Bissonnette, now a TNT analyst. \u201cIt's going to be tough sledding for Edmonton, especially with all that turnover they've had, so we'll see what they've got.\u201d",
      "Los Angeles is one of the hottest teams in the NHL since the trade deadline and has five 20-plus-goal scorers: Kevin Fiala, Adrian Kempe, Warren Foegele, Quinton Byfield and Anze Kopitar. Darcy Kuemper's bounce-back season gives the Kings a legit presence in net, and they have the offense to supplement a suffocating defensive system.",

      "Lee Corso's nearly four-decade run on ESPN's \u201cCollege GameDay\u201d is coming to an end.",
      "Corso, the longtime ESPN broadcaster and folksy former coach widely known for his endearing expressions and elaborate headgear picks, is set to retire after a career with the show that began in 1987, ESPN announced Thursday. His final broadcast will be Aug. 30 \u2014 Week 1 of the 2025 college football season \u2014 and the network said additional programming to celebrate Corso is also planned.",
      "\"My family and I will be forever indebted for the opportunity to be part of ESPN and \u2018College GameDay\u2019 for nearly 40 years,\u201d Corso said in a statement to ESPN. \u201cI have a treasure of many friends, fond memories and some unusual experiences to take with me into retirement.\u201d",
      "Corso, who turns 90 in August, began his popular headgear segment in October 1995 at a game at Ohio State. Since then, he has gone 286-144 in 430 selections wearing everything from helmets and mascot heads to dressing up as the Fighting Irish leprechaun from Notre Dame, the Stanford tree and historic figures James Madison and Benjamin Franklin.",
      "\u201cNot so fast, my friend\u201d is one of his most well-known comments and his good humor alongside Kirk Herbstreit, Rece Davis and Desmond Howard and many others going back more than three decades helped make Corso and the show a beloved staple for millions on college football Saturdays.",
      "Corso's career has lasted through a health scare in 2009, when he suffered a stroke that left him unable to speak for a while. He returned to \u201cCollege GameDay \u201dlater that year. Though he hasn't joined his colleagues as much on the road in recent years, Corso was at the site of last year's national title game between Ohio State and Notre Dame in Atlanta.",
      "Corso was a college and pro football coach for 28 years before transitioning to broadcasting. He coached 15 years in college at Louisville, Indiana and Northern Illinois.",

      "Interest in gymnastics traditionally peaks with the Olympic cycle, but the sport is popular all year round on the \u201cgymternet,\u201d an online global community for devoted fans",
      "WASHINGTON -- Thomas Bateman kept busy this year managing college fantasy teams in 12 different leagues, a lineup that included SECret Weapon and One and Dunne. Five of them won it all.",
      "These were not teams stocked with NFL or NBA players. All 12 were made up of college gymnasts, and the Chicago-based marriage and family therapist is just one member of a fervent and growing fan base that channels their love of the sport into fantasy leagues.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s such a great way to get to know the sport a bit,\u201d Bateman said. \u201cWhen I started off, I got these lists from College Gym News and picked athletes I didn\u2019t really know, so then I got to know teams I liked and then got familiar with athletes I want to draft. It\u2019s a great way to potentially grow the audience of the sport.\u201d",
      "Interest in gymnastics traditionally peaks with the Olympic cycle, but on the \u201cgymternet\u201d \u2013 the online global community for devoted fans \u2013 it\u2019s a year-round sport. At the college level, major growth in name, image and likeness deals, viewership and streaming availability has been accompanied by a surge in fantasy leagues, too.",
      "This year, over 7,000 women\u2019s college gymnastics devotees have found their way to the Gymlytics and GymCastic fantasy platforms \u2014 all within the last few years.",
      "Gymlytics, which launched before the 2022 collegiate season, runs through the regular season and has a postseason bracket competition. GymCastic, in its second year, offers weekly fantasy matchups, including the NCAA postseason and elite meets later in the year.",
      "The two leagues take slightly different approaches. Gymlytics participants draft individual athletes for their team at the beginning of the season and set lineups for each week of competition. GymCastic runs a salary cap-style draft, in which athletes are valued at a certain number of \u201cgym rubles.\u201d Participants select athletes until their roster is filled while staying under the cap.",
      "Neither are the first platforms of their kind: Founders of both pointed to Kristen Watkins, a former college gymnast and self-taught programmer who created and ran College Fantasy Gymnastics for the decade leading into the pandemic-canceled 2020 season, as an inspiration.",
      "Watkins competed for the MIT gymnastics team until it was cut following the 2009 season, a period in which other college gymnastics programs were cut or coming under threat of reduction. The creation of the fantasy league, she said, was motivated in part because she wanted to see if there could be more interest in women\u2019s gymnastics.",
      "Subsequent leagues have hinged on the same idea.",
      "\u201cThat\u2019s the point of everything we do: It\u2019s very, very specific to the gymnastics fans,\u201d said Jessica O\u2019Beirne, creator of the popular GymCastic podcast and a co-founder of the fantasy league of the same name. \u201cWe use the lingo of gymnastics. It\u2019s so niche and so specific.\u2033",
      "The Gymlytics audience is similarly a lot of \u201cdiehard gymnastics fans,\u201d said Lauren Pickens, a co-creator. That includes former athletes. Pickens recalled hearing from recently graduated members of the championship-winning Michigan team who had barely missed the Gymlytics draft deadline but wanted to put teams together. (She helped them join in.)",
      "Like all fantasy team managers who care about results, Bateman and other participants have their hands full. Week to week, participants set lineups across the four apparatuses \u2013 vault, uneven bars, balance beam and floor exercise \u2013 to maximize the total number of points their team scores. An injury or struggles at a weekend meet are factors in roster changes.",
      "Bateman joined Gymlytics in 2022 with friends who had been gymnasts at the University of Michigan. He named SECret Weapon after the Southeastern Conference, whose member school LSU is a repeat favorite at this week's NCAA championships in Texas. One and Dunne bears the surname of LSU gymnast and popular influencer Olivia Dunne \u2014 and the name worked in a league where each team could include just one athlete from each college.",
      "As GymCastic and Gymlytics have taken off, their creators have seen these diehard fans bring in friends and family who are less familiar with the sport.",
      "\u2033We\u2019ve gotten a lot of emails from people saying, my significant other did fantasy basketball or fantasy football and because there\u2019s a fantasy gymnastics, they wanted to connect with me and my passion so they joined a league,\u201d said GymCastic COO Steve Cooper. \u201cAnd now they\u2019re screaming at the TV like I am.\u201d",
      "According to the Fantasy Sports & Gaming Association, the number of Americans over the age of 21 participating in fantasy sports grew by about 5% between 2017 and 2022. It's been much more robust for Gymlytics, which launched its first season with 1,000 teams and, according to co-founder Yarden Tamir, had nearly 7,000 teams across 55 countries this season; and for GymCastic, which has seen over 10% growth between its first and second seasons, per Cooper.",
      "While overall fantasy sports participation skews male by about a 2:1 ratio, according to FSGA data, the Gymlytics and GymCastic founders both estimated their participants were more gender balanced.",
      "Multiple fantasy gymnastics participants and founders pointed to the 2021 and 2022 collegiate seasons as a turning point. Those seasons followed the delayed Tokyo Games and a 2021 Supreme Court decision allowing college athletes to earn endorsement money, marking the beginning of Olympics gymnasts being able to cash in and retain their NCAA eligibility.",
      "Other than Simone Biles, every member of that medal-winning Tokyo team, including alternates, went on to compete in the NCAA.",
      "\u201cOlympics is so fun but it\u2019s hard to consistently follow elite athletes because oftentimes they\u2019re only competing three or four times per year,\u201d Bateman said. NCAA gymnastics \"is fun, too, and it\u2019s such an accessible format.\u201d",
      "Accessibility has also grown as streaming networks have jumped in. According to ESPN, the three most-watched gymnastics telecasts have been the three most recent national championships. In 2022, ESPN and affiliated platforms broadcast 40 meets across five platforms; after championships this year, it will be more than 60 meets across eight.",
      "\u201cFOX bought in this year. ESPN is doing GameDay-style shows to lead into their broadcast,\u201d said Brandis Heffner, the managing editor of College Gym News and a fantasy player. \u201cGiving that option to gymnastics fans has been a fantastic way to help build the sport.\u201d",
      "Running a custom fantasy league isn\u2019t without its challenges. League officials pointed to challenges with data availability and inconsistent information across conferences and regions, including judging details.",
      "Gymlytics and GymCastic have both gotten around it by leveraging the devotion among their participants, essentially crowdsourcing scores to get them into their databases. While there are improvements to be made on both the institutional and platform sides, the fantasy league founders all expressed optimism.",
      "\u201cThere are a ton of little features we want to add and make the environment easier to use, more automated,\u201d Tamir said. \"If one actual person you don\u2019t know uses it, that\u2019s a huge win, but when thousands of users are using it on a daily basis, that\u2019s wild. We\u2019re just continuing to make that tent larger.\u201d",

      "The NCAA Playing Rules Oversight Panel gave final approval to a rule designed to discourage football players from faking injuries to stop the game clock",
      "The NCAA Playing Rules Oversight Panel gave final approval to a rule designed to discourage football players from faking injuries to stop the game clock, the NCAA announced Thursday.",
      "Beginning this season, if medical personnel go onto the field to evaluate a player with an apparent injury after the ball is spotted for the next play, that player\u2019s team will be charged a timeout. If the team does not have timeouts remaining, a 5-yard delay-of-game penalty will be assessed.",
      "Feigning injuries, sometimes at the coach\u2019s instruction, had become a tactic defenses use to slow down tempo offenses or as a way for an offense to avoid a delay-of-game penalty or get an extra timeout.",
      "The NCAA Football Rules Committee has been concerned about feigned injuries for several years. Before the 2021 season, a framework was put in place that allows a school or conference to request a postgame video review regarding questionable actions involving injuries. If it is determined a player faked an injury to manipulate the rules, the offending team\u2019s conference was notified for possible disciplinary action.",
      "A change to overtime timeouts also was approved. Beginning with a third overtime, each team will have one timeout for the duration of the game. Previously, teams were allotted one timeout for each overtime. Beginning in the third overtime, teams alternate running 2-point plays until a winner is decided.",
      "There will be change in verbiage when the decision on a video review is announced. The referee will only say that the call on the field is \u201cupheld\u201d or \u201coverturned.\u201d The terms \u201cconfirmed\u201d and \u201cstands\u201d will not be used.",
      "There also were a couple tweaks to kick and punt formations. No offensive player will be allowed in the direct line of the snap to the potential kicker or within the frame of the snapper on punts for the formation to qualify as a scrimmage kick formation. If a team is not in scrimmage kick formation, it must have five players numbered 50 through 79 on the line of scrimmage. Additionally, if the snapper is on the end of the line by formation, the snapper will lose scrimmage kick protection and the opposition can line a player over the snapper.",
      "If any player on a kickoff-return team makes a \u201cT\u201d signal with his arms during the kick, the team gives up the right to return the kick and the play will be whistled dead.",
      "No player can call defensive signals that simulate the sound or cadence of the offensive signals. The defensive terms \u201cmove\u201d and \u201cstem\u201d would be reserved for players on that side of the ball and could not be used by the offense.",
      "After the two-minute timeout in either half, if the defense has 12 or more players on the field and all the players participate in the play, the officials will administer a 5-yard penalty. The offensive team would have the option to reset the game clock back to the time at the start of the play. If the 12th player is attempting to leave the field and has no influence on the play, the defensive team will be penalized 5 yards with no adjustment to the game clock.",
      "Also, coach-to-player communication implemented for the Football Bowl Subdivision last year will be allowed in the Football Championship Subdivision.",

      "The Tennessee Titans need a quarterback, hold the No. 1 pick overall and have spent the offseason turning over every stone, rewatching tape and looking at Miami\u2019s Cam Ward up close and personal as much as possible",
      "NASHVILLE, Tenn. -- The Tennessee Titans need a quarterback, hold the No. 1 pick overall and have spent the offseason turning over every stone, rewatching tape and studying Miami's Cam Ward as much as possible.",
      "Yes, they've also looked closely at Shedeur Sanders, wide receiver and defensive back Travis Hunter and edge rusher Abdul Carter.",
      "Signing not one, but two journeyman sure makes Ward's name the one likely on the card the Titans give Commissioner Roger Goodell to kick off the first night of the NFL draft April 24 in Green Bay.",
      "If not, Tennessee has done its best to generate a trade market, needing more draft picks to fill roster holes after three straight losing seasons. New general manager Mike Borgonzi has said he's gotten calls about the No. 1 overall pick, but the Titans will need a \u201cbig haul\u201d to make a deal.",
      "Tennessee desperately needs a quarterback, somebody who can start and be a winner especially by the time their new stadium opens in 2027.",
      "This franchise has whiffed on a trio of first-round quarterbacks from Vince Young (No. 3 overall in 2006), Jake Locker (No. 8 in 2011) and Marcus Mariota (No. 2 in 2015). The Titans traded down from the No. 1 pick in 2016 two weeks before that draft because they already had Mariota.",
      "Young and Mariota each lasted five seasons. Locker retired after four seasons. Malik Willis, whom the Titans traded up to take in the third round in 2022, was traded last year, while Will Levis, the 33rd pick by the previous GM, was benched last season by first-year coach Brian Callahan.",
      "With veterans Brandon Allen and Tim Boyle signed in March, Levis appears to be trade bait with Tennessee needing to add to eight draft picks and leaving a big hole in the starting lineup. It's why Callahan said they're doing everything possible evaluating quarterbacks. More picks would be good for a team with only two within the first 35 picks and nothing in the third round.",
      "A potential franchise quarterback?",
      "\u201cIf you think they're that good and they're that type of player, those guys, to me, are priceless,\" Callahan said March 31 at the NFL owners' spring meetings. \u201cThere is no price that you can put on those type of players if you think that they are that caliber of quarterback.\u201d",
      "The Titans met with both Ward and Sanders of Colorado before the NFL talking period began just before the new league year opened. The team sent all the key front office personnel to Ward's pro day at Miami on March 24 and planned another visit before the draft. Team officials also checked out Sanders and Hunter at Colorado's pro day.",
      "Ward finished fourth in the voting for the Heisman Trophy after his lone season at Miami where he completed 67.2% of his passes for 4,313 yards with a FBS-best and program-record 39 touchdown passes. He also had only seven interceptions. His yards gained per pass attempt was a career-best 9.5 yards. That followed two seasons at Washington State where he threw for more yards and TDs in each season while dropping his interceptions from nine in 2022 to seven in 2023.",
      "The 6-foot-2, 219-pound Ward did his best to make his case at Miami's pro day. He completed one pass on the run, then told the Titans' top officials, \u201cI'm solidifying it today ... I made sure they heard me.\u201d",
      "Edge rusher remains a big need after Harold Landry III was released after leading the Titans with nine sacks last season to create salary cap space. So was cornerback Chidobe Awuzie. Wide receiver depth behind Calvin Ridley remains a big question. Defensive backs depth always is in demand.",
      "The Titans can wait to add offensive linemen after signing Dan Moore, expected to take over at left tackle with JC Latham sliding over after his rookie year to the right side. They also signed Kevin Zeitler to a one-year deal as a new right guard hoping to improve the offensive line after Tennessee allowed 52 sacks in the 2024 season. Only Houston, Seattle, Cleveland and Chicago gave up more.",
      "Ward. At this point, he makes the most sense for a quarterback-needy team.",

      "Here's what to know about the upcoming matches and the four semifinalists:",
      "Arsenal hosts Paris Saint-Germain on April 29 in north London, where defending champion Madrid lost by a stunning 3-0 last week in the first leg of the quarterfinals. PSG hosts the return game on May 7 at Parc des Princes, which has hosted three finals including the inaugural European Cup in 1956.",
      "Five-time champion Barcelona hosts the first leg on April 30 at the 1992 Olympics stadium. Inter hosts the second leg on May 6 at San Siro.",
      "The winners head to Munich on May 31 for the final of the most coveted and toughest title to win in club soccer.",
      "Coach Mikel Arteta\u2019s team has been solid all season, including facing PSG and Inter in the first half of the eight-game league program. Arsenal finished third in the new phase with six wins \u2014 including 2-0 against PSG in London \u2014 and one draw. Its only loss was at Inter 1-0.",
      "It easily overcame PSV Eindhoven in the round of 16 after a 7-1 rout in the first leg. Arsenal then stunned many with a 3-0 win at home against Real Madrid in the quarterfinals and finished the job on Wednesday with a controlled 2-1 win at Madrid.",
      "Arsenal is second in the Premier League but far behind leader Liverpool, so the Champions League is the only realistic chance it has left to win a title this season.",
      "PSG was at risk of being eliminated in the league phase but its campaign turned in the penultimate round when it bounced back from a 2-0 deficit to hand Manchester City a devastating 4-2 loss.",
      "Crucially, new signing from Napoli Khvicha Kvaratskhelia was added for the knockout rounds. Brest was demolished 10-0 in the playoffs and the Georgia winger was scintillating in the round of 16 against Liverpool. PSG and Liverpool traded 1-0 wins on the road, and a penalty shootout at Anfield was decided by goalkeeper Gianluigi Donnarumma\u2019s two saves.",
      "PSG\u2019s third visit to England this season was this week\u2019s 3-2 loss at Aston Villa. Donnarumma\u2019s saves kept out a fourth goal that would have forced extra time. PSG advanced thanks to a 3-1 win at home last week.",
      "PSG has already clinched Ligue 1. It now hopes to achieve what it failed to accomplish when France star Kylian Mbapp\u00e9 led the team: Winning the Champions League.",
      "Barcelona won four of its five European titles in a nine-year spell from 2006-15, mostly inspired by Lionel Messi, and has not been back to the final since.",
      "The team scored 28 goals in the league phase and added nine more in four knockout games. Robert Lewandowski, still prolific at age 36, has 11 goals and trails teammate Raphinha with 12. Lamine Yamal, outrageously good aged just 17, has four goals and three assists.",
      "Barcelona started with a blip in its first Champions League game under coach Hansi Flick, losing at Monaco 2-1, then romped unbeaten through the rest of the league phase: 4-1 against Bayern \u2014 which Flick led to the 2020 title \u2014 3-2 at Borussia Dortmund, and a wild 5-4 at Benfica.",
      "In the knockout rounds, Barcelona beat Benfica two more times, then met Dortmund again in the quarterfinals. A 4-0 win at home allowed the luxury of losing the return 3-1.",
      "Barcelona, like Inter, must balance preparing for the semifinals with staying top in a tight domestic title race and chasing the domestic cup.",
      "The hardest defense to breach, with just one goal conceded in the league phase by the three-time European champion.",
      "The tone was set in the opening game, a rematch of the 2023 final. A 0-0 draw at Man City was impressive in September before the English champion\u2019s aura collapsed.",
      "A series of 1-0 wins was broken up by losing by the same score at Bayer Leverkusen, on a 90th-minute goal by Nordi Mukiele. It was the only one to beat Inter goalkeeper Yann Sommer until Feyenoord scored a penalty in the second leg of the round of 16.",
      "Inter impressed in winning at Bayern 2-1 last week in the first leg of the quarterfinals, then responded quickly when Harry Kane tied the scores early in the second half at San Siro. The lead was restored by Lautaro Mart\u00ednez, Inter\u2019s talisman with eight Champions League goals.",
      "Inter beat Barcelona in the semis when last winning the Champions League in 2010.",

      "\u201cWe wanted to do the tribute last year, to be transparent, but he refused at the time,\u201d Mauresmo said. \u201cHe wasn\u2019t sure that it was his last Roland Garros. Now that he is retired, he is happy to receive it.\u201d",
      "Nadal holds the record for the most French Open titles with 14. His last appearance at the tournament was in 2024 when he lost to Alexander Zverev in the first round.",

We have a strong history together,\u201d said Gilles Moretton, president of the French Tennis Federation. \u201cAm\u00e9lie and I went to see him not long ago because we wanted to do something important for him. We still had some frustration from last year.\u201d",
      "Organizers also plan to build on the success of the 2024 Paris Olympics by setting up a fan zone with giant screens showing matches. Located at Place de la Concorde in central Paris, the venue will be free and open to up to 5,000 fans.",

      "His phone kept buzzing on the way to Hilton Head Island, one text after another, all of them with the same message that applauded his remarkable rally and offered commiseration and condolences for his runner-up finish to Rory McIlroy.",
      "Rose started the final round seven shots out of the lead, too far back to think about winning. He made a 20-foot birdie putt on the 18th for a 66. He was in a sudden-death playoff. He lost on a great shot by McIlroy, who hit gap wedge to 3 feet for birdie.",
      "It was a lot to process.",
      "\u201cA lot of outpouring from people with a lot of positive comments coming at me, so trying to absorb that, trying to absorb the week,\u201d Rose said Wednesday at the RBC Heritage. \u201cBut at the same time, looking at my phone and just wishing there was a different message there.\u201d",
      "This is a path he knows well.",
      "Rose had a two-shot lead with six holes to play in the 2017 Masters when Sergio Garcia \u2014 like McIlroy, a good friend \u2014 made a most improbable rally to force a playoff and beat Rose on the first extra hole.",
      "Rose was classy in defeat that day in 2017. He lovingly patted Garcia's cheek, they embraced, and then Rose tapped Garcia on the heart. He knew what it meant for a talented Spaniard who had played 70 majors before winning.",
      "He was equally gracious on Sunday, telling McIlroy when it was over he was happy to witness such a momentous occasion of the career Grand Slam.",
      "It still hurts.",
      "He searched for the right words. Rose was proud of how he played to match the low score of the final round with a 66. In one of those must-make moments in a major, he poured in a birdie on the last hole. There was a lot that went right. But there was no green jacket.",
      "\u201cJust sort of ... don't know what the right word is,\u201d he said. \u201cTormented, probably, by the thought of what might have been.\u201d",
      "He joined Ben Hogan as the only player to lose a playoff twice at the Masters, and it might have stung worse for Rose because both his losses were in sudden-death. He now has had at least a share of the lead after 12 rounds at the Masters, fourth on the list behind Jack Nicklaus (19), Arnold Palmer (18) and Gary Player (12), who have combined to win 13 green jackets.",
      "He has 23 wins worldwide, including a major at the U.S. Open and an Olympic gold medal in Rio de Janeiro. He also has the distinction of congratulating a Masters champion on the 18th green three times in the last 10 years \u2014 Jordan Spieth in 2015, Garcia in 2017, McIlroy on Sunday.",
      "The last time he lost the Masters in a playoff, Rose said it lingered for about a month. Sure, he made a few bogeys he'd like to have back from the final round Sunday. That's true for anyone at any golf tournament. There's still the sting of seeing someone else win.",
      "Rose would rather look back to what followed after that 2017 loss. He went on to win three more times that year, including his second World Golf Championships title. He won the FedEx Cup the following year and rose to No. 1 in the world for the first time.",
      "\u201cIf I look back to my best golf, 2017 August through to the end of '18 is probably the most consistently good golf that I\u2019ve ever played,\u201d Rose said. \u201cObviously, I was a little bit more in the prime of my career around that time, or you could argue more prime.\u201d",
      "Rose, who turned pro as a teenager in 1998, will be 45 at the end of July.",
      "\u201cBut I don\u2019t see any reason why that can\u2019t be the same this time around,\" he said. \u201cI'm working well. I'm working hard. I'm feeling good about my game. I've been saying all year that my game is good. I've just got to make sure that I\u2019m playing consistently well enough to give myself those opportunities, because majors come around ... only four times a year.\u201d",
      "Rose can't help but think how little it would take for him to be going to the PGA Championship next month at Quail Hollow with a shot at the career Grand Slam himself \u2014 briefly tied for the Sunday lead at Royal Troon, a playoff loss at the Masters.",
      "\u201cThe last two majors I\u2019ve been right there and been beaten by the top players in the world at the peak of their game,\u201d he said.",
      "What keeps him going at this stage? He will have completed his 28th year as a pro in July.",
      "It's moments like Sunday, being in the thick of it, delivering clutch moments. There was the birdie putt on the 18th at Augusta. There was that 8-foot putt on the 18th hole at the Ryder Cup in 2023 that earned a key halve. There was that walk up the 18th at Royal Troon last summer with thousands on their feet showing appreciation.",
      "\u201cI\u2019m close to kind of some seriously good stuff,\u201d Rose said.",

      "The 42-year-old Dominican, who appeared in eight All-Star Games, played in the United States for five franchises, among them the New York Yankees. He was a key player to lead Diablos Rojos to the championship last season and he recently agreed to return for a second one.",
      "Thorough his career, Can\u00f3 has played for the Dominican Republic's Estrellas Orientales and participated in several Caribbean Series, a team tournament played each year in different countries around Mexico and Central America.",
      "\u201cThe atmosphere in Mexico is somewhat like the Caribbean Series, but in there you are playing for your country and it is short tournament,\u201d Cano said. \u201cHere, it's a long season and yet the fans are still there every night.\u201d",
      "Las season, the Diablos Rojos topped the average attendance in the league with 11,694, followed by Toros de Tijuana (11,354) and Sultanes de Monterrey (9,092).",
      "Soccer clubs Pachuca (10,713), Santos Torreon (9,421), Mazatlan (9,522) and Ciudad Juarez (8,980) have worse attendance despite playing in bigger stadiums. The team with the best attendance in the Mexican soccer league is Monterrey with 43,544.",
      "\u201cWe have a great group of owners even though they are rivals on the field. Off it they work as allies and share all kinds of things, from how to clean bathrooms, how to have better food courts and even to sell beer,\u201d De la Vega said.",
      "Mexico City has three soccer stadiums: Ciudad de los Deportes, Olimpico Universitario and Azteca, but none of them has great facilities. There are no elevators, escalators or even food courts. Azteca is currently closed for renovations and might have them for the 2026 World Cup.",
      "The same thing happens in most of the other Liga MX stadiums. The most fan friendly venues are Estadio BBVA in Monterrey and the Akron in Guadalajara. Both were chosen to host games in the next World Cup.",
      "\u201cWe have been growing steadily and this being a special season we are aiming at a record 5 million fans in total attendance,\u201d De la Vega said.",
      "After the World Baseball Classic in 2023, 4.734 million fans set the league attendance record for a season. Last year, the number dipped, but only by 93,000 fans.",
      "And the fans are getting younger, too. According to Othon Diaz, the Diablos Rojos president, nine years ago 53% of the team\u2019s fans were 55 years or older and now 74% of them are under 45. Also, they averaged 3,000 fans per game and now it\u2019s up to 11,000.",

      "MILWAUKEE -- As he discusses his excitement about finally being healthy for the start of a postseason run, Milwaukee Bucks forward Giannis Antetokounmpo compares himself to a certain action movie star.",
      "\u201cI love playing in, how can I say, pressure, stressful situations,\u201d Antetokounmpo said this week as the Bucks prepare to open the playoffs Saturday at Indiana. \u201cI\u2019m like Tom Cruise. Have you ever seen the movies, the Tom Cruise movies that he does all the stunts? I think he gets an adrenaline rush. I love being there again.\u201d",
      "After missing all of Milwaukee\u2019s postseason run last year and part of it the year before \u2014 with his absence leading to consecutive first-round exits \u2014 Antetokounmpo is back to lead the Bucks as he pursues his second career title.",
      "If it\u2019s not quite a mission impossible, it certainly seems improbable.",
      "The Bucks are expected to open the playoffs without seven-time all-NBA guard Damian Lillard, who has been out for the last month with deep vein thrombosis in his right calf. The Bucks are seeded fifth in the Eastern Conference, their lowest playoff position since 2018. BetMGM Sportsbook gives the Bucks only a 37% chance of even getting past their first-round series with the fourth-seeded Pacers.",
      "Yet the Bucks believe they can compete with anyone as long as Antetokounmpo is available. They remember how much the two-time MVP's absence was felt last year in their 4-2 series loss to Indiana.",
      "\u201cLet\u2019s be honest,\u201d Bucks coach Doc Rivers said. \u201cTake the best player off of every team and it hurts them. Take one of the best players of our generation off your team, it\u2019s going to crush you. It\u2019s just nice having him on the floor.\u201d",
      "Antetokounmpo, 30, missed last year\u2019s Indiana series after straining his left calf in the 79th game of the regular season. A year earlier, he bruised his lower back in the first quarter of Milwaukee\u2019s opening playoff game against Miami and didn\u2019t return to action until Game 4 of a series the top-seeded Bucks eventually lost 4-1.",
      "At the end of last season, Antetokounmpo said he\u2019d have to ponder changing his offseason program or make other adaptations to assure he\u2019d stay healthy for the playoffs. He now enters the playoffs in peak form after leading Milwaukee to an eight-game winning streak to close the regular season.",
      "\u201cI made a lot of adjustments \u2014 that I\u2019ll keep private \u2014 but luck definitely plays a role, too,\u201d Antetokounmpo said. \u201cYou can be unlucky. Going down three games, or six games, I don\u2019t even remember, before the playoffs last year, that\u2019s being unlucky. But yeah, I think we made a lot of adjustments, me and my team, and I\u2019m here today, so I\u2019m happy.\u201d",
      "The last time Antetokounmpo played in an entire playoff series, he had 33.9 points, 14.7 rebounds and 7.1 assists per game in the Bucks\u2019 4-3 Eastern Conference semifinal loss to Boston in 2022. He became the first player in NBA history to collect 200 points, 100 rebounds and 50 assists in a single playoff series.",
      "A year before that, Antetokounmpo missed the final two games of the Eastern Conference finals with a hyperextended left knee but came back to earn NBA Finals MVP honors and score 50 points in a title-clinching Game 6 victory over the Phoenix Suns.",
      "Now he\u2019s back and leading a new-look Bucks roster.",
      "Antetokounmpo, Brook Lopez, Bobby Portis and Pat Connaughton are the only players remaining from Milwaukee\u2019s 2021 championship team. Kyle Kuzma, acquired at the trade deadline, was on the Los Angeles Lakers\u2019 2020 championship team but last made the playoffs in 2021. Kevin Porter Jr. and Ryan Rollins, whose roles expanded due to Lilllard's health issues, have never played in a postseason game.",
      "Lillard's absence has resulted in more ball-handling responsibilities for Antetokounmpo, who has been playing particularly well even by his lofty standards.",
      "The 6-11 forward ended the regular season ranked second in scoring (30.4), sixth in rebounding (11.9) and 13th in assists (6.5). Antetokounmpo is the only player ever to average 30 points while shooting at least 60% from the floor, and he\u2019s done that each of the last two seasons.",
      "In the six games he\u2019s played this month, Antetokounmpo has averaged 31.8 points, 12 rebounds and 11.8 assists while recording four triple-doubles.",
      "\u201cDuring this period where Dame has been out, he\u2019s been seeing consistent double teams, so he\u2019s just continued to evolve as a great player,\u201d Pacers coach Rick Carlisle said. \u201cHe\u2019s mixing in the assist, the laser passes, the skip passes cross-court which are very difficult to deal with when you\u2019re double-teaming him, and his shooting has gotten better and better.\u201d",
      "Now he gets a chance to try carrying that over to the postseason, a stage he missed dearly last year.",
      "\u201cWatching the game on the bench is not fun,\u201d Antetokounmpo said. \u201cIt\u2019s not fun. Maybe in 20 years, I can put on a polo or a suit \u2014 I don\u2019t know what the coaches wear \u2014 and watch it from the bench. But now I\u2019m just happy that I\u2019m out there and I\u2019m in the heat of the battle and I\u2019m able to get my hands dirty and help my team win.\u201d",

      "That number was up from 54 in 2023, 44 in 2022, 16 in 2021 and 19 in 2020.",
      "There have been more older prospects drafted in recent years because the COVID-19 pandemic gave players an option to stay in school an extra year. Even though the window is ending, the transfer portal and NIL deals might continue to keep some players in school longer.",
      "Teams used to shy away from older prospects. Scouts and general managers once considered the age of 24 a red flag in some cases.",
      "But the success of guys like Nix and Jayden Daniels, who turned 24 during an outstanding rookie season, shows that experience can help players make an immediate impact in the pros.",
      "\u201cI came from BYU, where kids go on missions for a couple years, and so people go: \u2018Well, they\u2019re too old,'\u201d Chiefs coach Andy Reid said. \u201cWell, then they come in and they do a pretty good job. So, and really, if you start taking averages of careers, career length, there\u2019s maybe a cutoff somewhere, but the careers aren\u2019t very long as it is. But we do look at (age), though.\"",
      "A majority of the older players selected in the draft last year were Day 3 picks, going in the sixth or seventh round. That indicates teams are more likely to overlook age later in the draft.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s just unique to where we\u2019re at right now in kind of the football world,\u201d Raiders general manager John Spytek said. \u201cYou got guys with sixth and seventh years really, and so you\u2019ve got to talk about a value of are we going to have a problem with the 25- or 26-year-old? Some people have more problems with that. I\u2019m just looking for good football players, and I\u2019m trying to impress that upon our scouts, too. Let\u2019s just find good football players. We\u2019ll figure it out. So I will say it\u2019s been really hard on the area scouts.",
      "\u201cYou go into these schools like Georgia and Michigan, Ohio State, and they\u2019ve got a list of 30 guys that can potentially come out. ... I mean it used to just be like here\u2019s these 10 juniors, maybe half of them come out. Now it\u2019s like, you got a fourth-year, fifth-year senior, and he might take another year. So it adds a lot more names to it and uncertainty and a lot more work that has to get done in a finite amount of time. And that\u2019s why the scouts\u2019 jobs are so critical to go through all that in an efficient way and present the players the right way. We\u2019re relying on it. It\u2019s critical to every organization.\u201d",
      "The number of older players drafted will decrease this season. There are 46 players age 23 or older who are draft eligible, including 17 who are 24 or older.",
      "Louisville quarterback Tyler Shough, who turns 26 in September, was the oldest player at the scouting combine. He spent seven years at three colleges, including Oregon, where he backed up Justin Herbert in 2019, and Texas Tech.",
      "Tennessee wide receiver Bru McCoy, San Jose State wideout Nick Nash and Arkansas receiver Andrew Armstrong were among the 24-year-old draft prospects at the combine.",
      "Teams that stick to the old philosophy of avoiding older players limit their talent pool.",
      "\u201cI think sometimes you have to ask yourself, are you trying to get this guy for 12 years? If you\u2019re looking for that, it\u2019s a small percentage,\u201d 49ers general manager John Lynch said. \u201cOr are you looking for one contract and then hopefully more? It\u2019s an interesting topic. It\u2019s one we constantly discuss. There are pluses and minuses to both sides. Having a young guy that you think you can develop and is already a good player, and then a guy who\u2019s a little more battle-tested ... bent through a little more. It\u2019s an interesting conversation.\u201d",
      "College experience is most valuable for quarterbacks. Nix and Daniels proved it last year when they led their teams to the playoffs. Meanwhile, Anthony Richardson threw just 393 passes in college before the Colts drafted him No. 4 overall in 2023. He has struggled to adjust at the NFL level.",
      "The oldest player ever selected in the draft was quarterback Chris Weinke. He was 28 years and 264 days old when the Panthers selected him in the fourth round of the 2000 draft. Weinke started just 20 games in the NFL, going 2-18.",
      "Quarterback Brandon Weeden was the oldest player ever drafted in the first round. He was 28 years and 195 days old when the Browns chose him 22nd overall in 2012. Weeden made 25 starts, going 6-19. Both Weinke and Weeden played minor-league baseball before college football.",
      "Depending on the position of a player and the round, age can be a determining factor when a team is choosing between two guys.",
      "\u201cWhen two players are level, even, same grade, you start weighing what they have,\u201d Chargers general manager Joe Hortiz said about age. \u201cOK, he\u2019s a three-year starter and he\u2019s a four-year starter. Great leader, team captain, those little things give them a bump. It\u2019s not intentional but you talk through it and it shakes out that way.\u201d",

      "The Bruins had topped 100 points in each of the six previous non-pandemic years, including a record-setting 135-point 2022-23 campaign that was the best regular season in NHL history. But since losing in the 2019 Stanley Cup Final, they haven\u2019t made it past the second round of the playoffs; they have won only one series in the last four years.",
      "That led to the firing of first Bruce Cassidy, and then Jim Montgomery, who was let go 20 games into this season and replaced with Joe Sacco. But the interim coach could only manage a 25-30-7 record the rest of the way \u2014 last in the Atlantic Division, and no better than tied for last in the whole Eastern Conference.",

      "\u201cIt\u2019s been pretty busy since the change,\u201d said the 56-year-old suburban Boston native, who played at Boston University before a 13-year NHL career.",

But I\u2019m proud of the guys. I know there\u2019s been a lot of moving parts this year and they haven\u2019t quit \u2014 right to the end.\u201d",
      "Pastrnak led the team with 43 goals and 63 assists, and his 106 points were nearly twice as many as his nearest teammate. With Charlie McAvoy and Hampus Lindholm injured, there wasn\u2019t much help on defense.",
      "And Jeremy Swayman struggled after signing an eight-year, $66 million contract and ending his holdout two days before the season opener.",
      "\u201cThe major takeaway is just finding a way to win. And no matter how we do it, we have to compete every single day,\u201d Swayman said. \u201cWe\u2019re a proud program. And we owe it to ourselves \u2014 really to our fans \u2014 to be a lot better. And I\u2019m excited for for the comeback.\u201d",

Some transferred to new schools to seek roster spots and enhanced opportunities for athletic competition. ... while implementing a \u2018grandfather\u2019 provision might benefit some athletes, it would, at the same time, upset the settled expectations, enrollment decisions and other preparations of numerous other student-athletes and member institutions.\u201d",
      "Wilken has already granted preliminary approval of the settlement. In addition to asking for Monday's adjustments from attorneys on both sides of the case, Wilken has asked for objectors to respond to the new brief on Tuesday.",
      "Attorneys expect her final decision on the settlement to come in a matter of weeks, with the July 1 deadline bearing down.",
      "In what was supposed to be the final hearing a week ago, more than a dozen athletes and their lawyers outlines their objections to to the terms.",
      "Of all the arguments over the deal, which sets a template for schools to pay athletes directly for use of their name, image and likeness and outlines $2.78 billion in back pay to athletes who played before NIL, those about roster limits appeared to make the biggest impact on Wilken.",
      "Under current rules, schools must adhere to a scholarship limit in each sport, but there are no roster limits. There are spots for walk-ons and partial scholarship recipients, all of whom can later qualify for aid.",
      "The new rules propose roster limits and make everyone eligible for scholarships. It could increase the total amount of aid available but is expected to cost athletes thousands of roster spots across the country as schools look to cut expenses to absorb higher costs.",
      "One example: Some women's swim teams currently divide 14 scholarships among 40 or more athletes. Under the new rules, most rosters would be capped at 30, but all those players could receive full rides.",
      "Wilken said figuring out a way to delay implementation wouldn't be that expensive and \u201cwould save a lot of good will and angst and unhappiness from a lot of students and their parents, so why not just do it?\u201d",
      "In their filing, attorneys said it would be too \u201cunworkable,\u201d with athletes perhaps seeking to start over after making a change: \u201cAnd every additional \u2018round\u2019 of re-dos permitted would create a new set of potentially affected student-athletes who might want re-dos themselves; with thousands if not more individual decisions having been made on the understanding the roster limits would likely go in effect in less than three months.\u201d",
      "The brief also argued that one of the most overlooked parts of the roster limits is how much more aid would go to athletes.",
      "\u201cIndeed, while it is unfortunate that a small number of athletes may ultimately have lost roster spots as a result of the settlement, the settlement afforded them an opportunity to compete for scholarships (or larger scholarships) and additional compensation and benefits that were not previously available,\u201d they attorneys wrote.",
      "The brief sought to address other concerns of the judge:",
      "\u2014 By agreeing to clarify that future Division I athletes -- they are covered under the 10-year term of the settlement even if they are not yet in college -- will have a chance to object to the deal and not release any claims until they have a chance to be heard or until their 60-day objection window ends. The defendants are hoping to avoid an endless series of court challenges over the same issues of athlete compensation.",
      "\u201cCollege sports would be entirely unmanageable if individual future college athletes (or groups of future athletes) pursued different types of injunctive relief year over year over year,\u201d the filing said. The settlement \u201cworks only if it is durable and applicable to all current and future class members.\u201d",
      "\u2014 By addressing what some objectors said were glitches in the system athletes use to calculate damages claims and asking the judge to OK a claims extension to May 16. A week ago, LSU gymnast and influencer Olivia Dunne told Wilken that the settlement hardly acknowledges her true value and potential earning power; the Monday filing said she would be among those receiving an updated allocation.",

      "\u201cMany of the turtle populations have come back, though some haven\u2019t,\u201d said Duke ecologist Stuart Pimm, who was not involved with the research. \u201cOverall, the sea turtle story is one of the real conservation success stories.\"",
      "The study looked at 48 populations of sea turtles around the world. Scientists measured the impacts of threats such as hunting, pollution, coastal development and climate change to the marine animals. In more than half of the areas studied, threats are declining overall, the study found.",
      "But there are some exceptions. Sea turtle populations in the Atlantic Ocean are more likely to be recovering than those in Pacific waters. And leatherback turtles are not faring as well as other species.",
      "Globally, leatherbacks are considered vulnerable to extinction, but many groups are critically endangered, according to the International Union for Conservation of Nature.",
      "All seven of the regions where leatherbacks are found face high environmental risks, said study co-author Bryan Wallace, a wildlife ecologist at Ecolibrium in Colorado.",
      "Leatherback turtles are famous for making the longest known marine migrations of any animal \u2013 with some individuals swimming as many as 3,700 miles (5,955 kilometers) each way. That feat moves them through a wide swath of regions and may expose them to unique risks, he said.",
      "Meanwhile, green turtles are still considered endangered globally, but their populations show signs of recovery in many regions of the world, researchers found.",
      "\u201cBy ending commercial harvests and allowing them time to rebound, their populations are now doing really well\u201d in coastal waters off many regions of Mexico and the U.S., said co-author Michelle Mar\u00eda Early Capistr\u00e1n, a Stanford University researcher who has conducted fieldwork in both countries.",

      "Around the world, the problem of sea turtles dying after accidentally becoming entangled in fishing gear remains a major threat, said Wallace. New technologies are being developed to spare turtles, but they must be accepted and used regularly by diverse fishing communities to be effective, he added.",

      "While commonplace globally, such automation is a complex feat in Cuba due to the island\u2019s frequent power cuts and a lack of modern technology.",

Habitat destruction is the biggest cause of extinction, said Noah Greenwald, endangered species director at the Center for Biological Diversity.",
      "The U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service and National Marine Fisheries Service said in a proposed rule issued Wednesday that habitat modification should not be considered harm because it's not the same as intentionally targeting a species, called \u201ctake.\u201d Environmentalists argue that the definition of \u201ctake,\u201d though, has always included actions that harm species, and the definition of \u201charm\u201d has been upheld by the Supreme Court.",

      "Meta CEO Mark Zuckerberg is emphasizing that he bought Instagram and WhatsApp because he liked the companies \u2014 not to cut competition as the Federal Trade Commission alleges in a historic antitrust trial",
      "WASHINGTON -- Meta CEO Mark Zuckerberg emphasized in federal court on Wednesday that he bought Instagram and WhatsApp because he saw value in the companies \u2014 not to take out competitors, as the Federal Trade Commission alleges in a historic antitrust trial.",
      "Zuckerberg took the stand for the third day in the trial, wrapping up his testimony as the first witness Wednesday afternoon. He took questions from Meta attorney Mark Hansen, who has argued that his client hardly has a monopoly in social media, as the FTC claims, and still faces stiff global competition.",
      "Hansen focused some of his questioning on emails sent by Zuckerberg and his associates that the FTC cited in earlier testimony to illustrate the Facebook founder's alarm over the growth of Instagram and his sense that he needed to neutralize its threat.",
      "Zuckerberg said he\u2019s very focused on inventing new things, and understanding what other people are creating is a big part of the process. At any given point in his company\u2019s history, he said, similar tones of concern could be found in emails about what other companies were doing better than his.",
      "\u201cThis is my job,\" Zuckerberg said. \"I need to understand what is going on, and I need to push our teams to move quickly\u201d to learn about what is going on in a very competitive market.",
      "Hansen questioned Zuckerberg about competition, particularly from TikTok, the popular social media site owned by Beijing-based company ByteDance, and the the growth of the video-sharing platform YouTube, which is owned by Alphabet.",
      "Zuckerberg testified that people spend more time on YouTube than on Facebook and Instagram combined.",
      "While Hansen noted that the FTC doesn't consider YouTube to be a Meta competitor \u2014 because it doesn't have the same friend-sharing technology as Facebook \u2014 Zuckerberg said YouTube has built in ways to share videos.",
      "The FTC contends Meta has used a monopoly in its technology that facilitates connecting with friends and family to generate enormous profits as consumer satisfaction has dropped. The case could force the tech giant to break off Instagram and WhatsApp, startups it bought more than a decade ago that have since grown into social media powerhouses.",
      "Daniel Matheson, the FTC's attorney who questioned Zuckerberg, has repeatedly brought up his own words in emails to associates before and after the acquisition of Instagram to try to show Zuckerberg was more interested halting Instagram's alarming growth than improving the product.",
      "Under questioning by Hansen, Zuckerberg insisted that he had no intention of acquiring Instagram only to slow its development and end a threat. He said the focus was on \"having it run as an independent brand.\u201d",
      "Hansen noted that the FTC is making similar claims about the acquisition of the messaging app WhatsApp: that Zuckerberg was afraid of the company's potential.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s something I thought about,\" Zuckerberg said, noting the app's formidable capabilities, but he added that he later learned not to be worried because the owners didn't share the same vision or direction.",
      "He said his interest in buying it was \u201cthe usage of it.\u201d",
      "\u201cI thought the app was important and valuable,\u201d Zuckerberg said.",
      "The trial, which is slated to last weeks, will feature other Big-Tech figures. After Zuckerberg, Sheryl Sandberg, Facebook's former chief operating officer, took the stand.",
      "The trial is one of the first big tests of President Donald Trump\u2019s FTC\u2019s ability to challenge Big Tech. The lawsuit was filed against Meta \u2014 then called Facebook \u2014 in 2020, during Trump\u2019s first term. It claims the company bought Instagram and WhatsApp to squash competition and establish an illegal monopoly in the social media market.",
      "Facebook bought Instagram \u2014 which was a photo-sharing app with no ads \u2014 for $1 billion in 2012.",

    "story": [
      "The speed and scope of the federal government\u2019s efforts to terminate the legal status of international students have stunned colleges and universities across the country",
      "WASHINGTON -- At first, the bar association for immigration attorneys began receiving inquiries from a couple students a day. These were foreigners studying in the U.S., and they'd discovered in early April their legal status had been terminated with little notice. To their knowledge, none of the students had committed a deportable offense.",
      "In recent days, the calls have begun flooding in. Hundreds of students have been calling to say they have lost legal status, seeking advice on what to do next.",
      "\u201cWe thought it was going to be something that was unusual,\u201d said Matthew Maiona, a Boston-based immigration attorney who is getting about six calls a day from panicked international students. \u201cBut it seems now like it\u2019s coming pretty fast and furious.\u201d",
      "The speed and scope of the federal government's efforts to terminate the legal status of international students have stunned colleges across the country. Few corners of higher education have been untouched, as schools ranging from prestigious private universities, large public research institutions and tiny liberal arts colleges discover status terminations one after another among their students.",
      "At least 600 students at more than 90 colleges and universities have had their visas revoked or their legal status terminated in recent weeks, according to an Associated Press review of university statements and correspondence with school officials. Advocacy groups collecting reports from colleges say hundreds more students could be caught up in the crackdown.",
      "Around 1.1 million international students were in the United States last year \u2014 a source of essential revenue for tuition-driven colleges. International students are not eligible for federal financial aid, and their ability to pay tuition often factors into whether they will be admitted to American schools. Often, they pay full price.",
      "Many of the students losing their legal status are from India and China, which together account for more than half the international students at American colleges. But the terminations have not been limited to those from any one part of the world, lawyers said.",
      "Four students from two Michigan universities are suing Trump administration officials after their F-1 student status was terminated last week. Their attorney with the American Civil Liberties Union, Ramis Wadood, said the students never received a clear reason why.",
      "\u201cWe don\u2019t know, and that\u2019s the scary part,\u201d he said.",
      "The students were informed of the terminations by their universities via email, which came as a shock, Wadood said. The reason given was that there was a \u201ccriminal records check and/or that their visa was revoked,\u201d Wadood said, but none of them were charged or convicted of crimes. Some had either speeding or parking tickets, but one didn\u2019t have any, he said. Only one of the students had known their entry visa was revoked, Wadood said.",
      "Students have filed similar lawsuits in several other states, arguing they were denied due process.",
      "In New Hampshire, a federal judge last week granted a temporary restraining order to restore the status of a Ph.D. student at Dartmouth College, Xiaotian Liu, while he challenges the revocation of his visa.",
      "At many colleges, officials learned the legal immigration status of some international students had been terminated when staff checked a database managed by the Department of Homeland Security. In the past, college officials say, legal statuses typically were updated after colleges told the government the students were no longer studying at the school.",
      "The system to track enrollment and movements of international students came under the control of Immigration and Customs Enforcement after 9/11, said Fanta Aw, CEO of NAFSA, an association of international educators. She said recent developments have left students fearful of how quickly they can be on the wrong side of enforcement.",
      "\u201cYou don\u2019t need more than a small number to create fear,\u201d Aw said. \u201cThere\u2019s no clarity of what are the reasons and how far the reach of this is.\u201d",
      "Her group says as many as 1,300 students have lost visas or had their status terminated, based on reports from colleges.",
      "The Department of Homeland Security and State Department did not respond to messages seeking comment.",
      "Foreigners who are subject to removal proceedings are usually sent a notice to appear in immigration court on a certain date, but lawyers say affected students have not received any notices, leaving them unsure of next steps to take.",
      "Some schools have told students to leave the country to avoid the risk of being detained or deported. But some students have appealed the terminations and stayed in the United States while those are processed.",
      "Still others caught in legal limbo aren't students at all. They had remained in the U.S. post-graduation on \u201coptional practical training,\u201d a one-year period \u2014 or up to three for science and technology graduates \u2014 that allows employment in the U.S. after completing an academic degree. During that time, a graduate works in their field and waits to receive their H-1B or other employment visas if they wish to keep working in the U.S.",
      "Around 242,000 foreigners in the U.S. are employed through this \u201coptional practical training.\u201d About 500,000 are pursuing graduate degrees, and another 342,000 are undergraduate students.",
      "Among the students who have filed lawsuits is a Georgia Tech Ph.D. student who is supposed to graduate on May 5, with a job offer to join the faculty. His attorney Charles Kuck said the student was likely targeted for termination because of an unpaid traffic fine from when the student lent his car to a friend. Ultimately, the violation was dismissed.",
      "\u201cWe have case after case after case exactly like that, where there is no underlying crime,\u201d said Kuck, who is representing 17 students in the federal lawsuit. He said his law firm has heard from hundreds of students.",
      "\u201cThese are kids who now, under the Trump administration, realize their position is fragile,\u201d he said. \u201cThey\u2019ve preyed on a very vulnerable population. These kids aren\u2019t hiding. They\u2019re in school.\u201d",
      "Some international students have been adapting their daily routines.",
      "A Ph.D. student from China at University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill said she has begun carrying around her passport and immigration paperwork at the advice of the university\u2019s international student office. The student, who spoke on condition of anonymity for fear of being targeted by authorities, said she has been distressed to see the terminations even for students like her without criminal records.",

They told the magistrate they were collecting the ants for fun and did not know that it was illegal.",
      "In a separate criminal case, Kenyan Dennis Ng\u2019ang\u2019a and Vietnamese Duh Hung Nguyen also were charged with illegal trafficking in the same courtroom, following their arrest while in possession of 400 ants.",
      "The Kenya Wildlife Service said the four men were involved in trafficking the ants to markets in Europe and Asia, and that the species included messor cephalotes, a distinctive, large and red-colored harvester ant native to East Africa.",
      "The illegal export of the ants \"not only undermines Kenya\u2019s sovereign rights over its biodiversity but also deprives local communities and research institutions of potential ecological and economic benefits,\u201d KWS said in a statement.",
      "Kenya has in the past fought against the trafficking of body parts of larger species of wild animals such as elephants, rhinos and pangolins among others. But the cases against the four men represent \"a shift in trafficking trends \u2014 from iconic large mammals to lesser-known yet ecologically critical species,\u201d KWS said.",
      "The two Belgians were arrested in Kenya\u2019s Nakuru county, which is home to various national parks. The 5,000 ants were found in a guest house where they were staying, and were packed in 2,244 test tubes that had been filled with cotton wool to enable the ants to survive for months.",
      "The other two men were arrested in Nairobi where they were found to have 400 ants in their apartments.",
      "Kenyan authorities valued the ants at 1 million shillings ($7,700). The prices for ants can vary greatly according to the species and the market.",
      "Philip Muruthi, a vice president for conservation at the Africa Wildlife Foundation in Nairobi, said ants play the role of enriching soils, enabling germination and providing food for species such as birds.",
      "\u201cThe thing is, when you see a healthy forest, like Ngong forest, you don\u2019t think about what is making it healthy. It is the relationships all the way from the bacteria to the ants to the bigger things,\u201d he said.",
      "Muruthi warned of the risk of trafficking species and exporting diseases to the agricultural industry of the destination countries.",
      "\u201cEven if there is trade, it should be regulated and nobody should be taking our resources just like that,\u201d he said.",

      "Meta Platforms Inc. faces a historic antitrust trial beginning Monday that could force the tech giant to break off Instagram and WhatsApp, startups it bought more than a decade ago that have since grown into social media powerhouses.",
      "The looming antitrust trial will be the first big test of President Donald Trump\u2019s Federal Trade Commission\u2019s ability to challenge Big Tech. The lawsuit was filed against Meta \u2014 then called Facebook \u2014 in 2020, during Trump's first term. It claims the company bought Instagram and WhatsApp to squash competition and establish an illegal monopoly in the social media market.",
      "Meta, the FTC argues, has maintained a monopoly by pursuing CEO Mark Zuckerberg's strategy, \"expressed in 2008: \u2018It is better to buy than compete.\u2019 True to that maxim, Facebook has systematically tracked potential rivals and acquired companies that it viewed as serious competitive threats.\"",
      "Facebook also enacted policies designed to make it difficult for smaller rivals to enter the market and \u201cneutralize perceived competitive threats,\u201d the FTC says in its complaint, just as the world shifted its attention to mobile devices from desktop computers.",
      "\u201cUnable to maintain its monopoly by fairly competing, the company\u2019s executives addressed the existential threat by buying up new innovators that were succeeding where Facebook failed,\u201d the FTC says.",
      "Facebook bought Instagram \u2014 then a scrappy photo-sharing app with no ads and a small cult following \u2014 in 2012. The $1 billion cash and stock purchase price was eye-popping at the time, though the deal's value fell to $750 million after Facebook's stock price dipped following its initial public offering in May 2012.",
      "Instagram was the first company Facebook bought and kept running as a separate app. Up until then, Facebook was known for smaller \u201cacqui-hires\u201d \u2014 a type of popular Silicon Valley deal in which a company purchases a startup as a way to hire its talented workers, then shuts the acquired company down. Two years later, it did it again with the messaging app WhatsApp, which it purchased for $22 billion.",
      "WhatsApp and Instagram helped Facebook move its business from desktop computers to mobile devices, and to remain popular with younger generations as rivals like Snapchat (which it also tried, but failed, to buy) and TikTok emerged. However, the FTC has a narrow definition of Meta's competitive market, excluding companies like TikTok, YouTube and Apple's messaging service from being considered rivals to Instagram and WhatsApp.",
      "\u201cThe FTC already has the difficult task, whether it\u2019s looking at 10 years ago or five years ago or today, of trying to define what is the market we\u2019re talking about in a sufficiently narrow way that it can show Meta has a ton of power in that market,\u201d said Paul Swanson, an antitrust attorney for the law firm Holland & Hart. \u201cAnd I do think that challenge has gotten harder as the years have gone by and we see more and more potential competitors in social media spaces.\u201d",
      "Meta, meanwhile, says the FTC\u2019s lawsuit \u201cdefies reality.\u201d",
      "\u201cThe evidence at trial will show what every 17-year-old in the world knows: Instagram, Facebook and WhatsApp compete with Chinese-owned TikTok, YouTube, X, iMessage and many others. More than 10 years after the FTC reviewed and cleared our acquisitions, the Commission\u2019s action in this case sends the message that no deal is ever truly final. Regulators should be supporting American innovation, rather than seeking to break up a great American company and further advantaging China on critical issues like AI,\" the company said in a statement.",
      "In a filing last week, Meta also stressed that the FTC \u201cmust prove that Meta has monopoly power in its claimed relevant market now, not at some time in the past.\" This, experts say, could also prove challenging since more competitors have emerged in the social media space in the years since the company bought WhatsApp and Instagram.",
      "Meta's fate will be decided by U.S. District Judge James Boasberg, who late last year denied Meta's request for a summary judgment and ruled that the case must go to trial.",
      "Boasberg \u201cseems to be skeptical\u201d of the FTC's narrow market definition in his rulings to date, Swanson said. He added that the judge also said it is a \u201cfact question,\" which means he is open to hearing what the FTC and its experts have to say to define that narrow market.",
      "While the FTC may face an uphill battle in proving its case, the stakes are high for Meta, whose advertising business could be cut in half if it's forced to spin off Instagram.",
      "\u201cInstagram is now Meta\u2019s biggest money maker in the U.S., its most lucrative market, where the app accounts for 50.5% of the company\u2019s ad revenues in 2025. Instagram has also been picking up the slack for Facebook on the user front, particularly among young people, for a long time,\u201d said Emarketer analyst Jasmine Enberg. \u201cThe trial also comes as Meta is trying to bring back OG Facebook in an effort to appeal to Gen Z and younger users as they join social media. Social media usage is far more fragmented today than it was in 2012 when Facebook acquired Instagram, and Facebook isn\u2019t where the cool college kids hang out anymore. Meta needs Instagram to continue growing, especially as more advertisers think Instagram-first with their Meta budgets.\u201d",
      "But Meta isn't the only technology company in the sights of federal antitrust regulators, Google and Amazon face their own cases. The remedy phase of Google's case is scheduled to begin on April 21. A federal judge declared the search giant an illegal monopoly last August.",
      "\u201cA big theme here is we are applying 19th-century laws to 21st-century markets. And I think it\u2019s an open question whether the judgment developments to antitrust law can keep up with markets as they are changing \u2014 these fluid and dynamic tech markets in particular,\u201d Swanson said. \u201cAnd this will be a case that speaks directly to that.\u201d",

      "The remarks came a day after Powell voiced alarm about Trump\u2019s tariff policy, saying it would likely hike inflation and slow economic growth. Powell indicated that the Fed may approach interest rates with restraint as policymakers observe the economic effects of Trump's tariffs.",

      "On Wednesday, Powell raised the possibility of what economists call \u201cstagflation,\u201d which is when inflation rises and the economy slows.",
      "If the Fed raises interest rates as a means of protecting against tariff-induced inflation under such a scenario, it risks stifling borrowing and slowing the economy further, experts previously told ABC News.",
      "On the other hand, experts said, if the Fed lowers rates to stimulate the economy in the face of a potential slowdown, it threatens to boost spending and worsen inflation.",
      "Last month, Trump urged the central bank to reduce interest rates, hours after it chose to leave borrowing rates unchanged. In January, Trump also advocated for interest-rate cuts in response to what he described as the prospect of lower oil prices.",
      "In November, days after Trump\u2019s election victory, Powell struck a defiant tone when asked whether he would resign from his position if Trump asked him to.",
      "\u201cNo,\u201d Powell said, pausing to let the one-word answer register with the reporters assembled at a press conference at the Fed headquarters, blocks away from the White House.",
      "When asked whether Trump could fire or demote him, Powell responded: \u201cNot permitted under the law.\u201d",
      "Powell has repeatedly affirmed the Fed's political independence. During a press conference at Fed headquarters last month, Powell was asked again about threats to the agency\u2019s political independence.",

    "published": "Thu, 17 Apr 2025 14:11:18 -0400",
    "summary": "HHS Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. said the agency is planning to study what causes autism and release results in September. Experts question how realistic this goal is.",
    "story": [
      "Studies have suggested that autism risk is heavily rooted in genetics.",
      "Health and Human Services Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. made headlines last week when he announced that the agency would \"know what has caused the autism epidemic\" by September of this year.",
      "At a Cabinet meeting at the White House, Kennedy said \"hundreds of scientists\" were looking into rising rates of autism diagnoses, adding that HHS would \"eliminate\" any exposures found to be causing autism.",
      "Asked by ABC News at a press conference on Wednesday if that timeline was still accurate, Kennedy said he expected to have \"some of the answers\" by September and called it \"an evolving process.\"",
      "A biennial report from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) published Tuesday found that, in 2022, one in 31 children was diagnosed with autism. This is an increase from one in 36 children in 2020 and one in 150 children in 2000.",
      "On the heels of the report, Kennedy pushed back against the explanation that the increase in autism diagnoses is due to a broadening definition of autism spectrum disorder (ASD), citing instead environmental toxins as a likely cause for a significant percentage of the increases.",
      "ABC News spoke to several public health specialists to understand if a five-month timeline is reasonable for this type of research, how that research should be done and what research has already been done to find causes of cases across the autism spectrum.",
      "More focus, funding for autism research could be beneficial, but may take a long time",
      "Public health specialists told ABC News that a systematic approach or national initiative to focus more research on potential causes of autism could be a good thing if that research is done appropriately.",
      "However, they added that a five-month timeline to perform any rigorous, scientific research study is \"ambitious,\" and that decades of research have already been done looking at the causes of autism.",
      "\"I feel like it would be amazing if the current administration actually would put resources into a better understanding, especially as the numbers are climbing, a better understanding of potential preventative causes,\" Dr. Judy Van de Water, a professor of medicine and associate director of biological sciences at University of California, Davis MIND Institute, told ABC News, but \"the timeline is very ambitious, if that in fact is the timeline.\"",
      "\"Regardless of what the research question is, designing the study, approving the study, funding the study, carrying out the study, analyzing the study and having it available for peer review in five months is ridiculous,\" Dr. Gregory Poland, a vaccinologist as well as president and co-director of the Atria Research Institute, told ABC News. \"It just displays an alarming na\u00efvet\u00e9 in regard to the scientific method.\"",
      "A study of this magnitude would need to be multi-disciplinary, carefully designed, take a large amount of money to fund and would take years, not months, experts say.",
      "\"I would welcome a high-quality systems biology level study of \u2013 it'd be tough to do it across the spectrum of autism, but I'll just use the word as a generalization \u2013 of autism. But design your study carefully. Submit the study design to widespread scientific peer review, then fund it and do it,\" Poland said, adding, \"that's a very large, very expensive systems-, level, multiple collaboration with 50 or 100 co-investigators and authors. And that isn't done in a year. It's not done in three years.\"",
      "Dr. Jeremy Veenstra-VanderWeele, division director in child and adolescent psychiatry at Columbia University, said it's unclear if HHS is planning to conduct an original study gathering individuals and tracking autism diagnoses or to conduct a large-scale analysis of published research.",
      "\"We don't know who those people are,\" he told ABC News. \"We don't know the approach that they might take. We don't know what their beliefs are. We don't know what papers will be included, if they're looking at existing literature, I think there's a lot that's unknown.\"",
      "Kennedy said the future studies would be conducted by providing funding grants to academic institutions and other researchers. Stating specifically, \"We're going to task them with certain outcomes and we're going to have them come and bid on how to do the research,\" Kennedy said.",
      "When Kennedy was asked by ABC News' Cheyenne Haslett if he would commit to following the science revealed by the studies, regardless of his current expectations on what's causing the rise in diagnosis, Kennedy said yes.",
      "Van de Water added that it's important for HHS researchers to take a multi-disciplinary approach because ASD is a spectrum and can present differently in different children.",
      "Additionally, like many other researchers, she pointed out that understanding what causes autism is just as important as understanding how to support those individuals.",
      "\"Understanding what the causes are, potentially preventing them, is important, but I think equally important -- we've got one in 31 kids now -- what do we do to help? That's impactful on everyone.\"",
      "Genetics vs. environment as a cause of autism",
      "During Wednesday's press conference, Kennedy acknowledged research that has found a significant association between autism and genetics but claimed, without evidence, that autism is a \"preventable disease\" caused by an environmental exposure, which is what he wants to focus this research on.",
      "\"We know it's an environmental exposure. It has to be. Genes do not cause epidemics. It can provide a vulnerability, but you need an environmental toxin,\" Kennedy said.",
      "One meta analysis of several twin studies found the genetic risk of autism is between 60% and 90%.",
      "Experts have said autism diagnosis rates may be increasing for many reasons, including a combination of widening the definition of the spectrum and the types of symptoms associated with ASD, as well as people having children at older ages, better awareness and access to diagnostic testing.",
      "Kennedy said he would be looking at \"all the potential culprits,\" listing mold, food additives, pesticides, air, water, medicines, and ultrasound. He also said the studies would look at associations with autism and parental factors like age and diabetes.",
      "\"This has not been done before, and we're going to do it in a thorough and comprehensive way, and we're going to get back to with an answer to the American people very, very quickly,\" Kennedy said.",
      "Dr. Manish Arora, founder and CEO of Linus Biotechnology and a professor of environmental medicine at the Mount Sinai School of Medicine, said both genetics and environmental factors are likely at play.",
      "\"Autism Spectrum Disorder, most of the evidence points at it being a disorder that involves both the genes and the environment,\" he told ABC News. \"However, the focus has primarily been on the genetics, and that has shown us that it's not enough to just focus on the genes to decipher the complexity of autism.\"",
      "Arora went on, \"We must also focus on the non-genomic part, and that's my area of research. Yes, I believe that there will be genetic risk factors, and then environment and genetics together would determine whether a person crosses that threshold into having the spectrum disorder.\"",
      "Dr. Ty Vernon, director of the Koegel Autism Center at the University of California, Santa Barbara, said there has been ongoing research into the root causes of autism for decades, including research on many environmental exposures..",
      "He said findings have shown environmental components increase the likelihood that somebody will be diagnosed with ASD, but they have not seen a study that shows any specific environmental factor don't outright cause autism.",
      "\"There's been studies into toxins like air pollution, pesticides, prenatal exposure to certain substances, maternal health conditions, diabetes, stress, older parents in general, birth complications, premature birth,\" Vernon told. ABC News. \"These are all kinds of environmental risk factors that increase likelihood that have been researched already.\"",
      "\"There's a growing understanding that there's not one autism, but multiple autisms, and that really helps explain why there are some kind of common characteristics,\" he added.",
      "Kennedy has referred to autism as a \"disease\" and that the rising rate of autism diagnoses is an \"epidemic.\"",
      "Experts said Kennedy's comments make it sound like autism is an infection that can be caught and prevented, and that using the term \"epidemic\" may further stigmatize those who are on the spectrum or are neurodivergent.",
      "\"'Epidemic' definitely has a very negative connotation,\" Dr. Barry Prizant, an adjunct professor in the department of communicative disorders at the University of Rhode Island and director of the private practice Childhood Communication Services, told ABC News.\"It's been applied most typically to infectious diseases and autism, as we have said, is not a disease, it is a behavioral description, and probably there are many, many factors associated with that behavioral description.\"",
      "Decades of evidence show vaccines do not cause autism",
      "The myth that vaccines cause autism was born out of a fraudulent 1998 study, hypothesizing that the measles, mumps, rubella (MMR) vaccine caused intestinal inflammation, which, in turn, led to the development of autism.",
      "The paper has since been discredited by the scientific community, retracted from the journal in which it was published, and its primary author, Andrew Wakefield, lost his medical license after an investigation found he had acted \"dishonestly and irresponsibly\" in conducting his research.",
      "More than a dozen high-quality studies have since found no evidence of a link between childhood vaccines and autism.",
      "Still, Kennedy has shared vaccine skepticism in the past and refused to acknowledge during his Senate confirmation hearings that vaccines don't cause autism. Researchers told ABC News that launching new studies about whether this link exists would not be beneficial.",
      "\"There just are not credible studies across decades, across multiple countries, across multiple study designs that have ever shown an association,\" Poland said.",
      "Poland pointed to several studies that have been done over the last 30 years including a 2012 report by the National Academies of Medicine that \"extensively reviewed all the studies found no evidence of an association.\"",
      "According to the report, \"the committee has a high degree of confidence in the epidemiologic evidence based on four studies with validity and precision to assess an association between MMR vaccine and autism.\"",
      "The report identified three strong studies with negligible limitations and high precision -- one study published in the New England Journal of Medicine and two published in the Lancet -- that each found no association or link between the MMR vaccine and autism.",
      "There were five total studies included in this analysis; 17 others were reviewed but excluded due to concerns with methodology or data limitations.",
      "In 2014, RAND researchers conducted a systematic review that was published in the journal Pediatrics that found \"strong evidence confirming that the MMR vaccine is not associated with autism in children.\"",
      "Poland also cited a large study published in the Annals of Internal Medicine in 2019 that studied over 657,000 kids in Denmark born between 1999 and 2010 who were followed until 2013 and found no increased risk for autism from the MMR vaccine based on any subgrouping, even those who had siblings with autism.",

      "Shapiro and his family were safely evacuated from the home early Sunday.",
      "Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer wants Attorney General Pam Bondi to investigate the arson attack on Pennsylvania Gov. Josh Shapiro's residence as a possible antisemitic hate crime.",
      "\"While the local district attorney has not yet filed hate-crime charges, he acknowledged that Governor Shapiro\u2019s religion appears to have factored into the suspect\u2019s decisions,\" Schumer wrote in a letter to Bondi on Thursday. \"Our federal authorities must bring the full weight of our civil-rights laws to bear in examining this matter. No person or public official should be targeted because of their faith, and no community should wonder whether such acts will be met with silence.\"",
      "The suspect\u2019s Palestinian statements, \"in conjunction with the timing of the attack during Passover, Governor Shapiro\u2019s visible embrace of his Jewish faith, and the context of rising antisemitism globally and across the country,\" Schumer said, \"raise serious concerns about antisemitic motivation.\"",
      "\"I appreciate your strong condemnation of the attack and urge you to ensure that the federal government does everything in its power to pursue justice and uphold the fundamental values of religious freedom and public safety,\" Schumer added. \"I look forward to your response and to the Justice Department\u2019s continued vigilance in the face of antisemitic violence.\"",
      "The fire at the governor's residence was reported at about 2 a.m. ET Sunday and the family was safely evacuated. The attack occurred hours after the Shapiro family hosted more than two dozen people for the first night of Passover.",
      "Investigators have not released a motive, but search warrants provide the most direct indication of why suspect Cody Balmer allegedly hopped a fence at the governor's mansion, broke windows and hurled inside Molotov cocktails police said he made from beer bottles and gasoline.",
      "Balmer, 38, called 911 less than an hour after the attack, identified himself and told the call-taker that he will not take part in Shapiro's plans \"for what he wants to do to the Palestinian people,\" a search warrant said. Balmer added that Shapiro needed to \"stop having my friends killed.\"",
      "\"Our people have been put through too much by that monster,\" Balmer said, according to the document.",
      "After turning himself in, Balmer allegedly told police he would have attacked Shapiro with a hammer if he happened upon the governor inside the residence, according to court documents.",
      "Balmer faces eight criminal charges, including attempted murder, terrorism and aggravated arson. Prosecutors at this time have not invoked a hate crime law, which in Pennsylvania is known as ethnic intimidation.",
      "Attorney General Pam Bondi strongly condemned the attack in remarks at the Department of Justice on Wednesday, but she declined to label the act \"domestic terrorism\" or commit to opening a separate federal case against the suspect.",
      "\"It is absolutely horrific what happened to him,\" Bondi said. \"We have been praying for Josh, for his family. Those photos, it was horrible. I firmly believe that they wanted to kill him. ... We are working with state authorities to do -- it's now a pending investigation -- anything we can to help convict the person that did this and keep them behind bars as long as possible.\"",
      "Bondi did not answer a direct question from a reporter about whether she would label the action \"domestic terrorism,\" as she has repeatedly described the wave of attacks carried out on Teslas and dealerships around the country in recent months.",
      "\"Prosecutors will ultimately determine what motivated this,\" Shapiro told reporters at the opening of a new Hershey\u2019s Chocolate processing facility in Hershey, Pennsylvania. \"The district attorney and the Department of Justice can comment on that further.\"",
      "When asked by a reporter if he wants hate crime charges filed, Shapiro said that's a decision for the district attorney and the Department of Justice.",

      "LOS ANGELES -- In the fight for the U.S. House, Democrats are hoping pop rock star power will help oust a long-serving Republican east of Los Angeles as the party looks to regain control of the chamber and slow President Donald Trump\u2019s agenda.",
      "Tim Myers, a Grammy-nominated former bassist for international hitmakers OneRepublic, announced Thursday he will challenge Rep. Ken Calvert in the battleground 41st District in Riverside County that stretches from the L.A. suburbs to the resort haven of Palm Springs.",
      "\u201cKen Calvert has been in Washington for 30 years,\u201d Myers says in a video announcing his campaign. The \u201cstatus quo isn't working.\u201d",
      "Christian Martinez, a spokesperson for the campaign arm of House Republicans, said in a statement that \u201cDemocrat Tim Myers is everything wrong with today\u2019s radical left: a Hollywood liberal trying to fake his way into Riverside County.\"",
      "Myers grew up in Corona, most of which is in the district, but now lives in neighboring Los Angeles County.",
      "At a time when competitive House contests are becoming scarcer nationwide, Democrats consider Calvert's closely divided California district one of the party\u2019s best opportunities to gain ground in the chamber, where Republicans hold a fragile 220-213 majority.",
      "With Congress and the White House under Republican control \u2014 and Democrats facing an uphill fight to take the Senate in 2026 \u2014 the California contest will carry added importance as Democrats maneuver to retake the House to provide a counterweight to the Trump administration on issues from immigration to the environment.",
      "Myers, a prolific producer, songwriter and solo artist, is positioning himself as a change agent in a race against one of the most senior members of the House. The 40-year-old Myers said he was in second grade when Calvert, the longest-serving Republican in the state\u2019s congressional delegation, was first elected in 1992.",
      "In the video that appears to have been filmed in a recording studio, Myers recalls growing up a pastor's son in Corona, on the western edge of the Southern California district. He recounts the ups-and-downs of the notoriously cutthroat music business that eventually led him to found his own record label. He now lives in the tony enclave of Hidden Hills in neighboring Los Angeles County, a popular redoubt for musicians and actors.",
      "Myers berates Trump policies that he says will hurt veterans and drive up consumer prices.",
      "\u201cOur community is being priced out of homeownership, groceries are more expensive every week and we\u2019re constantly under threat from wildfires and rising crime,\u201d Myers said in a statement. \u201cIt\u2019s time for a change.\u201d",
      "Republicans hold a slim registration advantage in the district \u2014 less than 2 points over Democrats \u2014 and Calvert has beat back tough challenges in the last two elections. Calvert prevailed by about a 3-point edge in 2024, the same year Trump carried the district by 6 points over Democrat Kamala Harris, the former California U.S. senator and attorney general.",
      "The campaign arm of House Democrats has named Calvert a top target for 2026, as he was in 2024. Calvert's campaign raised over $1.3 million the first quarter of 2025.",
      "California is known as a liberal protectorate. Democrats hold every statewide office, dominate the Legislature and congressional delegation and outnumber registered Republicans by a staggering 2-1 ratio. Still, Republicans retain pockets of political clout in the Southern California suburbs and vast rural stretches, including the Central Valley farm belt.",
      "In 2024, a tough year for Democrats nationally, the party picked up three GOP-held House seats in California.",

      "Abdul El-Sayed, 40, is the second Democrat to put his name in the running in what could be one of the most watched races in the 2026 midterm elections. He's also the second candidate this week to launch a campaign to replace Democratic Sen. Gary Peters, who is not seeking reelection.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s way too hard to survive here in the richest, most powerful country in the world and it should not be this hard to get by,\u201d he told The Associated Press.",
      "El-Sayed ran for governor in 2018 as a progressive Democrat and was endorsed by Sen. Bernie Sanders. He came in second in the Democratic primary, losing to Gretchen Whitmer by more than 20 points and beating now U.S. Rep. Shri Thanedar by more than 12 points. Whitmer went on to win the general election and is in the midst of a second term. She can't run again because of term limits.",
      "A resident of Ann Arbor, El-Sayed recently served as director of the Department of Health, Human & Veterans Services in Wayne County, home to Detroit. Before that, he was the public health director of the city after it declared bankruptc y in 2013.",
      "El-Sayed said he's inspired to run for Senate after the overhaul of the federal government brought on by President Donald Trump and Elon Musk, including changes and cuts made at the nation's top health agencies.

    "summary": "A judge found probable cause the Trump administration acted in contempt of court when officials defied his order to turn two planes around carrying alleged gang members.",
    "story": [
      "The Justice Department is appealing the judge's decision.",
      "A federal judge has found probable cause that the Trump administration acted in contempt of court when officials last month defied his order to turn around two planes carrying alleged Venezuelan gang members to El Salvador.",
      "The administration's \"willful disobedience of judicial orders\" without consequences would make \"a solemn mockery\" of \"the Constitution itself,\" U.S. District Judge James Boasberg wrote Wednesday.",
      "Boasberg last month ordered that the government turn around two flights carrying more than 200 alleged Tren de Aragua members to El Salvador after the Trump administration invoked the Alien Enemies Act -- a wartime authority used to deport noncitizens with little-to-no due process -- by arguing that the gang is a \"hybrid criminal state\" that is invading the United States.",
      "Authorities failed to turn the flights around, but have insisted that they \"complied with the law\" while questioning the legitimacy of Boasberg's order. According to the DOJ, Boasberg's oral instructions directing the flight to be returned were defective, and his subsequent written order lacked the necessary explanation to be enforced.",
      "Boasberg faulted the Trump administration for conducting a \"hurried removal operation\" on March 15 and 16 in the hours after he issued an order blocking the deportations and ordering the men returned to the United States.",
      "\"As this Opinion will detail, the Court ultimately determines that the Government's actions on that day demonstrate a willful disregard for its Order,\" he wrote.",
      "Boasberg noted that he gave the Trump administration \"ample opportunity to rectify or explain their actions\" yet \"none of their responses has been satisfactory.\"",
      "The Department of Justice is appealing Boasberg's decision.",
      "In a statement earlier Wednesday, a DOJ spokesperson said: \"The Supreme Court ruled that Judge Boasberg has no right to seize control of the President's authority to conduct foreign policy \u2014 he should have never issued his order. His underhanded attempt to maintain power over this case is a judicial power grab that the Department of Justice will fight by all means necessary.\"",
      "While the Supreme Court ultimately vacated his court order, Judge Boasberg concluded that the Trump administration still defied the order during the three weeks it was in effect, even if the order suffered from a \"legal defect.\"",
      "\"The Constitution does not tolerate willful disobedience of judicial orders -- especially by officials of a coordinate branch who have sworn an oath to uphold it. To permit such officials to freely 'annul the judgments of the courts of the United States' would not just 'destroy the rights acquired under those judgments'; it would make 'a solemn mockery' of 'the constitution itself,'\" he wrote.",
      "Boasberg gave the Trump Administration a one-week deadline to file \"a declaration explaining the steps they have taken and will take to do so.\"",
      "The way to \"purge\" the potential finding of contempt, Boasberg said, would be to obey his initial order.",
      "\"The most obvious way for Defendants to do so here is by asserting custody of the individuals who were removed in violation of the Court's classwide TRO so that they might avail themselves of their right to challenge their removability through a habeas proceeding,\" Boasberg wrote, referring to the temporary restraining order he issued.",
      "\"Per the terms of the TRO, the Government would not need to release any of those individuals, nor would it need to transport them back to the homeland. The Court will also give Defendants an opportunity to propose other methods of coming into compliance, which the Court will evaluate.\"",
      "If the Trump Administration does not wish to purge Boasberg's contempt finding, the judge said he will \"proceed to identify the individual(s) responsible for the contumacious conduct by determining whose \"specific act or omission\" caused the noncompliance.\"",
      "Boasberg said he will begin by requiring declarations from the government, and if those prove to be unsatisfactory, he will \"proceed either to hearings with live witness testimony under oath or to depositions conducted by Plaintiffs.\"",
      "As a final potential step, Boasberg raised the prospect that he could appoint an independent attorney to prosecute the government for its contempt.",
      "\"The next step would be for the Court, pursuant to the Federal Rules of Criminal Procedure, to request that the contempt be prosecuted by an attorney for the government,\" Boasberg wrote.",
      "If the Government \"declines\" or \"the interest of justice requires,\" the Court will \"appoint another attorney to prosecute the contempt,\" he wrote.",
      "In a separate filing Wednesday evening, lawyers with the ACLU representing the noncitizens removed to El Salvador urged Judge Boasberg to keep the case in D.C. following the Supreme Court's ruling that effectively threw out the case.",
      "They asked Judge Boasberg to issue a nationwide order that requires the Trump administration to provide 30-days' notice before attempting to remove anyone else under the Alien Enemies Act. They argued the relief is urgent because some noncitizens might be deported with less than a day's notice, \"making it virtually impossible\" for them to challenge their removal.",
      "In its 5-4 decision earlier this month, the Supreme Court ruled that the Trump administration could resume deportations of alleged Venezuelan gang members under the Alien Enemies Act, but said detainees must be given due process to challenge their removal.",
      "\"This Court continues to have jurisdiction over all class members' claims that adequate notice is required under the Supreme Court's ruling, the AEA, and due process\u2014whether those individuals are in immigration custody, in criminal custody, or not detained,\" the ACLU lawyers wrote.",
      "They also plan to refile more than a hundred habeas claims in D.C. for the men who were deported on March 15, according to the filing.",

      "Parents and advocates say his recent comments were misguided.",
      "Parents of children with autism are speaking out against recent comments made by Health and Human Services Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr., saying his remarks about autism and vaccines reinforce harmful stereotypes and ignore the diversity and potential of people on the autism spectrum.",
      "\"He's spreading fear and misinformation,\" said Beth Hoffman, a Maryland-based mom of a 10-year-old non-speaking son with autism.",
      "Hoffman said she was \"outraged and disturbed,\" adding that Kennedys' comments about \"autism being an epidemic and a chronic disease causes falsehoods and a negative stigma.\"",
      "\"I'm sad for our country, my son's future, and everyone with [a disability],\" she said.",
      "The backlash follows a new CDC report showing that autism diagnoses are on the rise, affecting 1 in 31 8-year-olds in the U.S. in 2022. On the heels of the report, Kennedy on Wednesday announced a directive to the National Institutes of Health to investigate what he called \"environmental exposures\" that he claimed could be contributing to that rise in diagnoses.",
      "Medical professionals say the rise in autism diagnosis is largely because of better awareness and diagnosis, as well as broadening medical definitions that now encompass a wider range of people on the autism spectrum.",
      "Kennedy pushed back on the idea that the surge in diagnoses may be due to increased awareness or better diagnostic tools, calling that explanation \"indefensible.\"",
      "\"Autism destroys families, and more importantly, it destroys our greatest resource, which is our children,\" he said at an HHS press conference in Washington, D.C.",
      "Autism advocates were dismayed to hear Kennedy's blanket characterization of children with autism: \"They'll never pay taxes, they'll never hold a job, they'll never play baseball, they'll never write a poem, they'll never go out on a date. Many of them will never use a toilet unassisted.\"",
      "Autism spectrum disorder, ASD, is a spectrum, which means symptoms vary by person: Some need little support in their daily lives, and some may need a great deal of support in performing day-to-day activities. Some may have advanced conversation skills and others may be nonverbal.",
      "The new CDC report, for example, estimated that fewer than 40% of children diagnosed with autism in 2022 were classified as having an intellectual disability.",
      "Parents speak out",
      "Actress and longtime autism advocate Holly Robinson Peete responded to Kennedy's comments on Wednesday with a pointed video on Instagram.",
      "\"There is so much to unpack,\" she said in the video. \"Autism is not a disease. It is a developmental disorder, and it is important to get that right.\"",
      "Peete, who has spoken extensively in the past about her son RJ's autism diagnosis 25 years ago, noted that he has \"checked off and shattered a lot of 'never' off that list.\"",
      "Samantha Taylor, whose 20-year-old son is also on the spectrum, echoed that frustration. \"Unless you are the parent of a child with autism, you can't begin to imagine what the journey is like,\" she told GMA. \"To say that it's an epidemic and destroying families is an insult to everyone in the autism community.\"",
      "Taylor also shared additional thoughts in a Facebook post earlier Thursday, writing, \"Autism doesn't destroy families. You know what does? Inaccurate information passed along as science.\"",
      "Alexis and Richard Brown, parents to 15-year-old twin boys with autism, told GMA they were disheartened by Kennedy's statements. \"RFK had a lot of nerve stating that autism is ruining our lives,\" Alexis Brown said.",
      "Alexis Brown, who has served on the board of the Gentry Foundation for Autism since 2016, added, \"Autism is a very broad spectrum, and it is not an epidemic. Our children play sports, are members of the National Junior Honor Society, serve as junior instructors in their jujitsu black belt club and do CrossFit. So let's debunk the idea that all children with autism will never use the toilet, never hold a job or never succeed in life.\"",
      "Experts call for more research",
      "Experts in the field echoed many of the concerns voiced by parents.",
      "\"We are excited about Secretary Kennedy's interest in autism,\" said Tom Frazier, professor of psychology at John Carroll University and board chair at Autism Speaks, a nonprofit autism awareness organization. \"But we have to make sure the research is focused on the needs of autistic people and their families, and that we're not recreating research that's already been done.\"",
      "Frazier pushed back on the sweeping generalizations shared by Kennedy, noting the wide range of abilities across the autism spectrum.",

      "WASHINGTON -- Dakota Meyer, a Marine who was awarded the Medal of Honor for heroism in the Afghanistan War but later became a sharp critic of the Biden administration over its chaotic withdrawal from that conflict, is reenlisting in the military and will serve in the Marine Reserves.",
      "In a briefing with reporters on Thursday before his reenlistment ceremony, Meyer said he is returning to military service after 15 years out of uniform because he felt he \u201chad more to give.\u201d He's also close to President Donald Trump's defense secretary, Pete Hegseth.",
      "But Meyer said he would refrain from politics while in uniform.",
      "\u201cThe great part about being in the reserves is I'm still a citizen when I'm not on orders,\u201d he said. \u201cWhen I'm on orders I'll comply obviously with whatever the standard is.\"",
      "Meyer was awarded the Medal of Honor, the military\u2019s highest honor, by then-President Barack Obama in 2011 for his heroics in Afghanistan when he charged five times in a Humvee into heavy gunfire to rescue comrades under attack by Taliban insurgents.",
      "On Sept. 8, 2009, Meyer was part of a security team supporting a patrol moving into a village in the Ganjgal Valley. Suddenly, the lights in a nearby village went out and gunfire erupted. About 50 Taliban insurgents on mountainsides and in the village had ambushed the patrol.",
      "His actions during the six-hour attack and firefight saved the lives of 36 people, both Americans and Afghans. He killed at least eight Taliban insurgents. Firing from a gun turret on top of a Humvee driven by a fellow Marine, he provided cover for his team, allowing many to escape likely death.",
      "Four American soldiers died in the ambush: 1st Lt. Michael Johnson, 25, from Virginia Beach, Virginia; Staff Sgt. Aaron Kenefick, 30, of Roswell, Georgia; Corpsman James Layton, 22, of Riverbank, California; and Edwin Wayne Johnson Jr., a 31-year-old gunnery sergeant from Columbus, Georgia. A fifth man, Army Sgt. Kenneth W. Westbrook, 41, of Shiprock, New Mexico, died later from his wounds.",
      "After leaving the military, Meyer remained in the spotlight. In 2016 he married former vice presidential candidate Sarah Palin's daughter, Bristol, and they had two children.",
      "He\u2019s been outspoken about the jailing of another Marine \u2014 Lt. Col. Stuart Scheller \u2014 who criticized the Biden administration for the 2021 withdrawal from Afghanistan in social media posts while in uniform, which is a violation of military conduct.",

      "MADISON, Wis. -- A Wisconsin Elections Commission discussion of uncounted ballots in Madison devolved into a shouting match Thursday, with the Democratic chair threatening to kick a Republican commissioner out of the meeting.",
      "The commission is investigating former Madison City Clerk Maribeth Witzel-Behl after she failed to count 200 absentee ballots in the November election and didn't tell the commission about the oversight until after election results were certified. Witzel-Behl resigned this week.",
      "Commission Chair Ann Jacobs said at a Thursday meeting that she and Commissioner Don Millis had deposed Witzel-Behl as well as other city workers and planned to continue questioning additional workers.",
      "Republican Commissioner Bob Spindell said that he was fine with the Madison investigation, but the commission needs to pay more attention to what he said were even more serious problems with election administration in Milwaukee.",
      "As he attempted to detail his concerns, Jacobs began screaming at him that how elections are run in Milwaukee wasn't on the agenda. She ordered him to stop talking or she would kick him out.",
      "\u201cI am not going to let you keep going, Bob,\u201d she said, jabbing her finger at him. \u201cI'm going to talk over you until you stop. You must stop. You are out of order, and I will eject you from this meeting if you disobey again.\u201d",
      "\u201cYou're going to eject me from the meeting? You're going to try and muzzle me?\u201d Spindell responded.",

      "\u201cThey are simple. You are out of order. The city of Milwaukee is not on this agenda. You don't get to hijack the agenda,\" Jacobs said.",
      "They continued to shout over each other until Spindell gave up. \u201cI said what I needed to say. Thank you,\" he said. Jacobs ultimately allowed Spindell to remain in the meeting.",
      "The commission is evenly divided with three Republican commissioners and three Democrats. Spindell was one of 10 Republicans who signed certificates in 2020 falsely stating that Donald Trump had won Wisconsin. Democrat Joe Biden actually won the state that year.",
      "He and Jacobs have been at odds for years, with Spindell often lodging complaints and making motions that Jacobs rules out of order. Much like Thursday's exchange, their interactions have often been marked by Jacobs demanding that he stop talking.",
      "The commission opened an investigation into Witzel-Behl in early January after learning that she had failed to count 193 absentee ballots and didn't inform the commission until Dec. 18, more than two weeks after election results were certified.",
      "The uncounted ballots didn't affect the outcome of any races, but commissioners appeared stunned at the oversight. Four Madison voters whose ballots went uncounted have filed claims for $175,000 each from the city and Dane County, the first step toward a lawsuit. It was another blunder for Witzel-Behl after she announced in September that her office erroneously sent out up to 2,000 duplicate absentee ballots.",
      "Mayor Satya Rhodes-Conway suspended Witzel-Behl in March and launched an internal investigation. Witzel-Behl resigned on Monday. The city has yet to release the findings from its internal probe.",
      "It wasn't clear what Milwaukee voting problems Spindell was referring to on Thursday since Jacobs drowned him out. But he could be heard referencing a report about how some polling stations in Milwaukee ran out of ballots because of higher than anticipated turnout in the state's hotly contested Supreme Court election.",

      "Now, as she looks at photos of the destruction, Zawatsky can envision where she had been seated and how deadly the attack could have been.",
      "Like many others, Zawatsky is cautiously awaiting word from investigators about the motivations of the attacker, which are clouded by hints of erratic behavior as well as statements from his past.",
      "Still, the attack hit the Jewish community hard in a state where such pain is achingly familiar. It targeted Pennsylvania\u2019s religiously observant Jewish governor in the very place where just hours before he had hosted one of the central rituals of the Jewish calendar.",
      "Zawatsky heads a Pittsburgh organization formed to counter antisemitism and memorialize the victims of another Pennsylvania assault \u2013 the murders of 11 worshippers from three congregations at the Tree of Life synagogue more than six years ago, the deadliest antisemitic attack in U.S. history.",
      "\u201cSeeing those images is deeply traumatic,\u201d said Zawatsky, CEO of The Tree of Life, the group established in the wake of the Oct. 27, 2018 killings. \u201cIt\u2019s not too much to ask that we all live in a country where we celebrate our faith without fear.\u201d",
      "The synagogue shooting trial revealed that the gunman, who was convicted and sentenced to death, had long been steeped in antisemitism and methodically carried out the attack.",
      "In the Harrisburg case, things are less clear. Investigators have released only fragments of what Balmer told them. His relatives say he has struggled with mental illness, and his lawyers suggested Wednesday that will be central to their defense.",
      "\u201cWe have no definitive information about this person\u2019s motive,\" Zawatsky said. \"We do know that there was certainly hate involved.\u201d",
      "Pennsylvania State Police said 38-year-old Cody Balmer confessed to the attack, harbored hatred for the governor and said he planned to beat Shapiro with a hammer.",
      "\u201cBALMER identified himself by name and related that Governor Josh SHAPIRO needs to know that he \u2018...will not take part in his plans for what he wants to do to the Palestinian people,\u2019\u201d police wrote as part of applications for search warrants. Exactly who and what that meant were unclear in the documents.",
      "Senate Democratic Leader Chuck Schumer of New York on Thursday called on the Justice Department to determine whether the attack qualifies as a federal hate crime.",
      "Audrey Glickman, a survivor of the 2018 attack and a member of Tree of Life Congregation, said she admired Shapiro\u2019s composure, just hours after the attack, and his emphatic denunciaton of hatred regardless of motivation.",
      "\u201cIt takes a while to realize you\u2019ve been attacked and what to make of it,\u201d Glickman said. She admired \u201chow he stood up right away and spoke strongly about it.\u201d",
      "Shapiro responded to the scene of the 2018 Pittsburgh attack as Pennsylvania\u2019s then-attorney general. As governor, he took part in the 2024 groundbreaking for a new building to replace the synagogue, including a memorial, programming and other exhibits aimed to counter antisemitism.",
      "About 200 people participated in a somber march Wednesday night in Harrisburg. They walked from the parking lot of a synagogue to the governor's residence, where they held a multifaith prayer vigil across the street.",
      "Several marchers connected the attack to the overheated political climate.",
      "\u201cTo deny it is like putting your head in the sand,\u201d said retired Presbyterian minister Don Potter, 75, of Dillsburg, who said the images of the building\u2019s interior with fire damage \u201cmade me sick.\u201d",
      "Enid Wassner, a retired child care worker from Hershey, said the fact that the firebombing occurring during Passover and targeted Shapiro and his family was \u201cextremely worrying.\u201d She noted that Jewish institutions and buildings in Harrisburg have had to increase security.",
      "\u201cGradually things have been getting more worrisome, for me personally and the entire Jewish community.\"",
      "Police said in court affidavits that in an interview with detectives Balmer \u201cadmitted to harboring hatred towards\u201d Shapiro and referred to the Palestinian people in a 911 call attributed to him that was placed shortly after the break-in.",
      "Balmer\u2019s mother and brother have said he suffered from bipolar disorder and would not consistently take medication. His brother, Dan Balmer, said Cody Balmer twice in recent years spent time in a psychiatric hospital in Harrisburg. During a court hearing on Monday, Balmer denied any history of mental illness.",
      "Dan Balmer told the AP on Tuesday that Cody Balmer \u201chad these theories that were going on in his head\u201d and became angry when family members would tell him his views didn't reflect reality.",
      "\u201cThe allegations, if true, demonstrate the devastating consequences of severe mental illness,\u201d Mary Klatt, the chief public defender in Dauphin County, whose office is representing Balmer, said Wednesday. She said his preliminary hearing would be delayed to determine whether Balmer is mentally competent to stand trial.",
      "Shapiro declined to talk about the attacker's motive on Wednesday, saying prosecutors will ultimately determine what drove him.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s not for me to answer that,\u201d he said.",
      "The governor has publicly criticized Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu\u2019s government and the nature of Israel\u2019s military action in Gaza, but also has backed Israel\u2019s right to defend itself from Hamas.",
      "Hank Butler, executive director of the Pennsylvania Jewish Coalition, said Shapiro\u2019s focus has been Pennsylvania and not the Palestinian people.",
      "\u201cTo say that our governor wishes the worst on the Palestinian people is not welcomed here,\u201d Butler said. \u201cIt is not justified, absolutely not justified -- no attack is justified.\u201d",
      "Shapiro has won statewide races three times in a crucial battleground state. He was a finalist to be Vice President Kamala Harris's running mate in last year's presidential campaign and is considered a potential 2028 Democratic candidate for president.",
      "The attack once again puts his identity front and center. When Harris picked Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz over Shapiro, Republicans tried to cast the pick as a snub to Jewish voters.",
      "Rabbi Rick Jacobs, president of the Union for Reform Judaism, an umbrella group for more than 800 Reform congregations in North America, connected the attack to Shapiro's identity.",
      "\u201cHe\u2019s also someone who is a strong supporter of Israel,\u201d Jacobs said of Shapiro. \"Are those things that put your life at risk in the 21st century?\u201d",
      "Zawatsky, the Tree of Life CEO, noted that in the Passover ritual, Jews are instructed not just to recite the story of their ancient forebears\u2019 liberation from slavery but to envision themselves as having experienced it \u2013 something that feels especially poignant now. Whether law enforcement officials ultimately settle on a definitive conclusion about what motivated last weekend's attack, she and others already know what living in fear feels like.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s very sad to think we pass along the inherited trauma of the fear of antisemitism, but never did I think we would be a generation that would have the lived experience of this kind of violent antisemitism,\u201d she said.",

      "Scores more people are undergoing screening as potential jurors for Harvey Weinstein\u2019s New York rape retrial",
      "NEW YORK -- Scores more people were undergoing screening Thursday as potential jurors for Harvey Weinstein's New York rape retrial.",
      "The panel started taking shape Wednesday, when five women and four men were picked for the redo of the landmark #MeToo-era trial. They were chosen after several stages of screening and questioning, a multistep process that's common for long felony trials in Manhattan. Weinstein's retrial is expected to run at least through the end of May.",
      "A new group of over 80 prospective jurors was brought into court Thursday for the first stage of selection: a show-of-hands response to whether they had schedule conflicts or felt they couldn't be fair and impartial because of the nature of the case.",
      "Weinstein, an Oscar-winning producer and onetime Hollywood power broker, is charged with raping two different women \u2014 an aspiring actor and a production assistant \u2014 on separate occasions. He also is charged with forcing oral sex on another woman.",
      "Weinstein, 73, has pleaded not guilty. He says all his sexual experiences have been consensual.",
      "After allegations about him emerged publicly in 2017 and fueled the #MeToo movement against sexual misconduct, Weinstein faced investigations and prosecutions in multiple places. The ex-movie mogul was convicted of rape at his first New York trial in 2020. Two years later, he was convicted in Los Angeles of a separate rape charge that he also denied.",
      "Then his New York conviction and 23-year prison sentence were overturned by the state's highest court last year. That reversal led to the retrial, where the charges and expected evidence differ somewhat from the original trial.",
      "Prosecutors and defense lawyers are to choose 12 jurors and six alternates.",
      "Judge Curtis Farber is overseeing the painstaking process: The nine jurors selected so far were whittled from roughly 140 people who went through initial screening earlier this week.",
      "Prospective jurors can be excused for various reasons, ranging from language barriers to prior experiences with \u2014 or opinions about \u2014 people or issues in a case. Prosecutors and defense lawyers also get a limited number of chances to eliminate potential jurors without giving a reason.",

      "Ullyot was one of Hegseth\u2019s initial communications office hires and oversaw some of its most highly visible but controversial moves, including a broad edict to the military services to strip away online images that were considered a promotion of diversity, equity or inclusion.",
      "That directive led to public outcry when images of national heroes like Jackie Robinson and others were removed. Ullyot told Politico on Wednesday he had come to the decision to resign. A senior defense official familiar with the decision said that wasn't the case and that Hegseth's office had requested that Ullyot resign.",
      "Ullyot did not immediately respond to a request for comment.",
      "Ullyot\u2019s departure Wednesday was not tied to the Defense Department's ongoing investigation into unauthorized disclosures of information, which so far has led to three other senior Pentagon aides being escorted out of the building.",

      "U.S. District Court Judge Algenon Marbley\u2019s decision came in a lawsuit filed by NetChoice, a trade group representing TikTok, Snapchat, Meta and other major tech companies. The organization's complaint argued that the law unconstitutionally impedes free speech and is overly broad and vague.",

The lawyers asked the judge to order her to be brought to the state by Friday and hold a hearing next week. They said that would allow better communication with her legal team and a doctor to evaluate her. They say Ozturk has suffered five asthma attacks in detention.",
      "Lawyers for Ozturk, 30, had asked an immigration judge that she be released on bond as her immigration case proceeds. That judge denied her request Wednesday, the same day Ozturk had a hearing, they said in a statement released Thursday morning.",
      "The Department of Homeland Security presented one document to support their opposition to Ozturk's bond request: a one-paragraph State Department memo revoking her student visa, her lawyers said in the new court filing.",
      "The memo says that Ozturk\u2019s visa was revoked on March 21 following an assessment that she had been involved in associations \u201d\u2018that may undermine U.S. foreign policy by creating a hostile environment for Jewish students and indicating support for a designated terrorist organization\u2019 including co-authoring an op-ed that found common cause with an organization that was later temporarily banned from campus.\u201d",
      "Ozturk's lawyers said the immigration judge denied bond based on the \u201cuntenable conclusion that Ms. Ozturk was both a flight risk and a danger to the community.\u201d",
      "Messages seeking comment Thursday were emailed to the department and to ICE.",
      "Ozturk, a doctoral student studying child development, was taken by immigration officials as she walked along a street in the Boston suburb of Somerville on March 25. After being taken to New Hampshire and then Vermont, she was put on a plane the next day and moved to an Immigration and Customs Enforcement detention center in Basile, Louisiana.",
      "Ozturk is among several people with ties to American universities whose visas were revoked or have been stopped from entering the U.S. after they were accused of attending demonstrations or publicly expressed support for Palestinians. A Louisiana immigration judge has ruled that the U.S. can deport Columbia University graduate student Mahmoud Khalil based on the federal government\u2019s argument that he poses a national security risk.",
      "Ozturk\u2019s lawyers are challenging the legal authority for ICE\u2019s detention. They also have asked U.S. District Judge William Sessions in Vermont, where her detention case was transferred after lawyers first petitioned for her release in Massachusetts, to take jurisdiction of it and release her.",
      "Sessions, who held a hearing Monday, has not ruled yet.",
      "\u201cThe government\u2019s entire case against R\u00fcmeysa is based on the same one-paragraph memo from the State Department to ICE that just points back to R\u00fcmeysa\u2019s op-ed,\" Marty Rosenbluth, one of Ozturk's attorneys, said in a statement.",

      "Ozturk\u2019s lawyers say her detention violates her constitutional rights, including free speech and due process. They said they didn't know for hours where she was after she was taken. They said they were unable to speak to her until more than 24 hours after she was detained. Ozturk herself said she unsuccessfully made multiple requests to speak to a lawyer.",

      "AmeriCorps NCCC, which completed its 30th year last year, employs more than 2,000 people ages 18 to 26 participating for a roughly 10-month service term, according to the program\u2019s website. The teams of corps members are tasked with working on several projects related to education, housing, urban and rural development, land conservation, and disaster relief, driving from one assignment to another across the country.",
      "The agency pays for volunteers' basic expenses, including housing, meals and a \u201climited health benefit,\u201d as well as a \u201cmodest\u201d living allowance, according to the program. The program also provided members who complete their 1,700-hour service term with funding for future education expenses or to apply to certain student loans. That benefit was worth about $7,300 this service year.",
      "Funding for AmeriCorps and NCCC has long been scrutinized when Congress talks of budget trims. The federal agency\u2019s budget showed NCCC funding amounted to nearly $38 million last fiscal year.",
      "A White House official said the Trump administration questioned using taxpayer money for the program. The official spoke on condition of anonymity because they were not authorized to comment publicly.",
      "The traditional NCCC volunteers worked with sponsors including community and faith-based based organizations, nonprofits, schools, cities and tribes. Some of the recent service projects included working at a food bank in Washington state, building homes with Habitat for Humanity in North Carolina, and facilitating after school programs in Arizona.",
      "AmeriCorps NCCC also has a partnership with the Federal Emergency Management Agency and, more recently, the U.S. Forest Service.

Members would receive their allowance and health coverage through the end of April, according to the memo.",
      "Members were told in the memo that those who have completed 15% or more of their term would be eligible for a prorated amount of their education award.",
      "But Kate Raftery, who was NCCC director from 2011 to 2014, said she's worried about the corps members, many of whom were the \u201cunusual suspects\u201d who \u201csaw this as a really impactful education or career launching pad.\u201d",
      "\u201cThey were not young people who had been striving to be service members somewhere,\u201d Raftery said. \u201cThey were looking for an opportunity to improve their life. They were looking for an opportunity to build some skills, and to be part of a community.\u201d",

    "story": [
      "The General Services Administration has a key role in the Trump administration\u2019s quest to slash costs and bring the federal government to heel",
      "WASHINGTON -- On the rooftop patio of the General Services Administration headquarters, an agency staffer recently discovered something strange: a rectangular device attached to a wire that snaked across the roof, over the ledge and into the administrator\u2019s window one floor below.",
      "It didn\u2019t take long for the employee \u2014 an IT specialist \u2014 to figure out the device was a transceiver that communicates with Elon Musk\u2019s vast and private Starlink satellite network. Concerned that the equipment violated federal laws designed to protect public data, staffers reported the discovery to superiors and the agency\u2019s internal watchdog.",
      "The Starlink equipment raises a host of questions about what Musk and his efficiency czars are doing at GSA, an obscure agency that is playing an outsized role in the Trump administration\u2019s quest to slash costs and bring the federal government to heel.",
      "Among other clues that GSA is a critical cog in Musk's stated efforts to slash billions of dollars in federal spending: people with ties to the entrepreneur or his companies hold key jobs at the agency. Its acting administrator is a Silicon Valley tech executive with expertise in rolling out artificial intelligence tools and a wife who once worked for Musk at his social media company, X.",
      "An engineer at Tesla, the billionaire\u2019s electric car company, runs the GSA\u2019s technology division. And one of Musk\u2019s trusted lieutenants is helping to spearhead the work of downsizing the government\u2019s real estate footprint.",
      "GSA oversees many of Uncle Sam\u2019s real estate transactions, collecting and paying rent on behalf of almost every federal agency. It helps manage billions in federal contracts. And it assists other agencies in building better websites and digital tools for citizens.",
      "It is so important because it is \u201ca choke point for all agencies,\u201d said Steven Schooner, a George Washington University law school professor who specializes in government contracting. \u201cThey can, in effect, stop all civilian agencies from purchasing, period. That\u2019s everything.\u201d",
      "In a statement in early March, GSA said it planned to get rid of \u201cnon-core assets\u201d and welcomed \u201ccreative solutions, including sale-lease backs, ground leases and other forms of public/private partnerships.\u201d",
      "The search for those cuts has engulfed the entire 12,000-person agency. At the helm of that push is the GSA\u2019s acting administrator, Stephen Ehikian, the tech executive whose wife worked for X.",
      "\u201cGSA was built for this moment,\u201d Ehikian told employees last month in a meeting, a video of which was viewed by The Associated Press.",
      "\u201cThis agency is the backbone of federal government operations,\u201d said Ehikian, who is seeking to expand automation \u2014 through the use of artificial intelligence \u2014 of many GSA functions. \u201cWe literally have an impact on the administration\u2019s mandate right now, which is around efficiency.\u201d",
      "Another close Musk adviser \u2014 Nicole Hollander \u2014 is driving the initiative to unload the government\u2019s real estate. Her husband, Steve Davis, is acting as the de facto leader of the Musk-inspired Department of Government Efficiency.",
      "Hollander, who studied business and real estate at George Washington University, is a licensed property manager in Washington, according to LinkedIn. Her profile also lists her as an employee of X since 2023.",
      "In early March, the GSA real estate division released a list of hundreds of government-owned or leased properties it sought to sell in a frenzied rush.",
      "The list drew sharp criticism from Democrats and civil society groups because it proposed the sale of the Justice Department headquarters and included at least one undisclosed Central Intelligence Agency facility. GSA quickly withdrew the list.",
      "That did not stall DOGE's fire sale. In the presentation viewed by the AP, Ehikian said the agency has canceled more than 680 leases, listed or sold at least 32 properties worth $185 million and cut more than $50 billion in contracts.",
      "Hollander has mostly operated behind the scenes. She rarely appears in Zoom meetings, according to employees. Documents obtained by the AP show spreadsheets she creates are stripped of her name and replaced with a more generic \u201cGSA leadership.\u201d",
      "The AP also obtained copies of some event invitations on Hollander\u2019s calendar. They showed Hollander had several meetings with commercial real estate and services firms, including a brokerage firm and a real estate consulting company that helps companies economize their space. She also took meetings with a consortium of Washington technology companies.",
      "Hollander did not respond to a request for comment sent over LinkedIn or through a GSA spokesperson.",
      "It\u2019s not the first time that Hollander has led a cost-cutting campaign for Musk. A lawsuit brought by fired Twitter employees in 2023 alleged that Hollander and Davis were part of a \u201ccadre of sycophants\u201d who were particularly zealous in implementing Musk\u2019s mandate overhaul of the social media company.",
      "The suit claimed the pair, following their boss\u2019 orders, circumvented San Francisco building and safety codes, ignored their obligation to pay vendors and landlords and downsized without regard to the turmoil it caused employees or customers.",
      "The couple, the lawsuit alleged, also lived at Twitter headquarters with their month-old child, mirroring Musk, who has a reputation for living at his company offices. That pattern appears to be repeating at GSA: Hollander has installed cots on the agency\u2019s sixth floor, according to employees.",
      "Attorneys for Musk and X have moved to dismiss the lawsuit, arguing that the Delaware federal court lacks jurisdiction and the lawsuit is legally groundless.",
      "Another employee installed by the Trump administration at GSA worked for Musk at Tesla.",
      "Shortly after taking over GSA\u2019s technology unit, Thomas Shedd told his workforce the goal was to \u201cmove fast and make changes,\u201d according to a transcript of the February meeting obtained by the AP. That's a variation on Facebook founder Mark Zuckerberg\u2019s motto of moving fast and breaking things.",
      "Shedd soon began demanding access to sensitive systems that enable the public to communicate or interact with government services, according to staffers who spoke to the AP on condition of anonymity because they feared reprisal.",
      "Shedd\u2019s request prompted pushback from existing GSA staff. One employee resigned rather than give Shedd access, according to 404 Media.",
      "He also told staff he wanted to consolidate all the government contracts in a centralized database to more easily figure out which ones to eliminate, according to a transcript of the meeting. It\u2019s not clear if he accomplished that goal. Shedd did not reply to emails seeking comment.",
      "He and other GSA officials have also sought to rely more heavily on artificial intelligence. In March, employees were given a demo of a new internal AI chatbot that is designed to more speedily identify contracts and real estate that can be jettisoned. Government agencies like GSA have been hesitant to deploy AI in such ways due to data-security and privacy concerns, according to current and former officials.",
      "It\u2019s not known what role \u2014 if any \u2014 Starlink is playing in GSA\u2019s technological evolution.",
      "On the GSA roof, employees found at least two transceivers, including the one with a wire running to the administrator\u2019s office. It is not clear why the agency is using Starlink. The network provides internet service but is not generally approved for use in most government computer systems.",
      "IT staffers, who reported the discovery to superiors, were concerned that the devices were not authorized to be used at GSA and DOGE might be utilizing them to siphon off agency data, according to internal emails obtained by the AP and a GSA employee who spoke on condition of anonymity out of fear of reprisal.",
      "GSA\u2019s IT staff opened an investigation to see if the terminals were a security threat, and an employee filed a complaint with the GSA\u2019s inspector general, the emails show. The status of those probes could not be determined.",
      "The AP obtained photos \u2014 taken by a GSA employee \u2014 of the transceivers. And an AP staffer, using a telephoto lens, confirmed that a wire runs from the roof to a window to the administrator\u2019s office. NBC reported that several DOGE staffers working out of GSA had begun using Starlink terminals in February. It\u2019s unclear if they\u2019re the same terminals referred for investigation by IT staff in March.",
      "A GSA spokesman confirmed the presence of Starlink transceivers but said they were not connected \u201cto GSA\u2019s internal network, nor was there a security breach.\u201d",
      "To many veterans of the agency, the irony of DOGE\u2019s slash-and-burn approach to GSA is that it is jeopardizing one of the agency\u2019s longstanding missions: improving government efficiency.",
      "The agency, for example, had an in-house consulting shop that during the first Trump administration focused on improving government services, especially those relying on technology. Among its initiatives, the team helped create systems to allow Americans to file taxes online and was working to improve online passport renewal.",
      "In the early weeks of the second Trump administration, DOGE officials gutted the team. Shedd defended that move, telling employees in a meeting that the team was eliminated because its work was not cost-effective, according to a transcript of his remarks.",
      "Any reduction in headcount could also jeopardize the government\u2019s ability to police contracts once they are issued to keep costs down.",
      "Such decisions have baffled those who have tracked GSA\u2019s work.",
      "Amira Boland, a behavioral scientist at GSA during the first Trump administration, said that trimming government was a good idea but described some of DOGE\u2019s cuts as \u201creckless.\u201d",
      "\u201cThere is certainly bureaucracy that needs to be eliminated,\u201d Boland said, \u201cbut you have to know the stakes you\u2019re playing with.\u201d",

      "The bill signed by Republican Gov. Kelly Armstrong bans ranked-choice and approval voting. Ranked-choice voting, in which voters rank their preferred candidates, is used in Alaska and Maine and various cities, but not in North Dakota. Voters select as many candidates as they want under approval voting; the top vote-getters win.",
      "Fargo adopted approval voting via ballot initiative in 2018 and uses the system for electing the mayor and four city commissioners. The measure came after previous elections in which candidates won commission seats with just slivers of the overall vote in crowded races.",
      "In 2018, before approval voting, the winning commission candidates received 18% and 16.5% of the vote, respectively. In the 2024 commission race, the two winners had support from 46% and 44.5% of voters. Three city elections have used approval voting.",
      "Supporters, including Mayor Tim Mahoney, say approval voting works for Fargo. But the bill sponsor, Republican Rep. Ben Koppelman of West Fargo, said the system prefers \u201cvanilla\u201d candidates who don't take hard stances. Republican Secretary of State Michael Howe supported the bill, saying North Dakota needs uniform elections.",
      "In a statement, the governor said: \u201cNow more than ever, we need a consistent, efficient and easy-to-understand voter experience across our entire state to maintain trust in our election system.\"",
      "In 2023, then-Gov. Doug Burgum vetoed a bill from Koppelman to ban Fargo's system. He called the bill state overreach and a blatant infringement on local control. The House overrode the veto but the Senate sustained it.",
      "Fargo's mayor said city officials saw the end result coming, given the Legislature's strong support for the bill.",
      "\u201cThe people of Fargo liked approval voting. It worked for us, but we accept the legislative body. We accept the decision they made,\" Mahoney said.",

      "The showdown between the Trump administration and Harvard University is spotlighting bare-knuckled politics and big dollar figures",
      "NEW YORK -- The showdown between the Trump administration and Harvard University is spotlighting bare-knuckled politics and big dollar figures. But in the battle of the moment, it\u2019s easy to lose sight of a decades-long alliance between the U.S. government and the nation\u2019s most prominent universities, forged to fight a world war.",
      "For eight decades, that interdependence has been prized by academic leaders and politicians of both parties as a paragon for American discovery and innovation.",
      "\u201cIn some ways I think it\u2019s a core part of the story of contemporary America,\u201d said Jason Owen-Smith, a University of Michigan professor who studies the scope of research on the nation\u2019s campuses. \u201cHarvard\u2019s an exemplar, but it\u2019s not the only one.\u201d",
      "That explains the more than $2 billion in multi-year grants and contracts to Harvard frozen this week by administration officials after the school defied their demands to limit activism on campus.",
      "The grants are testament to a system that has its roots in the early 1940s, when the U.S. government began securing cutting edge research through a singular partnership. Federal officials provided money and oversight; institutions, led by big state and private universities, used those billions of dollars to plumb the unknowns of science and technology, while training new generations of researchers.",
      "The partnership delivered wartime innovations including the development of radar at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology and, decades later, the birth at Stanford University of what became Google.",
      "Now the Trump administration is trying something many other chief executives have avoided: imposing ideology on a partnership that has long balanced accountability with independence.",
      "\u201cA lot of Americans are wondering why their tax dollars are going to these universities when they are not only indoctrinating our nation\u2019s students, but also allowing such egregious illegal behavior to occur,\u201d White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt said during a briefing with reporters this week.",
      "But longtime observers of the partnership between government and universities see the administration's actions very differently.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s never been politicized the way the Trump administration is doing it because it\u2019s always had bipartisan support,\u201d says Roger Geiger, a historian of higher education who is retired from Penn State. \u201cIt\u2019s unusual that we don\u2019t see that support now.\u201d",
      "Cutting off Harvard follows similar moves at Columbia and other prominent universities to force compliance. At the same time, Johns Hopkins University surrendered more than $800 million in federal grants for health and medical programs it administers after the administration began dismantling the U.S. Agency for International Development and cut funding by the National Institutes of Health.",
      "The dollar figures for use in domestic laboratories and programs overseas might seem surprising to a public most familiar with big universities as centers of teaching and student life.",
      "But to make sense of the current battle, it helps to understand how government and universities came to be so interdependent.",
      "A century ago, a much smaller community of research universities relied largely on private funding. But as U.S. officials scrambled to prepare for entry into World War II in 1940, a former MIT dean, Vannevar Bush, pitched President Franklin D. Roosevelt on the critical need to marshal defense research by partnering government with scientists at universities and other institutions.",
      "\u201cUrgency in the 1940s was really the overriding motivation,\u201d said G. Pascal Zachary, author of a biography of Bush. \u201cBut the structure proved durable.\u201d",
      "Bush\u2019s agency oversaw the quest for the first nuclear weapons, developed at a laboratory administered by the University of California. And when fighting ended, he prevailed on Roosevelt to expand the research partnership to ensure national security, foster scientific and medical discovery, and grow the economy.",
      "\u201cIt is only the colleges, universities, and a few research institutes that devote most of their research efforts to expanding the frontiers of knowledge,\u201d Bush wrote in a 1945 report to Roosevelt, laying out his plan.",
      "Federal funding for research remained limited, however, until the Soviet Union launched the first artificial satellite in 1957. Determined to catch up, U.S. lawmakers approved a stream of funding for university research and training of new scientists.",
      "\u201cWe were locked into the Cold War, this battle with the Soviet Union, that was in many ways a scientific and technological battle,\u201d said Jonathan Zimmerman, an education historian at the University of Pennsylvania.",
      "Research schools, which number between 150 and 200, used the inflow of federal dollars to build labs and other infrastructure. That growth came as enrollment climbed, with the government\u2019s paying for veterans to attend college through the G.I. Bill and measures in the 1960s to help poorer students.",
      "The partnership between government and universities has always come with a built-in tension.",
      "Federal officials were at the helm, awarding money to projects that meet their priorities and tracking the results. But it is explicit that government officials do not control the work itself, allowing researchers to independently pursue answers to questions and problems, even if they don\u2019t always find them.",
      "\u201cThe government gets to basically treat a generally decentralized national system of universities as a pay-as-you-go resource to get problems solved,\u201d Michigan\u2019s Owen-Smith said.",
      "With that understanding, universities have become the recipient of about 90 percent of all federal research funds, taking in $59.6 billion in 2023, according to the National Center for Science and Engineering Statistics.",
      "That accounts for more than half the $109 billion spent on research at universities, with most of the rest coming from the school themselves, state and local government and nonprofits.",
      "Johns Hopkins has been the single largest grantee, accounting for $3.3 billion in federal spending in 2023. Federal dollars for research at the University of Washington, Georgia Institute of Technology, UC San Diego and Michigan also exceeded more than $1 billion each. Harvard received about $640 million.",
      "Moves by the Trump administration to close agencies and impose changes on campuses present universities with an unprecedented threat.",
      "\u201cGenerations of Hopkins researchers have brought the benefits of discovery to the world,\u201d the school\u2019s president, Ronald J. Daniels, wrote recently. \u201cHowever, a fast and far-reaching cascade of cuts to federal research funding across higher education is badly fraying this long-standing compact.\u201d",
      "The partnership is supposed to be protected by guardrails. Rules specify that officials who believe a school is violating the law can\u2019t just cut funding but must instead present details of alleged violations to Congress.",
      "But the Trump administration, bent on making schools change policies designed to encourage diversity on campuses and crack down on protests, is ignoring those rules, Zimmerman said.",
      "Funding cuts will likely put pressure on schools\u2019 remaining resources, leaving them with less money for things like financial aid to students of modest means, he said. But the bigger danger is to academic freedom of schools to teach and do research as they see fit.",
      "\u201cLet\u2019s remember that in the past three months we\u2019ve seen people\" at universities \"scrubbing their websites for references to certain words,\u201d he said. \u201cThat\u2019s what happens in authoritarian countries.\u201d",

      "WASHINGTON -- Health secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. warned that children in the U.S. are being diagnosed with autism at an \u201calarming rate,\u201d promising on Wednesday to conduct exhaustive studies to identify any environmental factors that may cause the developmental disorder.",
      "His call comes the day after the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention released a report that found an estimated 1 in 31 U.S. children have autism, a marked increase from 2020.",
      "\u201cAutism destroys families,\" Kennedy said. \"More importantly, it destroys our greatest resource, which is our children. These are children who should not be suffering like this.\u201d",
      "Kennedy described autism as a \u201cpreventable disease,\u201d although researchers and scientists have identified genetic factors that are associated with it. Autism is not considered a disease, but a complex disorder that affects the brain. Cases range widely in severity, with symptoms that can include delays in language, learning, and social or emotional skills. Some autistic traits can go unnoticed well into adulthood.",
      "Those who have spent decades researching autism have found no single cause. Besides genetics, scientists have identified various possible factors, including the age of a child\u2019s father, the mother\u2019s weight, and whether she had diabetes or was exposed to certain chemicals.",
      "Kennedy said his wide-ranging plan to determine the cause of autism will look at all of those environmental factors, and others. He had previously set a September deadline for determining what causes autism, but said Wednesday that by then, his department will determine at least \u201csome\u201d of the answers.",
      "The effort will involve issuing grants to universities and researchers, Kennedy said. He said the researchers will be encouraged to \u201cfollow the science, no matter what it says.\u201d",
      "The Trump administration has recently canceled billions of dollars in grants for health and science research sent to universities.",
      "The CDC\u2019s latest autism data was from 14 states and Puerto Rico in 2022. The previous estimate \u2014 from 2020 \u2014 was 1 in 36.",
      "Boys continue to be diagnosed more than girls, and the highest rates are among children who are Asian/Pacific Islander, American Indian/Alaska Native and Black.",
      "To estimate how common autism is, the CDC checked health and school records for 8-year-olds, because most cases are diagnosed by that age. Other researchers have their own estimates, but experts say the CDC\u2019s estimate is the most rigorous and the gold standard.",
      "On Wednesday, Kennedy criticized theories that the rise in autism cases can be attributed to more awareness about the disorder. Autism researchers have cited heightened awareness, as well as medical advancements and increased diagnoses of mild cases.",
      "\u201cThe reasons for increases in autism diagnosis come down to scientific and health care progress,\u201d said Annette Estes, director of the autism center at the University of Washington. \"It's hard for many people to understand this because the causes of autism are complex.\u201d",

      "WASHINGTON -- The Federal Reserve can stay patient and wait to see how tariffs and other economic policies of the Trump administration play out before making any changes to interest rates, Chair Jerome Powell said Wednesday.",
      "\u201cFor the time being, we are well positioned to wait for greater clarity\u201d on the impact of policy changes in areas such as immigration, taxation, regulation, and tariffs, Powell said.",
      "The sharp volatility in financial markets since President Donald Trump announced sweeping tariffs April 2, only to put most of them on hold a week later, has led to speculation about whether the Fed would soon cut its key interest rate or take other steps to calm investors. Yet the Fed is unlikely to intervene unless there is a breakdown in the market for Treasury securities or other malfunctions, economists say.",
      "In written remarks to be delivered to the Economic Club of Chicago, Powell reiterated that the Trump administration's tariffs are \u201csignificantly larger than anticipated.\"",
      "\u201cThe same is likely to be true of the economic effects, which will include higher inflation and slower growth,\u201d he said.",
      "Powell said the inflation will likely be temporary, but \u201ccould also be more persistent,\u201d echoing a concern expressed by a majority of the Fed's 19-member interest rate-setting committee in the minutes of their meeting last month.",
      "Yet some splits among the Fed's interest rate-setting committee have emerged. On Monday, Fed governor Christopher Waller said that he expects the impact of even a large increase in tariffs to be temporary, even if they are left in place for several years. At the same time, he also expects such large duties would weigh on the economy and even threaten a recession.",
      "Should the economy slow sharply, even if inflation remained elevated, Waller said he would support cutting interest rates \u201csooner, and to a greater extent than I had previously thought.\"",
      "But other Fed officials, including Neel Kashkari, president of the Fed's Minneapolis branch, have said they are more focused on fighting the effects of higher tariffs on inflation, suggesting they are less likely to support rate cuts anytime soon.",
      "For now, most recent reports suggest the economy is in solid shape. Hiring has been solid and inflation cooled in March. Yet measures of consumer and business confidence have plunged, raising concerns among economists that spending and business investment could weaken.",

      "SAVANNAH, Ga. -- Georgia's highest court waded Wednesday into a fight between Black landowners and local officials who have weakened long-standing protections for one of the South's last Gullah-Geechee communities founded by freed slaves.",
      "Residents of largely unspoiled Sapelo Island have been trying to roll back zoning changes imposed by McIntosh County officials that doubled the size of homes allowed in a tiny enclave called Hogg Hummock. Homeowners fear the change will bring unaffordable tax increases, threatening one of America's most historically and culturally unique Black communities.",
      "The Georgia Supreme Court heard legal arguments Wednesday on whether residents can attempt to repeal the 2023 zoning amendments by forcing a special election.",
      "Hogg Hummock residents and their supporters last year gathered more than 2,300 petition signatures from registered voters seeking a referendum in the coastal county 60 miles (96 kilometers) south of Savannah.",
      "McIntosh County commissioners sued to stop the referendum. A lower court judge canceled voting less than a week before the election, ruling it was illegal after hundreds had already cast ballots early.",
      "Philip Thompson, an attorney for the Hogg Hummock residents, urged the state Supreme Court to declare that they have a \u201cconstitutional right to a referendum\u201d on the zoning changes so that they can defend a place that's \"a cultural and historical treasure.\u201d",
      "McIntosh County's attorney, Ken Jarrard, argued that zoning powers \u201care absolutely different\u201d from others granted to county governments by Georgia's constitution, and therefore aren't subject to being challenged by referendum.",
      "Roughly 30 to 50 Black residents live in Hogg Hummock, also known as Hog Hammock, a community of dirt roads and modest homes founded by their enslaved ancestors who worked the cotton plantation of Thomas Spalding.",
      "It's among a dwindling number of small communities started by emancipated island slaves \u2014 known collectively as Gullah, or Geechee in Georgia \u2014 scattered along the coast from North Carolina to Florida. Scholars say their separation from the mainland caused these communities to retain much of their African heritage, from their unique dialect to skills and crafts such as cast-net fishing and weaving baskets.",
      "Hogg Hummock earned a place in 1996 on the National Register of Historic Places, the official list of treasured U.S. historic sites. But for protections to preserve the community, residents depend on the local government in McIntosh County, where 65% of the 11,100 residents are white.",
      "Hogg Hummock landowners said they were blindsided in the fall of 2023 when county commissioners voted to relax zoning restrictions enacted decades earlier to help shield the community's Black residents from pressure to sell land held by their families for generations.",
      "Attorneys for McIntosh County say the residents' concerns are overblown, arguing in one court filing that allowing larger homes in their community is so \u201cunremarkable\u201d that it \u201cborders on banal.\u201d",
      "The issues before the Georgia Supreme Court have nothing to do with whether Hogg Hummock deserves special protections. Instead, the justices are being asked to deal with technicalities over whether local zoning laws can be challenged by referendum and whether McIntosh County commissioners had a right to sue to stop the October vote.",
      "The case follows a 2023 ruling by the Georgia justices that upheld a referendum that blocked coastal Camden County from building a launchpad for commercial rockets. The court ruled that a rarely used provision of Georgia's constitution empowers citizens to veto county government decisions at the ballot box.",
      "That decision emboldened Hogg Hummock residents to pursue their own referendum to overturn McIntosh County's zoning changes.",
      "But attorneys for the county commissioners have argued the constitutional provision allowing citizen referendums doesn't apply to local zoning decisions, because zoning powers are addressed in a separate section of the state constitution. They also say the trial court judge was wrong to put the zoning changes on hold pending a ruling by state Supreme Court, which could take six months.",
      "Lawyers for the Hogg Hummock residents say the referendum shouldn't have been interrupted and that county commissioners had no legal standing to sue to stop it, citing the high court's ruling in the spaceport case.",
      "The Supreme Court is weighing the Sapelo Island case as residents recover from an unrelated tragedy.",
      "Hundreds of tourists were visiting the island on Oct. 19 when a walkway collapsed at the state-operated ferry dock, killing seven people. It happened as Hogg Hummock was celebrating its annual Cultural Day festival, a day intended to be a joyful respite from worries about the community\u2019s uncertain future.",

      "What has been banned?",
      "Pork, beef, lamb, mutton, goat, venison and any other products made from these meats - such as sausages - from the EU have been banned. It also applies to pet food.",
      "In addition, milk and dairy products - like butter, cheese and yoghurt - from the EU have also been prohibited.",

      "However, there are exceptions such as chicken, duck, goose and any other products made from these.",
      "Who does the ban apply to?",
      "The measure is only directed at people arriving in Great Britain - as in, England, Wales or Scotland - from the EU.",
      "It does not apply to Northern Ireland, which has its own measures in place to contain foot and mouth disease.",
      "The ban covers anyone travelling by any mode of transport - whether that's by plane, train, bus or by car.",

      "Foot and mouth disease is harmless to humans and there are no cases in the UK -  but it is highly contagious for animals.",
      "It affects cattle, sheep, pigs and, according to the government, \"other cloven-hoofed animals such as wild boar, deer, llamas and alpacas\".",
      "Animals that catch it typically come down with a high temperature before developing blisters, usually around the mouth or feet. It can make animals lame and, for the very young, result in fatalities.",
      "How long will the ban last?",
      "The Department for Environment, Food, and Rural Affairs introduced the measure on Saturday, 12 April and did not give an end date.",
      "The BBC understands the ban will stay in place until the government believes there is no significant risk from travellers bringing banned meat and dairy into Great Britain.",

      "Anyone travelling should follow the rules.",
      "The government says items could be seized and destroyed at the border and, in serious cases, offenders could be fined up to \u00a35,000 in England.",
      "Can I take meat and milk products from the UK into the EU?",
      "No, travellers are not normally allowed to bring meat and milk products into the EU from the UK for personal use.",
      "This has nothing to do with the latest announcement though - it has been the case since Brexit, with the UK facing the same rules as every other non-EU country.",

      "On Instagram it now has 59,000 followers, but a few years ago the firm lost control of the account after a member of its social media team received a message suggesting that the business had been selected to get blue-badge verification from Instagram, which is owned by Facebook's Meta.",
      "This was the stamp of authenticity that Ms Deane had long sought. \"We were obviously very excited about that,\" she says.",
      "So her employee opened a link to what turned out to be a fake Instagram verification form that requested log-in credentials. She filled it in, divulging the username and password, and shortly afterwards the account was taken over by hackers.",
      "What added to Ms Deane's anguish was that she says she had to fight with Meta to get her account back, which took four months.",
      "Initially she filled out the admin dispute form and sent it off, but heard nothing. Multiple emails followed but no action was taken.",
      "\"It's so incredibly frustrating when you're dealing with your account being hacked and there is no-one to talk to,\" she says. \"It's almost traumatising because there is no-one who understands and can help escalate it.\"",
      "Eventually an email came from Meta, telling her that the case was closed, even though she was still unable to access her page.",
      "In the end the matter was finally resolved for Ms Deane because someone in the firm had a contact at Facebook, and the team emailed that person daily for the four months.",
      "\"Finally, I think they just needed to get us off their backs and they reinstated the account,\" says Ms Deane.",
      "According to Jonas Borchgrevink, boss of US-based cyber security firm Hacked.com, Ms Deane is far from a unique case among people with business accounts on Instagram and Facebook.",
      "\"I would say that it is a massive problem,\" says Mr Borchgrevink. \"There are probably thousands every day that are losing their business pages.\"",
      "His company helps firms recover their Instagram and Facebook accounts, and he gets \"10 to 15 clients per week\". \"But those are just the ones that know about us and are able to pay the price, because these cases can take up to six months to sort.\"",
      "The BBC asked Meta to provide some numbers that would reveal the extent of the problem, and how it was tackling it, but it declined.",
      "However, it said in a statement, that \"we take the safety and security of our community seriously and encourage everyone to create a strong password, enable two factor authentication and to be suspicious of emails or messages asking for personal details.",

      "Hackers want to take over business social media accounts for a number of reasons. These including using the pages to sell fake products or place scam adverts, harvesting personal information, spreading malware, tricking people into sending money, or blackmailing the company in question to unblock the account.",

      "\"It has implemented different security measures over the years and yet we still receive the same amount of clients, so I don't think there's been a lot of change there,\" he says.",
      "In fact, with scammers now utilising AI to make their messages seem even more believable, Mr Borchgrevink  thinks the situation could get a lot worse.",
      "He tells the BBC that scammers are behind many of these lock-outs and one of their preferred methods of fooling people is to masquerade as customer support agents.",
      "\"They pretend to be Meta Support and send the business an email saying that they have infringed some kind of copyright or broken terms and conditions in some way, and that they need to verify themselves.",
      "\"The messages have the Facebook logo and are very believable. But when you start to verify your business page, they ask for the password and redirect you to a fake Meta site to steal log-ins.\"",
      "He said that the fraudsters often target a personal Facebook page first, because all business accounts need to be linked to one.",
      "\"Your personal account will also have admin rights to your business account. The scammers go into your business account and transfer the admin rights to their own or to fake profiles.",
      "\"Then they go back to your personal account and disable it by posting inappropriate content like terror-related or pornography-related. That disables your account and makes it really hard to recover either that or your business account.\"",
      "The BBC has also learned of businesses losing access to their Facebook and Instagram accounts despite them not being hacked.",
      "One small business which is part of franchise, told the BBC that they lost access to their account when another franchisee gained a blue-tick verification. As a result of that their account was flagged as a clone.",

    "story": [
      "A Tesla whistleblower who has fought Elon Musk and his company through the courts for years has won the latest round of a long-running legal battle.",
      "Engineer Cristina Balan lost her job after she raised a safety concern in 2014 about a design flaw which could affect the cars' braking.",
      "Her defamation claim against the firm seemed to have run out of road when a judge confirmed an arbitration decision dismissing her case - but a panel of appeal judges in California has reversed this decision in her favour.",
      "She told BBC News she now wants to face Elon Musk and Tesla in open court.",
      "Tesla has not responded to a request for comment.",
      "Ms Balan said she believes the case will now in effect go back to square one, and new proceedings can be launched.",
      "\"We are hoping we will start a new lawsuit and we will have the chance to take on Elon Musk in front of a jury and judge,\" she said.",
      "The engineer was once so prominent at Tesla that her initials were engraved on the batteries inside Model S vehicles.",
      "In an interview with BBC News last year, she said she is determined to prove her innocence for the sake of her son.",
      "She also revealed she was in remission from stage-3B breast cancer, and her biggest worry was she may not live to see her final day in court.",
      "Ms Balan claimed she was worried the carpets were curling underneath some pedals in Tesla models, creating a safety hazard.",
      "She said managers rebuffed her concerns, became hostile, and she lost her job.",
      "She then won a wrongful dismissal case - but this turned out to be the start of a long journey through the courts.",
      "Ms Balan was publicly accused by Tesla of using its resources for a \"secret project\" - accusations which amount to embezzlement, a crime under US law.",
      "She has consistently denied the accusation, and decided to bring a defamation case against the firm in 2019.",
      "\"I want to clear my name,\" she told BBC News last year.",
      "\"I wish Elon Musk had the decency to apologise.\"",
      "A court then decided Ms Balan's case should be subject to arbitration per a contract she signed while working for Tesla.",
      "The arbitrator found in favour of the firm and Musk, dismissing her claims, due to California's statute of limitations - meaning too much time had passed since the alleged defamatory statements were made.",
      "Tesla brought the case back to a district court in California to have the decision confirmed.",
      "However, Ms Balan appealed this decision, and judges from the US Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit found in her favour - in effect deciding the California court did not have the jurisdiction to make its judgement.",
      "They have ordered for the confirmation of the arbitration award to be cancelled, and for the district court to dismiss the action due to its lack of jurisdiction.",
      "What could happen next?",
      "The majority of legal experts the BBC has spoken to believe the case has some way to go before there will be any conclusion.",
      "\"Tesla is among the many corporations that force employees and customers into opaque arbitration processes and deploy aggressive strategies to retaliate against employees who voice criticism of corporate practices,\" said Stanford professor Anat Admati.",
      "And Bill Moran, Ms Balan's attorney, agreed the legal process is far from over.",
      "But he said the case was \"revived\" by the latest ruling.",
      "\"We are confident we can secure her either a new arbitration or alternatively a trial in court so that her case can be heard on the merits after so many years,\" he said.",
      "\"She has fought cancer while waging this case... she is the epitome of strength and resolve, and she is now one step closer to getting the justice she deserves.\"",

      "The average price of petrol fell by 1.6p per litre between February and March to 137.5p per litre.",

      "However, this data is for last month, and analysts suggest it is the \"calm before a storm\".",
      "Exact predictions are difficult, but here are three key areas where inflation is expected to rise.",
      "1. April's bills and costs",
      "A host of household bills went up at the start of April, on top of continued rent rises.",
      "They included utilities such as domestic energy and water. Council tax also rose significantly for millions of people, and there were hikes for many on phone and broadband contracts, as well as the TV licence.",
      "For businesses, the rise in employer National Insurance contributions in April may have led them to immediately put up their prices.",
      "Some of these increased costs will feed into the next set of inflation data published in May. As a result, analysts think this will see the inflation rate quickly climb over 3% (remember the government and Bank of England's target is 2%).",
      "After that, there's significant uncertainty. Commentators suggest inflation may not stay as high, for as long, as previously thought, for reasons we'll come to next.",
      "2. The Donald Trump tariffs effect",
      "The rollercoaster ride of US tariff policy has dominated the headlines and airwaves in the last few weeks.",
      "The US president announced taxes on goods imported into the US from around the world, then rowed back or delayed many, but doubled down on Chinese imports.",
      "Some countries have hit back with tariffs of their own; others - such as the UK - are trying to negotiate.",
      "We are in relatively unknown territory in modern economics and the picture seems to change almost every day, so predictions have to be taken with a large dose of salt.",
      "In theory, when tariffs are announced, and retaliation comes, then higher taxes all round will make goods more expensive for consumers.",
      "But, particularly for the UK, things are far more nuanced. The 10% tariff on UK goods imported by the US is lower than feared, and retaliation looks unlikely.",
      "Indeed, there are heightened expectations of a UK-US trade deal, rather than a trade war.",
      "So, any price rises would be limited.",
      "China is facing massive 145% tariffs on all its goods bound for the US. If that puts up barriers to the US market, it may find other places to sell its - often cheaply manufactured - products, such as the UK.",
      "A so-called dumping of cheap Chinese products in the UK will increase price competition and could slow the rate of inflation.",
      "3. Performance of the UK economy",
      "Growth in the UK economy has been sluggish for some time, although the latest data was more positive than many had expected.",
      "But, again connected to the issue of tariffs, there are warnings that the improvement in UK economic growth could be short-lived with some even predicting a recession.",
      "That's not good news for the government, which has made economic growth its priority.",
      "Nor is it good news for workers, whose job security becomes less stable if businesses draw back on investment and start to cut costs.",
      "No job means less money to spend. That would bring down the inflation rate, but would be small mercy to anyone who is suddenly unemployed.",
      "Alternatively, the government's drive for growth could successfully propel the economy against these headwinds.",
      "And there is even greater pressure on policymakers at the Bank of England to help boost growth by cutting interest rates, lowering the cost of borrowing for loans and mortgages.",
      "Cutting interest rates usually adds to consumer demand, and risks raising prices and the rate of inflation further from its 2% target.",
      "So the Bank's rate-setters face a delicate balancing act for the rest of the year, starting at their next meeting in May, particularly because nobody is sure how much the tightrope is going to wobble.",

      "The Financial Reporting Council (FRC), the UK's accounting regulator, said it will check whether EY met its standards \"with particular reference to matters related to the Horizon IT system\".",
      "The software developed by Fujitsu was at the heart of the Post Office scandal that saw hundreds of postmasters wrongly convicted.",

    "story": [
      "China has unexpectedly appointed a new trade envoy, as officials said the US's practice of \"tariff barriers and trade bullying\" is having a serious impact on the global economic order.",
      "Li Chenggang, a former assistant commerce minister and WTO ambassador, is taking over from veteran trade negotiator Vice Commerce Minister Wang Shouwen.",
      "The shift comes as Beijing refuses to back down in an escalating trade war with Washington triggered by US President Donald Trump's hefty tariffs on Chinese goods.",
      "China's already sluggish economy is bracing for the impact on a key source of revenue - exports.",
      "Beijing announced on Wednesday its GDP grew by 5.4% between January and March, compared with the same period a year earlier.",
      "The figure has exceeded expectations but reflects the period before US tariffs jumped from 10% to 145%, and Chinese officials warned of more economic pain ahead.",
      "While both Washington and Beijing have said they are open to negotiating, neither have made a move to do so yet.",
      "When that happens, Li, 58, will play a key role. He previously served as a deputy permanent representative to the United Nations in Geneva and has held several key jobs in the commerce ministry.",
      "Speaking to Reuters, one expert said the change in jobs was \"very abrupt and potentially disruptive\" given the current trade tensions - adding that Wang also had experience negotiating with US since the first Trump administration.",
      "\"It might be that in the view of China's top leadership, given how tensions have continued escalating, they need someone else to break the impasse... and finally start negotiating,\" said Alfredo Montufar-Helu, a senior adviser to the Conference Board's China Centre.",
      "However, another analyst who spoke to Reuters suggested the move could just be a \"routine promotion\" that just happened to come at a particularly tense period in time.",
      "The US should 'stop whining'",
      "Speaking at a press conference on Wednesday, Sheng Laiyun, deputy commissioner of the National Bureau of Statistics (NBS) warned that US levies would put pressure on China's foreign trade and economy, but added that China's economy is resilient and should improve in the long term.",
      "\"We firmly oppose the US practice of tariff barriers and trade bullying,\" said Sheng.",
      "\"It violates the economic laws and the principles of the World Trade Organization, has a serious impact on the world economic order, and drags down the recovery of the world economy.\"",
      "In an editorial by state news outlet China Daily earlier this week, the outlet described the US's behaviour as \"capricious and destructive\", adding that it should \"stop whining about itself being a victim in global trade\".",
      "\"The US is not getting ripped off by anybody...rather... [it] has been taking a free ride on the globalisation train,\" the editorial went on to say.",
      "Promising growth - but will it last?",
      "Beijing's GDP figures for the first quarter have beaten analysts' expectations - which hovered around 5.1%.",
      "Growth in the world's second-largest economy was underscored by strong retail sales and promising factory output.",
      "But US tariffs on China soared only in recent weeks. Trump raised them to 145% early last week, and Beijing retaliated by raising levies on US goods to 125%.",
      "So some of the expansion could be down to factories rushing out shipments to beat Trump's tariffs - a concept called \"front loading\".",
      "Analysts say a surge in China's exports in March will be sharply reversed in the months ahead as tariffs take full effect.",
      "China's property downturn is also still dragging on growth. Property investment fell by almost 10% in the first three months of 2025 compared to the same period last year.",
      "New home prices also were unchanged compared to the previous month - a sign that there are still too many empty homes, and not enough people buying them.",
      "Officials have said there is ample room for stimulus measures, and plenty of tools that they can use to bolster the economy and roll out more support measures.",

      "The mood music from Washington is that this 10% tariff is not for negotiation with anyone. That is the baseline tariff that has been levied on nearly all of America's trading partners.",
      "Making an exception for one country would simply invite significant trade diversion.",
      "'Good chance' of US-UK trade deal, says Vance",
      "But the UK is in a different position than other nations.",
      "Most countries had faced higher tariffs - as illustrated on Donald Trump's big board - such as on electronics manufacturers in East Asia and they want to keep the levy at the 10% rate.",
      "The net result is that the UK may not have much to negotiate here, and yet is being treated very harshly, given there is no US trade deficit.",
      "Factor in the exemptions for electronics which benefit the likes of China and the fact that cars, a major industry for Britain, are being tariffed at 25% and the UK side has much to complain about.",
      "Another issue is that all this is being done at the same time as the post-Brexit reset negotiations are being outlined ahead of the UK-EU summit next month.",
      "The word is that the UK and EU would like to secure an ambitious deal which aligns closely on export rules. The aim of this reset would be to rid food and farm exports of most red tape.",
      "The US has taken an interest in this in the past. Could the US make it part of their negotiation?",
      "In addition, many US officials have mentioned a desire for allies to join it in containing China.",
      "The US might also try to force a choice on the UK here, or at least encourage action to keep out diverted Chinese goods.",
      "All this would fly in the face of the UK government's entire sell to the world that Britain could be the \"most connected economy in the world\" with strong links into European goods markets, US technology and the east Asia market, including China.",
      "There is a final factor here, which is very intriguing.",
      "Given last week's chaos in financial markets including for US government debt, it is now the case that the US needs these deals, especially the easy pickings with its closest allies.",
      "The UK has more leverage than it did a month ago. The PM may not want to use it but the US cannot afford to make the UK stall or walk away."

    "summary": "America is trying to create a chip industry through isolation and protectionism, when what allowed it to emerge in Asia is the opposite: collaboration.",
    "story": [
      "Listen to this article",
      "The US has \"dropped the ball\" on chip manufacturing over the years, allowing China and other Asian hubs to steam ahead. So said Gina Raimondo, who at the time was the US Commerce Secretary, in an interview with me back in 2021.",
      "Four years on, chips remain a battleground in the US-China race for tech supremacy, and US President Donald Trump now wants to turbocharge a highly complex and delicate manufacturing process that has taken other regions decades to perfect.",
      "He says his tariff policy will liberate the US economy and bring jobs home, but it is also the case that some of the biggest companies have long struggled with a lack of skilled workers and poor-quality products in their American factories.",
      "So what will Trump do differently? And, given that Taiwan and other parts of Asia have the secret sauce on creating high-precision chips, is it even possible for the US to produce them too, and at scale?",
      "Microchips: The secret sauce",
      "Semiconductors are central to powering everything from washing machines to iPhones, and military jets to electric vehicles. These tiny wafers of silicon, known as chips, were invented in the United States, but today, it is in Asia that the most advanced chips are being produced at phenomenal scale.",
      "Making them is expensive and technologically complex. An iPhone for example may contain chips that were designed in the US, manufactured in Taiwan, Japan or South Korea, using raw materials like rare earths which are mostly mined in China. Next they may be sent to Vietnam for packaging, then to China for assembly and testing, before being shipped to the US.",
      "It is a deeply integrated ecosystem, one that has evolved over the decades.",
      "Trump has praised the chip industry but also threatened it with tariffs. He has told industry leader, Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company (TSMC), it would have to pay a tax of 100% if it did not build factories in the US.",
      "With such a complex ecosystem, and fierce competition, they need to be able to plan for higher costs and investment calls in the long term, well beyond Trump's administration. The constant changes to policies aren't helping. So far, some have shown a willingness to invest in the US.",
      "The significant subsidies that China, Taiwan, Japan and South Korea have given to private companies developing chips are a big reason for their success.",
      "That was largely the thinking behind the US Chips and Science Act, which became law in 2022 under President Joe Biden \u2013 an effort to re-shore the manufacture of chips and diversify supply chains - by allocating grants, tax credits, and subsidies to incentivise domestic manufacturing.",
      "Some companies like the world's largest chipmaker TSMC and the world's largest smartphone maker Samsung have become major beneficiaries of the legislation, with TSMC receiving $6.6 billion in grants and loans for plants in Arizona, and Samsung receiving an estimated $6 billion for a facility in Taylor, Texas.",
      "TSMC announced a further $100 billion investment into the US with Trump, on top of $65 billion pledged for three plants. Diversifying chip production works for TSMC too, with China repeatedly threatening to take control of the island.",
      "But both TSMC and Samsung have faced challenges with their investments, including surging costs, difficulty recruiting skilled labour, construction delays and resistance from local unions.",
      "\"This isn't just a factory where you make boxes,\" says Marc Einstein, research director at market intelligence firm Counterpoint. \"The factories that make chips are such high-tech sterile environments, they take years and years to build.\"",
      "And despite the US investment, TSMC has said that most of its manufacturing will remain in Taiwan, especially its most advanced computer chips.",
      "Did China try to steal Taiwan's prowess?",
      "Today, TSMC's plants in Arizona produce high-quality chips. But Chris Miller, author of Chip War: The Fight for the World's Most Critical Technology, argues that \"they're a generation behind the cutting edge in Taiwan\".",
      "\"The question of scale depends on how much investment is made in the US versus Taiwan,\" he says. \"Today, Taiwan has far more capacity.\"",
      "The reality is, it took decades for Taiwan to build up that capacity, and despite the threat of China spending billions to steal Taiwan's prowess in the industry, it continues to thrive.",
      "TSMC was the pioneer of the \"foundry model\" where chip makers took US designs and manufactured chips for other companies.",
      "Riding on a wave of Silicon Valley start-ups like Apple, Qualcomm and Intel, TSMC was able to compete with US and Japanese giants with the best engineers, highly skilled labour and knowledge sharing.",
      "\"Could the US make chips and create jobs?\" asks Mr Einstein. \"Sure, but are they going to get chips down to a nanometre? Probably not.\"",
      "One reason is Trump's immigration policy, which can potentially limit the arrival of skilled talent from China and India.",

      "\"It's a wrench in the machine \u2013 a big wrench,\" says Mr Einstein. \"Japan for example was basing its economic revitalisation on semiconductors and tariffs were not in the business plan.\"",
      "The longer-term impact on the industry, according to Mr Miller, is likely to be a renewed focus on domestic manufacturing in many of the world's key economies: China, Europe, the US.",
      "Some companies could look for new markets.

      "However, they still have to pay a mortgage rate of well over 5% on average, while a borrower who pays a 40% deposit typically pays a rate of under 5%.",

      "Sales were agreed on half of homes within two months of being listed, it said. To complete a sale, sellers and buyers will typically need another four to six months, depending on the complexity of the transaction.",
      "The fastest sales were agreed for two-bedroom homes, at an average of 23 days, while homes with four bedrooms or more typically took an extra 15 days.",

      "Coking coal and iron ore from the US arrived at Immingham docks on Tuesday to be transported to British Steel's Scunthorpe site.",

      "Turning off a blast furnace without making it permanently unusable is notoriously difficult.",
      "The furnaces operate at extreme temperatures, with iron ore and coking coal poured in at the top and liquid iron extracted at the bottom. This iron goes to the steel plant to make steel.",
      "If a furnace stops working, the molten metal will cool and solidify. This is called a \"salamander\".",
      "When the furnace is turned back on this metal heats up again and expands which can crack the furnace.",
      "A so-called \"Salamander Tap\" process can be used to temporarily shut down a blast furnace by drilling a hole to remove any remaining hot metal. However, this can be a dangerous process.",

      "This means British Steel has not been nationalised - which is when a government takes ownership and control of a company.",
      "However, the business secretary acknowledged that public ownership was \"the likely option\" as there are currently no companies willing to buy the plant.",
      "If British Steel is nationalised, taxpayers' money will be used to run it. Reynolds says it is currently making an annual net loss of \u00a3233m, but had the furnaces been allowed to shut the cost to the taxpayer would be higher.",

      "\"We are hoping as you know to bring in a private sector partner as part of the future of Scunthorpe but those conversations are ongoing,\" she added.",
      "Why is the Scunthorpe plant losing money?",
      "In late March 2025, Jingye said the plant was losing around \u00a3700,000 a day and launched a consultation on its closure.",
      "It said the blast furnaces were \"no longer financially sustainable,\" blaming \"highly challenging\" market conditions, tariffs and costs associated with moving to lower-carbon production techniques.",
      "UK steel production has been falling for several decades and the financial pressures facing the industry were heightened in March when the US imposed a 25% tariff on any steel it imports.",
      "Global over-production has created \"a glut of steel on the international market\", according to a UK government UK government briefing, which has pushed prices down. British manufacturers also face higher costs, particularly on electricity, than elsewhere.",

    "link": "https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c1drqeev36qo",
    "published": "Thu, 17 Apr 2025 00:15:59 GMT",
    "summary": "As the trade war continues to escalate, China has hit back at Trump by suspending exports of rare earth minerals.",
    "story": [
      "As the trade war between China and the US escalates, attention has been focused on the increasingly high levels of tit-for-tat tariffs the two countries are imposing on one another.",
      "But slapping reciprocal tariffs on Washington is not the only way Beijing has been able to retaliate.",
      "China has now also imposed export controls on a range of critical rare earth minerals and magnets, dealing a major blow to the US.",
      "The move has laid bare how reliant America is on these minerals.",
      "This week, Trump ordered the commerce department to come up with ways to boost US production of critical minerals and cut reliance on imports - an attempt by Washington to reclaim this critical industry.  But why exactly are rare earths so important and how could they shake up the trade war?",
      "What are rare earths and what are they used for?",
      "\"Rare earths\" are a group of 17 chemically similar elements that are crucial to the manufacture of many high-tech products.",
      "Most are abundant in nature, but they are known as \"rare\" because it is very unusual to find them in a pure form, and they are very hazardous to extract.",
      "Although you may not be familiar with the names of these rare earths - like Neodymium, Yttrium and Europium - you will be very familiar with the products that they are used in.",
      "For instance, Neodymium is used to make the powerful magnets used in loudspeakers, computer hard drives, EV motors and jet engines that enable them to be smaller and more efficient.",
      "Yttrium and Europium are used to manufacture television and computer screens because of the way they display colours.",
      "\"Everything you can switch on or off likely runs on rare earths,\" explains Thomas Kruemmer, Director of Ginger International Trade and Investment.",
      "Rare earths are also critical to the production of medical technology like laser surgery and MRI scans, as well as key defence technologies.",
      "What does China control?",
      "China has a near monopoly on extracting rare earths as well as on refining them - which is the process of separating them from other minerals.",
      "The International Energy Agency (IEA) estimates that China accounts for about 61% of rare earth production and 92% of their processing.",
      "That means it currently dominates the rare earths supply chain and has the capacity to decide which companies can and cannot receive supplies of rare earths.",
      "Both the extraction and processing of these rare earths are costly and polluting.",
      "All rare earth resources also contain radioactive elements, which is why many other countries, including those in the EU, are reluctant to produce them.",
      "\"Radioactive waste from production absolutely requires safe, compliant, permanent disposal. Currently all disposal facilities in EU are temporary,\" says Mr Kruemmer.",
      "But China's dominance in the rare earth supply chain didn't take place overnight - but rather, is the result of decades of strategic government policies and investment.",
      "In a visit to Inner Mongolia in 1992, the late Chinese leader Deng Xiaoping, who oversaw China's economic reform, famously said: \"The Middle East has oil and China has rare earths\".",
      "\"Beginning in the late 20th century, China prioritised the development of its rare earth mining and processing capabilities, often at lower environmental standards and labour costs compared to other nations,\" said Gavin Harper, a critical materials research fellow at the University of Birmingham.",
      "\"This allowed them to undercut global competitors and build a near-monopoly across the entire value chain, from mining and refining to the manufacturing of finished products like magnets.\"",
      "How has China restricted exports of these minerals?",
      "In response to tariffs imposed by Washington, China earlier this month began ordering restrictions on the exports of seven rare earth minerals - most of which are known as \"heavy\" rare earths, which are crucial to the defence sector.",
      "These are less common and are harder to process than \"light\" rare earths, which also makes them more valuable.",
      "From 4 April, all companies now have to get special export licenses in order to send rare earths and magnets out of the country.",
      "That is because as a signatory to the international treaty on the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons, China has the ability to control the trade of \"dual use products\".",
      "According to the Centre for Strategic and International Studies (CSIS), this leaves the US particularly vulnerable as there is no capacity outside China to process heavy rare earths.",
      "How could this impact the US?",
      "A US Geological report notes that between 2020 and 2023, the US relied on China for 70% of its imports of all rare earth compounds and metals.",
      "This means that the new restrictions have the ability to hit the US hard.",
      "Heavy rare earths are used in many military fields such as missiles, radar, and permanent magnets.",
      "A CSIS report notes that defence technologies including F-35 jets, Tomahawk missiles and Predator unmanned aerial vehicles all depend on these minerals.",
      "It adds that this comes as China \"expands its munitions production and acquires advanced weapons systems and equipment at a pace five to six times faster than the United States\".",
      "\"The impact on the US defence industry will be substantial,\" said Mr Kroemmer.",
      "And it's not only in the field of defence.",
      "US manufacturing, which Trump has said he hopes to revive through the imposition of his tariffs, stand to be severely impacted.",
      "\"Manufacturers, particularly in defence and high-tech, face potential shortages and production delays due to halted shipments and limited inventories,\" said Dr Harper.",
      "\"Prices for critical rare earth materials are expected to surge, increasing the immediate costs of components used in a wide range of products, from smartphones to military hardware,\" he says, adding that this could result in potential production slowdowns for affected US companies.",
      "If such a shortage from China persists in the long-run, the US could potentially begin diversifying its supply chains and scaling up its domestic and processing capabilities, though this would still require \"substantial and sustained investment, technological advancements and potentially higher overall costs compared to the previous dependence on China\".",
      "And it's clear this is something already on Trump's mind. This week, he ordered an investigation into the national security risks posed by the US' reliance on such  critical minerals.",
      "\"President Trump recognises that an overreliance on foreign critical minerals and their derivative products could jeopardise US defence capabilities, infrastructure development, and technological innovation,\" said the order.",
      "\"Critical minerals, including rare earth elements, are essential for national security and economic resilience.\"",
      "China's precious metals the US can't do without",
      "What are 'rare earths' used for?",
      "Can't the US produce its own rare earths?",
      "The US has one operational rare earths mine, but it does not have the capacity to separate heavy rare earths and has to send its ore to China for processing.",
      "There used to be US companies that manufactured rare earth magnets - until the 1980s, the US was in fact the largest producer of rare earths.",
      "But these companies exited the market as China began to dominate in terms of scale and cost.",
      "This is largely believed to be part of why US president Donald Trump is so keen to sign a minerals deal with Ukraine - it wants to reduce dependency on China.",
      "Another place Trump has had his eye on is Greenland - which is endowed with the eighth largest reserves of rare earth elements.",
      "Trump has repeatedly showed interest in taking control of the autonomous Danish dependent territory and has refused to rule out economic or military force to take control of it.",
      "These might have been places that the US could have sourced some of its rare earth exports from, but the adversarial tone Trump has struck with them means the US could be left with very few alternative suppliers.",
      "\"The challenge the U.S. faces is two-fold, on the one hand it has alienated China who provides the monopoly supply of rare earths, and on the other hand it is also antagonising many nations that have previously been friendly collaborators through tariffs and other hostile actions,\" said Dr Harper.",
      "\"Whether they will still prioritise collaboration with America remains to be seen in the turbulent policy environment of this new administration.\""

      "Finland's right-wing coalition, which came into power in 2023, is on a mission to push the country even further up global indices, stating in its official government programme that it wants the Nordic nation to become a leader in fostering a dynamic start-up and growth company ecosystem.",
      "\"It's not just about rankings,\" says Marjo Ilmari, who runs the start-up services team at Business Finland, the government agency that promotes investment and innovation.",

      "One likely reason for the dip, says Mr Pentikainen, is a decision to raise VAT from 24% to 25.5% last September, the highest rate in western Europe. The government said this was a \"difficult but necessary\" move designed to stabilise public finances.",
      "But Mr Pentikainen suggests it could make Finland's start-up ecosystem less competitive for international founders.",
      "The Finnish government has also recently toughened up citizenship requirements, meaning foreign entrepreneurs now need to stay at least eight years instead of five in order to obtain a passport, and will soon also be required to pass a test on Finnish society and culture if they want to settle long-term.",

    "summary": "A Guyanese political commentator says Washington objects to Beijing's \"very strong foothold\" in the country.",
    "story": [
      "The Caribbean nation of Guyana is breathing a sigh of relief after US President Donald Trump announced a 90-day pause on the introduction of higher tariffs on a number of countries.",
      "Guyana, which is nestled between Venezuela and Suriname on the South American mainland, had been singled out for rates of 38% on many of its exports.",
      "Following Trump's change in policy, it now faces tariffs of only 10% - the same as all countries apart from Canada, China and Mexico.",
      "But why had Guyana been facing a higher levy in the first place?",
      "Guyanese political commentator Francis Bailey says the country is caught in a geopolitical battle between the US and China. Or more specifically - Washington objects to Beijing's \"very strong foothold\" in Guyana.",
      "Recent years have seen billions of dollars of investment in Guyana by Chinese entities, in everything from roads and hospitals, to hotels and shopping centres. And a crucial new bridge linking the capital Georgetown to the western region of Demerara-Mahaica is currently under construction by a Beijing-based company.",
      "For its part, the US continues to be happy to buy Guyana's key exports of crude oil, gold and bauxite, which is the ore from which aluminium is extracted. These were all to be exempt from the planned 38% tariff, which instead would have hit Guyana's fishing and sugar industries.",
      "The US also backs Guyana in its territorial dispute with Venezuela over the vast Essequibo region that forms the western two thirds of Guyana. During a visit to Georgetown in March, Secretary of State Marco Rubio warned Venezuela of \"consequences\" if it were to use force against Guyana.",
      "But the planned high tariff showed Washington's ire, says Mr Bailey. \"I think the reason we had been given such high tariffs is to apply pressure on Guyana.",
      "\"The US is saying, 'if you want our protection you need to chase the Chinese out of your country'. Trump is a very transactional president \u2013 and Guyana is in a very precarious position against its sabre-rattling adversary Venezuela which has been ramping up acts of aggression.\"",
      "The Guyanese government did not respond to requests for comments. The country, once one of the poorest nations in the western hemisphere, and a former British colony, has been enjoying a surge in wealth since it first discovered oil in its territorial waters in 2015.",
      "Last year it exported $3.13bn (\u00a32.4bn) of crude oil to the US, according to United Nations figures.",
      "Across the Caribbean all countries now face a 10% tariff on their exports to the US. However, it is the price impact of Trump's global tariffs on what they import from the US that is of most concern.",
      "This is because the Caribbean's love for, and reliance on, US products is immediately apparent when you glance at a High Street or supermarket shelf across the region. In fact, some islands are said to import as much as 70% of their consumer goods from their North American neighbour.",
      "And with American goods that rely on overseas raw materials or components set to go up in price, this will inevitably be passed on to consumers in the Caribbean.",
      "Also, much of what Caribbean nations buy from other countries around the world comes to them via the US.",
      "So with the White House now hitting Chinese goods coming into the US with tariffs of 125%, Chinese items that are then reexported to the Caribbean should see price hikes of a similar amount. And by around 10% for goods from other countries that arrive via the US.",
      "With already ever-increasing shipping costs in the Caribbean, and high local import duties causing exorbitant prices in a region beset by low wages, the impact of Trump's tariffs could be profound and keenly felt.",
      "In Antigua and Barbuda, interior designer Carissa Warner tells the BBC that 70% of her materials are imported from the US, and 20% from China.",
      "\"Some of my projects are on hold while we wait to see what happens,\" she explains. \"I am extremely worried from a business aspect but also just as a local consumer.",
      "\"I'm so worried about the cost of food I have been looking online for pots to start growing fresh produce. I don't think people realise the impact it will have on us.\"",
      "Ms Warner believes one way Caribbean governments could ease the squeeze on their people is by lowering their own import duties, which are partially calculated using a percentage of an item's cost.",
      "Antigua and Barbuda's Prime Minister Gaston Browne has dubbed global tariffs \"extremely worrisome\" and is urging citizens to \"buy smarter and buy local\".",
      "Trump's tariffs come as the Caribbean is already grappling with a confluence of harsh economic conditions from the cost of cleaning up after frequent natural disasters like hurricanes, to the aftereffects of the Covid pandemic.",
      "Antigua and Barbuda's ambassador to the US, Sir Ronald Sanders, says that the US has long enjoyed a trade surplus with most Caribbean countries.",
      "\"For decades, we have helped sustain American prosperity by collectively importing far more from the United States than we export,\" he says.",
      "\"The problem we have created for ourselves is that we have been dependent on the US market for such a long time and have not sought to diversify into other markets.\"",
      "As for the 10% tariff on Caribbean exports to the US, Sir Ronald says: \"Any loss is not a good thing for our small economies, but the 10% that we face is not going to disrupt our goods from going to the US market.\"",
      "The Caribbean islands' small market sizes, high labour costs and remoteness from principle markets has kept their manufacturing sectors relatively modest. Their exports include many niche products like specialist rums and indigenous foods such as ackee, a fruit from Jamaica.",
      "\"These kinds of products are all orientated to a certain kind of market and will not face any competition because the US does not produce them, and the countries that do face their own tariffs,\" Sir Ronald continues.",
      "Exacerbating worries in the Caribbean are potential additional taxes on Chinese-built ships entering US ports of up to $1.5m per docking. This idea was mooted by the White House in February.",
      "Many fear that will aggravate freight costs in the Caribbean, and lead to further hikes in the price of everyday goods, given the large volume of items sold in the region that are manufactured in China.",
      "Sir Ronald adds that tacking the problem of an overreliance on the US \"can only come from diversifying the market, but that's not an overnight achievement\".",
      "He adds: \"It's not as easy to set up new markets as people think. It's not governments who control trade; it's the private sector. And much of what we buy will still come via the US.\"",
      "Many Caribbean leaders feel the best strategy to thwart the fallout from tariffs is to negotiate as a bloc.",
      "Mia Mottley, chair of the intergovernmental group Caricom, said the region was facing the most challenging of times since its 15 member states gained independence several decades ago.",
      "\"We are working and will continue to work to become more self-sufficient, but\u2026 this trade war will mean higher prices for all of us,\" she said in a recent statement.",
      "Ms Mottley added that it was vital to redouble efforts to \"invest in Caribbean agricultural production and light manufacturing\".",
      "\"We must build our ties with Africa, Central and Latin America, and renew those ties with some of our older partners around the world, in the United Kingdom and Europe, and in Canada. We must not rely solely on one or two markets.\"",
      "Ms Mottley, who is also the prime minister of Barbados, is calling for Washington to \"work with\" the Caribbean to keep prices down.",

      "The rate of rising prices - inflation - has eased for the second month in a row, official figures show.",

      "Petrol and toy prices have fallen, a relief for drivers and parents, while food prices are unchanged.",
      "However, this data is for last month, and analysts suggest it is the \"calm before a storm\".",
      "Exact predictions are difficult, but here are three key areas where inflation is expected to rise.",
      "1. April's bills and costs",
      "A host of household bills went up at the start of April, on top of continued rent rises.",
      "They included utilities such as domestic energy and water. Council tax also rose significantly for millions of people, and there were hikes for many on phone and broadband contracts, as well as the TV licence.",
      "For businesses, the rise in employer National Insurance contributions in April may have led them to immediately put up their prices.",
      "Some of these increased costs will feed into the next set of inflation data published in May. As a result, analysts think this will see the inflation rate quickly climb over 3% (remember the government and Bank of England's target is 2%).",
      "After that, there's significant uncertainty. Commentators suggest inflation may not stay as high, for as long, as previously thought, for reasons we'll come to next.",
      "2. The Donald Trump tariffs effect",
      "The rollercoaster ride of US tariff policy has dominated the headlines and airwaves in the last few weeks.",
      "The US president announced taxes on goods imported into the US from around the world, then rowed back or delayed many, but doubled down on Chinese imports.",
      "Some countries have hit back with tariffs of their own; others - such as the UK - are trying to negotiate.",
      "We are in relatively unknown territory in modern economics and the picture seems to change almost every day, so predictions have to be taken with a large dose of salt.",
      "In theory, when tariffs are announced, and retaliation comes, then higher taxes all round will make goods more expensive for consumers.",
      "But, particularly for the UK, things are far more nuanced. The 10% tariff on UK goods imported by the US is lower than feared, and retaliation looks unlikely.",
      "Indeed, there are heightened expectations of a UK-US trade deal, rather than a trade war.",
      "So, any price rises would be limited.",
      "China is facing massive 145% tariffs on all its goods bound for the US. If that puts up barriers to the US market, it may find other places to sell its - often cheaply manufactured - products, such as the UK.",
      "A so-called dumping of cheap Chinese products in the UK will increase price competition and could slow the rate of inflation.",
      "3. Performance of the UK economy",
      "Growth in the UK economy has been sluggish for some time, although the latest data was more positive than many had expected.",
      "But, again connected to the issue of tariffs, there are warnings that the improvement in UK economic growth could be short-lived with some even predicting a recession.",
      "That's not good news for the government, which has made economic growth its priority.",
      "Nor is it good news for workers, whose job security becomes less stable if businesses draw back on investment and start to cut costs.",
      "No job means less money to spend. That would bring down the inflation rate, but would be small mercy to anyone who is suddenly unemployed.",
      "Alternatively, the government's drive for growth could successfully propel the economy against these headwinds.",
      "And there is even greater pressure on policymakers at the Bank of England to help boost growth by cutting interest rates, lowering the cost of borrowing for loans and mortgages.",
      "Cutting interest rates usually adds to consumer demand, and risks raising prices and the rate of inflation further from its 2% target.",
      "So the Bank's rate-setters face a delicate balancing act for the rest of the year, starting at their next meeting in May, particularly because nobody is sure how much the tightrope is going to wobble.",

      "It then thinks inflation will drop back towards the 2% target towards the end of 2027, having previously predicted this would happen earlier in the year.",
      "The Bank also considers other measures, external, such as \"core inflation\" when deciding whether and how to change rates.",
      "Core inflation doesn't include food or energy prices because they tend to be very volatile, so can be a better indication of longer term trends.",
      "This was 3.4% in January, down slightly from 3.5% in February.",

      "From the end of April, the 500-year-old Royal Mail will be controlled by a Czech billionaire who co-owns a football club and is a major investor in a British supermarket - so, why would he want this ailing institution?",
      "\"A pair of scissors, one empty teapot and some hot water, please.\" The slightly baffled staff at Claridge's scrambled to comply with Daniel Kretinsky's breakfast order as he sanitised and moisturised his hands.",
      "The upscale hotel has been serving tea to the global elite for decades but Mr Kretinsky brought along his own packet of Chinese green tea, which he snipped open (hence the scissors) and poured into the empty pot.",
      "He was tall, perfectly groomed, steely-eyed but unfalteringly polite and thoughtful. If you told anyone in the dining room he was a billionaire, they would have no problem believing it.",
      "Known as the Czech Sphinx for his enigmatic style, Mr Kretinsky, who is 49, is worth \u00a36bn according to the Sunday Times Rich List. He lives in plush mansions in Paris and London, was originally a lawyer and made his fortune in European energy markets.",
      "Our meeting was at Claridge's in June 2024 - I was trying to convince him to give me an interview about his audacious attempt to buy a British institution that was once seen as a national treasure: Royal Mail.",
      "His profile as a buyer was one that unions and ministers typically would be wary of because of his historic connections with Russia - his companies own a gas pipeline that has transported Russian gas to Europe.",
      "But six months on, his bid to buy Royal Mail's parent company was cleared by the UK government after he agreed \"legally binding\" undertakings.",
      "The government was awarded a so-called \"golden share\", requiring it to be notified of any major changes to Royal Mail's ownership, headquarters location and tax residency. The deal was also blessed by unions.",
      "Earlier this month, the owner of Royal Mail said that the takeover could be completed by the end of April as the deal cleared the final regulatory hurdles standing in the way.",
      "But step back and Royal Mail seems a strange target for a globally mobile oil and gas billionaire investor to set his sights on. It begs the question why would anyone, let alone a successful international entrepreneur, want to buy this faded relic?",
      "How Royal Mail's crown slipped",
      "Royal Mail was founded by Henry VIII more than 500 years ago and still carries the royal cipher on its vans. It is part of the fabric of British life and many people still have a fond relationship with their 'postie', who walks down their path bringing their letters and parcels to their door.",
      "But in recent years Royal Mail's crown has slipped. It is losing money and market share, has been fined for missing delivery targets and has made an enemy of its own workforce through a series of bitter strikes.",
      "Royal Mail's letter business is in steep decline too. It has gone from a peak of 20 billion letters sent in 2004 to under seven billion sent last year.",
      "In December 2024, it was fined \u00a310.5m by the regulator Ofcom for failing to meet delivery targets for first and second class mail.",
      "While the boom in e-commerce has seen the volume of parcels rise, Royal Mail's share of that more profitable business has been falling as new competitors like DPD, DHL, Amazon and Evri have eaten into its market share.",
      "Royal Mail was split off from the Post Office in 2012 and privatised in 2013 at a value of \u00a33.3bn. Its shares immediately rocketed by 38% on the first day of trading, leading to criticism - from the National Audit Office, among others - that it had been sold on the cheap.",
      "At its peak in Covid-era May 2021, the company was worth more than \u00a36bn but had slumped to just over \u00a32bn when Mr Kretinsky launched his takeover bid last April.",
      "He sealed the deal at \u00a33.6bn - 63% higher than before he signalled his intent, but barely more than it was worth at privatisation over a decade ago.",
      "\"Royal Mail is a business that has historically found it difficult to grow revenues by more than costs,\" says Alex Paterson, an analyst at Peel Hunt stockbrokers. \"It has seen its parcels market share eroded by more dynamic competition that has been able to invest more in technology, and it has struggled with industrial relations to keep staff working towards a common goal.",
      "\"This is not a challenge to underestimate nor one that can be overcome quickly, but that requires considerable long-term investment in infrastructure, technology and staff.\"",
      "Part of the challenge, and one that puts Royal Mail at a disadvantage compared with its rivals, is that unlike them, Royal Mail has to meet a string of legal and regulatory obligations, says Hazel King, the editor of Parcel and Post Technology International.",
      "Under what is called the universal service obligation (USO), Royal Mail is required by law to deliver letters six days a week and parcels five days a week to every address in the UK. So it cannot pick and choose which business it wants to do.",
      "\"Royal Mail must meet their universal service obligation while trying to compete with private firms who often cherry-pick the most profitable business,\" says Ms King.",
      "The 'Czech Sphinx's' plan",
      "Mr Kretinsky says he has a plan. His success in the energy sector allowed him to buy a 27.5% stake in Royal Mail's parent company, International Distribution Services (IDS). And his company \u2013 EP Group \u2013 intends to build a pan-European conglomerate built on three pillars: energy, retail and logistics.",
      "He sees IDS as the cornerstone of the logistics pillar, with a plan to go toe-to-toe with the likes of Deutsche Post DHL, DPD and Amazon.",
      "The USO has been under review by Ofcom, with Royal Mail hoping that the regulator will reduce the requirement to deliver second-class letters from six days a week to every other weekday. That single move could save Royal Mail \u00a3300m a year \u2013 putting it back on a break-even footing.",
      "Mr Kretinsky told me during our interview that he would honour the USO \"as long as I am alive\", but he is unsurprisingly very much in favour of changing its terms. He said he hopes that \"rational minds prevail\" when reforming a service that is unsustainable in its current form.",
      "So far, the noises from Ofcom seem to be supportive. The regulator's chief executive Dame Melanie Dawes told the BBC there were \"real questions about what the service needs to be going into the future\".",
      "Given letter numbers are falling, \"we have to think about what is economical\", she said, adding Ofcom would be publishing plans for the regulation of Royal Mail \"to make sure it is sustainable\".",
      "While Royal Mail generally welcomed the proposed changes to the Universal Service Obligation, Royal Mail pushed back against proposed new delivery time and business customer requirements.",
      "Royal Mail said last week that the level at which Ofcom is proposing to set the new delivery targets \u2013 99.5% of First Class letters delivered within three days, and the same percentage of Second Class letters within five \u2013 is \"over specified and will add significant cost to the delivery of the Universal Service\".",
      "It also expressed concerns that proposals to add a new category of regulation to ensure timely delivery for business users like direct mail companies \"goes against the wider government drive to reduce unnecessary regulation\".",
      "European parcel know-how",
      "But there are other factors that may have driven the sale. Some analysts have speculated that there is another jewel in the crown of IDS - and that Mr Kretinsky may really be after a different part of the business.",
      "Along with Royal Mail, IDS also owns a European parcels business called GLS which it acquired in 1999 \u2013 long before Royal Mail was split off from the Post Office and privatised.",
      "Last year GLS made a profit of \u00a3320m, compared to Royal Mail, which lost \u00a3348m as letter volumes continued to plunge and new competitors ate into its market share of the more profitable parcels business.",
      "\"GLS has been a profitable growth business, which has seen investment whereas Royal Mail has been a perpetual underperformer, as the board of parent company IDS has invested where it thinks it will see the best returns,\" says Mr Paterson.",
      "Mr Kretinsky rejects suggestions from some quarters that he wants to break up the group and has committed to keeping it together for at least five years. Even beyond that, he says the plan is to grow the company rather than shrink it, so a disposal of GLS would be \"nonsensical\".",
      "In fact, Mr Kretinsky says he hopes to bring the European parcel know-how at GLS to bear on Royal Mail's operations.",
      "What the unions are hoping, and Kretinsky is promising, is that Royal Mail will see greater investment and over time begin to look a bit more like GLS and its European counterparts such as Deutche Post DHL.",
      "Catching up with competitors",
      "Given all the challenges Royal Mail faces, there's an obvious question - why would a billionaire want to chance his arm on turning round something that others couldn't, while up against powerful competitors?",
      "Well, if you believe as Kretinsky does - and he is surely right - that getting parcels to people is a profitable and growing industry, then buying Royal Mail and GLS gives you a way to become a big European player in logistics quickly.",
      "Add to that a powerful and historic brand, a database with every single UK address and a frontline workforce that most of its customers are fond of and pleased to see when they walk down the path - then, despite the challenges, it begins to make sense.",
      "Mr Kretinsky is convinced future growth lies in out-of-home (OOH) delivery. The parcel lockers found in supermarket car parks and elsewhere, operated by the likes of Amazon, Evri and UPS, have grown quickly across Europe.",
      "Earlier this month it was reported that Sainsbury's would be the first supermarket to partner with Royal Mail and install parcel lockers at supermarkets. Some are already operating at several stores including ones in Clapham, Kidderminster and Chislehurst.",
      "Royal Mail has also trialled a new postbox that can take small parcels. Customers procure a barcode from an app, then at the postbox they scan the barcode and drop the parcel into a drawer - this is all powered by solar panels on the box.",
      "Emma Gilthorpe, Royal Mail chief executive, called it an \"historic change\" to give postboxes \"a new lease of life\".",
      "All of this boils down to the same thing: convenience. It means customers don't have to wait at home for a delivery - the sender or parcel business emails or texts a code to unlock the locker. For the business it's more efficient, allowing couriers to deliver lots of parcels to one place - meaning fewer miles on the road and less time.",
      "\"If they can grow the parcels business and claw back market share, there is every chance that they can add new jobs that could offset the reduction in jobs in the declining letters business,\" says Mr Paterson.",
      "\"There is a significant long-term opportunity to run Royal Mail more successfully with regulatory changes to the USO and greater investment in technology and out-of-home deliveries.\"",
      "But Royal Mail still has a lot of catching up to do with its competitors. It currently has 1,500 lockers in the UK and aims to grow this figure to at least 20,000 over time. By contrast, Amazon already has 5,000 lockers across the UK and InPost has 7,500 across the UK.",
      "Winning over doubters",
      "That Mr Kretinsky has pulled off the takeover is no easy feat. Royal Mail is, after all, considered vital national infrastructure and as such the deal required review under national security laws.",
      "Then there is the fact that his companies own a gas pipeline that has transported Russian gas to Europe \u2013 paid for and approved by EU member states. The small amount that was transported was reduced to zero at the end of 2024 when Ukraine refused to renew permission for any gas to flow across its borders.",
      "Speaking in front of MPs in November, UK Business Secretary Jonathan Reynolds referred to Mr Kretinsky as a \"legitimate business figure\" whose alleged links to Russia had already been reviewed and dismissed when he became the biggest shareholder in the company two years ago.",
      "Getting the unions on board seemed even more of a challenge and the Communication Workers Union was wary of Mr Kretinsky. \"The CWU believes Royal Mail should be in public hands,\" Dave Ward, the CWU's general secretary, told the BBC in June. \"We know there are legitimate concerns about Royal Mail Group being owned by a foreign private equity investor.\"",
      "But during negotiations, union representatives secured a series of time-limited commitments from him, including guarantees that he will protect Royal Mail's pension surplus, that there will be no compulsory redundancies for two years, no sell-off or break-up of any operational part of the existing company and no outsourcing of grades represented by the CWU.",

      "The mineral is added to some water supplies and brands of toothpaste to help prevent tooth decay.",
      "'Bit of a cheap shot'",
      "For BBC Radio 4's Dead Ringers star Jan Ravens, the first misstep of the writers behind the SNL sketch was \"not reading the room\".",
      "It was a bad idea to joke about someone's appearance in a sketch about The White Lotus, Ravens says, given Wood's casting has been praised for a character lacking \"those all-American, fake-looking teeth\".",
      "\"In the wake of all that, she's been talking about how she was bullied at school and the butt of jokes. So then you think, 'why would you do that joke'?\"",
      "It meant that in making fun of Wood's appearance, the sketch \"punched down,\" says Ravens.",
      "\"You might make a joke about Donald Trump's appearance because you're definitely not punching down on the most powerful man in the western world.\"",
      "Ronni Ancona, co-writer and star of the early 2000s TV series The Big Impression, said she \"could see\" that the writers were also trying to make a point about US Health Secretary Robert F Kennedy Jr's pledge to remove fluoride from US drinking water.",
      "But in doing so, \"they would have made this tenuous link between fluoride and Aimee Lou's teeth. It's a bit of a cheap shot,\" she told BBC Breakfast on Tuesday.",

      "\"But the whole joke was about fluoride,\" she wrote on Sunday. \"I have big gap teeth not bad teeth.\"",
      "Later on, in a post on social media, she said: \"I've had apologies from SNL.\"",
      "However, Francine Lewis, a comedian whose impersonations have earned her a large following on social media, says the whole purpose of the US show is to \"take the mick\".",
      "While she can sympathise with someone being \"embarrassed\" by being the target of a sketch, Lewis adds that she thinks Wood's response was \"too sensitive\".",
      "In her own impressions of celebrities, which include TV stars Gemma Collins and Stacey Solomon, Lewis has stuffed a pillow up her top to appear to be physically larger and put cotton wool on her teeth \"to make them really white and jut out a bit\".",

      "But she believes that being impersonated is actually a marker of someone's popularity and fame, saying that \"it means you've arrived\".",
      "Rather than adapting her impressions, Lewis is steadfast in her belief that \"to make comedy funny, unfortunately you have to overstep the mark.\"",
      "'Got to have the mickey taken'",
      "It's a view shared by Steve Nallon, known for impersonating former UK Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher on satirical TV programme Spitting Image.",
      "\"What caricaturists do by nature... is exaggerate the physicality. If a caricaturist is stopped from doing that, there's no point in him being a caricaturist,\" he says.",
      "During the 1980s, one of his targets - former Labour minister Roy Hattersley - was mocked for a slight speech impediment, with water spurting out of his mouth as he spoke.",
      "\"The joke was Roy Hattersley spits,\" says Nallon, who adds that Hattesley allegedly got on board with the joke after initially taking offence.",
      "For Nallon, those in the public eye will always be fair game. \"Maybe it's not a bad lesson to learn that you've got to have the mickey taken out of you occasionally,\" he says.",
      "But times have changed. Ravens says that \"people are much more sensitive\" about targeting certain aspects of people's appearances and mannerisms \"than they used to be earlier on in my career, for example, and I think rightly so\".",
      "This is not the first time SNL has received criticism of their portrayals.",
      "It doesn't mean the comedy is lost, says Ravens. In political satire - which was the main thrust of the SNL sketch - a really good impression satirises what the person is saying, rather than just fixating on how they look or how they deliver it, she adds.",
      "During our phone interview, she seamlessly breaks into an impression of former UK Prime Minister Theresa May, but notes that just speaking in a tense, clipped way, \"is only good for one line really\".",

      "The number of plays and musicals staged by the UK's main subsidised theatres last year was down by almost a third compared with 10 years earlier, BBC research suggests.",
      "In 2024, the 40 best-funded theatre companies that make their own productions - ranging from the National Theatre to the Colchester Mercury - opened 229 original productions, compared with 332 in 2014, a drop of 31%.",
      "Funding cuts and rising costs took much of the blame, with National Theatre executive director Kate Varah recently saying many in the industry are at \"breaking point\".",
      "But some venues said the shows they do stage are on a bigger scale than a decade ago, with the aim of running for longer on tour or in the West End.",
      "Last week, actress Lesley Manville warned that new talent had \"less opportunity\" to develop than when she was starting out in the 1970s.",
      "\"It's going to be a diminishing discipline, because there's not always the amount of stage work available for them to go and do,\" she told BBC Radio 4 after winning an Olivier Award.",
      "'Serious problem'",
      "Leeds Playhouse chief executive and artistic director James Brining said the venue had cut its number of homegrown shows from 12 to eight a year.",
      "\"That decision to contract has been forced upon theatres because it's so expensive, and increasingly so, to make work,\" he told BBC News.",
      "\"We love making work. So it's heartbreaking that the amount of work you can make is reducing, and it is reducing the pipeline opportunities for artists at the beginning of their careers.\"",

      "\"A lot of Netflix stars and a lot of those people we see on dramas like Mr Bates vs the Post office and Adolescence cut their teeth in regional theatres.",
      "\"And if those opportunities are no longer there, then those pathways don't exist. And that is a national scandal, I think.\"",
      "The theatre industry's financial pressures have had an impact on the workforce, with \"chronic low pay, job insecurity, poor work/life balance,\" he added.",
      "Many venues said they now co-produce more shows with other theatres or commercial operators to spread the costs and risks. That also means those productions can be on a bigger scale.",
      "\"Some individual productions that are made with the commercial sector are much bigger than anything we ever used to make,\" Birmingham Rep chief executive Rachael Thomas said.",
      "\"So for us, yes there are fewer productions coming out, but we are spending more because the productions that we are making are so much bigger than they ever used to be.\"",
      "However, the Rep has lost all of its annual local council funding - once worth more than \u00a31m a year - and smaller shows have often been squeezed out, Thomas said.",
      "\"I suppose the subsidy enables you to take the risk on the productions that are never going to recoup what they've cost, and often that will be the smaller-scale productions.\"",
      "In 1995, the Rep's studio theatre staged the premiere of East Is East, four years before it became a hit British film. It couldn't afford to do a play of that scale in its studio today.",
      "\"I cannot see a world in which we could now launch a play which has got a cast size of nine or 10 in our 133-seater studio space now as a new play,\" Thomas said.",
      "\"For our model, and I would say for the vast majority of regional producing theatres, that is nigh on impossible.\"",
      "'Less serious drama'",
      "Salisbury Playhouse artistic director Gareth Machin said audience tastes had also changed, meaning it's harder to put on \"serious drama\", especially outside London.",
      "\"When money is tight, people want a good night out and they don't want to take a risk,\" he said.",
      "\"They're probably not coming out as much as they were, so when they do come out they don't want to take a chance on something they're not sure is going to be entertaining and a fun experience.",
      "\"So there's less misery and risk.\"",
      "Nottingham Playhouse chief executive and UK Theatre joint president Stephanie Sirr said she didn't recognise the picture of a drop in productions, pointing out that \"it does fluctuate from year to year\".",
      "\"I do think it's more difficult to produce these days,\" she continued.",
      "\"The costs have gone up exponentially. Things like the energy costs really impact you if you're building scenery all day, or if you're running theatre lanterns all night.\"",
      "However, making more co-productions is a positive thing in most ways, and has meant \"we've been able to really increase the scale of the work we produce\", she said, with Nottingham's production of Dear Evan Hansen now on a major UK tour.",
      "'More with less'",
      "A handful of venues staged more original shows in 2024 than 2014. They include Leicester Curve, which has put a focus on making musicals in collaboration with commercial producers, which can then go on the road.",
      "Curve has doubled its box office receipts over the past decade.",
      "\"By sharing resources and risk, we're able to, by default, do more work and create and present more work,\" chief executive Chris Stafford said.",
      "\"We are doing more with less in terms of public investment,\" he continued, but said the biggest challenge for many theatres would be affording essential building repairs and upgrades in the coming years.",
      "Annual funding from Arts Councils in England, Wales and Northern Ireland and the Scottish equivalent has largely been stagnant for the past 10 years - while inflation has risen sharply - and many venues have had their local council subsidies cut. Many are also still recovering from the fallout from the pandemic.",
      "Last year, a survey by the group Freelancers Make Theatre Work depicted \"a workforce that is at breaking point\".",
      "Performer and group spokesman Paul Carey Jones said the BBC research \"would come as no surprise to most theatre freelancers in the UK, who have been struggling with low rates of pay, career precarity and vulnerability, a lack of job certainty and a skills retention crisis for many years now.",
      "\"It shows the need for action from government in terms of funding for the arts, but also from the theatre industry to support its freelance workforce, on which it entirely depends.\"",
      "The research for this story counted original and co-productions that opened in 2014 and 2024, including revivals, transfers and tours. They had to be professional in-person theatre productions, at least an hour long, and to have run for at least a week. If a co-production was jointly made by more than one theatre, it was counted as a single production.",

      "Her remarks echoed comments she made to BBC Radio 4's This Natural Life last year, when she said she \"absolutely loved\" acting, but also said it would be \"brilliant\" to give it up and spoke about her passion for nature and conservation.",
      "Blanchett is best known for appearing in films such as T\u00e1r, Notes on a Scandal and Elizabeth: The Golden Age, and won Oscars for her performances in Blue Jasmine and The Aviator.",
      "She wouldn't be the first successful actor to switch careers slightly later in life. Here are 10 other actors who retired from acting (including a few who came back):",
      "1. Cameron Diaz",
      "The US actress was one of Hollywood's biggest stars in the 90s and 00s, having made her debut at the age of 21 opposite Jim Carey in The Mask more than 30 years ago.",
      "Initially finding fame for her goofy performances in romcoms such as My Best Friend's wedding, and comedies including There's Something About Mary, Diaz went on to prove her dramatic acting chops in movies like Being John Malkovich and Martin Scorsese's Gangs of New York.",
      "But she took a hiatus from Hollywood following her turn as Ms Hannigan in 2014's remake of the musical Annie, confirming her \"retirement\" in 2018. \"I was free to be [like] 'I'm a mum, I'm a wife, I'm living my life' - it was so lovely.\"",
      "She said the decade she spent in retirement from acting was \"the best 10 years\" of her life. But she was eventually persuaded to return to screens earlier this year for spy thriller Back in Action with actor Jamie Foxx.",
      "2. Daniel Day-Lewis",
      "The Oscar-winning star, considered one of his generation's finest actors, apparently retired in 2017, but it wasn't the first time he had stepped away from the spotlight.",
      "Day-Lewis, who holds both British and Irish citizenship, has won an incredible three best actor Academy Awards for roles in My Left Foot, There Will Be Blood and Lincoln.",
      "Known for leaving long stretches between roles, in the 1990s Day-Lewis went into what he called \"semi-retirement\" and became a shoemaker's apprentice in Florence, Italy.",
      "He was coaxed back to acting by Martin Scorsese and his offer of the role in Gangs of New York.",
      "A statement issued through the star's agent in 2017, when he was aged 60, said he \"will no longer be working as an actor\".",
      "Again, however, that proved not to be permanent. Day-Lewis is soon to star in Anemone, the debut feature film from his son Ronan Day-Lewis. Daniel and Ronan co-wrote the script which \"explores the intricate relationships between fathers, sons and brothers, and the dynamics of familial bonds\".",
      "Whether it's a one-off due to the family connection or the start of a big return to film remains to be seen.",
      "3. Jack Nicholson",
      "Nicholson is one of only three actors (including Day-Lewis, above) to have won three Academy Awards for acting. Two of Nicholson's were for best actor (One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest and As Good As It Gets) and another for best supporting actor (Terms of Endearment).",
      "The legendary star's other famous roles include Easy Rider, The Shining, The Departed, A Few Good Men and Batman.",
      "Although he's never formally announced he is quitting or retiring, he previously said his retreat from the spotlight was brought on by a desire to not \"be out there anymore\".",
      "His last film role was in 2010 romcom How Do You Know.",
      "But just last week, that film's director James L Brooks told Hollywood Reporter: \"I wouldn't be surprised to see Jack work again. I mean, it's been a hunk of time but I don't know. Maybe it could be the right thing. He's reading scripts all the time, I think.\"",
      "4. Greta Garbo",
      "Legendary Swedish screen siren Greta Garbo declared in 1941 at the ripe old age of 36 that she would be taking a \"temporary\" retirement.",
      "It proved to be permanent. The Camille and Queen Christina star never appeared on film again.",
      "Always the reluctant celebrity, the reclusive actress never played the Hollywood game, refusing interviews and avoiding film premieres and other public appearances.",
      "The enigmatic star, whose famous line \"I want to be alone\" from Grand Hotel somewhat mirrored her desire in real life as well as on screen, only succeeded in increasing her mystique by stepping away from the spotlight.",
      "However, she later clarified in an interview: \"I never said: 'I want to be alone.' I only said, 'I want to be let alone! There is all the difference'.\"",
      "One of the few silent movie stars to transition successfully to the \"talkies\", Garbo moved away from Hollywood to New York, where she lived until her death in 1990 at the age of 84.",
      "5. Sean Connery",
      "Synonymous with James Bond, the late Scottish star first found fame through modelling and body-building before landing a few small theatre and TV roles.",
      "He made his film debut in No Road Back in 1957, but playing Secret Intelligence Service agent 007 in Dr No a few years later gave him his big breakthrough. He went on to star in five further Bond movies including From Russia with Love and Goldfinger.",
      "Connery appeared in numerous other films over his long career, including Alfred Hitchcock's Marnie, The Man Who Would Be King opposite Sir Michael Caine, The Untouchables (for which he won an Oscar) and The Hunt for Red October. But he would forever be wedded to 007.",
      "In 2005, however, he said he was \"fed up with the idiots\" adding there was an \"ever-widening gap between people who know how to make movies and the people who greenlight the movies.\"",
      "That declaration came a couple of years after he starred in The League of Extraordinary Gentlemen, which many concluded was one of the main reasons for his retirement.",
      "The poorly received comic book caper was to be his final screen appearance.",
      "6. Rick Moranis",
      "Kids of the 80s and 90s: You know. This guy was a huge star back in the day, the comedy backbone of popular films such as Ghostbusters, Honey I Shrunk The Kids and the musical Little Shop of Horrors (Suddenly, Seymour anyone?).",
      "But then he just seemed to disappear off the face of the earth. So what happened?",
      "He began to cut back on work after his wife died of cancer in 1991 to concentrate on raising his children, with his final big screen outing being the 1997 sequel Honey, We Shrunk Ourselves.",
      "\"I'm a single parent, and I just found that it was too difficult to manage raising my kids and doing the travelling involved in making movies,\" he told USA Today in 2005.",
      "\"So I took a little bit of a break. And the little bit of a break turned into a longer break, and then I found that I really didn't miss it.\"",
      "He did continue to do voiceover work, however, and Moranis was set to make a comeback in a Honey I Shrunk the Kids reboot, which sadly fell through.",
      "7. Gene Hackman",
      "We sadly lost this acting legend earlier this year, along with his second wife Betsy Arakawa, but the star hadn't been seen on screen for years after retiring from the profession on the advice of his heart doctor - opting for a quiet life in New Mexico.",
      "Hackman shot to fame in Bonnie and Clyde at the end of the 60s and was rarely out of work - in films like The French Connection, Mississippi Burning and Superman.",
      "He chose to bow out from acting in the political satire Welcome to Mooseport in 2004.",
      "Explaining his decision, he told Reuters that he didn't want to risk going out on a sour note.",
      "\"The business for me is very stressful. The compromises that you have to make in films are just part of the beast,\" he said, \"and it had gotten to a point where I just didn't feel like I wanted to do it any more.\"",
      "8. Bridget Fonda",
      "Fonda, from the famous family dynasty, is another star who quit at the height of her fame.",
      "Starring in 80s and 90s hits such as Scandal (about the Profumo Affair), Cameron Crowe's Singles, The Godfather Part III and Single White Female (everyone wanted to copy that elfin crop, not just Jennifer Jason Leigh). And then... nothing.",
      "Fonda never formally retired, she just seemed to retreat. Her last big screen appearance was in The Whole Shebang in 2001.",
      "When asked in 2023 by a reporter if she would return to acting at some point, she replied: \"I don't think so, it's too nice being a civilian.\" Fair enough!",
      "Fonda's aunt Jane also quit acting in 1990 for several years, explaining later in Vogue that \"she wasn't having fun anymore\".",
      "But she later came out of retirement for the romcom movie Monster-in-Law.",
      "\"It was just a gut feeling of, Why the hell not? It'd been 15 years, and I wanted to act again.\"",
      "9. Shelley Duvall",
      "Another star we sadly lost in the last year, Shelley Duval was best known for her roles in film like The Shining, Annie Hall and Nashville.",
      "Her step back from the spotlight wasn't just her choice. Movie roles began to drop off in the 90s and then she decided to move back to Texas after her brother was diagnosed with cancer.",
      "A year before her death, she told People magazine: \"It's the longest sabbatical I ever took but it was for really important reasons - to get in touch with my family again.\"",
      "Duvall did return to acting in horror movie, 2023's The Forest Hills.",
      "\"Acting again - it's so much fun. It enriches your life,\" she told People.",
      "\"[Jessica Tandy] won an Oscar when she was 80. I can still win,\" she joked. Sadly, she didn't get the chance.",
      "10. Ke Huy Quan",
      "Who could forget 2024 award season's most charming star, Oscar winner and Everything, Everywhere All At Once actor Ke Huy Quan?",
      "He first found fame as a child actor in the 80s when he landed the role of Short Round in Steven Spielberg's Indiana Jones and The Temple of Doom, before taking another starring role in childhood adventure hit The Goonies.",
      "A couple of TV roles followed but then the work largely dried up, and he settled for working behind the scenes as a stunt co-ordinator and assistant director.",
      "\"It's always difficult to make the transition from a child actor to an adult actor,\" he told the Telegraph. \"But when you're Asian, then it's 100 times more difficult.\"",
      "He reluctantly gave up - only due to lack of opportunity - and it took years before he took a punt on inventive, off-the wall movie Everything, Everywhere, All At Once, where his role as Waymond Wang won him an Oscar and made him a Hollywood darling once again.",

    "summary": "Michelle Collins is making her Edinburgh debut as the Fringe looks to the future with a new leader.",
    "story": [
      "Michelle Collins has been acting since she was 18.",
      "But after more than four decades on stage and screen, in shows such as Calendar Girls, Eastenders and Doctor Who, even she wasn't prepared for the fear of making her debut at the Edinburgh Festival Fringe.",
      "\"I keep thinking to myself 'what on earth am I doing?' I don't need to do this, and I have to admit it's absolutely terrifying,\" she says.",
      "Her show Motorhome Marilyn is based on a passing glimpse of a real person she encountered years ago on the streets of Los Angeles.",
      "\"I saw this woman coming out of a motorhome near the place where the stars are on the pavement,\" says Collins. \"She was dressed as Marilyn Monroe, in a white halterneck dress, and she popped some money in the parking meter.",
      "\"It was the strangest image. I never saw her again but I never forgot her.\"",
      "Collins, who is best known for her portrayal of Cindy Beale in Eastenders, began turning that one moment into a play about an aspiring actress with an obsessive interest in Hollywood legend Marilyn Monroe.",
      "She worked with writer and actor Stewart Permutt, who she met through festival veteran and friend Miriam Margolyes.",
      "\"I found a producer, we decided to take it to Edinburgh, we had a venue, we made posters and a short trailer for the show,\" she says.",
      "\"And then Covid happened.\"",
      "The festival was cancelled in 2020 and greatly curtailed the following year. Everything went on hold.",
      "Sadly, Permutt died last year. But he left his literary estate, including the first draft of Motorhome Marilyn, to Collins.",
      "\"He was insistent we should take it to Edinburgh as planned,\" she says.",
      "\"His name is still on the posters as well as Ben Weatherill who has taken it on.\"",
      "That attitude to get the show on whatever the odds is at the heart of the Fringe.",
      "Motorhome Marilyn is one of 1,792 shows announced so far for this August, which also marks the debut of Tony Lankester as CEO of the Edinburgh Festival Fringe Society, the organisation which runs the festival.",
      "He first visited Edinburgh in 2007 on a British Council tour, when he was running the South African National Arts Festival.",
      "\"It became evident to me that this was the gold standard for festivals wherever you are in the world, even on the tip of Africa,\" he says.",
      "Back then, his was one of seven fringe festivals which had begun working together to further their common aims. Today, more than 300 festivals from around the world are linked in a new network, and he says the advice they share is vital.",
      "\"It can be a lonely job running a festival,\" he adds. \"Just the comfort of knowing that on your phone is a person who is going through the same thing.",
      "\"Whether you're running a festival in Toronto or Prague or Adelaide the issues are the same and the ambitions are the same.\"",
      "Having been in the job only a week, he says he's keen to listen and learn before making any changes.",
      "And he says his previous job at London's Riverside Studios, which he took up just weeks before the pandemic began, gave him a better understanding of the fragility of the sector.",
      "\"When I stepped into the role I inherited a huge amount of debt, we had to go into administration but we emerged from that largely intact,\" he says. \"Covid continues to hang over everything we do. We have to be a lot more pragmatic and we can't take anything for granted.\"",
      "He says that includes the Edinburgh Fringe.",
      "\"A lot of the time, public bodies take the big events that happen on their doorsteps for granted. They assume they're always going to be there and post covid we can assume nothing.\"",
      "Lankester is confident the Fringe Society has \"a seat at the table\" in discussions with Edinburgh City Council over controversial local issues such as the tourist tax and short-term letting.",
      "The August festivals have come in for a lot of scrutiny in recent years due to their effect on the letting sector in the capital.",
      "The sheer scale of the festival both benefits and strains the resources of the city. But for Lankester, it's all a question of perspective.",
      "\"We can't necessarily fix Edinburgh's accommodation crisis ourselves but we need to be there when it is under discussion,\" he says.",
      "\"The scale of the Edinburgh Fringe is staggering. It's a mammoth event and has huge impact but the approach I've always taken is to not focus on the big number.",
      "\"It's not about the 2.7 million tickets you sell, it's about the one ticket you sell and one person's experience of the festival because that's what's important.",
      "\"No matter how bad the world is, how much the conversation is about economic issues, the artists are still stepping up creating new, fresh, interesting work and we're enormously proud to create this platform for them,\" he says.",
      "And Collins is excited to be playing her part in the festival. She's currently visiting Edinburgh, months ahead of curtain up, in order to get her bearings.",
      "Having returned to Eastenders in 2023 after a 25-year absence, she's aware that there's no star treatment for anyone at the Fringe.",
      "\"I'm going to have to do a lot of things myself. I'll be doing the get in, the get out, handing out the leaflets,\" she says.",
      "\"But it's also a place to experiment. Look at all the shows which have begun here. Baby Reindeer, Fleabag, Big Boys.",
      "\"I want it to be good, I want it to be brilliant but it's a development process. This is something I've created, I've produced.",
      "\"So to get it here at last is quite exciting. I feel I'm in charge of my own destiny.\"",

    "summary": "The magazine, seen on news stands since 1885, has formally announced it will cease publication.",
    "story": [
      "The Lady, Britain's longest-running women's magazine, has formally announced that it has ceased publication.",
      "The magazine is famed for its etiquette advice and adverts for butlers, nannies and discreet liaisons with well-heeled 60-somethings.",
      "In a statement, the publishers confirmed recent media reports that the April edition of the magazine will be the last, but added that the website with its jobs board and recruitment agency will continue.",
      "Here's a look back at its place in, and impact on, British culture over 140 years.",
      "The 'whole field of womanly action'",
      "The Lady was established in 1885 by Thomas Gibson Bowles, as a magazine for gentlewomen, a weekly guide to navigating the social minefield of well-to-do British life.",
      "Its very distinctive character was affectionately lampooned by PG Wodehouse. In his Jeeves stories, Bertie Wooster is briefly employed by a magazine called Milady's Boudoir, which was housed \"in one of those rummy streets in the Covent Garden neighbourhood\".",
      "The real Lady Magazine just happened to be in Bedford Street in Covent Garden.",
      "The Lady's fame owed much to its advice to women on the mysteries of the British class system. In 1936, for instance, its readers were given an update on the acceptability of novels.",
      "\"The reading of fiction, not long ago thought deplorable by nearly all social workers, is now becoming almost a virtue,\" it noted.",
      "Its first edition began with an explanation that its objective was to cover \"the whole field of womanly action\".",
      "Almost all of it was written by a man - Bowles - using various aliases. It was not a huge success. Fortunes changed in 1894 when he appointed his children's governess, Rita Shell, to be editor.",
      "'How to sack a servant'",
      "Under Shell's control, it became a successful weekly guide to women who found themselves in charge of both a household and a budget to outsource the daily drudgery to the lower classes.",
      "In December 1927, it cautioned young women \"to become a good cook before you marry, darling. Then you will be competent to rebuke a staff of domestics or to dispense with one\".",
      "Eighty years later, those concerns remained central. Editor Rachel Johnson was a firm believer in not being too familiar with staff, writing: \"Never sit in the kitchen chatting to your nanny, it'll end in tears before bedtime.\"",
      "And even today there are still pages of classified adverts for livery workers and other assorted varieties of domestic help but the demand now is more for live-in carers for the elderly than butlers or nannies.",
      "Rebranding The Lady",
      "That age profile has long been a concern. In 2009, Johnson was taken on to give the magazine a more youthful rebrand. She was asked to halve the average of the reader, which was, when she started, 78.",
      "A Channel 4 documentary revealed it was not universally welcomed, and Johnson's diaries later catalogued all the difficulties of aiming articles at  younger readers amongst adverts for walk-in baths and absorbent underwear along with products to remove their associated odours. It was an eventful three years that made more than a few headlines.",
      "Nevertheless, while the readership did briefly increase, like most print magazines, sales have been in sharp decline in recent years. Once a weekly, it went from fortnightly to monthly. The last published figures in 2023 revealed it sold just under 18,000 copies an issue.",
      "Custard creams in the safe",
      "And while the website will continue, it is the end of the line for a very distinctive bit of British culture.",
      "The current owner of The Lady is the great grandson of the founder, Thomas Bowles. Ben Budworth has spent 17 years trying to keep it afloat.",
      "He took over the running of the magazine in 2008 and oversaw the controversial rebrand. His decision to sell off the Covent Garden offices and move production to a business park in Borehamwood in Hertfordshire was met with protest.",
      "The premises on Bedford Street were seen by many of the staff as more than just another office, they helped define The Lady's character.",
      "No-one had a direct phone line. Instead, calls all went through a telephonist. One former editor said work would stop at 2pm to listen to the Archers, and again at 3:30pm for tea.",
      "Johnson said the wall safe was where the tins of custard creams were stored. One particular perk was her own peach-coloured WC. Each day she would be handed two freshly laundered towels.",
      "The building was a reminder of its long history and the magazine's many contributors, among them Lewis Carroll, Nancy Mitford and Stella Gibbons, who while giving the impression of being hard at work wrote Cold Comfort Farm in the magazine's offices.",
      "The L word",
      "However, heritage does not pay bills. Problems with a tax demand made headlines in 2024 and suggested the move to Hertfordshire had not solved the financial woes.   The problem of the shrinking and ageing readership was never going away.",
      "Even the word lady has shifted over the years from being an aspiration to a term widely regarded as demeaning and disparaging.",
      "And while there are older magazines, such as The People's Friend (which did not begin as a magazine aimed specifically at women) and the American Harper's Bazaar, which absorbed the even older British stalwart Queen, the Lady has a good claim on being the UK's oldest surviving women's magazine.",
      "However, 140 years on, a magazine that once billed itself as an indispensable guide to society has found that society has moved on."

    "summary": "The actress stayed behind the camera to make a documentary about Young's 2023 solo tour.",
    "story": [
      "Fifty-seven years into his career, Neil Young has harvested millions of fans \u2013 but none of those followers is more devoted than his pet dogs.",
      "\"They love the music,\" says the musician's wife, actress Daryl Hannah.",
      "\"They go to every sound check and lay under the piano on the stage. Whenever Neil is playing, the dogs just migrate right to him and lay at his feet.\"",
      "It's not just the dogs. During the 2020 lockdown, Young performed a livestream concert from the barn at his Colorado farm, surrounded by alpacas, ducks, chickens and even a horse.",
      "\"And every single one of the animals came over and laid down and watched him,\" Hannah says. \"It was so cool. I think they're really drawn to the music.\"",
      "Hannah, known for appearing in films such as Blade Runner, Splash and Kill Bill, directed that livestream \u2013 and she's stayed behind the camera to make a documentary about Young's 2023 solo tour.",
      "Filmed largely on her phone (\"and it's not even the most recent model\"), it captures the star's return to the stage, aged 75, after a four-year break, with his dogs in tow.",
      "\"He was very nervous about it,\" she recalls.",
      "\"There's always a point where he's like, 'I don't know if I can do this\u2026 We'll see'.\"",
      "\"It's funny, because he didn't do any rehearsals before the tour. He likes things to be real and spontaneous. But as soon as he walked out on stage, he was fine.\"",
      "Playing without a band, the shows were loose and unpredictable. The setlist changed every night, and even recurring songs like Heart of Gold and Like A Hurricane would be played in different settings, on different instruments, without warning.",
      "It's a set-up that caused his director a few headaches.",
      "\"It was really hit or miss because every day he would go out to do sound check, and he would choose one of his three pianos and play something like Expecting To Fly,\" says Hannah.",
      "\"So we'd set a camera on that piano but, when it came to show time, he wouldn't go near it. There were quite a few shows where we literally got no footage.",
      "\"I was frustrated in the editing room, trust me.\"",
      "Despite those challenges, Hannah captured spellbinding, stripped back versions of rarely-played tracks like Vampire Blues, If You Got Love and Prime Of Life.",
      "More revealing, however, was the footage she shot off the stage.",
      "Large stretches of the film take place on a silver eagle tour bus, where Young rides shotgun beside his longtime driver, Jerry Don Burden.",
      "Together, they shoot the breeze like Vladimir and Estragon - but rather than waiting for Godot, they're waiting for the next arena car park.",
      "The conversations are wonderfully mundane. There is ample discussion of scenery, snacks and setlists (\"people think they want to hear the hits, because that's all they've ever heard\", Young observes.)",
      "It's punctuated by stretches of companionable silence, where Young drums on his knees, or interacts with his son Ben, who was born with severe cerebral palsy.",
      "Later, the musician emerges from the bathroom, stares into the camera and deadpans: \"Now there's no risk of having to pee in the middle of the show\".",
      "Capturing that day-to-day normality was Hannah's motivation from the start.",
      "\"So many performers put on a persona, and Neil just does not have that quality at all. Whatever he's talking about with his bus driver, he continues talking about with the audience.",
      "\"People think of him as this intimidating, inscrutable person who'll make an album the record company refuses to put out,\" she continues, referring to the time Geffen Records sued Young for submitting two albums it considered \"musically uncharacteristic\".",
      "Hannah says people who judge him on that basis have got it wrong.",
      "\"He just has an absolute, uncanny commitment to his creative muse,\" she argues.",
      "\"He's not driven by financial interests, he's not driven by self-aggrandisement, he's not driven by anything other than that creative force, and it's pretty incredible to witness.",
      "\"Having spent so much time with him, my perception is that he's completely guileless. He has a lot of warmth and innocence, so I wanted to show that.\"",
      "Barred from America?",
      "Young recently made headlines for pulling out of the Glastonbury Festival, saying the BBC had asked him \"to do a lot of things\" he was \"not interested in\".",
      "He later backtracked, saying he'd received bad information, and will top the bill on the Pyramid Stage this June (Hannah jokes he'll serenade Glastonbury's livestock, in the style of his lockdown sessions).",
      "But his European tour isn't without peril. Writing on his website, Young has shared concerns that he could be barred from the US upon his return, following a rise in the number of people being detained and deported upon entering the country.",
      "\"If I talk about Donald J Trump, I may be one of those returning to America who is barred or put in jail to sleep on a cement floor with an aluminium blanket,\" he wrote.",
      "Young, who holds dual Canadian-American citizenship, has long been an outspoken critic of President Trump, calling him \"a disgrace to my country\" and suing him for using the song Rockin' In the Free World on the campaign trail.",
      "Hannah reveals her husband was harassed during the first Trump administration, as he went through the process of becoming a US citizen.",
      "\"They tried to every trick in the book to mess him up, and made him keep coming back to be re-interviewed and re-interviewed. It's ridiculous [because] he's been living in America and paying taxes here since he was in his 20s.\"",
      "Despite that, she doesn't think Young will be prevented from entering the country.",
      "\"They've been detaining people who have green cards or visas \u2013 which is hideous and horrifying -  but they have not, so far, been refusing to let American citizens back in the country, so I don't think that's going to happen.\"",
      "Hannah will accompany Young to Glastonbury, and says she'll film his performance from the side of the stage (perhaps the BBC can use that footage, if all else fails).",
      "The trip happens to fall on the 25th anniversary of her West End debut, in The Seven Year Itch. So, has she any desire to tread the boards again?",
      "\"Oh God, no,\" she exclaims. \"I really loving directing, because I don't have to be the focus of things, and that's a much more comfortable position for me.",

      "\"Let me be absolutely clear: I did not do any of the awful things being alleged,\" he said.",
      "Mr Combs - who has also gone by the names Puffy, Puff Daddy, P Diddy, Love, and Brother Love - essentially rewrote the rules of hip-hop in the 1990s, but his career has been punctuated by controversies.",
      "Here is a timeline of his career and the accusations against him.",
      "1969-89: Early life in New York",
      "Sean John Combs was born in Harlem and raised in Mount Vernon, New York.",
      "His mother, Janice, was a teacher's assistant, while his father Melvin was a former member of the US Air Force who became an associate of the drug-trafficker Frank Lucas, who later inspired the Ridley Scott film American Gangster.",
      "In 1972, Melvin was fatally shot in his car during a drug transaction after being misidentified as an informant. Combs was just two, although he didn't learn the circumstances of his father's death until much later.",
      "Raised by his mother, he was a flashy kid who loved rap music and played football for the school team.",
      "As a teenager, he danced in music videos for artists such as Diana Ross and the Fine Young Cannibals.",
      "Taking a cue from his mother, who worked multiple jobs to support Sean and his sister Keisha, he also worked six separate newspaper delivery routes, before enrolling to study business administration at Howard University.",
      "Early 1990s: Party plans turn into tragedy",
      "At university, Mr Combs gained a reputation for throwing lavish parties, some of which attracted more than a thousand guests.",
      "After booking musicians such as Heavy D and Terry Riley to play at these gigs, he came to the attention of Uptown Records' founder Andre Harrell, who gave him an internship in New York.",
      "Mr Combs eventually dropped out of university to work there full-time, guiding the early careers of artists including Mary J Blige and Jodeci.",
      "However, tragedy struck in 1991, when Mr Combs co-promoted a celebrity basketball game and concert at City College of New York. Nearly 5,000 people showed up to the gymnasium, which could only fit 2,730 people. In the ensuing crush, nine people died and 29 people were injured.",
      "An inquiry by the New York Mayor's Office cited Mr Combs for hiring inexperienced security guards. However, the star and his lawyers maintained he was not responsible for security at the event.",
      "\"City College is something I deal with every day of my life,\" the musician said in 1998. \"But the things that I deal with can in no way measure up to the pain that the families deal with. I just pray for the families and pray for the children who lost their lives every day.\"",
      "No criminal charges were filed over the tragedy, but family members of the people who died sued the promoters, the college and the city, accusing them of negligence.",
      "The case was settled for $3.8m (\u00a33m), of which Mr Combs paid $750,000.",
      "Mid-to-late 1990s: A new beginning",
      "Mr Combs struck upon the idea of pairing R&B singers like Mary J Blige with the street-tough sounds of hip-hop",
      "While at Uptown, Mr Combs signed a young Brooklyn rapper called Christopher Wallace - aka Biggie Smalls, or the Notorious B.I.G. - and started work on his debut album.",
      "But his relationship with Harrell broke down and Mr Combs was fired. He retaliated by setting up his own label, Bad Boy Records, and taking Biggie with him.",
      "The star's debut album, Ready To Die, was hailed as an all-time rap classic, selling millions of copies and generating the multi-platinum singles Juicy and Big Poppa.",
      "Mr Combs quickly expanded the Bad Boy roster, releasing hit albums by Faith Evans, Ma$e, 112 and Total.",
      "The label's sound was slick and polished. Its biggest singles lifted chunky samples from well-known hits. The practice was frowned upon by hip-hop purists, but it was catnip to radio programmers.",
      "1997: Notorious B.I.G. is murdered",
      "The Notorious B.I.G. and Puff Daddy (as he was then known) on the set of the Hypnotize music video in 1997",
      "In March 1997, Biggie Smalls was gunned down in a drive-by shooting at the age of 24.",
      "The murder has never been solved, but it has consistently been linked to the East-Coast-West-Coast rivalry that consumed rap music in the 1990s and which had previously claimed the life of Tupac Shakur.",
      "Mr Combs, who had been travelling in the car behind his friend, poured his grief into a song, I'll Be Missing You, which became one of the biggest songs of 1997.",
      "The song, based around The Police's Every Breath You Take, also featured on Mr Combs' debut album, No Way Out, which sold seven million copies worldwide.",
      "1999: New York shooting",
      "By this stage, Bad Boy had become one of the most important labels in rap. Aside from its own releases, artists including Mariah Carey and Jennifer Lopez were asking Mr Combs to remix their songs, hoping for a dash of hip-hop credibility.",
      "But there was trouble, too. In May 1999, Mr Combs was arrested on suspicion of assaulting Interscope Records executive Steve Stoute, after a disagreement over a music video. He pleaded guilty to harassment and was sentenced to a one-day anger management class, external.",
      "Later that year, he was charged with criminal possession of a weapon when police found two nine-millimetre guns in his car, after an argument in a club turned violent.",

      "Her self-titled debut was released in 2008 and its futuristic, space-age R&B proved to be a hit with critics.",
      "By that stage, Mr Combs and Ventura were in a relationship. But in a civil lawsuit filed in December 2023, she said the mogul had used his position of power to \"set the groundwork\" for a \"manipulative and coercive romantic and sexual relationship\".",
      "Her lawsuit included multiple graphic descriptions of violent abuse, alleging that Mr Combs \"regularly beat and kicked Ms Ventura, leaving black eyes, bruises, and blood\".",
      "Ventura also alleged sexual abuse and rape, and claimed that many of these incidents were witnessed by Mr Combs' \"tremendously loyal network\" who \"were not willing to do anything meaningful\" to stop the violence.",
      "Mr Combs strenuously denied the allegations and accused Ventura of trying to extort him. They settled the case a day after it was filed in New York, with Mr Combs' lawyer saying the settlement was \"in no way an admission of wrongdoing\".",
      "2007-2024: Business ventures",
      "Music took a back seat after 2007, when Mr Combs signed a deal with British drinks company Diageo to promote the French vodka brand, C\u00eeroc, in the US for a 50-50 profit split.",
      "His endorsement saw the brand placed in dozens of music videos - including Diddy's own single \"Ciroc Star\" - and helped increase sales from 40,000 to 2,000,000 cases per year by 2014.",
      "Around the same time, he co-founded the media company Revolt, whose TV channels and websites are described as \"the unapologetic, authoritative voice of hip-hop culture\".",
      "Mr Combs' involvement with both companies came to an end in 2023-24. He had previously sued Diageo, accusing it of neglecting his brand because of race.",

      "As the row escalated, Mr Combs allegedly threatened an intern with a kettle bell. He was later arrested and charged with assault with a deadly weapon.",

      "A third woman, Liza Gardner, also filed court papers accusing Mr Combs of coercing her into sex in the early 1990s and then, a couple of days later, choking her so hard that she passed out.",
      "The lawsuits all came shortly before the expiration of the New York Adult Survivors Act, which temporarily allowed people who said they were sexually abused to file claims, even after the statute of limitations had expired.",
      "Mr Combs denied all the allegations against him, while his spokesperson called the lawsuits a \"money grab\".",
      "\"The claims involving alleged misconduct against Mr Combs from over 30 years ago and filed at the last minute are all completely denied and rejected by him,\" they said in a statement.",
      "\"The New York Legislature surely did not intend or expect the Adult Survivors Act to be exploited for improper purposes. The public should be sceptical and not rush to accept these unsubstantiated allegations.\"",

      "The judge in the case later ruled that the woman, who filed her case anonymously, would have to use her real name if she wanted to proceed.",

    "story": [
      "\"I made a real decision when I was, like, 11 that I wasn't gonna be like a typical teenager,\" says Bella Ramsey.",
      "Talk about an understatement.",
      "By the time Bella was 13, they had been cast in the world's biggest TV show at the time, Game of Thrones.",
      "And when the actor, now 21 years old, speaks to BBC Newsbeat, it's the night after walking the red carpet at the London premiere of The Last of Us season two.",
      "The smash-hit adaptation of the PlayStation video game was a critical and ratings success, launching the young star to full-on leading role status.",
      "\"I think it's quite a unique experience,\" Bella, who's originally from Nottingham, England, modestly admits.",
      "The rest of this article contains spoilers for The Last of Us season one.",
      "Bella, who uses gender-neutral pronouns, plays Ellie in the HBO drama, set in a post-apocalyptic future where humanity has been almost wiped out by cordyceps.",
      "The deadly parasitic fungus turns humans into zombie-like creatures, but Ellie is immune from infection and is humanity's last hope for a cure.",
      "In the first season viewers saw a father-daughter relationship slowly blossom between Ellie and mercenary Joel, played by Pedro Pascal.",
      "After escorting the 14-year-old on a dangerous journey across the USA to meet doctors working on a vaccine, it becomes apparent Ellie must die for a potential remedy to be produced.",
      "Rather than sacrifice her, Joel kills the medics and flees with the unconscious teenager.",
      "When she awakes, he lies to her about what happened, and season one's cliffhanger ending leaves viewers with the strong impression that Ellie is well aware of the deception.",
      "So when the new season begins, five years later, \"obviously there's tension in that relationship,\" says Bella.",
      "\"It was quite horrible to play.\"",
      "Young Bella's vow to not be a \"typical teenager\" was actually less about their career and more about their relationship with their parents, they say.",
      "No screaming matches, no slamming doors.",
      "\"So I never went through that with my dad,\" says Bella. \"Me and my dad are great.\"",
      "\"So it was kind of sad to do that with Ellie and Joel.\"",
      "But, Bella adds, Ellie \"is very justified in her feelings about everything\".",
      "Ellie is 19 in season two, not too much younger than Bella, who began shooting the first series back in 2021.",
      "Number two was delayed by the 2023 Hollywood strikes, so a lot has happened for Bella in the meantime.",
      "There's symmetry there.",
      "\"It's so fun getting to step back into a character but with kind of new revelations about her and about me in my own life,\" says Bella.",
      "\"There's always like a merging of me and whatever character I'm playing and that happens times 10 with Ellie because I'm spending so much time in her skin.\"",
      "Bella's recently spoken publicly about being diagnosed with autism while working on the first series of the show.",
      "\"It was something that I didn't really think about too much before,\" Bella starts.",
      "\"Actually, no, that's a lie. I did, because I said that I was neurodiverse before, and then I was like, 'Why don't I just say what it actually is, which is, yeah, I'm autistic.\"",
      "Bella says opening up has allowed them \"to be a bit more free\" and hopes it will inspire others.",
      "\"You can be in industries like this and openly say that you're autistic, why there shouldn't be sort of such a stigma around that and such a fear around that,\" says Bella.",
      "\"So I'm very proud to be able to say it out loud and also just to bring more awareness.",
      "\"Autism comes in all different shapes and sizes, and and I'm not someone that people would maybe typically see and go like 'oh, you're autistic'.\"",
      "Bella also identifies as non-binary, and the new series of The Last of Us more deeply explores Ellie's same-sex relationship with Dina, played by Isabella Merced.",
      "\"I feel like we're still figuring out how to portray queer storylines in the media in a way that feels very authentic but that also feels very genuine in terms of the story,\" says Bella.",
      "\"That's what The Last of Us does so well, I think, with Ellie and Dina.",
      "\"It doesn't feel like it's like representation added on top to check a box - it really feels like it's just a part of the story.",
      "\"So that was what was exciting about getting to portray this sort of relationship in this medium.\"",
      "The Last of Us has already been commissioned for a third series after a positive critical reception for season two, so Bella - and Ellie - will still be growing up in the public eye for a while yet.",
      "It's something that \"comes with pros and cons,\" says Bella.",
      "\"But it's kind of lovely that my growth and development has been immortalised on-screen.",
      "\"I feel very grateful for that.\"",
      "But Bella says there's one thing that doesn't get any easier.",
      "\"The more that you grow up, you just realise how little you know, I think. And I think that's something that Ellie is also discovering.\"",

      "A scheme to help GPs provide care and advice to patients without them joining long NHS hospital waiting lists is being expanded in England, the government has said.",
      "GPs will work more closely with specialists to access expert advice quickly for patients with conditions such as irritable bowel syndrome, menopause symptoms and ear infections.",
      "Backed by \u00a380m of funding, its ambition is to help two million people receive faster and more convenient care in their local community by the end of 2025/26.",

      "It has pledged that 92% of NHS patients will be waiting less than 18 weeks for treatment after referral to a consultant, by the end of this parliament.",
      "Between July and December 2024, the scheme diverted 660,000 treatments from hospitals and into the community, the government says.",
      "Called 'Advice and Guidance', the scheme links GPs and hospital specialists before patients are referred onto waiting lists, so that tests and treatments can be offered in the most convenient place.",
      "For example, patients with tinnitus and needing ear wax removal often end up being referred to specialists when they could be helped outside hospitals. And women needing advice on types of HRT could be treated in local hubs, rather than waiting to see a gynaecologist.",

      "The British Medical Association said in a statement: \"We have seen decades of underinvestment in general practice, and this is an important small step in acknowledging the important role of the GP and supporting practices to deliver enhanced care to patients in the community.",
      "\"The journey to bringing back the family doctor has only just begun. Now we must focus on the secretary of state's promise to complete negotiation of a new GP contract within the term of this Parliament in order to safeguard family GP services for the future, and we look forward to working closely with the government to achieve that.\"",

    "summary": "The number of people vaping in the UK has stalled, while disposable vape usage has fallen, a study suggests.",
    "story": [
      "The popularity of disposable e-cigarettes or vapes has fallen ahead of a UK-wide ban on their sale on 1 June, a study suggests.",
      "The percentage of people aged 16-24 who mainly use disposable vapes has dropped by nearly half in the last year from 63% to 35%, University College London (UCL) researchers say.",
      "But researchers believe vape users are switching to refillable and rechargeable vapes in anticipation of the ban \u2013 instead of giving up.",
      "As a result they warn the ban may only have a \"limited impact\" on vaping rates as it found vaping in general stalled between January 2024 and 2025 in all adults over 16 after several years of significant growth.",
      "The UK government ban on disposable and single-use vapes is aimed at stopping littering as, in most cases, the vapes cannot be recycled and often end up in landfill or pollute natural environments.",
      "The ban is also aimed at tackling rising rates of youth vaping and protecting children from harm.",
      "GP Dr Helen Wall told BBC Breakfast that NHS advice is \"very clear\" that vaping should be used as a means to stop smoking.",
      "\"But for people who have never smoked, and for young people particularly, to turn to vaping can be quite detrimental,\" she said.",
      "\"Our young people are becoming quite addicted. It's affecting their concentration, they're becoming agitated, their capacity to learn is affected, their developing brain can be affected.\"",
      "The UCL study looked at survey data on vaping habits in England, Wales and Scotland both before and after the ban was announced.",
      "The study used data from the Smoking Toolkit Study, which collected data on 88,611 people aged 16 and over.",
      "Before the ban, between January 2022 and January 2024, vaping among those aged 16 and over went up from 8.9% to 13.5%.",
      "In young adults aged 16-24, usage increased more sharply, from 17% to 26.5%.",
      "After the ban was announced, researchers found a decline in the number of vapers mainly using disposable e-cigarettes - in all age groups and particularly among 16-24 year olds.",
      "The study only asked vape users about their main choice of device.",
      "Dr Sarah Jackson, who works for the UCL Tobacco and Alcohol Research Group and is the lead author of the survey, tells the BBC she thinks \"more people are turning to refillable, reusable devices\" rather than stopping vaping altogether.",
      "\"We often see people change their behaviour in response to impending policy changes before they come into action,\" she adds.",
      "Disposable vapes are single-use devices, which come pre-filled with vape liquid, whereas refillable and rechargeable (reusable) devices have a longer shelf-life and are often a cheaper way to vape in the long-term.",
      "A reusable vape has vape liquid that can be refilled and a battery that can be recharged.",
      "How are the vaping rules changing?",
      "Dr Jackson adds that vape manufacturers have also been quick to react to the upcoming ban, with \"the most popular\" disposable brands producing rechargeable versions of their most popular models.",
      "\"They're very similar in design, colours, flavours and even price,\" she says.",
      "While Dr Jackson thinks it's too early to tell whether the government's new strategy will deter young people from vaping, she maintains that health legislators face \"an issue of balance\".",
      "\"We know it makes sense to do something to try and reduce the vast numbers of young people taking up vaping, but the key public health priority here does remain smoking,\" she says.",
      "\"This is vastly more harmful and is killing a lot of people every year, so we need to make sure that any policy measures that are brought in to tackle youth vaping don't put people off using vapes, which are very effective at quitting smoking,\" she adds.",

      "At the core of the agreement is a proposed Pathogen Access and Benefit-Sharing System (PABS), allowing the faster exchange of data between pharmaceutical companies.",

    "summary": "The statistics are five times higher than the world figure, a University of Aberdeen study says.",
    "story": [
      "Northern Scotland has one of the highest rates of Huntington's disease in the world, according to a new study.",
      "Huntington's is a hereditary disorder that slowly damages the brain, affecting the ability to walk, talk, eat, drink, make decisions and live independently. There is currently no cure.",
      "The study confirmed the rate of Huntington's disease in northern Scotland is 14.5 per 100,000 people - more than five times the estimated worldwide rate of 2.71.",
      "The researchers from the University of Aberdeen found there are more than 160 adults living in Grampian, Highland, Orkney, Shetland, and the Western Isles who have the gene but have not been tested.",
      "Every child of someone affected has a 50:50 chance of inheriting the neurodegenerative gene which causes Huntington's.",
      "On average, every person who has been diagnosed with Huntington's disease will have at least another 2.2 relatives who have the gene, meaning there are hundreds of people in northern Scotland who could be considered for effective treatments in the future, researchers said.",
      "Previous studies have mainly looked at the number of people who tested positive for the gene then estimated the number of relatives at risk using statistical modelling.",
      "In the new study, published in a peer-reviewed medical journal, scientists used family tree clinical records to count how many people have a 50:50 chance of having inherited the condition but have not been tested.",
      "It is hoped the findings can help affected families plan for the future and prompt future investment in specialist care.",
      "The chief executive of the Scottish Huntington's Association, Alistair Haw, said specialist services were not an \"optional extra\"  but rather an \"absolute necessity\".",
      "\"Specialist Huntington's services need to be expanded urgently \u2013 a message further reinforced by this new and clear evidence which has major implications for health and social care providers throughout Scotland,\" he said.",
      "The research was led by Prof Zosia Miedzybrodzka of the University of Aberdeen and clinical lead for Huntington's disease at NHS Grampian, alongside Heather Cruickshank, genetic counsellor at NHS Grampian.",
      "They say the decision to be tested for the gene is entirely a personal choice.  While some people might want to know if they have inherited the Huntington's gene, others prefer not to unless they develop symptoms.",
      "\"Previous work looked at how many people in the area have been tested for Huntington's disease, that is people diagnosed with Huntington's disease signs and those with a gene alteration that will develop the condition in later life,\" Prof  Miedzybrodzka explained.",
      "\"However, no-one has properly counted just how many people who haven't been tested yet must have the gene.",
      "\"It is crucial that we know this, and that it is accurate, so that health boards can properly plan for care and for treatments when they become available in the future.\"",
      "More stories from North East Scotland, Orkney and Shetland",
      "Listen to news from North East Scotland on BBC Sounds",
      "Heather Cruickshank said that despite high rates of testing, most people at risk of developing the disease in Scotland have not had a test.",
      "\"There is a massive worldwide effort seeking treatments for Huntington's disease,\" she added.",
      "\"Services need to plan to treat these as-yet-uncounted people, as well as those currently diagnosed.",
      "\"Regional variations in rates will become more important, including genetic counselling and testing, management, and treatment delivery.\"",
      "She added: \"Having a test remains a free choice for people from Huntington's disease families and our research means that care can be planned for all those at risk, without people who don't want a test having one.\"",
      "Brian Watt, 69, of Hopeman in Moray, is a former whisky distillery manager who received his diagnosis in 2016.",
      "\"I knew there was Huntington's disease in my family - my father and my sister were both diagnosed,\" he said.",
      "\"I wasn't sure whether to go ahead with the test, but I am glad I did.\"",
      "Brian walks his two dogs along Hopeman beach every day.",
      "He believes keeping busy and having an upbeat outlook are vital when living with Huntington's.",
      "\"Zosia (Prof Miedzybrodzka) said to me the best way to manage Huntington's disease is with a balance of lifestyle, attitude and medication and I think that is spot-on,\" he said.",
      "\"I try to keep a healthy lifestyle and positive attitude and I'm doing just fine.\"",
      "Sandy Patience, 62, of Inverness, was diagnosed with disease in 2017.",
      "He had lost relatives to the disease, and recalls the support of his wife Laura at the time.",
      "\"I said to Laura 'this is a game changer in our 20 years together - please can you leave me and live the rest of your life with someone else'.",
      "\"But she didn't, because her love for me is as immense as mine for her. We are very very blessed, and I can't imagine life without my soulmate by my side - she picks me up if I am feeling down.\"",
      "He added: \"This is a fantastic opportunity for other people, just like me, to take a big leap forward and consider testing.",
      "\"I want everyone to know that testing positive is not the end of the world, it may even be the beginning of better family relationships and countless other positive things.\"",
      "What is Huntington's disease?",
      "Huntington's disease is an inherited condition that stops parts of the brain working properly and is usually fatal within 20 years of the first appearance of symptoms.",
      "These include difficulty concentrating, depression, stumbling and clumsiness, involuntary jerking of the limbs and body, mood swings and personality changes, problems swallowing, speaking and breathing.",
      "They usually begin between the age of 30 and 50 and gradually get worse over time.",

      "As Sunak's women and equalities minister, Badenoch led the UK government's efforts to block Scotland's Gender Recognition Reform Bill.",

      "A Labour source said Sir Keir had brought the party to a \"common sense position\" on the subject from an \"activist\" stance, and it was \"one of the reasons\" the electorate felt that they could back the party after the \"disaster of 2019\".",
      "Labour are not the only party to have tied themselves in knots on this issue.",

      "The Liberal Democrats have had their problems too.",
      "Officially, the party is pro-trans rights. It has a powerful and influential LGBTQ+ section and campaigned at the last general election for legal recognition of non-binary identities.",
      "In May 2023, leader Sir Ed Davey told LBC: \"The vast majority of people will have the same gender as their biological sex, but a small number won't.\"",
      "When asked by presenter Nick Ferrari \"so, a woman can have a penis?\", he replied: \"Well, quite clearly.\"",
      "He went on to suggest that trans people's rights were adequately protected by the Equality Act, which \"allow there to be single sex spaces\".",
      "His comments were ridiculed by then Tory leader Sunak \u2013 and did not go down well with gender critical campaigners in his own party.",
      "Liberal Voice for Women (LVW), which has fought a long campaign against a ban on having a stall at the annual Lib Dem conference, said their leader had made the party \"look dishonest, unreliable and detached from reality\".",
      "Earlier this year, party chiefs backed down and allowed LVW to hold events and have exhibition stands after the group threatened to sue for discrimination.",

      "The party adds: \"It is a dangerous safeguarding issue to confuse children by suggesting otherwise\u2026 no gender questioning, social transitioning or pronoun swapping, inform parents of under-16s about their children's life decisions. Schools must have single-sex facilities.\"",
      "On paper, the Green Party of England and Wales is equally clear, at the opposite end of the spectrum.",
      "The party's charter of Rights and Responsibilities states \"trans men are men, trans women are women, and that non-binary identities exist and are valid\", and it campaigns to make it easier for trans people to change their legal status.",
      "But within the party there are major splits over the issue.",
      "Last year, the Greens were ordered by a court to pay nearly \u00a3100,000 to their former deputy leader Shahrar Ali after it found the party had discriminated against him when they fired him as a spokesman during a row over his gender critical beliefs.",
      "Today's court ruling takes the immediate pressure off the Labour government and other politicians who have struggled to answer the question \"what is a woman?\"",
      "But with passions running high on both sides of the debate, it is unlikely to go away.",

      "A so-called \"Romeo and Juliet\" clause has been added to new plans for mandatory reporting of concerns around child sexual abuse.",
      "The Crime and Policing Bill puts a new duty on teachers, GPs, and other professionals to report concerns or face criminal sanctions.",
      "Mandatory reporting was one of the 20 recommendations of the Independent Inquiry into Child Sexual Abuse (IICSA) following the grooming gangs scandal.",

      "Local grooming gang reviews will go ahead, says Cooper",
      "Grooming gang investigator 'fed up' of political rows",
      "Child exploitation and cuckooing to be criminal offences",
      "Shakespeare's Romeo and Juliet were fictional teenage lovers, whose forbidden romance ended in tragedy, but who have become synonymous with youthful love.",
      "Labour's Safeguarding Minister Jess Phillips, who put forward the amendment during a committee hearing on the bill, said she wanted to provide \"some discretion\" in a limited number of situations \" to avoid unintentional consequences\".",

      "\"Nor do we want to discourage young people from accessing services that are designed to offer support in addressing their own harmful sexual behaviour.\"",
      "The clause would not apply if either child was aged under 13 years old, if there was suspicion of coercion or abuse, or if there was a significant difference in age or maturity.",
      "Responding in the debate, Conservative MP Harriet Cross backed the clause, which she said recognised that age differences were important in these relationships.",
      "\"For example, if a 14-year-old girl is sexually involved with a 17-year-old boy, even if she says she has consented, a teacher or adult might rightly feel uneasy about the power dynamic and the possible impact of grooming,\" she said. \"The adult might decide that it is appropriate to report in that case.",
      "\"On the other hand, two 14-year-olds would likely fall under the exemption.\"",
      "Cross said it would allow professionals to use their judgement - but stressed the bar for not reporting should be high.",
      "\"It recognises that not all sexual activity involving under-18s is a cause for alarm or state intervention,\" she said.",
      "\"Specifically, it lets professionals refrain from reporting consensual sexual activity between older teenagers when they believe there is no abuse or exploitation at play - it is basically a Romeo and Juliet exemption.",
      "\"...The exemption is not about condoning under-age sex, it is about proportionality.\"",

      "Citizens from Kosovo, Bangladesh, Colombia, Egypt, India, Morocco and Tunisia would all have their claims fast-tracked within three months on the assumption that they were likely to fail.",
      "Markus Lammert of the European Commission said it would be a \"dynamic list\" that could be expanded or reviewed, with countries suspended or removed if they were no longer seen as safe.",
      "Ever since EU countries saw an influx of irregular migrants in 2015-16, they have sought to reform asylum rules.",
      "A pact on migration and asylum was agreed last year, but the EU says as it does not come into force until June 2026 it wants to push through two key rules on speeding up processing.",
      "EU leaders called on the Commission last year to come up with plans to accelerate migrant returns, as EU figures suggested under 20% of people ordered to leave were sent back to their countries of origin.",
      "Under the plans, EU countries would be able to fast track people coming either from safe countries or countries from which a maximum of one in five applicants are given protection.",
      "European countries that are candidates to join the EU will automatically be considered safe, although exceptions are possible, for example for countries at war such as Ukraine.",
      "Among the countries pushing for reform was Italy, which has seen a big influx since 2015. Other countries including Germany have imposed border controls in a bid to limit irregular migration.",
      "Although Italy is among several member states that already have designated safe countries, it is thought an agreed EU list would deter asylum seekers from targeting those with looser regulations.",
      "Morocco, Tunisia and Egypt have all seen large numbers of irregular migrants leave their shores to cross the Mediterranean in recent years.",

      "The new proposals will now need to be approved by both the European Parliament and EU member states, and some human rights groups have expressed concern about the plans.",
      "EuroMed Rights - a network of human rights organisations - warned that it was misleading and dangerous to label the seven countries as safe, because they included \"countries with documented rights abuses and limited protections for both their own citizens and migrants\".",
      "\"We do not cut back on fundamental and human rights,\" said Commission spokesman Markus Lammert. \"Under EU law member states have to carry out individual assessments of each asylum application in each individual case.\"",

    "story": [
      "Judges at the UK Supreme Court have unanimously ruled that a woman is defined by biological sex under equalities law.",
      "It marks the culmination of a long-running legal battle which could have major implications for how sex-based rights apply across Scotland, England and Wales.",
      "The court sided with campaign group For Women Scotland, which brought a case against the Scottish government arguing that sex-based protections should only apply to people that are born female.",
      "Judge Lord Hodge said the ruling should not be seen as a triumph of one side over the other, and stressed that the law still gives protection against discrimination to transgender people.",
      "Five key takeaways from Supreme Court ruling",
      "Women's campaigners celebrate court win - but what will it change?",
      "The Scottish government argued in court that transgender people with a gender recognition certificate (GRC) are entitled to the same sex-based protections as biological women.",
      "The Supreme Court was asked to decide on the proper interpretation of the 2010 Equality Act, which applies across Britain.",
      "Lord Hodge said the central question was how the words \"woman\" and \"sex\" are defined in the legislation.",
      "He told the court: \"The unanimous decision of this court is that the terms woman and sex in the Equality Act 2010 refer to a biological woman and biological sex.",
      "\"But we counsel against reading this judgement as a triumph of one or more groups in our society at the expense of another, it is not.\"",
      "He added that the legislation gives transgender people \"protection, not only against discrimination through the protected characteristic of gender reassignment, but also against direct discrimination, indirect discrimination and harassment in substance in their acquired gender\".",
      "Campaigners who brought the case against the Scottish government hugged each other and punched the air as they left the courtroom, with several of them in tears.",
      "The Equality Act provides protection against discrimination on the basis of various characteristics, including \"sex\" and \"gender reassignment\".",
      "Judges at the Supreme Court in London were asked to rule on what that law means by \"sex\" - whether it means biological sex, or legal, \"certificated\" sex as defined by the 2004 Gender Recognition Act.",
      "The Scottish government argued the 2004 legislation was clear that obtaining a GRC amounts to a change of sex \"for all purposes\".",
      "For Women Scotland argued for a \"common sense\" interpretation of the words man and woman, telling the court that sex is an \"immutable biological state\".",
      "Speaking outside the Supreme Court following the ruling, For Women Scotland co-founder Susan Smith said: \"Today the judges have said what we always believed to be the case, that women are protected by their biological sex.",
      "\"Sex is real and women can now feel safe that services and spaces designated for women are for women and we are enormously grateful to the Supreme Court for this ruling.\"",
      "First Minister John Swinney said the Scottish government accepted the judgement.",
      "He posted on social media: \"The ruling gives clarity between two relevant pieces of legislation passed at Westminster.",
      "\"We will now engage on the implications of the ruling.\"",
      "Swinney added: \"Protecting the rights of all will underpin our actions.\"",
      "A Scottish government spokesperson insisted ministers had acted \"in good faith\" during the legal proceedings, and noted that the Equality and Human Rights Commission was updating its guidance in response to the judgement.",
      "A UK government spokesman said the ruling would bring \"clarity and confidence for women and service providers such as hospitals, refuges, and sports clubs\".",
      "\"Single-sex spaces are protected in law and will always be protected by this government,\" the spokesman added.",
      "Conservative leader Kemi Badenoch described the ruling as a \"victory for all of the women who faced personal abuse or lost their jobs for stating the obvious\".",
      "She added: \"It's important to be reminded the court strongly and clearly re-affirmed the Equality Act protects all trans people against discrimination, based on gender reassignment, and will continue to do so.\"",
      "'Deep concern'",
      "Harry Potter author JK Rowling posted on social media: \"It took three extraordinary, tenacious Scottish women with an army behind them to get this case heard by the Supreme Court and, in winning, they've protected the rights of women and girls across the UK.\"",
      "But Scottish Green MSP Maggie Chapman, a prominent campaigner for trans-rights, said: \"This is a deeply concerning ruling for human rights and a huge blow to some of the most marginalised people in our society.",
      "\"It could remove important protections and will leave many trans people and their loved ones deeply anxious and worried about how their lives will be affected and about what will come next.\"",
      "For Women Scotland had warned that if the court sided with the Scottish government, it would have implications for the running of single-sex spaces and services, such as hospital wards, prisons, refuges and support groups.",
      "Transgender people warned the case could erode the protections they have against discrimination in their reassigned gender.",
      "Scottish Trans manager Vic Valentine said the organisation was \"shocked\" by the court ruling, arguing that it \"reverses 20 years of understanding on how the law recognises trans men and women with gender recognition certificates\".",
      "They added: \"This judgement seems to suggest that there will be times where trans people can be excluded from both men's and women's spaces and services.",
      "\"It is hard to understand where we would then be expected to go - or how this decision is compatible with a society that is fair and equal for everybody.\"",
      "The case follows years of heated debate over transgender and women's rights, including controversy over transgender rapist Isla Bryson initially being put in a women's prison and an ongoing employment tribunal involving a female NHS Fife nurse who objected to a transgender doctor using a women's changing room.",
      "NHS Fife said it would \"carefully consider\" the court's judgement.",
      "'Biological' or 'certified'?",
      "The judges ruled that interpreting sex as \"certificated\" rather than \"biological\" would \"cut across the definitions of man and \"woman and thus the protected characteristic of sex in an incoherent way\".",
      "They said a \"certified\" definition of sex would weaken protections for lesbians, citing the example of lesbian-only spaces and associations as it would mean that a trans woman who was attracted to women would be classed as a lesbian.",
      "The ruling found the biological interpretation of sex was also required for single-sex spaces to \"function coherently\".",
      "It cited changing rooms, hostels, medical services and single-sex higher education institutions.",
      "The judges noted \"similar confusion and impracticability\" had arisen in relation to single-sex associations and charities, women's sport, public sector equality and the armed forces.",
      "The judges added: \"The practical problems that arise under a certificated sex approach are clear indicators that this interpretation is not correct.\"",
      "Gender reassignment is a protected characteristic in law, making it is illegal to discriminate against someone on the basis that they are transgender.",
      "However, single-sex spaces can exclude people with GRCs \"if it is proportionate to do so\".",
      "Dr Nick McKerrell, senior law lecturer at Glasgow Caledonian University, said the ruling means a transgender women with a GRC who was excluded from a single-sex space would be unable to argue she is being discriminated against as a woman.",
      "He also said the ruling implied that workplaces would need to provide separate spaces for people on the basis of biological sex.",
      "But the law lecturer said arguments over access to single-sex spaces would not be \"settled\" by this court case.",
      "He told the BBC: \"It doesn't mean everything overnight is going to change in terms of stopping trans people from accessing services. It will depend on what providers think the new definition will mean for them.\"",
      "Dr McKerrell said the judgement does not immediately change anything for the rules on transgender participation in women's sport, but that it might prompt a \"reassessment\" of rules.",
      "How did we get here?",
      "The legal dispute began in 2018, when the Scottish Parliament passed a bill designed to ensure gender balance on public sector boards.",
      "For Women Scotland complained that ministers had included transgender people as part of the quotas in that law.",
      "The issue has been contested several times in the Scottish courts.",
      "Holyrood ministers won the most recent case in Scotland, with judge Lady Haldane ruling in 2022 that the definition of sex was \"not limited to biological or birth sex\".",
      "The Scottish Parliament passed reforms that year that would have made it easier for someone to change their legally recognised sex.",

      "The average price of petrol fell by 1.6p per litre between February and March to 137.5p per litre.",
      "The inflation decrease was also driven by a drop in recreation and culture prices, with toys, games, and hobbies falling particularly sharply.",
      "The fall in inflation means that, although prices continue to rise, the pace is slowing. Price rises have slowed from highs seen in recent years.",
      "Wages continue to outpace inflation with salary raises for public sector workers growing more than those in the private sector.",
      "The average rise in wages was 5.9%, data released by the ONS on Tuesday showed.",
      "How quickly are prices rising?",
      "How quickly are prices rising?",
      "In May, the inflation figure for April will likely be pushed to around 3% due to increases in gas prices, electricity prices, and water charges, said Michael Saunders, senior advisor at Oxford Economics.",

      "The Scottish government's argument - that sex can be changed via the gender recognition process, and that someone with a gender recognition certificate should have the protections of that sex - were dismissed.",
      "So what does it all mean?",
      "Supreme Court backs 'biological' definition of woman",
      "UK Supreme Court rules legal definition of a woman is based on biological sex",
      "The application of the law on the ground, in \"real life\", was clearly foremost in the minds of the judges.",
      "Take the example of single sex spaces and services - part of the motivation for FWS bringing this case.",
      "The previous reading of the law was that everything from hospital wards and prison wings to support groups for victims of abuse can exclude everyone but women thanks to exceptions in the Equality Act.",
      "The concern from campaigners was that if people could change their sex with a certificate, and then claim protection against discrimination as a woman, that could be more complicated.",
      "That's particularly the case on a practical level, given those providing these services aren't actually meant to ask to see a gender recognition certificate.",
      "Now, the court is clear that this exemption can continue - the rules underpinning women-only spaces can exclude people with gender recognition certificates, along with everyone else.",
      "Does the Equality Act still protect trans people?",
      "There are still conditions which need to be satisfied - services will have to show that excluding trans people is a limited and proportionate means to achieving a legitimate aim.",
      "Blanket bans are generally discouraged. There is still a bar to clear to exclude anyone, and the test of proportionality has to be met in each case.",
      "The Equality and Human Rights Commission - which oversees the application of the Equality Act - is to issue new guidance to help service providers",
      "But FWS are clearly delighted with the underlying principle, and hope it will lead to clearer guidance for those providing services.",
      "It's important to note that trans people are still protected by the Equality Act.",
      "The protected characteristic of gender reassignment is not affected by this ruling, and Lord Hodge stressed that there are other defences against direct and indirect discrimination and harassment.",
      "He was clear that trans people are a \"vulnerable and often harassed minority\", who \"struggle against discrimination and prejudice as they seek to live their lives with dignity\".",
      "But the court has held that it would be problematic to effectively divide trans people between two different protected characteristics, depending on whether they have a certificate.",
      "Again, judges stressed that this is particularly the case when service providers can't ask to see the certificate.",
      "They say the law needs to be \"clear and consistent\" - and that including those with a GRC in with women would ultimately be \"incoherent\".",

      "There had been some pressure on the UK government to clarify the definitions of the Equality Act, which is Westminster legislation.",

      "There may be more political pressure on the Scottish government, given it has lost this case.",
      "For a long time, ministers have batted away questions about this case - such as, do they really believe in the legal points their lawyers are making? - by saying they can't comment on live litigation.",

      "\"Nobody wants tariffs. No one wants a tariff war. We want to secure a deal with the US,\" she added.",
      "The real question about positive comments by Vice-President JD Vance and Jones about a UK-US trade deal, is what they actually mean by the term \"deal\".",
      "Just after Prime Minister Sir Keir Starmer's visit to the White House in February, it was rather telling that the UK delegation referred to what was being negotiated as an \"economic deal\".",

      "Most countries had faced higher tariffs - as illustrated on Donald Trump's big board - such as on electronics manufacturers in East Asia and they want to keep the levy at the 10% rate.",
      "The net result is that the UK may not have much to negotiate here, and yet is being treated very harshly, given there is no US trade deficit.",
      "Factor in the exemptions for electronics which benefit the likes of China and the fact that cars, a major industry for Britain, are being tariffed at 25% and the UK side has much to complain about.",
      "Another issue is that all this is being done at the same time as the post-Brexit reset negotiations are being outlined ahead of the UK-EU summit next month.",
      "The word is that the UK and EU would like to secure an ambitious deal which aligns closely on export rules. The aim of this reset would be to rid food and farm exports of most red tape.",
      "The US has taken an interest in this in the past. Could the US make it part of their negotiation?",
      "In addition, many US officials have mentioned a desire for allies to join it in containing China.",
      "The US might also try to force a choice on the UK here, or at least encourage action to keep out diverted Chinese goods.",
      "All this would fly in the face of the UK government's entire sell to the world that Britain could be the \"most connected economy in the world\" with strong links into European goods markets, US technology and the east Asia market, including China.",

    "story": [
      "The UK government has taken control of British Steel's plant in Scunthorpe, Lincolnshire, to prevent it from closing.",
      "Ministers say they have secured the raw materials needed to keep the plant's blast furnaces working in the \"coming weeks\", while they look for a long-term solution.",
      "What is British Steel and why is it important?",
      "British Steel's Scunthorpe plant employs 2,700 people, about three-quarters of the company's workforce.",
      "It is the last plant in the UK producing virgin steel, which is used in major construction projects like buildings and railways. It has fewer imperfections than the recycled steel made elsewhere in the country.",
      "Were the plant to stop producing virgin steel, the UK would be the only member of the G7 group of leading economies without the ability to make it. The government views that as a risk to the UK's economic security.",

      "British Steel to get supplies to keep furnaces burning",
      "UK takes control of British Steel under emergency powers",
      "Why is British Steel Chinese-owned?",
      "In 2016, Tata Steel sold the loss-making part of its business that made \"long products\" like transport rails and steel sections for construction.",
      "Private investment firm Greybull Capital bought it for \u00a31 and renamed the business British Steel.",
      "However, following financial collapse in 2019, British Steel was taken over by the government's insolvency service.",
      "It was sold to Chinese steel-making firm Jingye the following year.",
      "Can British Steel's blast furnaces keep running?",
      "Scunthorpe's skyline has four blast furnaces, all named after English Queens - Bess, Mary, Anne and Victoria. Bess and Anne are the only two still working.",
      "The supplies needed to keep them running - coking coal and iron pellets - are running low.",
      "But a delivery of the materials will be unloaded at Immingham docks and transported to Scunthorpe on Tuesday. A separate shipment of materials on its way to the UK from Australia.",
      "On Saturday, Business Secretary Jonathan Reynolds said it had become clear that Jingye intended to \"refuse\" to buy enough material to keep the furnaces running, and \"to cancel and refuse to pay for existing orders\".",
      "\"The company would therefore have irrevocably and unilaterally closed down primary steel making at British Steel,\" he added.",
      "Why can't a blast furnace easily be restarted?",
      "Turning off a blast furnace without making it permanently unusable is notoriously difficult.",
      "The furnaces operate at extreme temperatures, with iron ore and coking coal poured in at the top and liquid iron extracted at the bottom. This iron goes to the steel plant to make steel.",
      "If a furnace stops working, the molten metal will cool and solidify. This is called a \"salamander\".",
      "When the furnace is turned back on this metal heats up again and expands which can crack the furnace.",
      "A so-called \"Salamander Tap\" process can be used to temporarily shut down a blast furnace by drilling a hole to remove any remaining hot metal. However, this can be a dangerous process.",
      "Has British Steel been nationalised?",
      "The emergency legislation fast-tracked through Parliament on Saturday gives the government the ability to order raw materials for the furnaces and to direct the company's workforce and managers.",
      "Any employees sacked by the Chinese owners can be reinstated and the plant can be entered by force, if necessary, to secure assets.",
      "But Jingye will retain ownership of it for now.",
      "This means British Steel has not been nationalised - which is when a government takes ownership and control of a company.",
      "However, the business secretary acknowledged that public ownership was \"the likely option\" as there are currently no companies willing to buy the plant.",
      "If British Steel is nationalised, taxpayers' money will be used to run it. Reynolds says it is currently making an annual net loss of \u00a3233m, but had the furnaces been allowed to shut the cost to the taxpayer would be higher.",
      "Industry Minister Sarah Jones told the BBC the costs would come from an existing \u00a32.5bn fund for steel.",
      "\"We are hoping as you know to bring in a private sector partner as part of the future of Scunthorpe but those conversations are ongoing,\" she added.",
      "Why is the Scunthorpe plant losing money?",
      "In late March 2025, Jingye said the plant was losing around \u00a3700,000 a day and launched a consultation on its closure.",
      "It said the blast furnaces were \"no longer financially sustainable,\" blaming \"highly challenging\" market conditions, tariffs and costs associated with moving to lower-carbon production techniques.",
      "UK steel production has been falling for several decades and the financial pressures facing the industry were heightened in March when the US imposed a 25% tariff on any steel it imports.",
      "Global over-production has created \"a glut of steel on the international market\", according to a UK government UK government briefing, which has pushed prices down. British manufacturers also face higher costs, particularly on electricity, than elsewhere.",
      "After the government took control of the plant, China's embassy in the UK said it was \"closely following\" developments.",
      "It said: \"It is an objective fact that British steel companies have generally encountered difficulties in recent years.\"",
      "Who else produces steel in the UK?",
      "There are 1,160 businesses in the UK steel industry, directly supporting 40,000 other firms, according to government figures.",
      "Tata Steel at Port Talbot in Wales was once the UK's largest virgin steel producer but it turned off its blast furnace in September 2024, saying it was losing \u00a31.7m a day.",
      "An agreement with the UK government was reached which saw it commit \u00a3500m to help the company move to greener forms of steelmaking.",
      "Other steelmakers in the UK include Liberty Steel, Celsa, Marcegaglia and Outokumpu.",
      "Liberty Steel also has a plant in Scunthorpe which is facing closure. More than 120 jobs are at risk, with bosses blaming high energy costs.",
      "In 2023 the UK steel industry contributed \u00a32.3 billion to the UK economy -  equivalent to 0.1% of total UK economic output and 1.0% of manufacturing output.",
      "In the same year, the UK produced 5.6 million tonnes of crude steel, or 0.3% of the world's total. In comparison, China produced more than 1,000 million tonnes, 54% of global production.",
      "The EU produced 126 million tonnes of steel in 2023, 7% of the world's total. Compared with EU countries, the UK ranked as the eighth largest steel producer, after Germany, Italy, Spain, France, Austria, Poland and Belgium.",

    "story": [
      "Scientists have found new but tentative evidence that a faraway world orbiting another star may be home to life.",
      "A Cambridge team studying the atmosphere of a planet called K2-18b has detected signs of molecules which on Earth are only produced by simple organisms.",
      "This is the second, and more promising, time chemicals associated with life have been detected in the planet's atmosphere by Nasa's James Webb Space Telescope (JWST).",
      "But the team and independent astronomers stress that more data is needed to confirm these results.",
      "The lead researcher, Prof Nikku Madhusudhan, told me at his lab at Cambridge University's Institute of Astronomy that he hopes to obtain the clinching evidence soon.",
      "\"This is the strongest evidence yet there is possibly life out there. I can realistically say that we can confirm this signal within one to two years.\"",
      "K2-18b is two-and-a-half times the size of Earth and is 700 trillion miles, or 124 light years, away from us - a distance far beyond what any human could travel in a lifetime.",
      "JWST is so powerful that it can analyse the chemical composition of the planet's atmosphere from the light that passes through from the small red Sun it orbits.",
      "The Cambridge group has found that the atmosphere seems to contain the chemical signature of at least one of two molecules that are associated with life: dimethyl sulphide (DMS) and dimethyl disulphide (DMDS). On Earth, these gases are produced by marine phytoplankton and bacteria.",
      "Prof Madhusudhan said he was surprised by how much gas was apparently detected during a single observation window.",
      "\"The amount we estimate of this gas in the atmosphere is thousands of times higher than what we have on Earth,\" he said.",
      "\"So, if the association with life is real, then this planet will be teeming with life,\" he added.",
      "Prof Madhusudhan went further: \"If we confirm that there is life on K2-18b, it should basically confirm that life is very common in the galaxy.\"",
      "He told BBC Radio 5Live on Thursday: \"This is a very important moment in science, but also very important to us as a species.",
      "\"If there is one example, and the universe being infinite, there is a chance for life on many more planets.\"",
      "Dr Subir Sarkar, a lecturer in astrophysics at Cardiff University and part of the research team, said the research suggests K2-18b could have an ocean which could be potentially full of life - though he cautioned scientists \"don't know for sure\".",
      "He added that the research team's work will continue to focus on looking for life on other planets: \"Keep watching this space.\"",
      "The truth about life on other planets - and what it means for humans",
      "There are lots of \"ifs\" and \"buts\" at this stage, as Prof Madhusudhan's team freely admits.",
      "Firstly, this latest detection is not at the standard required to claim a discovery.",
      "For that, the researchers need to be about 99.99999% sure that their results are correct and not a fluke reading. In scientific jargon, that is a five sigma result.",
      "These latest results are only three sigma, or 99.7%. Which sounds like a lot, but it is not enough to convince the scientific community. However, it is much more than the one sigma result of 68% the team obtained 18 months ago, which was greeted with much scepticism at the time.",
      "But even if the Cambridge team obtains a five sigma result, that won't be conclusive proof that life exists on the planet, according to Prof Catherine Heymans of Edinburgh University and Scotland's Astronomer Royal, who is independent of the research team.",
      "\"Even with that certainty, there is still the question of what is the origin of this gas,\" she told BBC News.",
      "\"On Earth it is produced by microorganisms in the ocean, but even with perfect data we can't say for sure that this is of a biological origin on an alien world because loads of strange things happen in the Universe and we don't know what other geological activity could be happening on this planet that might produce the molecules.\"",
      "That view is one the Cambridge team agree with. They are working with other groups to see if DMS and DMDS can be produced by non-living means in the lab.",
      "\"There is still a 0.3% chance that it might be a statistical fluke,\" Prof Madhusudhan said.",
      "Suggesting life may exist on another planet was \"a big claim if true\", he told BBC Radio 4's Today programme, adding: \"So we want to be really, really thorough, and make more observations, and get the evidence to the level that there is less than a one-in-a-million chance of it being a fluke.\"",
      "He said this should be possible in \"maybe one or two years\".",
      "Other research groups have put forward alternative, lifeless, explanations for the data obtained from K2-18b. There is a strong scientific debate not only about whether DMS and DMDS are present but also the planet's composition.",
      "The reason many researchers infer that the planet has a vast liquid ocean is the absence of the gas ammonia in K2-18b's atmosphere. Their theory is that the ammonia is absorbed by a vast body of water below.",
      "But it could equally be explained by an ocean of molten rock, which would preclude life, according to Prof Oliver Shorttle of Cambridge University.",
      "\"Everything we know about planets orbiting other stars comes from the tiny amounts of light that glance off their atmospheres. So it is an incredibly tenuous signal that we are having to read, not only for signs of life, but everything else,\" he said.",
      "\"With K2-18b part of the scientific debate is still about the structure of the planet.\"",
      "Dr Nicolas Wogan at Nasa's Ames Research Center has yet another interpretation of the data. He published research suggesting that K2-18b is a mini gas giant with no surface.",
      "Both these alternative interpretations have also been challenged by other groups on the grounds that they are inconsistent with the data from JWST, compounding the strong scientific debate surrounding K2-18b.",
      "Prof Chris Lintott, presenter of the BBC's The Sky at Night, said he had \"great admiration\" for Prof Madhusudhan's team, but was treating the research with caution.",
      "\"I think we've got to be very careful about claiming that this is 'a moment' on the search to life. We've [had] such moments before,\" he told Today.",
      "He said the research should be seen instead as \"part of a huge effort to try and understand what's out there in the cosmos\".",
      "Prof Madhusudhan acknowledges that there is still a scientific mountain to climb if he is to answer one of the biggest questions in science. But he believes he and his team are on the right track.",
      "\"Decades from now, we may look back at this point in time and recognise it was when the living universe came within reach,\" he said.",
      "\"This could be the tipping point, where suddenly the fundamental question of whether we're alone in the universe is one we're capable of answering.\"",

      "Listen to this article on BBC Sounds",
      "There are some scientific discoveries that do much more than advance our knowledge: they create a shift in our psyche as they show us the scale of the Universe and our place in it.",
      "One such moment was when space craft sent back images of the Earth for the first time. Another is the discovery of life on another world, a moment that has inched a little closer today with the news that signs of a gas, which on Earth is produced by simple marine organisms, has been found on a planet called K2-18b.",
      "Now, the prospect of really finding alien life - meaning we are not alone in the Universe - is not far away, according to the scientist leading the team that made the detection.",
      "\"This is basically as big as it gets in terms of fundamental questions, and we may be on the verge of answering that question,\" says Prof Nikku Madhusudhan of the Institute of Astronomy at Cambridge University.",
      "But all of this prompts even more questions, including, if they do find life on another world, how will this change us as a species?",
      "Flying saucers and sci-fi aliens",
      "Our ancestors have long created stories of beings that might dwell in the skies. In the early 20th Century, astronomers thought they could see straight line features on the Martian surface, raising speculation that one of our nearest planets might be home to an advanced civilisation: an idea that spawned a wealth of pulp science fiction culture involving flying saucers and little green aliens.",
      "It was during an era when western governments generated fear of the spread of communism, so visitors from outer space were more often than not portrayed as menaces, bringing peril rather than hope.",
      "But decades on, what has been described as \"the strongest evidence yet\" of life on another world has come, not from Mars or Venus, but from a planet hundreds of trillions of miles away orbiting a distant star.",
      "Part of the challenge when it comes to researching the existence of alien life  is knowing where to look.",
      "Until relatively recently, the focus for Nasa's search for life was Mars, but that began to change in 1992 with the discovery of the first planet orbiting another star outside of our solar system.",
      "Although astronomers had suspected that there were other worlds around distant stars there had been no proof until that point. Since then, nearly 6,000 planets outside our solar system have been discovered.",
      "Scientists find 'strongest evidence yet' of life on distant planet",
      "Many are so-called gas giants, like Jupiter and Saturn in our solar system. Others are either too hot or too cold to support liquid water, thought to be essential for life.",
      "But many are in what astronomers call \"The Goldilocks Zone\" where the distance is \"just right\" to support life. Prof Madhusudhan believes there could be thousands in our galaxy.",
      "Breathtakingly ambitious tech",
      "As these so-called exoplanets were being discovered, scientists began to develop instruments to analyse the chemical composition of their atmospheres. Their ambition was breathtaking, some would say audacious.",
      "The idea was to capture the tiny amount of starlight glancing through the atmospheres of these faraway worlds and study them for chemical fingerprints of molecules, which on Earth can only be produced by living organisms, so-called biosignatures.",
      "And they succeeded in developing such instruments for ground and space-based telescopes.",
      "Nasa's James Webb Space Telescope (JWST), which detected the gas on the planet called K2-18b in this week's discovery, is the most powerful space telescope ever built and its launch in 2021 generated excitement that the search for life was at long last within humanity's grasp.",
      "But JWST has its limits - it can't detect faraway planets as small as ours or as close to their parent stars, because of the glare. So, Nasa is planning the Habitable Worlds Observatory (HWO), scheduled for the 2030s, which will be able to spot and sample the atmospheres of planets similar to our own. (This is possible using what is effectively a high-tech sunshield that minimises light from the star which a planet orbits.)",
      "Also coming online later this decade is the European Southern Observatory (ESO)'s Extremely Large Telescope (ELT), which will be on the ground, looking up at the crystal-clear skies of the Chilean desert.",
      "It has the largest mirror of any instrument built, 39-metres in diameter, and so can see vastly more detail at planetary atmospheres than its predecessors.",
      "More discoveries, more questions",
      "Prof Madhusudan, however, hopes to have enough data within two years to demonstrate categorically that he really has discovered the biosignatures around K2-18b. But even if he does achieve his aim, this won't lead to mass celebrations about the discovery of life on another world.",
      "Instead, it will be the start of another robust scientific debate about whether the biosignature could be produced by non-living means.",
      "Eventually though, as more data is gathered from more atmospheres and as chemists fail in finding alternative explanations for biosignatures, the scientific consensus will slowly and gradually shift towards the probability that life does exist on other worlds, according to Prof Catherine Heymans, from Edinburgh University, who is Scotland's Astronomer Royal.",
      "\"With more time on telescopes, astronomers will get a clearer vision of the chemical compositions of these atmospheres. You won't know that it's definitely life. But I think the more data that's built up, and that if you see this in multiple different systems, not just this one particular planet, it gives us more confidence\".",
      "The world wide web emerged in a series of incremental technological breakthroughs that didn't necessarily feel of enormous consequence at the time.",
      "In similar fashion, it may dawn on people that possibly the most enormous scientific, cultural and social transformation in the whole of human history has happened, but that the moment the balance was tipped in terms of there being other life out there was not fully recognised at the time.",
      "A much more definitive discovery would be to discover life in our own solar system using robotic space craft containing portable laboratories. Any off-world bug could be analysed, possibly even brought back to Earth, providing prima facie evidence to at least significantly limit any scientific push back that may ensue.",
      "The scientific case for the possibility of life or past life in our own solar system has increased in recent years following data sent back by various spacecraft, so several missions to search for signs of it are on their way.",
      "The European Space Agency's (ESA) ExoMars rover, planned for launch in 2028, will drill below the surface of Mars to search for signs of past and possibly present life. Given the extreme conditions on Mars, however, the discovery of fossilised past life is the more likely outcome.",
      "China's Tianwen-3 mission, also planned for launch in 2028 is designed to collect samples and bring them back to Earth by 2031. Nasa and ESA each have spacecraft on their way to the icy moons of Jupiter to see if there may be water, possibly vast oceans, under their icy surfaces.",
      "But the spacecraft are not designed to find life itself.  Instead, these missions lay the ground for future missions which will, according to Prof Michele Dougherty of Imperial College, London.",
      "\"It is a long, slow process,\" she says. \"The next decision to make would be a lander, which moon it goes to, and where we should be landing.",
      "\"You don't want to land where the ice crust is so thick that there is no way you can get underneath the surface. And so, it's a long, slow burn, but it's pretty exciting en route\".",
      "Nasa is also sending a spacecraft called Dragonfly to land on one of the moons of Saturn, Titan in 2034. It is an exotic world with what are thought to be lakes and clouds made from carbon-rich chemicals which give the planet an eerie orange haze, bringing The Beatles\u2018 song, Lucy in the Sky with Diamonds to mind: a world with \"marmalade skies\".",
      "Along with water these chemicals are thought to be a necessary ingredient for life.",
      "Prof Dougherty is one of the leading planetary scientists in her field. Does she think there is life on one of the icy Moons of Jupiter or Saturn?",
      "\"I'd be very surprised if there wasn't,\" she says, beaming with delight.",
      "\"Three things are required: a heat source, liquid water and organic (carbon-based) chemicals. If we have those three ingredients, the chances that life is able to form rises really steeply.",
      "Reducing human 'specialness'",
      "If simple life forms are found to exist that is no guarantee that more complex life forms are out there.",
      "Prof Madhusudhan believes that, if confirmed, simple life should be \"pretty common\" in the galaxy. \"But going from that simple life to complex life is a big step, and that is an open question. How that step happens? What are the conditions that govern that? We don't know that. And then going from there to intelligent life is another big step.\"",
      "Dr Robert Massey, who is the deputy executive director of the Royal Astronomical Society, agrees that the emergence of intelligent life on another world is much less likely than simple life.",
      "\"When we see the emergence of life on Earth, it was so complex. It took such a long time for multi-cellular life to emerge and then evolve into diverse life forms.",
      "\"The big question is whether there was something about the Earth that made that evolution possible. Do we need exactly the same conditions, our size, our oceans and land masses for that to happen on other worlds or will that happen regardless?\"",

      "As he puts it, centuries ago, we believed we were at the centre of the Universe and with each discovery in astronomy we have found ourselves \"more displaced\" from that point. \"I think the discovery of life elsewhere it would further reduce our specialness,\" he says.",
      "Prof Dougherty, on the other hand, believes that such a discovery in our own solar system would be good for science, and good for the soul.",
      "\"The discovery of even simple life will allow us a better understanding about how we might have evolved way back those millions of aeons ago when we first evolved. And so, for me, it's helping us find our place in the Universe.",
      "\"If we know there is life, elsewhere in our solar system and potentially beyond, [this] would somehow be comforting to me, knowing that we're a fabric of something larger will make us bigger\".",
      "Never before have scientists searched so hard for life on other worlds and never before have they had such incredible tools to do this with. And many working in the field believe that it is a matter of when, rather than if, they discover life on other worlds. And rather than bringing fear, the discovery of alien life will bring hope, according to Prof Madhusudhan.",
      "\"When we would look at the sky, we would see not just physical objects, stars and planets, we would see a living sky. The societal ramifications of that are immense. It will be a huge transformational change in the way we look at ourselves in the cosmic scene.",
      "\"It will fundamentally change the human psyche in how we view ourselves and each other, and any barriers, linguistic, political, geographical, will dissolve, as we realise we are all one. And that will bring us closer,\" he continues.",

      "The industry was set a target to reduce these incidents by 40% by 2025 against 2016 levels.",
      "The latest publicly availably data is to the end of 2023. But following a Freedom of Information request, Surfers Against Sewage obtained the data up to the start of 2025.",
      "This showed that 2,487 pollution incidents were recorded last year - a 31% increase on the 2016 levels, and almost double the original EA target.",
      "\"The water industry fails, fails and fails again,\" said Giles Bristow, CEO of Surfers Against Sewage.",

      "Some of the UK's rarest wildlife is being \"torched alive\" and pushed closer to extinction after weeks of intense grass fires, conservationists have warned.",
      "They include endangered birds like hen harriers and water voles, which are now the UK's fastest declining mammal.",
      "The National Trust said it believed ongoing wildfires at Abergwesyn common in Powys had destroyed \"the last remaining\" local breeding habitat for golden plovers - considered one of the most beautiful birds of the British uplands.",

      "Some wildlife may not return after recurring fires",
      "Aerial images show land devastated by wildfire",
      "Figures obtained by the BBC show that in Wales, fire crews have battled almost 1,400 wildfires already this year, leading fire services to urge people to \"act responsibly\" and report any suspicious behaviour to the police.",
      "The National Trust said 2025 was \"turning out to be the worst year ever for these human-caused fires across the country\".",
      "\"We're extremely worried, this is looking like it's going to be the worst year for seeing our wildlife going up in flames,\" said Ben McCarthy, the charity's head of nature conservation.",
      "A record dry spell and unusually high temperatures in March are believed to have contributed to the fires. A low number of blazes in 2024 also left more vegetation to fuel them.",
      "Coed Cadw, the Woodland Trust in Wales, said an \"irreplaceable\" area of temperate Atlantic rainforest had been affected at Allt Boeth near Aberystwyth, with damage to protected bluebells too.",
      "Also known as Celtic rainforest, the habitat harbours scarce plants, lichens and fungi, and is considered more threatened than tropical rainforest.",
      "In England, the National Trust said several thousand newly planted trees at Marsden Moor, in West Yorkshire, had gone up in flames.",
      "While on the Morne Mountains, in Northern Ireland, invertebrates and ground dwelling animals like reptiles were \"simply being torched alive\".",
      "\"That then cascades through the food web because without the invertebrates you don't get the birds who are reliant on them for food,\" Mr McCarthy said.",
      "He said government funding to help farmers and land managers restore peat bogs in the uplands, to prevent fires while also soaking in planet-warming carbon and providing habitat, was essential.",
      "Conservation charities including The Wildlife Trusts and the Initiative for Nature Conservation Cymru (INCC) also voiced fears for the future of the water vole, which is already under serious threat from habitat loss and predation by American minks.",
      "Small animals like water voles and shrews, which live in burrows, can survive fast-moving fires but their habitats and the food they rely on are destroyed.",
      "Water voles are \"the fastest-declining mammal ever\" according to Rob Parry of the INCC.",
      "\"Their last foothold [in Wales] is in the uplands so when those sites are burned it is awful for that particular population, but from a UK point of view we are one step closer to the extinction of an entire species,\" he said.",

      "\"I don't know how they are going to cope. A wildfire just makes that habitat disappear overnight.\"",
      "Other rare birds are also affected, including hen harriers, which have been subject to  recent conservation efforts to increase their numbers in the Welsh uplands, and skylarks, which have declined in huge numbers since the 1970s.",
      "\"We're worried enough as it is about wildlife,\" said Mr Parry.",
      "\"We're one of the most nature-depleted countries in the world and wildfires every spring at the worst possible time is a burden that wildlife and the environment just can't cope with.\"",
      "The INCC has called for closer oversight of controlled burns by farmers and better monitoring of the impact of wildfires on the environment.",
      "Natural Resources Wales (NRW) said wildfires were a \"massive issue\", particularly in south Wales, where Welsh government figures showed more than half of wildfires in Wales took place last year.",
      "Becky Davies, a senior officer at NRW, said: \"In the last three days we've had over 75 fires in the south Wales valleys alone.",
      "\"We have a lot of hillsides that are linear, the valley side has a lot of bracken, a lot of heathland, grassland and coal spoil and that is the sort of hillside that goes up in flames.\"",
      "The environmental impact of wildfires can also be felt more widely.",
      "When it rains after a fire, the newly bare soil and the phosphates that were trapped inside it can wash off into streams and rivers, affecting water quality.",
      "'Deliberate fire setting is a crime'",
      "Numbers of wildfires vary year-on-year depending on when spells of dry weather happen.",
      "But figures obtained by the BBC show that in south Wales, grassfires have increased by 1,200% from the same time period last year.",

      "\"Most of the animals offered for sale came from countries such as Russia, Belarus, and Ukraine, to be smuggled into the European Union,\" the Civil Guard said.",
      "The authorities said the couple's social media was \"extremely active\" as people from other countries contacted them to purchase these types of animals.",
      "The animals were smuggled into the EU through Poland's border with Belarus and then distributed with false documents, they added.",

      "The animals have been temporarily placed at the Son Servera Safari Zoo in Majorca. They may be later relocated to a rescue centre near Alicante, although this is still under discussion.",
      "The high demand for exotic cats is fuelled by social media because the felines can be seen as a sign of wealth or status, according the IFAW.",
      "But these cats \u2013 which require a lot of space \u2013 are difficult to look after.",

      "The day after the Eyjafjallaj\u00f6kull eruption which spewed ash high into the atmosphere - around 20 to 50,000ft (4-10 miles) where commercial airlines operate - that ash started to drift southward into UK airspace.",
      "International aviation rules at the time were that aircraft could not fly into any levels of volcanic ash and the airspace was quickly closed down.",
      "This had never caused a problem before because most volcanic eruptions up to that point were localised and airlines were able to fly around ash cloud without issue.",
      "According to Jonathan Nicholson from the UK Civil Aviation Authority (CAA): \"It was what a lot of people called a 'Black Swan Event' - unforeseen, typically with extreme consequences - but it was a Black Swan that was ultimately predictable because Icelandic volcanoes happened and will continue to happen.\"",

      "\"An eye opener globally\"",
      "The Met Office operates one of nine global Volcanic Ash Advisory Centres (VAAC) and is responsible for issuing advisories for volcanic eruptions originating from the north eastern corner of the North Atlantic, including Iceland.",
      "Once Eyjafjallaj\u00f6kull erupted the centre ran computer models with forecast data and for Dr Matthew Hort, Head of Atmospheric Dispersion at the Met Office, it was the most intense period of his working life before and since.",
      "He said: \"It was an eye opener globally. The unique thing about the Icelandic eruption was that it happened in an area where we had winds from the north that brought the ash down across UK airspace and trans-Atlantic routes.\"",
      "Four days after the main eruption the Met Office dispersion forecasts showed ash across the UK, the Atlantic, most of Europe and western Russia.",
      "As the days of disruption went on with no sign of ash contamination clearing, everyone was under pressure to find a way to re-open airspace in a safe and controlled way.",
      "Airlines and engine manufacturers had to conduct research to ascertain if there was a safe level of ash concentration which wouldn't damage jet engines.",
      "Rolls-Royce was at the forefront of pioneering testing and for the first time was able to establish a level of volcanic ash that didn't seriously affect the jet engine over a given timeframe.",
      "Mr Nicholson explained: \"In conjunction with Met Office forecasts it enabled us to open airspace where there were low levels of ash.\"",
      "On 20 April after an international teleconference headed by the CAA, it was agreed that 2 milligrams of ash per cubic metre of air was an acceptable safe ash concentration.",
      "Airspace re-opened that night with flights operating as normal.",
      "Eyjafjallaj\u00f6kull continued to erupt well into June with occasional spikes of higher ash concentration coming into the UK but under the new rules authorities were able to keep most of the airspace open with only localised airport closures.",
      "Airlines had a 'zero volcanic ash' policy for jet engines in 2010",
      "Have things changed?",
      "In the months and years after research and working groups continued to assess procedures and rules.",
      "\"The work that happened very quickly at the time around the event got us to 90% of where we are now\u2026but that has been consolidated and put into specific safety measures,\" Mr Nicholson said.",
      "Today there are three levels of volcanic ash contamination - low, medium and high, with guidance on how long a pilot can fly in those concentrations before causing significant damage.",
      "\"If something similar happened today, it will be up to the airlines to use their own permissions from the engine manufacturers and their own safety cases to decide where and when, based on forecasts, will allow them to go,\" Mr Nicholson added.",
      "\"And that will be different for each airline as some may accept higher or lower levels of ash as acceptable.\"",
      "There has also been a massive development programme in the monitoring and forecasting of volcanic ash.",
      "As a direct result of the ash cloud the Met Office deployed permanent LIDAR instruments that point a laser into the sky capable of measuring ash concentrations.",
      "New satellites have also been launched globally which enable scientists to monitor ash concentrations every 15 minutes.",
      "In addition there have been advances in computer modelling to improve the physics and processes involved in how different shapes and sizes of volcanic ash behave in the atmosphere.",
      "Volcano has been erupting intermittendly near Grindavik, Icleand with large lava flows but no ash cloud",
      "Could it happen again?",
      "What is clear today is that as a direct result of 2010, with all the improvements made, the UK and Europe is in a much better place to control and manage volcanic ash.",
      "In recent months there have been small eruptions in Iceland leading to the evacuation of Grindavik and the closure of the famous Blue Lagoon spa.",
      "However, there has been little concern to aviation as these recent eruptions are mostly small fissure eruptions with large and slow lava flows - rather than the explosive ash eruption from Eyjafjallaj\u00f6kull.",
      "Experts believe that if the 2010 volcanic ash event happened today there would be \"nowhere near the same level, if any, disruption\" according to both Dr Hort and Mr Nicholson, largely because we now know that the level of ash seen in UK airspace in 2010 was relatively low and safe to fly in.",
      "But Dr Hort warns: \"You can always have a bigger eruption.\"",

    "summary": "Countries break ten-year deadlock to agree measures to reduce commercial shipping emissions.",
    "story": [
      "Countries have agreed a global deal to tackle shipping emissions, after nearly ten years of negotiations.",
      "The agreement covers the vast majority of the world's commercial shipping and means that starting in 2028, ship owners will have to use increasingly cleaner fuels or face fines.",
      "The deal was nearly derailed after Saudi Arabia forced a last minute vote and the US pulled out of talks in London \u2013 but it eventually passed on Friday.",
      "Small island states and environmental groups were angry that a blanket tax was not  agreed to and called the deal \"unfit for purpose\".",
      "Shipping agrees net-zero goal but critics unmoved",
      "Clean energy's share of world's electricity reaches 40%, report says",
      "Shipping accounts for around 3% of global emissions. But unlike many other sectors it has struggled to reduce its carbon footprint over the last decade and is reliant on fossil fuels like diesel.",
      "But the agreement means it is now the first industry in the world with internationally mandated targets to reduce emissions.",
      "The agreement was passed at the UN's International Maritime Organisation (IMO) meeting.",
      "It will require owners of large international vessels to increase their use of less carbon intensive fuels or face a penalty of up to $380 per tonne of carbon dioxide emissions they emit from burning fuel.",
      "Although the final agreement was passed, it had to be put to a vote - an unusual move for UN bodies that usually agree measures by consensus.",
      "The vote was requested by Saudi Arabia, who did not support the agreement, and this position was shared by a dozen other oil-producing nations, including Russia.",
      "Although they opposed the proposal, they will be bound to implement it because they are members of the IMO.",
      "There have been moves to improve the efficiency of ships, but emissions have continued to increase in line with global trade - 90% of which is carried by ships.",
      "The most effective measure would be to switch ships away from fossil fuels to green fuels, but that would be very expensive.",
      "\"There is no fuel as cheap as diesel that ships use today because when we take crude oil out of the ground, we take out all the nice bits, that's the kerosene for aviation, diesel and petrol for cars,\" said Faig Abbasov, programme director for maritime transport at think tank Transport and Environment.",
      "\"Whatever is left at the bottom, that's what ships burn. So no fuel will be as cheap as this because not much energy goes into its production,\" he said.",
      "In comparison, the most environmentally friendly fuels like e-kerosene and ammonia are created from initially splitting water molecules to obtain hydrogen, which is a very energy-intensive and costly process.",
      "Figures vary depending on the fuel type but the World Economic Forum estimates that these green fuels are 3-4 times more expensive to produce.",
      "\"There's still a huge cost gap between the fossil fuels and the zero emission fuels and we need to close this gap. So you need carrots and sticks and in shipping the stick is not that big yet to use sustainable fuels,\" said Refke Gunnewijk, manager for clean industry & transport at the Port of Rotterdam.",
      "Some island states also abstained and said the deal was a watered down version of what they hoped for. An earlier proposal to apply a blanket carbon tax or levy - which would have been a world first - was dropped.",
      "\"Let us be clear about who has abandoned 1.5\u00b0C. Saudi Arabia, the US and fossil fuel allies pushed down the numbers to an untenable level and blocked progress at every turn,\" said Ralph Regenvanu, minister of energy and climate change for Vanuatu.",
      "Their disappointment was shared by environmental groups.",
      "\"This week, IMO member states squandered a golden opportunity for the global shipping sector to show the world how it can turn the tide on catastrophic climate heating, putting their own goals out of reach\", said Delaine McCullough, president of the Clean Shipping Coalition.",
      "It is estimated that the agreement could achieve an 8% reduction in emissions for the sector by 2030, according to the maritime consultancy UMAS. This would be short of the IMO's target agreed two years ago to cut emissions by 20% by the end of the decade.",
      "But China and Brazil had previously raised concerns that a levy could result in a significant price increase for basic goods like food. Both countries backed the final deal.",
      "Jesse Fahnestock, director of decarbonisation at the Global Maritime Forum, said that the deal was a compromise.",
      "\"It is a difficult set of decisions, but it is the first regulation of its kind and that is to be celebrated,\" he said.",
      "Listen: How to clean up the shipping industry",
      "Listen: How to clean up the shipping industry",
      "Fahnestock added it was unclear if the penalties were enough to close the cost gap between the fuel types.",
      "\"You may have incentivised shipowners to prepare a bit for the future fuels but whether the signal is strong enough to get the billions of dollars of investment into the production facilities for these fuels - I don't think these regulations will overcome that. I think more will need to be done,\" he said.",
      "Any money raised from the penalties will be put into a \"Net Zero\" fund, with money spent on scaling up greener fuels and supporting developing countries.",
      "It is this \"redistribution\" that prompted the US delegation to pull out of the talks on Tuesday night. A letter was sent by the US to all countries at the IMO negotiations saying any levy would cause inflation and if it was passed then \"reciprocal measures\" would be taken.",
      "Although the US move was at odds with its long-held position at the IMO, it was in keeping with President Trump's push back on climate action seen over the last few months - such as withdrawing the US from the Paris Climate Agreement.",
      "But industry and country delegates appeared unperturbed when speaking to the BBC on Wednesday and continued with negotiations.",
      "The US only flags 178 cargo ships that represent 0.57% of worldwide commercial shipping tonnage. So if it took the decision not to implement the new proposals it is unlikely to make a significant difference to the funds raised.",

    "story": [
      "Listen to this article on BBC Sounds",
      "There are some scientific discoveries that do much more than advance our knowledge: they create a shift in our psyche as they show us the scale of the Universe and our place in it.",
      "One such moment was when space craft sent back images of the Earth for the first time. Another is the discovery of life on another world, a moment that has inched a little closer today with the news that signs of a gas, which on Earth is produced by simple marine organisms, has been found on a planet called K2-18b.",
      "Now, the prospect of really finding alien life - meaning we are not alone in the Universe - is not far away, according to the scientist leading the team that made the detection.",
      "\"This is basically as big as it gets in terms of fundamental questions, and we may be on the verge of answering that question,\" says Prof Nikku Madhusudhan of the Institute of Astronomy at Cambridge University.",
      "But all of this prompts even more questions, including, if they do find life on another world, how will this change us as a species?",
      "Flying saucers and sci-fi aliens",
      "Our ancestors have long created stories of beings that might dwell in the skies. In the early 20th Century, astronomers thought they could see straight line features on the Martian surface, raising speculation that one of our nearest planets might be home to an advanced civilisation: an idea that spawned a wealth of pulp science fiction culture involving flying saucers and little green aliens.",
      "It was during an era when western governments generated fear of the spread of communism, so visitors from outer space were more often than not portrayed as menaces, bringing peril rather than hope.",
      "But decades on, what has been described as \"the strongest evidence yet\" of life on another world has come, not from Mars or Venus, but from a planet hundreds of trillions of miles away orbiting a distant star.",
      "Part of the challenge when it comes to researching the existence of alien life  is knowing where to look.",
      "Until relatively recently, the focus for Nasa's search for life was Mars, but that began to change in 1992 with the discovery of the first planet orbiting another star outside of our solar system.",
      "Although astronomers had suspected that there were other worlds around distant stars there had been no proof until that point. Since then, nearly 6,000 planets outside our solar system have been discovered.",
      "Scientists find 'strongest evidence yet' of life on distant planet",
      "Many are so-called gas giants, like Jupiter and Saturn in our solar system. Others are either too hot or too cold to support liquid water, thought to be essential for life.",
      "But many are in what astronomers call \"The Goldilocks Zone\" where the distance is \"just right\" to support life. Prof Madhusudhan believes there could be thousands in our galaxy.",
      "Breathtakingly ambitious tech",
      "As these so-called exoplanets were being discovered, scientists began to develop instruments to analyse the chemical composition of their atmospheres. Their ambition was breathtaking, some would say audacious.",
      "The idea was to capture the tiny amount of starlight glancing through the atmospheres of these faraway worlds and study them for chemical fingerprints of molecules, which on Earth can only be produced by living organisms, so-called biosignatures.",
      "And they succeeded in developing such instruments for ground and space-based telescopes.",
      "Nasa's James Webb Space Telescope (JWST), which detected the gas on the planet called K2-18b in this week's discovery, is the most powerful space telescope ever built and its launch in 2021 generated excitement that the search for life was at long last within humanity's grasp.",
      "But JWST has its limits - it can't detect faraway planets as small as ours or as close to their parent stars, because of the glare. So, Nasa is planning the Habitable Worlds Observatory (HWO), scheduled for the 2030s, which will be able to spot and sample the atmospheres of planets similar to our own. (This is possible using what is effectively a high-tech sunshield that minimises light from the star which a planet orbits.)",
      "Also coming online later this decade is the European Southern Observatory (ESO)'s Extremely Large Telescope (ELT), which will be on the ground, looking up at the crystal-clear skies of the Chilean desert.",
      "It has the largest mirror of any instrument built, 39-metres in diameter, and so can see vastly more detail at planetary atmospheres than its predecessors.",
      "More discoveries, more questions",
      "Prof Madhusudan, however, hopes to have enough data within two years to demonstrate categorically that he really has discovered the biosignatures around K2-18b. But even if he does achieve his aim, this won't lead to mass celebrations about the discovery of life on another world.",
      "Instead, it will be the start of another robust scientific debate about whether the biosignature could be produced by non-living means.",
      "Eventually though, as more data is gathered from more atmospheres and as chemists fail in finding alternative explanations for biosignatures, the scientific consensus will slowly and gradually shift towards the probability that life does exist on other worlds, according to Prof Catherine Heymans, from Edinburgh University, who is Scotland's Astronomer Royal.",
      "\"With more time on telescopes, astronomers will get a clearer vision of the chemical compositions of these atmospheres. You won't know that it's definitely life. But I think the more data that's built up, and that if you see this in multiple different systems, not just this one particular planet, it gives us more confidence\".",
      "The world wide web emerged in a series of incremental technological breakthroughs that didn't necessarily feel of enormous consequence at the time.",
      "In similar fashion, it may dawn on people that possibly the most enormous scientific, cultural and social transformation in the whole of human history has happened, but that the moment the balance was tipped in terms of there being other life out there was not fully recognised at the time.",
      "A much more definitive discovery would be to discover life in our own solar system using robotic space craft containing portable laboratories. Any off-world bug could be analysed, possibly even brought back to Earth, providing prima facie evidence to at least significantly limit any scientific push back that may ensue.",
      "The scientific case for the possibility of life or past life in our own solar system has increased in recent years following data sent back by various spacecraft, so several missions to search for signs of it are on their way.",
      "The European Space Agency's (ESA) ExoMars rover, planned for launch in 2028, will drill below the surface of Mars to search for signs of past and possibly present life. Given the extreme conditions on Mars, however, the discovery of fossilised past life is the more likely outcome.",
      "China's Tianwen-3 mission, also planned for launch in 2028 is designed to collect samples and bring them back to Earth by 2031. Nasa and ESA each have spacecraft on their way to the icy moons of Jupiter to see if there may be water, possibly vast oceans, under their icy surfaces.",
      "But the spacecraft are not designed to find life itself.  Instead, these missions lay the ground for future missions which will, according to Prof Michele Dougherty of Imperial College, London.",
      "\"It is a long, slow process,\" she says. \"The next decision to make would be a lander, which moon it goes to, and where we should be landing.",
      "\"You don't want to land where the ice crust is so thick that there is no way you can get underneath the surface. And so, it's a long, slow burn, but it's pretty exciting en route\".",
      "Nasa is also sending a spacecraft called Dragonfly to land on one of the moons of Saturn, Titan in 2034. It is an exotic world with what are thought to be lakes and clouds made from carbon-rich chemicals which give the planet an eerie orange haze, bringing The Beatles\u2018 song, Lucy in the Sky with Diamonds to mind: a world with \"marmalade skies\".",
      "Along with water these chemicals are thought to be a necessary ingredient for life.",
      "Prof Dougherty is one of the leading planetary scientists in her field. Does she think there is life on one of the icy Moons of Jupiter or Saturn?",
      "\"I'd be very surprised if there wasn't,\" she says, beaming with delight.",
      "\"Three things are required: a heat source, liquid water and organic (carbon-based) chemicals. If we have those three ingredients, the chances that life is able to form rises really steeply.",

How that step happens? What are the conditions that govern that? We don't know that. And then going from there to intelligent life is another big step.\"",
      "Dr Robert Massey, who is the deputy executive director of the Royal Astronomical Society, agrees that the emergence of intelligent life on another world is much less likely than simple life.",
      "\"When we see the emergence of life on Earth, it was so complex. It took such a long time for multi-cellular life to emerge and then evolve into diverse life forms.",
      "\"The big question is whether there was something about the Earth that made that evolution possible. Do we need exactly the same conditions, our size, our oceans and land masses for that to happen on other worlds or will that happen regardless?\"",
      "He believes that the discovery of even simple alien life would be the latest chapter in the diminution of humanity's place in the cosmos.",
      "As he puts it, centuries ago, we believed we were at the centre of the Universe and with each discovery in astronomy we have found ourselves \"more displaced\" from that point. \"I think the discovery of life elsewhere it would further reduce our specialness,\" he says.",
      "Prof Dougherty, on the other hand, believes that such a discovery in our own solar system would be good for science, and good for the soul.",
      "\"The discovery of even simple life will allow us a better understanding about how we might have evolved way back those millions of aeons ago when we first evolved. And so, for me, it's helping us find our place in the Universe.",
      "\"If we know there is life, elsewhere in our solar system and potentially beyond, [this] would somehow be comforting to me, knowing that we're a fabric of something larger will make us bigger\".",
      "Never before have scientists searched so hard for life on other worlds and never before have they had such incredible tools to do this with. And many working in the field believe that it is a matter of when, rather than if, they discover life on other worlds. And rather than bringing fear, the discovery of alien life will bring hope, according to Prof Madhusudhan.",
      "\"When we would look at the sky, we would see not just physical objects, stars and planets, we would see a living sky. The societal ramifications of that are immense. It will be a huge transformational change in the way we look at ourselves in the cosmic scene.",
      "\"It will fundamentally change the human psyche in how we view ourselves and each other, and any barriers, linguistic, political, geographical, will dissolve, as we realise we are all one. And that will bring us closer,\" he continues.",

    "published": "Tue, 15 Apr 2025 23:39:32 GMT",
    "summary": "America is trying to create a chip industry through isolation and protectionism, when what allowed it to emerge in Asia is the opposite: collaboration.",
    "story": [
      "Listen to this article",
      "The US has \"dropped the ball\" on chip manufacturing over the years, allowing China and other Asian hubs to steam ahead. So said Gina Raimondo, who at the time was the US Commerce Secretary, in an interview with me back in 2021.",
      "Four years on, chips remain a battleground in the US-China race for tech supremacy, and US President Donald Trump now wants to turbocharge a highly complex and delicate manufacturing process that has taken other regions decades to perfect.",
      "He says his tariff policy will liberate the US economy and bring jobs home, but it is also the case that some of the biggest companies have long struggled with a lack of skilled workers and poor-quality products in their American factories.",
      "So what will Trump do differently? And, given that Taiwan and other parts of Asia have the secret sauce on creating high-precision chips, is it even possible for the US to produce them too, and at scale?",
      "Microchips: The secret sauce",
      "Semiconductors are central to powering everything from washing machines to iPhones, and military jets to electric vehicles. These tiny wafers of silicon, known as chips, were invented in the United States, but today, it is in Asia that the most advanced chips are being produced at phenomenal scale.",
      "Making them is expensive and technologically complex. An iPhone for example may contain chips that were designed in the US, manufactured in Taiwan, Japan or South Korea, using raw materials like rare earths which are mostly mined in China. Next they may be sent to Vietnam for packaging, then to China for assembly and testing, before being shipped to the US.",
      "It is a deeply integrated ecosystem, one that has evolved over the decades.",
      "Trump has praised the chip industry but also threatened it with tariffs. He has told industry leader, Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company (TSMC), it would have to pay a tax of 100% if it did not build factories in the US.",
      "With such a complex ecosystem, and fierce competition, they need to be able to plan for higher costs and investment calls in the long term, well beyond Trump's administration. The constant changes to policies aren't helping. So far, some have shown a willingness to invest in the US.",
      "The significant subsidies that China, Taiwan, Japan and South Korea have given to private companies developing chips are a big reason for their success.",
      "That was largely the thinking behind the US Chips and Science Act, which became law in 2022 under President Joe Biden \u2013 an effort to re-shore the manufacture of chips and diversify supply chains - by allocating grants, tax credits, and subsidies to incentivise domestic manufacturing.",
      "Some companies like the world's largest chipmaker TSMC and the world's largest smartphone maker Samsung have become major beneficiaries of the legislation, with TSMC receiving $6.6 billion in grants and loans for plants in Arizona, and Samsung receiving an estimated $6 billion for a facility in Taylor, Texas.",
      "TSMC announced a further $100 billion investment into the US with Trump, on top of $65 billion pledged for three plants. Diversifying chip production works for TSMC too, with China repeatedly threatening to take control of the island.",
      "But both TSMC and Samsung have faced challenges with their investments, including surging costs, difficulty recruiting skilled labour, construction delays and resistance from local unions.",
      "\"This isn't just a factory where you make boxes,\" says Marc Einstein, research director at market intelligence firm Counterpoint. \"The factories that make chips are such high-tech sterile environments, they take years and years to build.\"",
      "And despite the US investment, TSMC has said that most of its manufacturing will remain in Taiwan, especially its most advanced computer chips.",
      "Did China try to steal Taiwan's prowess?",
      "Today, TSMC's plants in Arizona produce high-quality chips. But Chris Miller, author of Chip War: The Fight for the World's Most Critical Technology, argues that \"they're a generation behind the cutting edge in Taiwan\".",
      "\"The question of scale depends on how much investment is made in the US versus Taiwan,\" he says. \"Today, Taiwan has far more capacity.\"",
      "The reality is, it took decades for Taiwan to build up that capacity, and despite the threat of China spending billions to steal Taiwan's prowess in the industry, it continues to thrive.",
      "TSMC was the pioneer of the \"foundry model\" where chip makers took US designs and manufactured chips for other companies.",
      "Riding on a wave of Silicon Valley start-ups like Apple, Qualcomm and Intel, TSMC was able to compete with US and Japanese giants with the best engineers, highly skilled labour and knowledge sharing.",
      "\"Could the US make chips and create jobs?\" asks Mr Einstein. \"Sure, but are they going to get chips down to a nanometre? Probably not.\"",
      "One reason is Trump's immigration policy, which can potentially limit the arrival of skilled talent from China and India.",
      "\"Even Elon Musk has had an immigration problem with Tesla engineers,\" says Mr Einstein, referring to Musk's support for the US's H-1B visa programme that brings skilled workers to the US.",
      "\"That's a bottleneck and there's nothing they can do, unless they change their stance on immigration entirely. You can't just magic PhDs out of nowhere.\"",
      "The global knock-on effect",
      "Even so, Trump has doubled down on tariffs, ordering a national security trade investigation into the semiconductor sector.",
      "\"It's a wrench in the machine \u2013 a big wrench,\" says Mr Einstein. \"Japan for example was basing its economic revitalisation on semiconductors and tariffs were not in the business plan.\"",
      "The longer-term impact on the industry, according to Mr Miller, is likely to be a renewed focus on domestic manufacturing in many of the world's key economies: China, Europe, the US.",
      "Some companies could look for new markets. Chinese technology giant Huawei, for example, expanded into Europe and emerging markets including Thailand, the UAE, Saudi Arabia, Malaysia and many countries in Africa in the face of export controls and tariffs, although the margins in developing nations are small.",
      "\"China ultimately will want to win \u2013 it has to innovate and invest in R&D. Look at what it did with Deepseek,\" says Mr Einstein, referring to the China-built AI chatbot.",
      "\"If they build better chips, everyone is going to go to them. Cost-effectiveness is something they can do now, and looking forward, it's the ultra-high-tech fabrication.\"",
      "In the meantime, new manufacturing hubs may emerge. India has a lot of promise, according to experts who say there is more chance of it becoming integrated into the chip supply chain than the US \u2013 it's geographically closer, labour is cheap and education is good.",
      "India has signalled a willingness that it is open to chip manufacturing, but it faces a number of challenges, including land acquisition for factories, and water \u2013 chip production needs the highest quality water and a lot of it.",
      "Bargaining chips",
      "Chip companies are not completely at the mercy of tariffs. The sheer reliance and demand for chips from major US companies like Microsoft, Apple and Cisco could apply pressure on Trump to reverse any levies on the chip sector.",
      "Some insiders believe intense lobbying by Apple CEO Tim Cook secured the exemptions to smartphone, laptop and electronic tariffs, and Trump reportedly lifted a ban on the chips Nvidia can sell to China as a result of lobbying.",
      "Asked specifically about Apple products on Monday in the Oval Office, Trump said, \"I'm a very flexible person,\" adding that \"there will be maybe things coming up, I speak to Tim Cook, I helped Tim Cook recently.\"",
      "Mr Einstein thinks it all comes down to Trump ultimately trying to make a deal - he and his administration know they can't just build a bigger building when it comes to chips.",
      "\"I think what the Trump administration is trying to do is what it has done with TikTok's owner Bytedance. He is saying I'm not going to let you operate in the US anymore unless you give Oracle or another US company a stake,\" says Mr Einstein.",
      "\"I think they're trying to fandangle something similar here \u2013 TSMC isn't going anywhere, let's just force them to do a deal with Intel and take a slice of the pie.\"",
      "But the blueprint of the Asia semiconductor ecosystem has a valuable lesson: no one country can operate a chip industry on its own, and if you want to make advanced semiconductors, efficiently and at scale \u2013 it will take time.",
      "Trump is trying to create a chip industry through protectionism and isolation, when what allowed the chip industry to emerge throughout Asia is the opposite: collaboration in a globalised economy.",

      "When it came to providing my job title, my first attempt was declined because I included BBC News and was told this violated content policy - I think because currently the BBC does not allow ChatGPT to use its output.",
      "Once you do get an image you're likely to want to tweak it further; my first attempt was too cartoon-like.",
      "The following, more realistic version made me look considerably older than I am, then too child-like, and I gave up in the end trying to get it to use my actual eye-colour, which kept defaulting back to blue (mine are a blend of hazel and green).",
      "It took a couple of minutes to generate each version and overall the process was slower than I would have liked, potentially because of its popularity.",
      "It did start to feel like a lot of work for a passing trend, and it isn't perfect - my doll  is expanding out far beneath the supposed packaging.",

      "Ukraine's President Volodymyr Zelensky has accused US special envoy Steve Witkoff of \"disseminating Russian narratives\" after he appeared to suggest that a peace deal between Russia and Ukraine hinged on the status of five Ukrainian regions.",
      "After holding a five-hour meeting with Russian President Vladimir Putin on Friday, Witkoff told Fox News that a deal to end the war was \"about these so-called five territories\".",
      "\"I think that Mr Witkoff has taken the strategy of the Russian side,\" Zelensky told a Kyiv press conference on Thursday.",
      "\"I think it's really dangerous, because consciously or unconsciously he is disseminating Russian narratives\".",
      "Witkoff appeared to be referring to the Donetsk, Luhansk, Zaporizhzhia and Kherson regions in eastern Ukraine, much of which are under Russian military occupation after Vladimir Putin launched a full-scale invasion in 2022 with the aim of taking control of the whole country.",
      "The fifth region is believed to be Crimea, which Russia annexed in 2014 in a move not recognised internationally.",

      "Meanwhile Donald Trump renewed his own criticisms of Zelensky on Thursday. He appeared to row back on earlier comments accusing the Ukrainian leader of starting the war but said he was \"not a big fan\".",
      "\"I don't hold Zelensky responsible but I'm not exactly thrilled with the fact that that war started,\" Trump said.",

      "Tignes Mayor Serge Revial said there was a high risk of avalanches and \"we had to make a decision to protect people\", after more than a metre of snow was dumped over the town.",
      "Although snow is not uncommon in the Alps in April, the disruption left thousands of homes in the Savoie region of eastern France without power.",
      "In neighbouring Switzerland, the Simplon Pass into Italy and the Great St Bernard Tunnel were closed to traffic, while two cantons were badly affected.",
      "In Valais and Bernese Oberland, tourists heading for ski holidays were hit by the disruption.",
      "Road and rail routes were cut off into the resort of Zermatt in the southern canton of Valais; power was cut throughout Thursday and mobile phone networks were badly disrupted.",
      "Queues built up outside the only supermarket open in the town, according to Swiss media.",

      "\"Two rivers, the Po and the Dora, near Turin have burst their banks. The city is fine but they had to shut several bars and restaurants by the river in Turin.\"",

      "The White House has demanded the oldest university in the US make changes to hiring, admissions and teaching practices - to help fight antisemitism on campus.",
      "Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem has asked for records on what she called the \"illegal and violent\" activities of its foreign student visa-holders.",
      "Harvard earlier said it had taken many steps to address antisemitism, and that demands were an effort to regulate the university's \"intellectual conditions\".",
      "\"The university will not surrender its independence or relinquish its constitutional rights,\" Harvard President Alan Garber wrote in a message on Monday to the Harvard community.",
      "The new request from Noem said the institution would lose the \"privilege of enrolling foreign students\" if it did not comply with the demand for records.",
      "Harvard said it was aware of the new request from Noem, which was made in a letter, the Reuters news agency reported.",
      "International students make up more than 27% of Harvard's enrolment this year. Even before Noem's statement, billions of dollars hung in the balance for the university, after the freeze of some $2.2 bn (\u00a31.7bn) in federal funding.",
      "Trump has also threatened to also remove Harvard's valuable tax exemption, the loss of which could cost Harvard millions of dollars each year. US media reports suggest the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) has started drawing up plans to enact this.",
      "Harvard has said there is \"no legal basis\" to remove its tax exemption, and that \"such an unprecedented action would endanger our ability to carry out our educational mission\".",

      "The administration's attacks on Harvard are not isolated. The government's antisemitism task force has identified at least 60 universities for review.",
      "During his presidential campaign, Trump pitched a funding crackdown on universities, painting them as hostile to conservatives. He and Vice-President JD Vance have long railed against higher education institutions.",
      "Polling by Gallup last year suggested that confidence in higher education had been falling over time among Americans of all political backgrounds, particularly Republicans - in part due to a belief that universities push a political agenda.",
      "Since taking office, Trump has focused particularly on universities where pro-Palestinian protests have taken place. Some Jewish students have said they felt unsafe and faced harassment on campus.",
      "In March, Columbia University agreed to several of the administration's demands, after $400m in federal funding was pulled over accusations the university failed to fight antisemitism.",
      "These included replacing the official leading its Middle Eastern, South Asian and African Studies department and pledging to take on a review to \"ensure unbiased admission processes\".",
      "Harvard too has made concessions - including by dismissing the leaders of its Center for Middle Eastern Studies, who had come under fire for failing to represent Israeli perspectives.",

      "Unions say around 80,000 hotel workers on Tenerife, La Palma, La Gomera and El Hierro will still take action.",
      "The UK Foreign Office warned travellers to expect disruption over the Easter weekend and to check their tour operator's advice and follow the advice of authorities.",

      "They stress they are not against the tourism industry, which makes up 35% of the Canaries' economy, but there was a need for a more sustainable model that factored in environmental impacts such as water shortages and which puts less pressure on costs and housing."

    "summary": "The US says a new Zambian law is more intrusive than equivalents in many other countries.",
    "story": [
      "The US embassy in Zambia has warned its citizens to be wary of a new \"intrusive\" cyber-security law introduced in the southern African country.",
      "The embassy issued an alert telling Americans \"in or planning to visit Zambia of a new law that requires the interception and surveillance of all electronic communications in the country\".",
      "This includes calls, emails, texts and streamed content \"in-country to assess if they include any transmission of 'critical information,' a term the law defines so broadly that it could apply to almost any activity\", the embassy says.",
      "Zambia's government said the law was needed to tackle online fraud and child pornography, as well as the spread of disinformation.",
      "Following the alert from the US embassy, Zambia's foreign ministry released a statement saying that the new Cyber Security Act was \"not intended to invade any person's privacy\" - whether Zambians or foreigners.",
      "\"The Law does not authorize mass or random surveillance. Any interception or data request requires a court-issued warrant,\" it said.",
      "The statement added that the \"classification of 'critical information'\" referred to national security, \"and any assessments or actions taken are carried out by authorized institutions, in line with due process\".",
      "There are fears that the law could be use against anyone who criticises the government, especially with elections due next year.",
      "Some Zambians have expressed concern that a new cyber-security unit is being set up in the president's office.",
      "Joan Chirwa, founder of the Free Press Initiative Zambia campaign group, told the BBC \"it was a sad day for Zambia\".",
      "She said the law wouldn't \"just affect journalists, or civil society organisations. It will affect everyone in Zambia\".",
      "The new measure empowers a law enforcement officer with a warrant to enter any premises to search and seize a computer or computer system containing material that is either evidence necessary to prove an offence or acquired by a person as a result of an offence.",
      "It also allows the government to extradite Zambians deemed to have committed any offence under the law, with a range of jail terms prescribed.",
      "Offenders may be fined or jailed for between five and 15 years, depending on the crime they have committed.",
      "Among other provisions, the legislation requires Information and Communication Technology (ICT) companies to proactively intercept all electronic communications.",
      "It was signed into law by President Hakainde Hichilema on 8 April with very little publicity and the first many Zambians knew about it was when the US embassy posted its alert on Facebook.",
      "\"As this new law introduces an intrusive surveillance ecosystem significantly different from privacy protection provisions that prevail in many countries, the embassy of the United States encourages Americans living in Zambia or considering visiting the country to carefully assess the implications of this law and adjust accordingly,\" the US statement said.",
      "The alert came as a surprise to many as the US has widely been seen to enjoy a warm relationship with the Hichilema-led administration, although the ambassador has recently been critical of alleged corruption in the government.",
      "Zambia had enjoyed a frosty relationship with the US after the former government expelled its pro-gay rights ambassador Daniel Foote in 2019 but relations had improved since Hichilema was elected in 2021.",
      "Social commentator and civil rights activist Laura Miti accused the US embassy of \"hypocrisy\", while also labelling the new law \"tyrannical\".",
      "\"Until Edward Snowden revealed the matter, the US secretly surveilled its citizens for years. He remains in exile and one of the most wanted people by American law enforcement,\" she wrote on Facebook. \"That raises an eyebrow about this from the American embassy. Hypocritical really.\"",
      "However, she also condemned the new law.",
      "\"This... is a very tyrannical law which the government only needs because it feels insecure.\"",
      "In 2021, while still in opposition, Hichilema opposed a similar law when the former government wanted to pass it, writing: \"The Cyber Security and Crime Bill is not about preventing cyber-bullying. It is about clamping down on freedom of expression and spying on citizens.\"",
      "Opposition lawmaker Miles Sampa has accused Hichilema of performing a U-turn now that he is president.",
      "\"My question is when did you change this stance to now sign a law that almost 100% prohibits us citizens from expressing ourselves on Facebook, X, Instagram, TikTok, etc., without being jailed for 25 years or life imprisonment,\" he wrote on Facebook.",
      "\"In the current state of the Cyber Laws that you have assented to, Mr President, you may as well also sign a martial law (State of Emergency) to discard democracy so we all stop talking and leave it to your good self to express alone.\"",

    "story": [
      "The scheduled dates and location of Fyre Festival 2 have been thrown into doubt, according to US media reports.",
      "The reboot of the 2017 Fyre Festival - which made international headlines, sparked a hit Netflix documentary and resulted in organiser Billy McFarland going to jail for fraud - was due to take place in Mexico from 30 May to 2 June.",
      "McFarland's second attempt to stage the event was announced not long after he was released from prison, with ticket prices ranging from $1,400 (\u00a31,058) to $1.1m (\u00a3831,534).",
      "But now the organisers are reportedly looking for a new location for the festival, with the scheduled dates uncertain.",
      "A message to ticket holders on Wednesday said the event had been postponed and a new date would be announced, ABC News reported. The festival's website also briefly said the event was postponed, according to NBC News.",
      "The organisers said in a further update reported by NBC and the New York Times that Fyre 2 was \"still on\".",
      "\"We are vetting new locations and will announce our host destination soon. Our priorities remain unchanged: delivering an unforgettable, safe, and transparent experience,\" the update said.",
      "McFarland told NBC the date is dependent on location.",
      "BBC News has reached out to Fyre Festival 2 organisers for comment.",
      "The uncertainty follows two local governments in Mexico saying they had no planning records for the festival that organisers had said would take place in their areas.",
      "In February, organisers announced the festival's location as Isla Mujeres, an island off Canc\u00fan.",
      "However, the local city council posted on Facebook that \"no person or company has requested permits from this office or any other Municipal Government department for said event\".",
      "The event was re-announced with a new location in Playa del Carmen. Local officials there said on X that \"no event with this name has reached our city\".",
      "\"Following a responsible review of the situation, it confirms that there is no registration, planning or conditions indicating the realisation of the event in the municipality,\" a translation of the statement read.",
      "McFarland and Fyre Festival 2 posted documents on Instagram that they said showed approval for the event. One document indicated permission for 250 people at a venue. McFarland had said 1,800 tickets were for sale.",
      "To many, the latest developments will come as little surprise.",
      "The original Fyre was promoted by supermodels and celebrities as an exclusive getaway for the ultra-rich, and the location was hyped as a private island once owned by drug lord Pablo Escobar.",
      "But festival-goers arrived in the Bahamas to find all the talent cancelled, bare mattresses to sleep on in storm-ravaged tents and cheese sandwiches in takeaway containers to eat.",
      "McFarland was sentenced in 2018 to six years in jail for wire fraud, and was also ordered to return $29m to investors.",
      "He was freed in 2022 under an early release programme but remains on probation until August.",
      "Last year, McFarland announced the reboot, saying \"Fyre 2 has to work\".",
      "He claimed he had spent a year planning it, and had already sold 100 tickets at an \"early bird\" rate of $499. It is unclear how many tickets have been sold to date.",
      "No line-up for the festival has been announced.",
      "Last year, Andy King, an investor in the first Fyre Festival, issued a warning to anyone interested in going to its planned reboot: \"Proceed with caution.\"",
      "Mr King, who lost $1m in the original debacle, told the BBC that McFarland was \"known for the biggest failure in pop culture and wants to flip the script. But I'm not sure he's going about it the right way.\"",

      "Her defamation claim against the firm seemed to have run out of road when a judge confirmed an arbitration decision dismissing her case - but a panel of appeal judges in California has reversed this decision in her favour.",
      "She told BBC News she now wants to face Elon Musk and Tesla in open court.",
      "Tesla has not responded to a request for comment.",
      "Ms Balan said she believes the case will now in effect go back to square one, and new proceedings can be launched.",
      "\"We are hoping we will start a new lawsuit and we will have the chance to take on Elon Musk in front of a jury and judge,\" she said.",
      "The engineer was once so prominent at Tesla that her initials were engraved on the batteries inside Model S vehicles.",

      "Ms Balan claimed she was worried the carpets were curling underneath some pedals in Tesla models, creating a safety hazard.",

      "Tesla brought the case back to a district court in California to have the decision confirmed.",
      "However, Ms Balan appealed this decision, and judges from the US Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit found in her favour - in effect deciding the California court did not have the jurisdiction to make its judgement.",
      "They have ordered for the confirmation of the arbitration award to be cancelled, and for the district court to dismiss the action due to its lack of jurisdiction.",
      "What could happen next?",
      "The majority of legal experts the BBC has spoken to believe the case has some way to go before there will be any conclusion.",
      "\"Tesla is among the many corporations that force employees and customers into opaque arbitration processes and deploy aggressive strategies to retaliate against employees who voice criticism of corporate practices,\" said Stanford professor Anat Admati.",
      "And Bill Moran, Ms Balan's attorney, agreed the legal process is far from over.",
      "But he said the case was \"revived\" by the latest ruling.",
      "\"We are confident we can secure her either a new arbitration or alternatively a trial in court so that her case can be heard on the merits after so many years,\" he said.",

    "story": [
      "The leaders of Canada's four major federal parties have been grilled about their response to US President Donald Trump and clashed over energy and housing in their first televised debate of the country's election campaign.",
      "The French-language face-off marked a key moment in the election as it gave leaders a chance to woo voters in the seat-rich province of Quebec.",
      "It was also a big test for Liberal leader Mark Carney, who has a slight lead in the polls, but whose French is the weakest among the federal leaders. He at times struggled to articulate his points on stage.",
      "There is a second debate in English on Thursday, before Canadians vote on 28 April.",
      "On the stage were the four main party candidates: Liberal leader and current Prime Minister Carney, Conservative leader Pierre Poilievre, Bloc Qu\u00e9b\u00e9cois leader Yves-Fran\u00e7ois Blanchet, and leader of the New Democratic Party (NDP), Jagmeet Singh.",
      "The debate was moderated by Radio-Canada journalist Patrice Roy.",
      "Mr Roy opened the forum saying that Canada's short 36-day federal election had been \"hijacked by Trump\", and asked each leader to outline two campaign promises unrelated to the US or its tariffs.",
      "But soon afterwards, Mr Roy plunged into a question on how each party would handle the trade war with the US, calling it the \"elephant in the room\".",
      "Trump has implemented blanket 25% tariffs on goods from Canada, with an exemption on products covered by the USMCA - a North American free trade deal. Canada is also hit with global US tariffs on steel and aluminium and cars.",
      "The president has also publicly mused about Canada becoming the 51st US state.",
      "Poilievre, of the opposition Conservatives, accused the governing Liberals of weakening the country over the past decade, making Canada more vulnerable to economic threats.",

      "\"[Trump] respects people who understand the world and how the private sector works,\" Carney said.",

      "That forum will be more widely watched nationwide, but the stakes were high on Wednesday for Carney's Liberals, which are leading in Quebec where the majority of French-speaking Canadians live.",
      "His French was the weakest on stage, and he often kept his answers brief and sometimes struggled to get his points across in a debate format with opportunities for rapid exchanges.",
      "He also faced the most frequent attacks as the others leaders tried to tie him to the Liberal record of former Prime Minister Justin Trudeau, who resigned last month.",
      "\"We are still talking about the same party, the same caucus,\" the Bloc's Blanchet said.",
      "He added: \"It's not because you change the leader that you change your philosophy.\"",
      "Carney countered that he had accomplishments despite only being sworn in as PM last month. He had \"just arrived\", he said.",
      "There was a moment of levity when Mr Roy asked the leaders if they were buying fewer US products - like many Canadians are in the face of tariffs - at the grocery store.",
      "Carney had admitted in an interview early this month that he does not do his own groceries when asked if he still buys US strawberries.",
      "Singh and Blanchet both said they bought Canadian berries. Carney said he had given up US wine, while Poilievre said he buys Canadian beef.",
      "Trump was not the only issue on the agenda. The leaders were asked about their plan to address Canada's housing crisis, and how they would balance climate and the economy.",
      "On housing, Poilievre vowed to cut taxes and red tape that he says act as a barrier to home building.",
      "\"We don't need more bureaucracy, we need more front doors,\" the Conservative leader said in a jab directed at Carney.",
      "But the two found common ground on energy, saying the country should ramp up its oil and gas production.",
      "Carney said climate remains a priority for his party, adding that he would focus on producing \"low-risk\", \"low-carbon\" oil.",
      "On immigration, there was also wide agreement that Canada must look at its capacity to integrate newcomers and asylum seekers.",
      "Canada has seen a rapid population boom in recent years and social and housing infrastructure has struggled to catch up.",

    "summary": "The pair hope to take a step towards release - decades after killing their parents in a high-profile US case.",
    "story": [
      "After decades spent in prison by Erik and Lyle Menendez - and months of contentious court fights - a judge will hear arguments on whether the brothers should be resentenced, in a murder case that still divides America.",
      "The pair are serving life in prison for killing their parents, Kitty and Jose Menendez, in 1989, when they were 21 and 18. Their case gained renewed attention after a popular Netflix series last year.",
      "Thursday's resentencing hearing will determine whether the pair should be resentenced to a lesser penalty. If approved, the brothers could become eligible for parole - potentially allowing their freedom.",
      "Prosecutors at the time argued Erik and Lyle meticulously planned the killings so they could access their parents' fortune. The current Los Angeles District Attorney says the brothers have continued to cling to lies about the case.",
      "But the brothers' lawyers have long argued the killings were an act of self-defence and claimed their father abused them for years. They have also pointed to court filings detailing their rehabilitation during their years behind bars.",
      "Here is what to expect from the hearing - and a recap of how we got here.",
      "What did the Menendez brothers do?",
      "The brothers shot and killed their parents with shotguns at their Beverly Hills mansion. There has long been a debate over their motive.",
      "Prosecutors painted them during their trials as spoiled rich kids who wanted to access their parents' $14m (\u00a310.7m) fortune. They argued that the duo methodically bought shotguns and opened fire on their parents 13 times as the couple watched TV - before going gambling, to parties and on shopping sprees.",
      "The brothers ultimately admitted to the killings - but argued they acted out of self-defence after years of emotional, physical and sexual abuse by their father Jose, a high-powered record label executive.",
      "The brothers' trial in 1993 was one of the first high-profile murder cases to be shown live on television, gripping audiences in the US and globally.",
      "It ended deadlocked, but in 1996, the brothers were convicted of first-degree murder in a second trial during which the judge barred many of their claims of sexual abuse. They are imprisoned near San Diego.",
      "What will happen during the resentencing hearing?",
      "A judge will look at evidence, hear from witnesses, and ultimately determine whether Erik and Lyle should be resentenced.",
      "It will not be a re-trial, and guilt will not be a question. Much of the focus could instead be on what the brothers have done during their 30 years in prison.",
      "The hearing - which will not be televised - will start Thursday in Los Angeles and is scheduled to also go into Friday, though it could wrap up in a single day.",
      "Who are the Menendez family?",
      "Who are the Menendez family?",
      "Both sides - lawyers for the Menendez brothers and the district attorney's office - will present arguments on why the brothers should or should not be resentenced.",
      "They will also be able to call people to testify. This could include a wide variety of individuals, from people involved in prosecuting the brothers in the 1990s or prison officials talking about the brothers' last 30 years behind bars.",
      "We are likely to hear from members of the Menendez family, many of whom have become outspoken advocates for Erik and Lyle's release. But at least one member of the family has been a fierce critic of the effort to free them.",
      "Milton Anderson, who is Kitty Menendez's brother, has called the brothers \"cold-blooded\" and has argued the pair should remain behind bars for the \"heinous act\".",
      "Will Erik and Lyle Menendez testify?",
      "That is unclear. If they did, it would mark a significant moment in the case, and would leave them open to questions from prosecutors who oppose their release.",
      "The pair have previously appeared remotely at hearings by video link. The BBC has asked whether they will appear in person, and if they will testify.",
      "On a recent episode of his podcast, lawyer Mark Geragos said he had not decided whether to call them to the stand.",
      "\"I know right now that I'm going to put family members on the stand,\" Mr Geragos said. \"I know right now, I'll put correctional officers on the stand. I know right now I may put behavioural scientists on the stand.\"",
      "The district attorney's office has similarly not said who it plans to call to testify.",
      "When will a judge rule, and what will it mean?",
      "After the two-day hearing, Los Angeles County Judge Michael Jesic will rule on whether the brothers should be resentenced.",
      "But it is not clear if that will come at the conclusion of the hearing, or later.",
      "Could the Menendez brothers go free after the hearing?",
      "Even if Judge Jesic rules in favour of the brothers being resentenced, they will not be immediately released.",
      "What happens next will depend on what type of sentence the judge offers the brothers. There is a chance they could be given a new, lesser sentence that would make them immediately eligible for parole.",
      "But eligibility does not guarantee release; they would still need to convince a state parole board they are no longer a danger to society.",
      "Or the judge could opt for a modified sentence that reduces their punishment but does not immediately open the door to parole. In that case, the brothers could face several more years behind bars before becoming eligible.",
      "Why is this happening now?",
      "The Menendez brothers filed a motion in 2023 detailing new evidence alleging childhood sexual abuse by their father, and requesting their convictions be vacated.",
      "The evidence included an allegation of rape from a former member of boy band Menudo, Roy Rossell\u00f3, and a letter Erik Menendez wrote to a cousin eight months before the murders, which detailed the alleged abuse.",
      "The top LA prosecutor at the time, George Gasc\u00f3n, announced that he was supporting the resentencing bid, days before an election in November 2024. He denied the announcement was political and argued it was a long time coming.",
      "Gasc\u00f3n's announcement came shortly after a popular Netflix documentary and TV drama welcomed a new generation to the case. Many of the brothers' supporters suggest that if they were put on trial today, their allegations of abuse would be taken more seriously \u2013 potentially leading to a very different outcome.",

      "Citizens from Kosovo, Bangladesh, Colombia, Egypt, India, Morocco and Tunisia would all have their claims fast-tracked within three months on the assumption that they were likely to fail.",
      "Markus Lammert of the European Commission said it would be a \"dynamic list\" that could be expanded or reviewed, with countries suspended or removed if they were no longer seen as safe.",
      "Ever since EU countries saw an influx of irregular migrants in 2015-16, they have sought to reform asylum rules.",
      "A pact on migration and asylum was agreed last year, but the EU says as it does not come into force until June 2026 it wants to push through two key rules on speeding up processing.",
      "EU leaders called on the Commission last year to come up with plans to accelerate migrant returns, as EU figures suggested under 20% of people ordered to leave were sent back to their countries of origin.",
      "Under the plans, EU countries would be able to fast track people coming either from safe countries or countries from which a maximum of one in five applicants are given protection.",
      "European countries that are candidates to join the EU will automatically be considered safe, although exceptions are possible, for example for countries at war such as Ukraine.",
      "Among the countries pushing for reform was Italy, which has seen a big influx since 2015. Other countries including Germany have imposed border controls in a bid to limit irregular migration.",
      "Although Italy is among several member states that already have designated safe countries, it is thought an agreed EU list would deter asylum seekers from targeting those with looser regulations.",
      "Morocco, Tunisia and Egypt have all seen large numbers of irregular migrants leave their shores to cross the Mediterranean in recent years.",

      "The new proposals will now need to be approved by both the European Parliament and EU member states, and some human rights groups have expressed concern about the plans.",
      "EuroMed Rights - a network of human rights organisations - warned that it was misleading and dangerous to label the seven countries as safe, because they included \"countries with documented rights abuses and limited protections for both their own citizens and migrants\".",

      "A court in the capital, Lima, said he had accepted illegal funds from the Venezuelan president at the time, Hugo Ch\u00e1vez, and from the Brazilian construction company Odebrecht to bankroll his election campaigns in 2006 and 2011.",
      "Humala's lawyer said he would appeal against the conviction.",

      "In 2011, Humala ran on a more moderate platform emulating the policies of Brazil's then-president Luiz In\u00e1cio Lula da Silva to defeat right-wing rival Keiko Fujimori, the eldest daughter of Alberto Fujimori.",
      "Violent social conflicts quickly dented his popularity, and he lost the support of many members of Congress.",
      "His legal troubles started shortly after his term finished in 2016, when Odebrecht admitted to bribing Latin American government officials and political parties with hundreds of millions of dollars to win business.",
      "Prosecutors accused Humala and his wife of receiving millions from Odebrecht, as well as the illegal funding from Ch\u00e1vez to finance the 2006 presidential campaign.",

      "That means police haven't ruled out the extremist left, or a foreign power such as Russia or Algeria.",
      "But the conviction is growing that the attacks - 12 since Sunday night - can only have been the work of drugs gangs, hitting back at the government's latest crackdown.",
      "That is certainly the belief of the government itself.",
      "Speaking on Thursday morning, Interior Minister Bruno Retailleau said he was \"certain that what we're dealing with is the drugs-yobs [in French, narco-racaille]\".",
      "\"It's not they who have declared war on us. It's we who declared war on them with our new law on drugs trafficking. They know we're going to be hitting their wallets.\"",
      "In what was obviously a co-ordinated plan over three nights, gangs set fire to cars outside prisons and a prison officer training centre. In two locations, guns were used.",

      "The group was previously unheard of, but on Tuesday it posted a video on the messaging platform Telegram showing the burning of a prison officer's car.",
      "In French that is full of mistakes, the video's text accuses Justice Minister G\u00e9rard Darmanin of declaring \"war\" on prisoners.",
      "\"All we want is that human rights be respected,\" the text reads. \"If in 2025 we can watch TV, smoke and eat our meals without being bothered in our cells, it's only because our elders fought for these fundamental rights.\"",
      "Presenting themselves as defenders of human rights may not be the usual methodology of drugs gangs.",
      "But nor does the DDPF come across as a classic far-left or anarchist organisation, which might more naturally be fighting for the cause.",
      "For one thing, such groups tend to have intellectual underpinning which means they write grammatical and properly spelled French. Nor have far-left groups till now made prisoners' rights a particular issue.",
      "Investigators have said that perpetrators of the attacks caught on video were dressed more like drugs-gang foot soldiers rather than far-left militants, who tend to come from a different social background.",
      "And in one location they wrote the wrong set of initials \u2013 DDFM \u2013 suggesting that their attachment to the supposed organisation was not exactly deep.",
      "The theory of foreign manipulation is taken seriously \u2013 especially after proven cases of Russian interference such as the spraying of Stars of David in Paris after the October 7 attacks.",
      "Relations with Algeria are also at an all-time low at the moment.",
      "But if the drugs gang theory is the favoured one, it is because means and motivation are both so easy to grasp.",
      "The French government currently includes an unusual tandem: an interior and a justice minister who are not rivals; who are both on the political right; and who have pledged to fight head-on the scourge that they say is the drugs trade.",
      "To this end Darmanin and Retailleau are currently steering a bill through parliament that they say will seriously hamper the drugs lords' ability to operate.",
      "A dedicated branch of the prosecutors' office will be created. There will be extra powers for investigators, and a special, protected status for informers.",
      "Even more of a threat to the drugs barons \u2013 so the government says \u2013 will be two newly converted prisons, where the 100 most powerful of them will be interned from later this year.",
      "In these top-security jails, there will be much stricter rules governing visits and communication with the outside world. New measures will be in place to stop the infiltration of mobile telephones (of which tens of thousands are known to circulate in French jails).",
      "The purpose is to prevent gang leaders from continuing their operations from behind bars \u2013 a security breach which has become widespread.",
      "The case of Mohamed Amra, the drugs-lord whose escape last year led to the murder of two prison-officers near Rouen, is typical.",
      "Prison staff who went on strike in protest told the BBC how laxity inside jails was undermining morale and presenting a growing security risk.",
      "Amra was recaptured in Romania last month.",
      "The French government sees in the prison attacks a sign that for once the drugs gangs feel intimidated \u2013 and that's why they're hitting back.",
      "Of course it suits the French government to say that, because it's evidence they can present to the voters that they are indeed getting tough.",

    "story": [
      "Listen to this article on BBC Sounds",
      "There are some scientific discoveries that do much more than advance our knowledge: they create a shift in our psyche as they show us the scale of the Universe and our place in it.",
      "One such moment was when space craft sent back images of the Earth for the first time. Another is the discovery of life on another world, a moment that has inched a little closer today with the news that signs of a gas, which on Earth is produced by simple marine organisms, has been found on a planet called K2-18b.",
      "Now, the prospect of really finding alien life - meaning we are not alone in the Universe - is not far away, according to the scientist leading the team that made the detection.",
      "\"This is basically as big as it gets in terms of fundamental questions, and we may be on the verge of answering that question,\" says Prof Nikku Madhusudhan of the Institute of Astronomy at Cambridge University.",
      "But all of this prompts even more questions, including, if they do find life on another world, how will this change us as a species?",
      "Flying saucers and sci-fi aliens",
      "Our ancestors have long created stories of beings that might dwell in the skies. In the early 20th Century, astronomers thought they could see straight line features on the Martian surface, raising speculation that one of our nearest planets might be home to an advanced civilisation: an idea that spawned a wealth of pulp science fiction culture involving flying saucers and little green aliens.",
      "It was during an era when western governments generated fear of the spread of communism, so visitors from outer space were more often than not portrayed as menaces, bringing peril rather than hope.",
      "But decades on, what has been described as \"the strongest evidence yet\" of life on another world has come, not from Mars or Venus, but from a planet hundreds of trillions of miles away orbiting a distant star.",
      "Part of the challenge when it comes to researching the existence of alien life  is knowing where to look.",
      "Until relatively recently, the focus for Nasa's search for life was Mars, but that began to change in 1992 with the discovery of the first planet orbiting another star outside of our solar system.",
      "Although astronomers had suspected that there were other worlds around distant stars there had been no proof until that point. Since then, nearly 6,000 planets outside our solar system have been discovered.",
      "Scientists find 'strongest evidence yet' of life on distant planet",
      "Many are so-called gas giants, like Jupiter and Saturn in our solar system. Others are either too hot or too cold to support liquid water, thought to be essential for life.",
      "But many are in what astronomers call \"The Goldilocks Zone\" where the distance is \"just right\" to support life. Prof Madhusudhan believes there could be thousands in our galaxy.",
      "Breathtakingly ambitious tech",
      "As these so-called exoplanets were being discovered, scientists began to develop instruments to analyse the chemical composition of their atmospheres. Their ambition was breathtaking, some would say audacious.",
      "The idea was to capture the tiny amount of starlight glancing through the atmospheres of these faraway worlds and study them for chemical fingerprints of molecules, which on Earth can only be produced by living organisms, so-called biosignatures.",
      "And they succeeded in developing such instruments for ground and space-based telescopes.",
      "Nasa's James Webb Space Telescope (JWST), which detected the gas on the planet called K2-18b in this week's discovery, is the most powerful space telescope ever built and its launch in 2021 generated excitement that the search for life was at long last within humanity's grasp.",
      "But JWST has its limits - it can't detect faraway planets as small as ours or as close to their parent stars, because of the glare. So, Nasa is planning the Habitable Worlds Observatory (HWO), scheduled for the 2030s, which will be able to spot and sample the atmospheres of planets similar to our own. (This is possible using what is effectively a high-tech sunshield that minimises light from the star which a planet orbits.)",
      "Also coming online later this decade is the European Southern Observatory (ESO)'s Extremely Large Telescope (ELT), which will be on the ground, looking up at the crystal-clear skies of the Chilean desert.",
      "It has the largest mirror of any instrument built, 39-metres in diameter, and so can see vastly more detail at planetary atmospheres than its predecessors.",
      "More discoveries, more questions",
      "Prof Madhusudan, however, hopes to have enough data within two years to demonstrate categorically that he really has discovered the biosignatures around K2-18b. But even if he does achieve his aim, this won't lead to mass celebrations about the discovery of life on another world.",
      "Instead, it will be the start of another robust scientific debate about whether the biosignature could be produced by non-living means.",
      "Eventually though, as more data is gathered from more atmospheres and as chemists fail in finding alternative explanations for biosignatures, the scientific consensus will slowly and gradually shift towards the probability that life does exist on other worlds, according to Prof Catherine Heymans, from Edinburgh University, who is Scotland's Astronomer Royal.",
      "\"With more time on telescopes, astronomers will get a clearer vision of the chemical compositions of these atmospheres. You won't know that it's definitely life. But I think the more data that's built up, and that if you see this in multiple different systems, not just this one particular planet, it gives us more confidence\".",
      "The world wide web emerged in a series of incremental technological breakthroughs that didn't necessarily feel of enormous consequence at the time.",
      "In similar fashion, it may dawn on people that possibly the most enormous scientific, cultural and social transformation in the whole of human history has happened, but that the moment the balance was tipped in terms of there being other life out there was not fully recognised at the time.",
      "A much more definitive discovery would be to discover life in our own solar system using robotic space craft containing portable laboratories. Any off-world bug could be analysed, possibly even brought back to Earth, providing prima facie evidence to at least significantly limit any scientific push back that may ensue.",
      "The scientific case for the possibility of life or past life in our own solar system has increased in recent years following data sent back by various spacecraft, so several missions to search for signs of it are on their way.",
      "The European Space Agency's (ESA) ExoMars rover, planned for launch in 2028, will drill below the surface of Mars to search for signs of past and possibly present life. Given the extreme conditions on Mars, however, the discovery of fossilised past life is the more likely outcome.",
      "China's Tianwen-3 mission, also planned for launch in 2028 is designed to collect samples and bring them back to Earth by 2031. Nasa and ESA each have spacecraft on their way to the icy moons of Jupiter to see if there may be water, possibly vast oceans, under their icy surfaces.",
      "But the spacecraft are not designed to find life itself.  Instead, these missions lay the ground for future missions which will, according to Prof Michele Dougherty of Imperial College, London.",
      "\"It is a long, slow process,\" she says. \"The next decision to make would be a lander, which moon it goes to, and where we should be landing.",
      "\"You don't want to land where the ice crust is so thick that there is no way you can get underneath the surface. And so, it's a long, slow burn, but it's pretty exciting en route\".",
      "Nasa is also sending a spacecraft called Dragonfly to land on one of the moons of Saturn, Titan in 2034. It is an exotic world with what are thought to be lakes and clouds made from carbon-rich chemicals which give the planet an eerie orange haze, bringing The Beatles\u2018 song, Lucy in the Sky with Diamonds to mind: a world with \"marmalade skies\".",
      "Along with water these chemicals are thought to be a necessary ingredient for life.",
      "Prof Dougherty is one of the leading planetary scientists in her field. Does she think there is life on one of the icy Moons of Jupiter or Saturn?",
      "\"I'd be very surprised if there wasn't,\" she says, beaming with delight.",
      "\"Three things are required: a heat source, liquid water and organic (carbon-based) chemicals. If we have those three ingredients, the chances that life is able to form rises really steeply.",
      "Reducing human 'specialness'",
      "If simple life forms are found to exist that is no guarantee that more complex life forms are out there.",
      "Prof Madhusudhan believes that, if confirmed, simple life should be \"pretty common\" in the galaxy. \"But going from that simple life to complex life is a big step, and that is an open question. How that step happens? What are the conditions that govern that? We don't know that. And then going from there to intelligent life is another big step.\"",
      "Dr Robert Massey, who is the deputy executive director of the Royal Astronomical Society, agrees that the emergence of intelligent life on another world is much less likely than simple life.",
      "\"When we see the emergence of life on Earth, it was so complex. It took such a long time for multi-cellular life to emerge and then evolve into diverse life forms.",
      "\"The big question is whether there was something about the Earth that made that evolution possible. Do we need exactly the same conditions, our size, our oceans and land masses for that to happen on other worlds or will that happen regardless?\"",
      "He believes that the discovery of even simple alien life would be the latest chapter in the diminution of humanity's place in the cosmos.",
      "As he puts it, centuries ago, we believed we were at the centre of the Universe and with each discovery in astronomy we have found ourselves \"more displaced\" from that point. \"I think the discovery of life elsewhere it would further reduce our specialness,\" he says.",

    "link": "https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cly15pp707go",
    "published": "Thu, 17 Apr 2025 00:49:46 GMT",
    "summary": "The journey of two boxes of weapons reveals a chain of lax laws, absent checks and suspected corruption.",
    "story": [
      "The assault rifles and pistols arrived in Haiti stashed in two cardboard boxes, nestled among packages of food and clothes, on a cargo ship stacked with rust-red shipping containers.",
      "They had come from the US, which one expert describes as a \"supermarket\" feeding an arms race among gangs that have brought chaos to the Caribbean island nation.",
      "An investigation by the BBC World Service and BBC Verify traced the two boxes' journey, showing how weapons from the US reach Haiti. It reveals a chain of lax laws, absent checks and suspected corruption used by traffickers to bypass a UN embargo.",
      "The seizure",
      "Haitian police announced in April 2024 that they had seized the two boxes. They contained 12 assault rifles, 14 pistols and 999 ammunition cartridges.",
      "A police photo clearly shows weapons from two different US-based manufacturers.",
      "The shipment had travelled nearly 1,200km (746 miles) from Fort Lauderdale in Florida to Cap-Haitien in northern Haiti, on the Rainer D cargo ship.",
      "The shipping container was filled in a warehouse yard in Fort Lauderdale, according to a UN Panel of Experts, which is tasked with monitoring sanctions on Haiti and investigated the shipment.",
      "Haitians in the US frequently ship much-needed food and other items to the country.",
      "A man named Anestin Predestin told the Miami Herald that in late February 2024, he was leasing out space in the container.",
      "He told the newspaper that a man who gave his name as \"Diamortino\" put in two boxes saying they contained \"clothes\" \u2013 and that he was shocked to learn later they had contained weapons.",
      "The BBC's attempts to contact Mr Predestin were unsuccessful.",
      "It is not clear where the guns had been bought. Guns are not manufactured in Haiti, and previous seizures have included guns bought in Florida.",
      "Sometimes dubbed the \"gunshine state\", Florida was one of about 30 states where, until 2024, private, unlicensed sellers could sell firearms, for example at gun shows and online, without doing background checks. As president, Joe Biden tightened these rules nationally.",
      "The UN panel says two Haitian brothers based in the US had used \"straw buyers\" \u2013 individuals buying on their behalf \u2013 to buy the weapons in the seized shipment.",
      "Experts say this is a common method, often with the guns transported in multiple shipments of small quantities, a process named \"ant trafficking\".",
      "Shipping",
      "The container was shipped by the Florida-based shipping company Alliance International Shipping, Haitian police say.",
      "Alliance International Shipping does not own vessels travelling to Haiti, but buys space on ships and sells it on to clients such as Mr Predestin.",
      "The company's president, Gregory Moraille, said in a statement to the BBC that it provides empty containers to customers, but does not physically interact with the cargo.",
      "\"Unfortunately, we have no viable means of preventing illicit shipments,\" he says, adding the firm co-operates with authorities and has many staff originating from Haiti.",
      "\"Tragically, many of our own families have been victims of gun violence in Haiti,\" he adds.",
      "Leaving the US",
      "The BBC contacted US Customs and Border Protection to ask whether the shipment could have been checked as it left the US, but received no response.",
      "The UN panel said last September that US searches had increased, but \"the vast majority of the 200 containers heading from South Florida to Haiti every week are not inspected\".",
      "A former official with the US Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms, and Explosives (ATF), Bill Kullman, told the BBC that checks on outgoing cargo are \"very scattershot\" and the volume of shipments is \"incredible\".",
      "Arriving in Haiti",
      "Haitian police say they discovered the weapons in a \"targeted search\" of the container.",
      "According to the UN panel, a senior Haitian customs official had put one of the boxes containing weapons in his vehicle and was arrested and sacked a few days later.",
      "Police said they were seeking a man called Wilmane Jean, who is named in the customs data as the consignee for the shipment - the person responsible for receiving it.",
      "The BBC understands from sources in Haiti that he is a customs broker, is on the run and is suspected of being connected with gang activity in the north of the country.",
      "A previous UN report says Haitian customs operations suffer from a lack of capacity, corruption among senior officials, and threats and attacks from gangs.",
      "BBC attempts to contact Haitian customs authorities for comment were unsuccessful.",
      "The power of the gangs",
      "Around the time the weapons were packed into the shipping container, a wave of gang violence swept through the Haitian capital, Port-au-Prince.",
      "Gangs freed thousands of inmates from the main prison, and blockaded the capital's ports and airport.",
      "In March 2024, Prime Minister Ariel Henry, unable to return from an overseas trip, agreed to step down.",
      "A record 5,601 people were killed in gang violence in Haiti in 2024, according to the UN. Its agencies say nearly a tenth of the population \u2013 over a million people - have fled their homes and half the population faces acute hunger. Kidnapping and extortion are rife.",
      "Wilson, a handyman from Port-au-Prince, was shot in the leg while trying to flee as gangs fought over territory in his neighbourhood.",
      "\"It was chaos, everyone was running from their homes,\" he told the BBC. \"My leg stopped working. When I looked down, blood was pouring.\"",
      "He is now living alongside hundreds of other people in a school that is being used as a shelter.",
      "Experts say the authorities do not have the capacity to take back control, despite support from an international security force including at least 800 Kenyan police officers.",
      "The gangs have gained territory in the past six months, and now control at least 85% of the capital, says Romain le Cour, a Haiti expert at the Global Initiative against Transnational Organized Crime, an NGO with headquarters in Geneva.",
      "Gang members frequently pose on social media with high-calibre weapons. Experts told the BBC some of the guns displayed were definitely made in the US, and others are likely to have been manufactured there too.",
      "However, guns and ammunition \"keep on coming\", says Mr Le Cour, which is \"a massive driver for violence and instability\".",
      "Hundreds of shipments",
      "To investigate the potential scale of trafficking from the US using similar shipping routes, the BBC analysed customs data shared with us by the shipping data platform CargoFax.",
      "We compiled a list of individuals currently under sanctions for alleged gang connections in Haiti, and others who have been arrested in Haiti or the US as suspected arms traffickers.",
      "We checked these names against thousands of records of shipments from the US to Haiti over four years.",
      "In total, 26 people on the list were named as consignees for 286 shipments, which took place before the individuals were put under sanctions or arrested. It is not clear whether these shipments contained weapons.",
      "Listed 24 times as a consignee was Prophane Victor - a former member of Haiti's parliament who was later put under UN and US sanctions for arming gangs and trafficking weapons. He was arrested in Haiti in January.",
      "Can the traffickers be stopped?",
      "\"First and foremost, US authorities are not doing enough,\" says Mr Le Cour.",
      "Mr Kullman, the former US official at the ATF, says there is no legal obligation on gun dealers to report suspicious buyers.",
      "Changes to US gun laws are \"really politically difficult to achieve\", he says, but he would like to see a voluntary code of conduct for firearms sellers covering issues such as sales to suspicious buyers and information sharing.",
      "Also, gun registration - similar to car registration \u2013 is in place in a few states and could be \"really helpful\" if adopted more widely, Mr Kullman adds.",
      "Jonathan Lowy, president of Global Action on Gun Violence, says gun makers are told when trafficked guns are under investigation and are aware which dealers are selling guns to traffickers.",
      "\"Manufacturers cutting off these dealers would put an immediate stop to most trafficking routes from the US.\"",
      "The BBC contacted the ATF and the US Department for Homeland Security for comment, but received no responses.",
      "Mr Le Cour says international scrutiny of the problem has increased, but there is no visible impact: \"We know we have the diagnosis, we know what the symptoms are, but we're not doing anything to actually cure it\".",

    "link": "https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cj0zqdqzp73o",
    "published": "Thu, 17 Apr 2025 00:24:58 GMT",
    "summary": "A new initiative aims to boost the local economy by attracting elderly travellers to remote parts of the country.",
    "story": [
      "Beijing insists it will stand firm in the face of Donald Trump's tariffs on Chinese goods. It has been trying to reassure everyone that the country is strong and the economy is resilient enough to weather this latest storm.",
      "But this week, Chinese officials have acknowledged the potential for economic pain as a result of the unfolding trade war with the US.",
      "One option for policymakers here is to try to increase domestic consumption to make up for lost export revenue.",
      "China has a massive population and, if they start buying more stuff, Chinese companies won't have to rely as much on trade overseas.",
      "A key target in this endeavour are retirees with potentially decades of savings.",
      "Now the government wants them to spend some of it - for the good of the country.",
      "And initiatives like the \"silver trains\" - which are tailored specifically to older travellers - aim to do just that.",
      "On board the Star Express, the cocktails are poured and the karaoke microphone is passed around, as retirees party their way through China's south-western Yunnan province.",
      "The roast goose is being devoured with shots of baijiu, a Chinese white spirit alcohol.",
      "\"We have been working hard all these years,\" says 66-year-old Daniel Ling, who is travelling with a group of retired or semi-retired friends.",
      "\"The important thing when we reach this age, is to know what is the right thing to do - and that is to really enjoy life.\"",
      "The initiative hopes to turn an economic problem into an economic solution by giving older people a fun avenue to spend more.",
      "Families are not spending enough because they don't feel financially safe - the property crisis has diminished the value of their number one asset: their home. And growing unemployment has also potentially made their job less secure.",
      "Add to the mix an ageing population and low birthrates and the proportion of retirees grows each year, making it harder for the economy to support them.",
      "But what retirees do have is time on their hands and money to spend.",
      "So now they are to be given more opportunities to splurge with special trains designed to take them to sites they might not normally visit - parts of the country further afield, which need a financial shot in the arm.",
      "\"The main places where the silver trains will stop are undeveloped rural areas or small towns with struggling economies,\" says Dr Huang Huang, a research associate from the China Tourism Academy who has been studying the potential impact of this plan.",
      "\"They will consume various products on the trains, but after they pull into a station, they will also visit tourist attractions and traditional villages.\"",
      "In Baisha, the travellers stop by the modest street stalls at the bottom of old, two-storey, wooden houses built by the local Naxi ethnic minority.",
      "One of them approaches a vendor selling barbecued strips of yak meat. They look tasty and she buys a bagful. The vendor's husband, who is also working at the stall, says this business is only a year old and that they need outside customers to survive.",
      "All along this street you can get potatoes with spicy sauce, lamb skewers, fresh orange juice and the traditional clothing of the Naxi people.",
      "This is a region where incomes are low and most young people leave when they reach a certain age because there are hardly any jobs for them.",
      "It is also not an easy place for many retirees to reach, but these silver trains make it possible, with easy access to boarding and alighting, and with staff to help as well as extra medical support if required.",
      "Shi Lili, 69, whose granddaughter is accompanying her, says the travelling spirit of her youth has been rekindled: \"When I was young I really liked exploring other places by myself. Now I'm older, I have my family who can go with me.\"",
      "By the end of last year, 22% of China's population were over the age of 60, making up more than 310 million people.",
      "So, if only the smallest percentage of China's retirees take \"silver trains\", it can still mean millions of ticket sales. And China's railway authorities say they plan to be operating 100 routes within the next three years.",
      "Such trips alone are not going to fix China's massive challenge with low consumer spending. But economists would say these moves are a step in the right direction.",
      "Older citizens now have a much greater desire to travel compared to previous generations, creating \"huge potential\", according to Dr Huang.",
      "\"Given that China's ageing population is now a reality going into the long run - something which is unlikely to the reversed - we should find more opportunities from this rather than always turning it into a challenge.\"",
      "Back on board the train, the silver adventurers are ready to crash out. And they can do so knowing that their big day out was - at least partly - for the benefit of all.",
      "Then it's onto the next town.",
      "Should China worry about its shrinking population?",
      "China will have 300 million pensioners. Can it afford them?",
      "Why is China spending billions to get people to open their wallets?"

    "story": [
      "When F. Scott Fitzgerald wrote \"The Great Gatsby\" at the height of the roaring '20s, he couldn't possibly realize that the book would emerge as one of the very top contenders for \"the great American novel.\"",
      "In fact, when Fitzgerald \u2013 a St. Paul, Minnesota native whose debut novel \"This Side of Paradise\" launched him into national prominence at the age of 24 \u2013 died in 1940 at the early age of 44, the book was already in danger of falling into obscurity.",
      "Now, 100 years after the book's first publication on April 10, 1925, it endures as one of the country's foremost tales of American hubris, modern yearning and class consciousness. And its clear-eyed assessment of the attainability of the American dream remains incisive with each passing decade.",
      "Fitzgerald's book, long a staple in high school literature classes, tells the story of Nick Carraway, a Midwesterner (and veiled Fitzgerald stand-in) who becomes enamored with the bon vivant, Jazz Age lifestyle on Long Island, specifically the effects of mutli-millioniare Jay Gatsby.",
      "Like Carraway, Gatsby is a Midwesterner who has trekked to the East Coast to make a name for himself. It's Carraway's cousin Daisy Buchanan who serves as the catalyst for Gatsby's downfall, and ultimately Carraway's own disillusionment. All the while, a symbolic green light beckons from the distance.",
      "When the book was first published, reviews were largely positive, though not unanimous. Fitzgerald, who originally wanted to title the book \"Trimalchio in West Egg\" before being persuaded to go with a title he thought far more generic, watched as the book languished on the vine commercially, selling fewer than 25,000 copies in the initial push.",
      "He would only complete one further novel in his lifetime: 1934's \"Tender is the Night,\" a thinly-veiled roman \u00e0 clef of Fitzgerald's own marriage to socialite Zelda Sayre, detailing their mutual descent into alcoholism and mental illness. Fitzgerald's early death from a heart attack was likely fuelled by years and years of alcohol abuse. Ironically, he'd gone sober just ahead of the cardiac event.",
      "If \"The Great Gatsby\" never achieved the level of esteem it now enjoys during the author's own life, it wasn't long after his death that Fitgerald's literary reputation took off.",
      "When the Modern Library asked authors, historians, critics and publishers on the eve of Y2K to rank their picks for the world's best novels of the 20th century, it was \"The Great Gatsby\" that\u00a0stood above all other U.S. contenders near the top of the poll. (The novel landed in second place, bookended by Irish author James Joyce's \"Ulysses\" and \"A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man\" in the top three.)",
      "The novel has since launched multiple film adaptations, has been transposed to the stage, and since going into the public domain in 2021, has been the subject of an endless array of reimaginings, remixes and mashups. It's even cleared space around itself as a modern-day meme, in the form of an animated .GIF depicting Leonardo Dicaprio (playing Gatsby in Baz Luhrmann's 2013 film adaptation) smirking as he offers a champagne toast flanked by ostentatious fireworks.",
      "Host of \"Gatsby\" centennial events planned in New York, Minnesota",
      "A host of \"Gatsby\"-themed events are planned to mark the novel's centennial anniversary. In New York, the Empire State Building announced plans to light up in green in a nod to the novel's symbolic green light at the end of Tom and Daisy's dock.",
      "There was also a rowdy \"Roaring Twenties\" party at the Empire Steak House in New York, which was an opulent opera house in Fitzgerald's era. Billed as the \"nation's most extravagant celebration,\" the event featured live jazz, period dancing, and speeches from officials with the New York Public Library.",
      "In honor of the legendary stage play, Broadway has marked the occasion with a release of new block tickets for the show. Tickets are on sale now and will run through Jan. 4, 2026.",
      "The iconic Victorian-themed New York bar, Oscar Wilde, is also hosting a Gatsby-inspired soir\u00e9e on Saturday. The event information markets the celebration as \"an all-day affair of music, opulence and mischief.\" Events kick off at 2 p.m. and continue into the evening until 11 p.m.",
      "Additionally, multiple restaurants are offering exclusive discounts on cocktails, and even a free drink at some places. Gatsby's Landing, Nothing Really Matters, Angelina Bakery and The Plaza are all listed as participants. All events and discounts are ongoing throughout the month of April.",
      "In Fitzgerald's hometown of St. Paul, the events include a new exhibit of the author's life and times at the Minnesota History Center, as well as various, less-than-sober events leaning into the novel's party-friendly Prohibition-era setting.",
      "If you managed to get through high school without having been assigned to read the book, there are a number of live readings of the book scheduled this month, including at St. Paul's Gale Family Library.",

      "What is ALS?",
      "ALS, also known as Lou Gehrig's disease for the New York Yankees player who was stricken with the condition in the late 1930s, affects nerve cells in the brain and spinal cord. The brain becomes unable to control muscle movement, and people eventually lose their ability to speak, eat, move and breathe, according to the\u00a0ALS Association. About 1 in 300 Americans are affected by ALS, Brian Frederick, senior vice president of communication at the ALS Association, told CBS News in August 2023.",
      "Experts don't know the exact cause of ALS. About 5% to 10% of cases appear to have a genetic link, according to the\u00a0National Institutes of Health. Most cases are sporadic, the NIH said. The average life expectancy with the disease is 2 to 5 years. Most patients die from respiratory failure, the NIH said. The condition has no cure.",
      "\"It can strike anyone at any time and is always fatal,\" Frederick said.",

    "published": "Thu, 17 Apr 2025 11:08:18 -0400",
    "summary": "CDC experts were not made available to discuss the findings showing a rise in autism prevalence.",
    "story": [
      "One out of 31 children \u2014 more than 3% of kids \u2014 have been identified with autism, according to the latest results published Tuesday from a Centers for Disease Control and Prevention study that tracks trends of autism's prevalence across some communities in the U.S.",
      "\"They've again gone up dramatically, just in two years. We have in some states as low as 1 out of 20 boys having autism, 1 out of 31 kids. And when I was, in my generation today, the rate of autism was 1 in 10,000,\" Health and Human Services Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. said Tuesday in Indiana, announcing the new findings. \"And this is just one disease. This whole generation of kids is damaged by chronic disease.\"",
      "Kennedy often cites the CDC's figures from this study as evidence for his claim that the U.S. is now seeing a growing \"epidemic\"\u00a0of autism, which experts and advocacy groups have criticized as stigmatizing and misleading.",
      "\"As the report indicates, more children have access to evaluations for autism and more children are being identified as autistic. This is encouraging because when children are identified early, appropriate supports and services can be tailored to help them, and their families thrive,\" said Dr. Kristin Sohl, of the American Academy of Pediatrics subcommittee on autism, in a statement shared before Kennedy's remarks and the report's release.",
      "Dr. C\u00e9line Gounder, CBS News medical contributor and editor-at-large for public health at KFF Health News, told \"CBS Mornings Plus\"\u00a0that the definition of what autism is has also expanded.",
      "\"It's a spectrum. It's not just one thing. ... So that's part of it,\" she said. \"We also are being much more aggressive about looking for it \u2014 pediatricians, educators.\"",
      "The definitions used in this study are also quite broad, Gounder added.",
      "\"They were looking at both health records, educational records, did a student access special ed supports, that sort of thing,\" she said. \"So part of it is the way in which we're looking for it. But there also does seem to be an underlying increase that has been occurring over time.\"",
      "For years, CDC scientists have said that the data indicating a rise in diagnoses of autism spectrum disorder, or ASD, could be reflecting improved screening and access to autism services in some communities. However, the agency's experts were not made available for a press briefing about the latest findings, marking a change from previous years.",
      "\"Research has not demonstrated that living in certain communities puts children at greater risk for developing ASD,\" the CDC's authors said in their report.",
      "The study's authors said estimated autism prevalence was consistently higher among Asian, Black and Hispanic children compared to White children. Factors like disparities in preterm birth and lead poisoning could be contributing to this gap, the report says.",
      "Data from sites in 16 communities were collected for the new CDC report. The last report found a rate of 1 in 36 children through 2020, based on data from 11 communities.",
      "While the network's data is not nationally representative, figures from other federally-funded surveys and studies have also tracked a rise in autism's prevalence over the past two decades, accelerating in the early 2000s.",
      "\"Autistic children add value to our communities. Advocating for resources and funding to support autistic people across the lifespan is essential for a productive and healthy America,\" Sohl said in the statement.",
      "It comes as federal spending into autism research has also surged, largely going into efforts to study the biology suspected to underlie the condition. While scientists have linked up to 90% of autism to genetic traits, other factors are also suspected to play a role in changing its risk.",
      "Kennedy has said he believes \"an environmental toxin\" is causing autism, pointing to a range of potential culprits from food contaminants to vaccines.",
      "Many studies have debunked the claim that vaccines cause autism. But there is less research for some other factors that studies suggest might be linked to autism, ranging from pesticides to time between pregnancies.",
      "\"While the number of studies investigating the epidemiology of autism is increasing, most potential environmental factors have not been investigated sufficiently to draw firm conclusions,\" the federal government's autism research coordination office said in 2023.",
      "In a statement Tuesday, Kennedy claimed that autism was preventable and said that it was \"unforgivable that we have not yet identified the underlying causes.\"",
      "\"We are assembling teams of world-class scientists to focus research on the origins of the epidemic, and we expect to begin to have answers by September,\" he said. Leading autism organizations have expressed skepticism over that promise and concern that he will revive debunked theories.",
      "Finding an answer to the cause or causes of autism by September is \"not realistic,\" Gounder said.",
      "\"Some of the theories include diabetes during pregnancy that might be affecting the development of the child, air pollution, exposure to micro plastics, antibiotic use and the way that changes the microbiome and the gut,\" she said. \"There's a whole bunch of different theories. And again, because it's so many different diseases actually labeled Autism Spectrum Disorder, it's going to take a while to really tease that out.\"",
      "The CDC also released a statement noting that prevalence varied widely between different sites in the study. That variation \"could reflect differences in availability of services for early detection, evaluation, and diagnostic practices,\" Dr. Karyl Rattay, head of the CDC's Division of Human Development and Disability, said.",
      "CDC delayed report, barred agency experts from media",
      "The CDC's National Center on Birth Defects and Developmental Disabilities was initially planning to release the report in March this year, multiple officials told CBS News. Its publication was pushed back by CDC officials amid a department-wide pause on communications ordered by the Trump administration.",
      "Plans to make the agency's experts available to explain and interpret the results were also scrapped, said multiple CDC officials, who spoke on the condition of anonymity. Ahead of the agency's last release of autism figures in 2023, CDC scientists appeared at press briefings and interviews with media outlets about the report.",
      "That year, news outlets were also provided with embargoed copies of the report ahead of time to give journalists time to prepare their reports and interview experts. This longstanding practice has also now been abandoned agency-wide under the Trump administration, officials said, both for the autism report and many other studies published by the agency.",
      "The CDC and HHS did not respond to requests for the embargoed report, or to make any experts available for an interview.",
      "Most of the communications staff working with the center have also been laid off, officials said, as part of Kennedy's sweeping restructuring of the department this month.",
      "The branch responsible for producing the autism figures is one of the few teams remaining on the job in the CDC's birth defects and disabilities center.",
      "Officials expect it to be cleaved off from the CDC and merged into Kennedy's new Administration for a Healthy America agency.",

      "\"It just suggests that they may not be addictive by the typical mechanism that many drugs are addictive. But even this bit of daylight between the preconceived narrative and our study was apparently too much,\" Hall said in a message.",

      "\"The truth is that it was the largest study of its kind and no previous study had the same level of dietary control, much less admitted them to a hospital to ensure diet adherence,\" Hall said.",
      "An HHS spokesperson denied to CBS News that HHS had edited Hall's answers. In a statement, another spokesperson for HHS said it was \"disappointing that this individual is fabricating false claims.\"",
      "\"NIH scientists have, and will, continue to conduct interviews regarding their research through written responses or other means. We remain committed to promoting gold-standard research and advancing public health priorities. Any attempt to paint this as censorship is a deliberate distortion of the facts,\" the statement said.",
      "In response to the department's statement, Hall asked: \"I wonder how they define censorship?\"",
      "Hall said he had also been blocked from presenting his research on ultra-processed foods at a conference and given an ultimatum to either comply with edits demanded by officials on a manuscript he had worked on with outside scientists or remove himself as a co-author.",
      "\"I was hoping this was an aberration. So, weeks ago I wrote to my agency's leadership expressing my concerns and requested time to discuss these issues, but I never received a response,\" he said in his post.",
      "Before this week, Hall had been considered as one of NIH's leading researchers on ultra-processed foods. He was among experts featured in CBS Reports' investigation on how ultra-processed foods have become so pervasive in the American diet.",
      "\"He led a seminal clinical trial demonstrating that ultra-processed foods led to calorie overconsumption,\" Susan Mayne, former head of the Food and Drug Administration's food safety and nutrition center, said in a message.",
      "Mayne said that more recent work has focused on unpacking Hall's findings about how ultra-processed food leads to overconsumption.",
      "\"This work is critical to understand what it is mechanistically about UPF that may be driving obesity. Few places other than NIH have metabolic wards to even do such research,\" Mayne said.",
      "Hall's early retirement marks the latest high-profile departure from the NIH, which has seen its ranks of top scientists gutted through oustings and layoffs under the Trump administration since February.",

    "published": "Thu, 17 Apr 2025 16:11:57 -0400",
    "summary": "A new study from SmartAsset reveals varied increases in grocery prices depending on where you live.",
    "story": [
      "As ongoing inflation continues to deplete household budgets, perhaps nowhere is the pinch felt more strongly\u00a0than in grocery aisles. However, depending on where you live, the pain can be sharper than in other areas.",
      "That's according to a new study from\u00a0SmartAsset\u00a0which reveals notable fluctuations in grocery price increases from city to city. The financial technology company used data from the Bureau of Labor Statistics to examine how the costs of everyday items like eggs, meat and produce have changed in 12 major metro areas over the last year.",
      "\"While prices of fruits, vegetables and dairy products either increased or decreased depending on the location, eggs, meat and poultry soared almost unanimously, reaching over 9% or higher than just a year before \u2014 tripling the general rate of inflation,\" the study found.",
      "Jaclyn DeJohn, director of economic analysis and author of the SmartAsset study, said the big takeaway is how much location can impact these day-to-day items.",
      "\"We really wanted to do was compare where people's budget is going to get hit the hardest,\" said DeJohn, who noted that the study in not a comprehensive ranking but a snapshot of location-related shifts in the cost of groceries. \"People are noticing these costs, and they're impacting their bottom line.\"",
      "Read on to see how grocery prices\u00a0fluctuated in 12 major U.S. metros.",
      "Which cities are seeing price increases?",
      "Out of the 12 cities included in SmartAsset's analysis, Honolulu, Hawaii, experienced the largest uptick with a 5.3% increase in overall grocery prices since last year. Price hikes in Tampa Bay, Florida, are the second highest at 4.3%, followed by he Twin Cities, Minnesota, at 4.2%.",
      "When it comes to fresh produce, the Twin Cities saw the biggest spike among the 12 metro areas, with the cost of fruits and vegetables rising 6.9% from 2024. In Los Angeles, egg, meat, poultry and fish prices rose the most, at 9.8%, followed by the D.C. metro area at 9.4%.",
      "By contrast, residents of the Dallas-Fort Worth-Arlington experienced only a modest price hike of 2.1% on eggs, meat, poultry and fish.",
      "While the report doesn't specify the factors driving price changes from city to city, a combination of influences could be at play, said SmartAsset's DeJohn. \"A big factor for something like Honolulu is it's isolated from the rest of the U.S.,\" she said. \"So, that's a good illustration of how transportation costs where you're located geographically compared to where your food is sourced can impact the prices big time.\"",
      "While price fluctuations varied from city to city, prices for egg, meats, poultry and fish went up in all metro areas, which DeJohn says were behind overall grocery cost increases across all 12 metro areas. \"As we didn't see such intense price increases across any other category of grocery, it was the egg and meat prices that were really driving the increase in grocery prices across the board in these metros,\" she said.",
      "The rise in egg prices at the metro level tracks with national BLS data. Egg prices have been climbing in large part due to the bird flu outbreak which has\u00a0forced farmers to kill infected flocks to prevent the disease from spreading.",
      "Are any cities seeing lower grocery prices?",
      "Yes. Two metro areas in SmartAsset's study \u2014 Dallas-Fort Worth, Texas, and Boston \u2014 saw a decrease in grocery prices of 0.1% and 0.7%, respectively, from a year ago.",
      "Where are grocery prices headed?",
      "A recent analysis by the Yale Budget Lab estimates that overall food prices will rise by 2.6% in the next three years, as a result of U.S. tariffs as well as reciprocal tariffs from foreign nations in place as of April 15. Fresh produce is estimated to rise 5.4%, according to the think tank, before stabilizing at 3.6% higher.",
      "The USDA's\u00a0food price outlook, based on Consumer Price Index and Producer Price Index data from this year and last, forecasts a slightly larger rise in overall food prices of 3.2%, with grocery store or supermarket food purchases, or food-at-home, increasing 2.7%.",
      "Prices for dairy products and fresh vegetables will remain mostly unchanged, according to the USDA, but unfortunately for consumers, the cost of egg prices is expected to climb. Egg prices, which have\u00a0soared over the past year, are expected to rise 57.6% in 2025, according to the report.",

      "President Trump took aim at Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell on Thursday, writing in a social media post that Powell should be cutting interest rates and adding that his \"termination cannot come fast enough.\"",
      "Mr. Trump's comments on his social media app, Truth Social, come after Powell delivered a speech on Wednesday that warned of the potential consequences of the Trump administration's trade war, while reiterating that the central bank plans to hold interest rates steady for now.",
      "The Fed has put the brakes on interest rate cuts this year due to sticky inflation, which has remained higher than its target growth rate of 2% per year.",
      "In the meantime, Mr. Trump has introduced a series of tariffs on major trading partners that economists say could reignite inflation. Powell highlighted those risks on Wednesday in saying that the Trump administration tariffs could create a \"challenging scenario\" for the U.S. that requires both managing both accelerating inflation and a slowing economy.",
      "Those types of conditions describe \"stagflation,\" a mashup of \"stagnation\" and \"inflation\" that describes periods when economic growth falters while price hikes accelerate.",
      "In his social media post, Mr. Trump on Thursday pointed to the European Central Bank, which cut rates by 0.25 percentage points after the president posted his message.",
      "\"The ECB is expected to cut interest rates for the 7th time, and yet, 'Too Late' Jerome Powell of the Fed, who is always TOO LATE AND WRONG, yesterday issued a report which was another, and typical, complete 'mess!'\" Mr. Trump wrote.",
      "He added, \"Oil prices are down, groceries (even eggs!) are down, and the USA is getting RICH ON TARIFFS. Too Late should have lowered Interest Rates, like the ECB, long ago, but he should certainly lower them now. Powell's termination cannot come fast enough!\"",
      "Can Mr. Trump fire Powell?",
      "A landmark ruling by the Supreme Court in 1935 affirmed Congress' authority to create independent federal agencies whose boardmembers could only be forced out before their terms expired \"for cause.\"",
      "\"The fundamental necessity of maintaining each of the three general departments of government entirely free from the control or coercive influence, direct or indirect, of either of the others has often been stressed, and is hardly open to serious question,\" the court ruled\u00a0in the case, Humphrey's Executor v. United States.",
      "After Mr. Trump was elected in November, Powell said he wouldn't step down if asked by the president, who has previously criticized his performance. Powell has also noted that, under the law, presidents may not fire or demote the Fed chair.",
      "In a meeting Thursday with Italian Prime Minister Giorgia Meloni, Mr. Trump said of Powell, \"Oh, he'll leave. If I ask him to, he'll be out of there.\"",
      "Mr.\u00a0Trump nominated Powell\u00a0to lead the Fed in 2017, and Powell was re-nominated by President Joe Biden in November 2021. Powell's term as Fed chair ends May 15, 2026.",
      "Over the years, Powell has steadfastly defended the central bank's independence. In December, he said that insulating the Fed from political influence is \"for the benefit of all Americans,\" allowing it to make decisions based on economic data rather than at the behest of elected officials.",
      "Whether the White House chooses to respect the Fed's independence remains to be seen. Mr. Trump has long challenged political norms, ranging from refusing to accept the results of the 2020 presidential election to, since his return to power in January, empowering Elon Musk to slash the federal workforce through the billionaire's Department of Government Efficiency.",
      "Jaret Seiberg, an analyst with TD Cowen Research Group, notes that Mr. Trump this week fired two Democrats on the board of another financial regulator, the National Credit Union Administration. In March, the White House also dismissed two Democratic members of the Federal Trade Commission, which historically has operated as an independent, bipartisan commission.",
      "\"The President appears to be moving closer to justifying removal of Democrats on the Federal Reserve Board. By firing the two Democrats from the credit union regulator, the president is establishing the precedent that he has total discretion over financial regulators, which could include the Federal Reserve,\" Seiberg said in a report.",

    "story": [
      "Italian Prime Minister Giorgia Meloni is meeting at the White House on Thursday with President Trump, in what her aides have called a high-stakes \"commercial peace mission.\"",
      "European leaders are hoping Italy's right-wing premier\u00a0can position herself as a bridge between the Trump administration and the European Union, which Mr. Trump and his top aides have bashed as a deadbeat, if not abusive partner on defense and trade.",
      "Mr. Trump told reporters Thursday that \"of course\" there will be a trade deal with the EU, amid the 90-day pause on his \"reciprocal\" tariffs. Asked if the EU is on his priority list of nations for reaching trade deals, Mr. Trump said, \"Everybody's on my priority list.\"",
      "The president said he and Meloni discussed trade and \"many, many things\" in their first meeting of the day. But it's unclear how much progress Mr. Trump and Meloni made in discussing any sort of trade deal.",
      "The hope not only in Rome, but in EU capitals across the 27-nation bloc is likely that Meloni can persuade Mr. Trump not to impose the steep tariff hikes he's threatened, which could devastate European economies. A reporter asked Meloni if she believes the U.S. is a reliable partner.",
      "\"If I wouldn't think it's a reliable partner, I wouldn't be here,\" Meloni responded.",
      "Meloni said she's \"here to find the best way to make us both stronger.\"",
      "\"The goal for me is to make the West great again,\" Meloni said. \"And I think we can do it together.\"",
      "Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent told reporters he believes there have been trade calls with the EU already, and the U.S. is trying to work with the world's 15 largest economies first. The president said \"tariffs are making us rich.\"",
      "Meloni and Trump seem to \"get along great\"",
      "Meloni has positioned herself as the European leader Mr. Trump is most likely to listen to. The two have developed a relationship based on shared political and ideological affinities on issues including immigration and LGBTQ rights.",
      "Meloni was the only European leader to be invited to Mr. Trump's inauguration in January, and he has praised her multiple times, calling her a \"fantastic leader and person,\" and someone he could potentially work with to \"straighten out the world a little bit.\"",
      "After the reopening of the Notre Dame Cathedral in Paris last year, which both leaders attended, Mr. Trump was quoted by the New York Post as saying: \"I was with her a lot\" and \"we get along great.\"",
      "But the Italian leader will have to try to balance that budding special relationship with her mandate to protect the interests not only of her own nation's economy, but the EU's, with which Italy's financial future is inextricably linked.",
      "Europe has hope, and anxiety, over the Trump-Meloni meeting",
      "Meloni and European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen discussed strategies on how to approach her meeting with Mr. Trump during multiple phone calls ahead of the trip, according to a commission spokesperson.",
      "Von der Leyen herself has not yet been granted a meeting with Mr. Trump, despite repeated requests. Meloni's sit-down at the White House will be the first with any European leader since the administration announced its tariffs on virtually every nation with which the U.S. conducts trade at the beginning of April. The EU was hit with a blanket 20% tariff rate on all exports to the U.S. with that announcement, though Mr. Trump put those higher rates on hold for 90 days about a week later, as global stock markets reeled, leaving a 10% universal rate in place.",
      "Meloni has gently chided the sweeping tariffs on the EU as \"wrong,\" but she's been one of the voices urging the continental bloc not to impose retaliatory measures, insisting that a calm response focused on negotiations would bring a more constructive resolution.",
      "The White House claims dozens of counties have come forward seeking to negotiate new trade agreements with the U.S., with Mr. Trump boasting that leaders were calling him and \"kissing my ass,\" begging to strike deals to avoid the reimposition of the higher levies.",
      "\"We know we're going through a difficult period, let's see how it goes in the coming hours. I am feeling no pressure, as you can imagine, for my next two days,\" Meloni said with a note of clear irony at an awards ceremony two days before her White House meeting. \"I am aware of what I represent, and I am aware of what I am defending.\"",
      "Not all European politicians were so sanguine about the potential outcome of the Trump-Meloni meeting, however.\u00a0 Italian opposition politician Carlo Calenda said, \"the most important thing is that Meloni does not allow herself to be used by Trump to split the European front.\"",
      "In other European capitals, there was clear anxiety over the possibility that the White House could use the meeting to try to undermine EU unity.",
      "\"If we start having bilateral discussions, obviously it will break the current dynamic,\" the French government's Minister for Industry and Energy, Marc Ferracci, said last week, adding: \"Europe is only strong if it is united.\"",
      "The French news agency AFP said a government spokeswoman later stressed that any voices capable of encouraging dialogue between Washington and the EU were to be welcomed. That statement echoed the remarks by the EU spokesperson on Monday, who noted the close coordination between Meloni and Von der Leyen ahead of the Italian leader's trip to Washington and said the \"outreach is very welcome.\"",

    "published": "Thu, 17 Apr 2025 14:20:00 -0400",
    "summary": "The ruling involving Google's online ad technology follows a similar case last year in which Google's search engine was declared a monopoly.",
    "story": [
      "Google has been branded an abusive monopolist by a federal judge for the second time in less than a year, this time for illegally exploiting some of its online marketing technology to boost the profits fueling an internet empire currently worth $1.8 trillion.",
      "The ruling issued Thursday by U.S. District Judge Leonie Brinkema in Virginia comes on the heels of a separate decision in August that concluded Google's namesake search engine has been illegally leveraging its dominance to stifle competition and innovation.",
      "After the U.S. Justice Department targeted Google's ubiquitous search engine during President Donald Trump's first administration, the same agency went after the company's lucrative digital advertising network in 2023 during President Joe Biden's ensuing administration in an attempt to undercut the power that Google has amassed since its inception in a Silicon Valley garage in 1998.",
      "Although antitrust regulators prevailed both times, the battle is likely to continue for several more years as Google tries to overturn the two monopoly decisions in appeals while forging ahead in the new and highly lucrative technological frontier of artificial intelligence.",
      "The next step in the latest case is a penalty phase that will likely begin late this year or early next year. The same so-called remedy hearings in the search monopoly case are scheduled to begin Monday in Washington D.C., where Justice Department lawyers will try to convince U.S. District Judge Amit Mehta to impose a sweeping punishment that includes a proposed requirement for Google to sell its Chrome web browser.",
      "Brinkema's 115-page decision centers on the marketing machine that Google has spent the past 17 years building around its search engine and other widely used products and services, including its Chrome browser, YouTube video site and digital maps.",
      "The system was largely built around a series of acquisitions that started with Google's $3.2 billion purchase of online ad specialist DoubleClick in 2008. U.S. regulators approved the deals at the time they were made before realizing that they had given the Mountain View, California, company a platform to manipulate the prices in an ecosystem that a wide range of websites depend on for revenue and provides a vital marketing connection to consumers.",
      "The Justice Department lawyers argued that Google built and maintained dominant market positions in a technology trifecta used by website publishers to sell ad space on their webpages, as well as the technology that advertisers use to get their ads in front of consumers, and the ad exchanges that conduct automated auctions in fractions of a second to match buyer and seller.",
      "After evaluating the evidence presented during a lengthy trial that\u00a0concluded just before Thanksgiving last year,\u00a0Brinkema reached a decision that rejected the Justice Department's assertions that Google has been mistreating advertisers while concluding the company has been abusing its power to stifle competition to the detriment of online publishers forced to rely on its network for revenue.",
      "\"For over a decade, Google has tied its publisher ad server and ad exchange together through contractual policies and technological integration, which enabled the company to establish and protect its monopoly power in these two markets.\" Brinkema wrote. \"Google further entrenched its monopoly power by imposing anticompetitive policies on its customers and eliminating desirable product features.\"",
      "Despite that rebuke, Brinkema also concluded that Google didn't break the law when it snapped Doubleclick nor when it followed up that deal a few years later by buying another service, Admeld.",
      "The Justice Department \"failed to show that the DoubleClick and Admeld acquisitions were anticompetitive,\" Brinkema wrote. \"Although these acquisitions helped Google gain monopoly power in two adjacent ad tech markets, they are insufficient, when viewed in isolation, to prove that Google acquired or maintained this monopoly power through exclusionary practices.\"",
      "That finding may help Google fight off any attempt to force it to sell its advertising technology to stop its monopolistic behavior.",
      "The Justice Department didn't immediately comment on the judge's decision.",
      "In a statement, Google said it will appeal the ruling.",
      "\"We disagree with the Court's decision regarding our publisher tools,\" said Lee-Anne Mulholland, Google's vice president of regulatory affairs. \"Publishers have many options and they choose Google because our ad tech tools are simple, affordable and effective.\"",
      "Analysts such as Brian Pitz of BMO Markets had been predicting that Google would likely lose the case, helping to brace investors for the latest setback to the company and its corporate parent, Alphabet Inc., whose shares declined 1% in afternoon trading. Alphabet's stock has plunged by 20% so far this year.",
      "As it did in the search monopoly case, Google and its corporate parent Alphabet vehemently denied the Justice Department's allegations. Their lawyers argued the government largely based its case on an antiquated concept of a market that existed a decade ago while underestimating a highly competitive market for advertising spending that includes the likes of Facebook parent Meta Platforms, Amazon, Microsoft and Comcast.",
      "The market as drawn in the Justice Department's case didn't include ads that appear on mobile apps, streaming television services, or other platforms to which internet users have increasingly migrated, prompting Google lawyer Karen Dunn to compare the government's definition a \"time capsule with a BlackBerry, an iPod and a Blockbuster video card\" during her opening statement\u00a0when the trial began last September.",
      "At trial, the Justice Department's lawyers emphasized the harm to news publishers that has arisen from Google's alleged dominance of the marketplace. Witnesses from Gannett, the publisher of USA Today and other newspapers, and News Corp., the publisher of The Wall Street Journal, testified about the difficulties they have faced and what they said was a lack of alternatives to Google's ad tech. Those companies rely on online advertising to fund their news operations and make their articles free to consumers on the internet, government lawyers have argued.",
      "Now, government is in position to try to dismantle that byzantine ad system. When the case was filed more than two years ago during the Biden administration, the Justice Department asserted Google should be forced to sell, at a minimum, its Ad Manager product, which includes the technology used by website publishers and the ad exchange.",

      "Shein and Temu, two popular Chinese e-commerce sites known for their low-cost items, say they will raise prices for U.S. consumers starting next week, a move that comes amid President Trump's 145% tariff on imports from China and the end of a trade loophole.",
      "The sites are popular with U.S. shoppers because of their low prices, with a focus on fast fashion. While they predominantly sell women's apparel and accessories, both also sell men's and children's clothing. Temu carries household items and small personal electronics.",

      "Beginning April 25, though, the deals won't be as enticing for U.S. consumers. In a notice on its website, Shein told customers that \"price adjustments\" will go into effect late next week. Shein said \"recent changes in global trade rules and tariffs\" have caused its own costs to rise, making the price hikes necessary.",
      "\"We're doing everything we can to keep prices low and minimize the impact on you. Our team is working hard to improve your shopping experience and stay true to our mission: making fashion accessible for everyone,\" Shein added, without indicating the size of the price hikes.",

      "The \"de minimis\" loophole",
      "The two e-commerce sites have benefitted from a tax law loophole known as the \"de minimis\" exemption, which has allowed goods worth less than $800 to enter the U.S. duty free. Mr. Trump's recent action\u00a0to eliminate the loophole beginning May 2 throws a wrench in the companies' business models.",
      "In an April 2 executive order, the White House said that shippers in China have previously used the exemption to \"hide illicit substances and conceal the true contents of shipments sent to the United States through deceptive shipping practices.\"",
      "\"These shippers often avoid detection due to administration of the de minimis exemption,\" the executive order said.",
      "Effective May 2, such shipments will be subject to \"all applicable duties,\" the order states.",
      "The end of the \"de minimis\" loophole, as well as the Trump administration's tariffs of 145% on imports from China, have dented the business models of the two platforms.",

    "story": [
      "Small business owners worry that mounting economic uncertainty, driven largely by President Trump's\u00a0shifting tariff policies, could shut their doors for good.",
      "Beth Benike, cofounder of Busy Baby, told CBS MoneyWatch that a lack of clarity on the direction of U.S. tariffs poses serious problems for the Oronoco, Minnesota-based retailer.",
      "\"I am a problem solver. When a decision or policy comes out, I'll find a solution. I will work with it or around it,\" said Benike, whose company makes nonslip placemats and other products for babies. \"The next day, the policy changes and that plan doesn't make sense anymore, so I come up with something else.\"",
      "Smaller enterprises that rely on imported goods and packaging from China, which now faces U.S. tariffs of as high as 145%, are among the most concerned about Mr. Trump's trade policies. But a prolonged period of economic uncertainty alone can prove fatal, obscuring future borrowing costs, dampening consumer spending, and otherwise hindering the strategic planning and managerial decision-making involved in running a small business.",
      "Trump administration officials have staunchly defended their economic policies.",
      "\"Just as it did during President Trump's first term, the administration's America First economic agenda of tariffs, deregulation, tax cuts and the unleashing of American energy will restore American Greatness from Main Street to Wall Street,\" White House spokesman Kush Desai told CBS MoneyWatch in a statement.",
      "Recently, however, tremors in the economy intensified by Mr. Trump's tariffs have eroded the optimism of small businesses, according to a closely watched confidence\u00a0gauge.",
      "\"The implementation of new policy priorities has heightened the level of uncertainty among small business owners over the past few months,\" William Dunkelberg, chief economist of the National Federation of Independent Businesses, said in a statement.",
      "The decline in optimism comes as Mr. Trump's economic agenda roils financial markets and raises concerns about slowing U.S. economic growth.",
      "\"Consumers are concerned about the inflationary effects of the tariffs hikes. They understand if\u00a0prices rise, their real spending power will go down,\" Steven J. Davis, a Stanford University economist who co-developed an economic policy uncertainty\u00a0index, told CBS MoneyWatch. \"Also, some of them also feel that maybe their jobs are at risk, so for both reasons many consumers will cut back on discretionary spending.\"",
      "The cost of unpredictability",
      "To be sure, even in the best of times business owners can be caught flat-footed by abrupt changes in the competitive landscape. But risks surge when the economic climate become unpredictable.",
      "\"Uncertainty is the enemy of entrepreneurship,\" Neri Karra Sillaman, an entrepreneurship expert at Oxford University, told CBS MoneyWatch. \"When the rules of the game are constantly shifting \u2014 one day you have a pause on tariffs, another day you don't have tariffs, if there are interest rate changes or political and economic instability \u2014 businesses cannot then confidently invest in growth.\"",
      "Smaller businesses, which typically have less of a financial cushion than larger enterprises, tend to struggle more in such an environment, she added.",
      "Davis, whose own\u00a0index\u00a0shows a spike in uncertainty in recent months, said trade policy unknowns are \"the big source of uncertainty right now inhibiting business investment and hiring.\"",
      "\"When you have tariffs, they tend to introduce cost unpredictability, which makes it very hard to predict and forecast margins accurately, especially in a product-based business,\" Karra added.",
      "Busy Baby's Benike said the sudden swerves in U.S. trade policy have made planning all but impossible.",
      "\"If I invest time, energy and money and the policy changes again in a way that makes the decision a poor one, I am already invested, the wheels are in motion and I'd be screwed,\" she said.",
      "\"I can't make a decision, so the best thing I can do is get the inventory I've paid for here and ready to sell,\" she added, referring to her latest factory order, now sitting in a Chinese warehouse.",
      "Meanwhile, the new 125% U.S. baseline tariff on Chinese imports means that Benike would owe $229,000 in duties on products worth roughly $158,000. She has launched a fundraising campaign to help cover the tariff costs.",
      "Her plan B, should the steep levies remain in place, is to continue manufacturing her products in China and to sell them to markets outside the U.S.",
      "\"There are babies everywhere. If I can't sell in America, there are other countries that are interested,\" she said.",
      "Business on the brink",
      "Kristin Bear, founder of Kilo Brava, an online lingerie and sleepwear company that sells both directly to consumers as well as to major retailers including Macy's, Nordstrom and Anthropologie, said the sky-high U.S. tariffs on Chinese imports \"wipe out our business completely\" if they stay in place.",
      "\"We have not imported anything yet with the 145% tariffs in place, but it really puts our business in complete jeopardy,\" she said.",
      "Another challenge is that U.S. factories aren't equipped to manufacture the types of garments she designs, Bear said. And because orders for garments intended for sale this fall must be placed with factories by May, it's too late to explore manufacturing options in other countries.",
      "Said Bear, noting that she can't afford to lose a whole season's worth of orders, equivalent to roughly $500,000 in sales: \"If tariffs are still in place when it's time to import them, we'll just have to abandon the goods and close the company.\"",

    "summary": "Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell said in a speech today that President Trump's tariffs are likely to boost U.S. inflation.",
    "story": [
      "Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell on Wednesday cautioned that the central bank could face a \"challenging scenario\" of managing both accelerating inflation and a slowing economy brought on by the impact of President Trump's tariffs.",
      "In written remarks\u00a0at the Economic Club of Chicago, Powell reiterated that the Trump administration's tariffs are \"significantly larger than anticipated.\"",
      "\"The same is likely to be true of the economic effects, which will include higher inflation and slower growth,\" he added.",
      "Even so, Powell said the Federal Reserve can stay patient and wait to see how tariffs and other economic policies of the Trump administration play out before making any changes to interest rates. The sharp volatility in financial markets since Mr. Trump announced sweeping tariffs April 2, only to put most of them on hold a week later, has led to speculation about whether the Fed would soon cut its key interest rate or take other steps to calm investors.",
      "\"For the time being, we are well positioned to wait for greater clarity\" on the impact of policy changes in areas such as immigration, taxation, regulation, and tariffs, Powell said.",
      "Powell said the inflation will likely be temporary, but \"could also be more persistent,\" echoing a concern expressed by a majority of the Fed's 19-member interest rate-setting committee in the minutes of their meeting last month.",
      "Mr. Trump's tariffs have led economists to lower their expectations for U.S. economic growth and forecast higher inflation this year. Because tariffs are taxes paid by importers like Walmart, they typically pass on the added costs to consumers in the form of higher prices.",
      "\"Tariffs likely lead to higher prices while softening consumer sentiment and business optimism possibly means slower growth,\" said Scott Helfstein, Global X's head of investment strategy, in an email. \"This is going to make economic forecasting more difficult, and the Fed is likely going to widen their bands growth and rates with risks to both price stability and full employment rising.\"",
      "Yet some splits among the Fed's interest rate-setting committee have emerged. On Monday, Fed governor Christopher Waller said that he expects the impact of even a large increase in tariffs to be temporary, even if they are left in place for several years. At the same time, he also expects such large duties would weigh on the economy and even threaten a recession.",
      "Should the economy slow sharply, even if inflation remained elevated, Waller said he would support cutting interest rates \"sooner, and to a greater extent than I had previously thought.\"",
      "But other Fed officials, including Neel Kashkari, president of the Fed's Minneapolis branch, have said they are more focused on fighting the effects of higher tariffs on inflation, suggesting they are less likely to support rate cuts anytime soon.",
      "For now, most recent reports suggest the economy is in solid shape. Hiring has been solid and inflation cooled in March. Yet measures of consumer and business confidence have plunged, raising concerns among economists that spending and business investment could weaken.",

    "story": [
      "Pensacola, Florida\u00a0\u2014 Emily Ley has spent the last 17 years building Simplified, her small stationery business based in Pensacola, Florida.",
      "The company produces its planners in China, but for American shoppers.",
      "\"I would love to make them here, but the U.S. simply doesn't have the infrastructure or the supply chain to do it,\" Ley told CBS News.",
      "That stationery is now subject to the recent slew of\u00a0sky-high tariffs.",
      "\"We don't have the same options as large businesses,\" Ley said. \"We don't have the same capital or ability to pivot.\"",
      "After President Trump raised tariffs on China this month,\u00a0eventually totaling 145%, Ley, with the help of the nonpartisan, conservative-funded New Civil Liberties Alliance, filed a federal lawsuit against the president, U.S. Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem, and acting U.S. Customs and Border Patrol Commissioner Pete Flores, alleging illegal use of emergency powers illegally to enact the fees.",
      "Ley said that because Congressional approval was bypassed to impose the tariffs, she and other voters didn't have their positions represented.",
      "\"Had (Congress) had a chance to debate, discuss, vote, be involved,\u00a0I would've then had the opportunity to make my voice heard,\" she explained. \"And same for other Americans who were gonna be impacted by the tariffs. That didn't happen.\"",
      "\"If this is the end of my American dream, I'm gonna go down swinging,\" Ley said.",
      "The president has argued that the tariffs represent short-term pain that will result in long-term gain.",
      "But according to Ley, \"We can't survive the short-term pain, and especially without any sort of plan in place to create the infrastructure here...It would take years and millions and millions of dollars to build such a thing that's been built overseas over decades.\"",
      "Ley said Simplified has paid nearly $1.2 million in tariffs since Mr. Trump's first term, and is facing between $830,000 and $1 million in payments this year alone under the administration's new tariffs.",
      "While the White House is\u00a0offering exemptions\u00a0to multibillion-dollar Chinese industries that produce smartphones and other electronics, Ley says that to just cover the cost of tariffs at 145%, she would have to raise prices on her $64 signature planner to $82. To maintain a profit on her planners, Ley would have to double the sticker price to about $120.",
      "\"I'm not paying $120 for a planner,\" Ley said.",
      "Ley employs eight other women, and disclosed that she is being forced to consider reducing salaries and possibly eliminating positions, something she says she really doesn't want to do.",
      "She says it comes down to keeping prices manageable for customers while balancing the new tariff burden on her bottom line.",
      "Ley said that China's unique manufacturing infrastructure isn't currently available in the U.S. or other countries internationally. Different elements of her planners are made in several different factories in the Shenzhen region. Because they are located close to one another, the final product is higher quality and more affordable.",
      "In response to Ley's lawsuit, Harrison Fields, a White House spokesperson, told CBS News in a statement that the president \"has broad authority to impose tariffs to address issues of national emergency, such as the opioid pandemic. The Trump Administration looks forward to victory in court.\"",
      "Ley says her business cannot survive such tariffs.",
      "\"That's what's terrifying,\" Ley said. \"...It's just not sustainable. And it's truly catastrophic to so many businesses, and big businesses and small businesses alike. But I really think small businesses are gonna be the casualty of this trade war.\"",

      "Reaching the six-figure salary threshold may be considered a financial victory for many Americans, but in a many big U.S. cities the once aspirational milestone just doesn't cut it anymore.",
      "In one out of four large metro areas in the United States, a family of three with a household income of $100,000 will still struggle to get by, a LendingTree\u00a0analysis\u00a0reveals. That's a stark realization for many Americans, who continue to face\u00a0rising household expenses\u00a0on everything from\u00a0a dozen eggs to a bag of coffee. The average median household income in then U.S. was $80,610 in 2023,\u00a0according\u00a0to the most recent estimate from the Census Bureau.",
      "\"For generations of Americans, $100,000 has long been a magic number. It has been seen as a level of yearly earnings that says: You've made it. You're successful,\" according to the report. \"However, that has changed dramatically in many of the nation's biggest metros. In 25 of the 100 largest metros in this country, a six-figure household income isn't enough to handle the basics.\"",
      "In determining the metro areas where a $100,000 salary wouldn't stretch far enough, LendingTree considered eight different spending categories a typical family of three might face \u2014 such as two-bedroom apartment and infant daycare \u2014 and then subtracted the total cost from the $8,333 in monthly income the family would be earning on a salary of $100,000. That left a slew of large metro areas, from Los Angeles to New York, with negative monthly income estimates.",
      "In 25 of the 100 largest U.S. cities LendingTree looked at for its report, researchers found that monthly expenditures \u2013 which ranged from food to childcare and health insurance costs \u2013 outweighed net monthly income. The analysis didn't factor in debt payments.",
      "\"It's a rough time out there. The fact that you can make six figures in many, many cities across this country and still be broke, even before you factor in debt payments, is scary,\" said Matt Schulz, chief consumer finance analyst at LendingTree and author of the study. \"That's the reality for many families today, though, and unfortunately, there's not much reason to think things are going to improve anytime soon. That means that families are going to be forced to make some tough decisions and real sacrifices to get by.\"",
      "The study comes at a time when consumer confidence has fallen to its lowest levels since the pandemic, as Americans weather a period of economic uncertainty amid the Trump administration's tariff rollout. Americans expect long-term inflation to reach 4.4%, up from 4.1% last month.",

      "In San Jose, the heart of California's pricey Silicon Valley, a family of three with household income of $100,000 a year would find themselves more than $2,000 short every month after covering basic expenses. Researchers say this is attributable to disproportionately high housing and transportation costs. Trailing San Jose are San Francisco and Boston which are the second and third hardest places, respectively, to get by on a $100,000 annual salary.",
      "Notably, the lion's share of locations where family breadwinners making $100,000 might still end up broke were cities on the West or East Coasts. California metro hubs figured prominently on the list, with all 10 of the state's largest cities among the top 25.\u00a0Colorado, Connecticut, Massachusetts and New York also had multiple metro areas included on the list.",
      "Which cities were the most affordable for a family making $100,000?",
      "In 1 in 3 cities, however, a $100,000 salary \"is still magical,\" even for a family of three. Earners in these areas could still pocket $1,000 or more each month after paying basic expenses, LendingTree found.",
      "McAllen, Texas, located on the U.S. - Mexico border, came in at the top for places where a $100,000 salary will give you the biggest bang for your buck. Residents there would have $1,770 left over after subtracting money for their monthly expenditures. Close behind McAllen are Little Rock, Arkansas and El Paso, Texas, according to the report.",

      "The Chinese government has told the country's domestic airlines to stop accepting deliveries of Boeing jets as a trade war between the world's two largest economies escalates, Bloomberg News\u00a0reports.",
      "China is also instructing its carriers to stop buying airline parts and other components from U.S. companies, according to Bloomberg, which cited people familiar with the situation.",
      "Boeing declined to comment. The aviation giant's shares fell $2.59, or 1.6%, to $156.74 in morning trading.",
      "The order to stop accepting Boeing jets comes after China boosted its retaliatory tariffs on U.S. goods to 125%. That matches the level of tariffs that President Trump has placed on Chinese imports, although those taxes can rise as high as 145% for some products. China's tariffs would have more than doubled the price of U.S.-made aircraft and parts, making the cost unaffordable, Bloomberg reported.",
      "Boeing is scheduled to ship about 10 737 Max aircraft to Chinese carriers, including China Southern Airlines, Air China and Xiamen Airlines, Bloomberg reported, citing data from Aviation Flights Group. During the first quarter, Boeing delivered 130 aircraft in all, including more than 100 737 jets, the company\u00a0said on April 8.",
      "Mr. Trump addressed the report in a Truth Social post on Tuesday, writing that China \"just reneged on the big Boeing deal, saying that they will 'not take possession' of fully committed to aircraft.\"",
      "Bloomberg reported that some of the payment and delivery paperwork on some of those jets ordered by Chinese airlines might have been completed before the trade war expanded earlier this month. In that case, some planes might be able to enter China, the news service reported.",

    "summary": "Meta CEO Mark Zuckerberg is in federal court for a second day in a landmark federal antitrust trial accusing Meta of being a monopoly.",
    "story": [
      "Meta CEO Mark Zuckerberg sparred Tuesday with a Federal Trade Commission attorney over the meaning of emails the Facebook founder wrote about why he wanted to acquire Instagram, as a historic antitrust trial alleging Meta illegally monopolized the social media market went into its second day.",
      "Zuckerberg returned to the witness stand on Tuesday to defend Meta's purchase of Instagram and WhatsApp, in a trial that could force Meta to divest the two apps, startups the tech giant bought more than a decade ago which have since grown into social media powerhouses.",
      "Daniel Matheson, who is leading the FTC's case against Meta, contends that Zuckerberg bought Instagram because he saw it as a threat to his company, not because he thought he could make it thrive.",
      "While questioning Zuckerberg on Tuesday morning, Matheson noted that the CEO had referred to Instagram as being a \"rapidly growing, threatening, network.\"",
      "But Zuckerberg, who is the first witness called in the trial, said while Matheson was able to show documents in court that indicated his concern about Instagram's growth, he also had many conversations about how excited his company was to acquire Instagram to make a better product.",
      "Zuckerberg pushed back against Matheson's contention that the reason for buying the company was to neutralize a threat.",
      "\"I think that that mischaracterizes what the email was,\" Zuckerberg said.",
      "In his questioning of Zuckerberg, Matheson repeatedly brought up emails \u2014 many of them more than a decade old \u2014 written by Zuckerberg and his associates before the acquisition of Instagram.",
      "While acknowledging the documents, Zuckerberg has often sought to downplay the contents, saying he wrote them in the early stages of considering the acquisition and that what he wrote at the time didn't capture the full scope of his interest in the company.",
      "Matheson also brought up a February 2012 message in which Zuckerberg wrote to the former chief financial officer of Facebook that Instagram and Path, a social networking app, already had created meaningful networks that could be \"very disruptive to us.\"",
      "Zuckerberg testified that the message was written in the context of a broad discussion about whether they should buy companies to accelerate their own developments.",
      "The CEO was also questioned about why he bought Instagram and WhatsApp instead of building new apps.",
      "\"I'm sure we could have built an app, whether it would have succeeded or not, I think is a matter of speculation\u2026\u00a0 building a new app is hard, and many more times than not, when we've tried to build a new app, it hasn't gotten a lot of traction,\" Zuckerberg said.",
      "Zuckerberg also repeatedly disputed the government's claim that acquiring Instagram was bad for competition and for consumers.",
      "\"What I was focused on is the software infrastructure of different services that they (Instagram) can plug into. I think the explicit strategy for the Instagram integration was that we wanted to let Kevin and Mike, the founders basically tell us what services they needed from Meta in order to help improve the quality of growing Instagram faster,\" he said.",
      "The trial is one of the first big tests of President Donald Trump's FTC's ability to challenge Big Tech. The lawsuit was filed against Meta \u2014 then called Facebook \u2014 in 2020, during Trump's first term. It claims the company bought Instagram and WhatsApp to squash competition and establish an illegal monopoly in the social media market.",
      "Facebook bought Instagram \u2014 which was a photo-sharing app with no ads \u2014 for $1 billion in 2012.",
      "Instagram was the first company Facebook bought and kept running as a separate app. Until then, Facebook was known for smaller \"acqui-hires\" \u2014 a popular Silicon Valley deal in which a company purchases a startup as a way to hire its talented workers, then shuts the acquired company down. Two years later, it did it again with the messaging app WhatsApp, which it purchased for $22 billion.",
      "Narrow market definition",
      "WhatsApp and Instagram helped Facebook move its business from desktop computers to mobile devices, and to remain popular with younger generations as rivals like Snapchat (which it also tried, but failed, to buy) and TikTok emerged.",
      "However, the FTC has a narrow definition of Meta's competitive market, excluding companies like TikTok, YouTube and Apple's messaging service from being considered rivals to Instagram and WhatsApp.",
      "Meta, meanwhile, says the FTC's lawsuit \"defies reality.\"",
      "\"The evidence at trial will show what every 17-year-old in the world knows: Instagram, Facebook and WhatsApp compete with Chinese-owned TikTok, YouTube, X, iMessage and many others. More than 10 years after the FTC reviewed and cleared our acquisitions, the Commission's action in this case sends the message that no deal is ever truly final,\" the company said in a statement.",
      "U.S. District Judge James Boasberg is presiding over the case. Late last year, he denied Meta's request for a summary judgment and ruled that the case must go to trial.",

    "published": "Tue, 15 Apr 2025 17:21:31 -0400",
    "summary": "Filing a tax extension is easy. But it's important to know what you're getting into, including what to do if you owe money to the IRS.",
    "story": [
      "If you're still scrambling to get your taxes filed before the April 15 deadline, an extension can take the pressure off.",
      "Normally, the IRS recommends\u00a0that people file their income tax return as early as possible. But that's not always feasible, whether because of personal circumstances or a complicated tax situation. For those in a bind, a\u00a0tax extension\u00a0gives people an additional six months to file their federal return. The quick and free process gives Americans plenty of extra time to assemble their forms, work through complex tax situations and submit everything to the government without penalty.",
      "As of April 4, roughly 100 million people had already filed their taxes, according\u00a0to the IRS. The tax agency said\u00a0in January that it is expecting more than 140 million individual tax returns to be filed before the April 15 deadline, meaning there are likely millions of outstanding 1040s yet to be filed.",
      "Taxpayers in these states have beyond April 15 to file their taxes, IRS says. Here's where.Do you know what you pay in taxes? Here's who pays the most and least to the IRS.",
      "Taxpayers in these states have beyond April 15 to file their taxes, IRS says. Here's where.",
      "Do you know what you pay in taxes? Here's who pays the most and least to the IRS.",
      "Taxes are typically a major source of stress for Americans. In an April TaxAct survey, a quarter of respondents said one of their top concerns was filing their taxes incorrectly. Those polled also expressed uncertainty around what to expect when filing, with one-quarter of respondents saying they worried about having to pay more taxes than they'd expected.",
      "If you're planning to file a tax extension this year, here are some things to keep in mind.",
      "What is the 2025 filing deadline?",
      "The deadline to file your taxes this year is Tuesday, April 15, by 11:59 p.m. in your local time zone. However, there are exceptions.",
      "U.S. citizens, resident aliens and members of the military on duty who live outside of the U.S. are granted an automatic extension of two months. Military servicemembers serving in combat zones are given 180 days after they leave the area to file and pay their tax returns.",
      "This year, the IRS also extended the deadline for 13 states due to natural disasters in those areas. All taxpayers in Alabama, Florida, Georgia, North Carolina, South Carolina, and certain locations in Alaska, New Mexico, and Virginia have until May 1 to file their returns. Taxpayers in California's Los Angeles County have until October 15. And people in Arkansas, Kentucky and Tennessee, as well as in certain counties in West Virginia, have until November 3 to file.",
      "How do I file a tax extension online?",
      "The IRS offers a few different ways for people to extend their tax deadline to October 15. The online payment system, which allows you to pay the IRS directly from your bank account, debit card, credit card or digital wallet, has a box you can check if you need to file for an extension.",
      "Taxpayers can also electronically request an automatic tax-filing extension while using IRS File Free, which guides taxpayers through their federal income returns using tax preparation software.",
      "Another option is to file a Form 4868, which is the Application for Automatic Extension of Time To File U.S. Individual Income Tax Return. It asks for basic information including your name, address and Social Security number. You can file a Form 4868 electronically by using IRS e-file or mailing the form to the IRS.",
      "If I get an extension, does that mean I have more time to pay the IRS?",
      "Even if you get an extension, you are still required to pay the IRS by the regular deadline if you owe money. As the IRS says, \"an extension gives extra time to file, but it does not give taxpayers extra time to pay if they owe.\" If taxpayers want to avoid financial penalties, it's best to estimate the amount you owe and pay it by the regular deadline, which is 11:59 p.m, Tuesday, April 15.",
      "Is there a penalty for filing taxes late?",
      "Yes. The IRS charges individuals and businesses a fine if they fail to file their return by the deadline or by their extension date. The \"failure to file penalty\" is 5% of the tax due for each month the return is late and is capped at 25%.",
      "What happens if I file but don't pay?",
      "The IRS levies a fine based on the amount of taxes you didn't pay. The \"failure to pay penalty\" is 0.5% of the unpaid taxes for each month, with a cap of 25% of the unpaid taxes. You would be subject to the penalty if you file your taxes on time but don't pay by the April 15 deadline.",
      "Tax filers can avoid the \"failure to file\" and \"failure to pay\" charges if they can prove that they missed the payment due to a\u00a0reasonable cause. \"Reasonable cause is determined on a case by case basis considering all the facts and circumstances of your situation,\" the IRS says.",
      "What if I can't afford to pay the IRS?",
      "The IRS offers both a short-term and long-term payment plan for taxpayers struggling to pay what they owe to the IRS. Those interested in applying can do so on the IRS website.",

      "Meta, the parent company of Facebook, Instagram and WhatsApp, is facing off with the Federal Trade Commission on Monday, for Day one of a landmark antitrust trial that could result in the company's breakup. For Zuckerberg, the case could determine whether the business empire he started building while still a student at Harvard University will be forced to break apart.",
      "The trial will be the first big test of the FTC's willingness under President Trump to challenge Big Tech, a long-time target of Republicans. The lawsuit was initially filed against Meta \u2014 then called Facebook \u2014 in 2020, during Mr. Trump's first term, before being amended in 2021.",

      "\"There's nothing wrong with Meta innovating,\" said Daniel Matheson, lead attorney for the FTC in his opening statements for the agency Monday, \"It's what happened next that is a problem.\"",
      "During his testimony Monday, Zuckerberg defended his decision to buy Instagram and pushed back against FTC claims that he did not invest in developing the app.",
      "Purchased by Facebook in\u00a02012\u00a0and\u00a02014, respectively, Instagram and WhatsApp have grown into social media powerhouses.",
      "To restore competition, Meta must part ways with Instagram and WhatsApp, the government agency says in\u00a0court filings. The FTC also wants Meta to provide the government with prior notice for any future mergers and acquisitions.",
      "With the landmark trial underway, here's what you need to know.",
      "How long will the Meta trial last, and who will testify?",
      "The trial, which begins Monday in federal court in Washington, D.C., is expected to last several weeks.",
      "U.S. District Judge James Boasberg will preside over the case, which could see a range of witnesses including Meta CEO and founder Zuckerberg; former Meta Chief Operating Officer Sheryl Sandberg; former Meta Chief Technology Officer Mike Schroepfer; Instagram co-founder Kevin Systrom; and executives from rival social media platforms.",
      "What is happening in court today?",
      "The FTC and Meta made their opening arguments on Monday, with witness testimony expected to start in the afternoon.",
      "In his opening statement, lead FTC attorney Matheson said Meta was struggling to compete with the fast-growing WhatsApp and Instagram platforms and in buying them, the tech giant was \"eliminating immediate threats,\" to their market.",
      "Meta said the company \"did nothing wrong\" by acquiring Instagram and WhatsApp. Meta attorney Mark Hansen said in his opening statement that the two apps have grown substantially under the tech company's ownership and that there is no evidence to prove Meta is a monopoly.",
      "If Meta had monopoly power, it would exercise control over pricing in the social media space, Hansen said. But Meta's services are free, he noted. \"How can the FTC maintain this monopolization case when [Meta] has never charged users a cent,\" Hansen said.",
      "After the opening statements, Zuckerberg was the first person called to the stand to testify. His\u00a0testimony largely focused on Facebook's efforts to build a rival photo app that could compete with Instagram, before it decided to ultimately buy the company in 2012.",
      "Zuckerberg admitted Facebook was struggling with mobile users in the early 2010s. \"Our whole company had been built up to that point\" for desktop.",
      "Referencing email communications sent by the Meta executive, the FTC pointed out that Zuckerberg had been eyeing the progress of competitor Instagram. Facebook at the time was working on launching a new photo app.",
      "According to the FTC, Zuckerberg sent an email in Feb 2011 saying \"Instagram seems like it's growing quickly\" that mentioned their numbers and uploads.",
      "In 2012, Zuckerberg sent another email in which he described his rationale for buying Instagram, saying it was a good photo-sharing network, according to the FTC. At that point Facebook was \"so far behind that we don't even understand how far behind we are,\" he said, adding, \"I worry that it will take us too long to catch up.\"",
      "Zuckerberg is scheduled to return to court Tuesday morning to continue testimony.",
      "What's at stake?",
      "The showdown is the most significant legal challenge brought against Meta in the company's roughly 20-year history. If the FTC is successful, Meta could be forced to divest Instagram and WhatsApp. Instagram, which Meta has owned for over a decade, accounts for half of the company's overall advertising revenue.",
      "\"Instagram has also been picking up the slack for Facebook on the user front, particularly among young people, for a long time,\" Emarketer analyst Jasmine Enberg told the Associated Press.",
      "\"The trial also comes as Meta is trying to bring back OG Facebook in an effort to appeal to Gen Z and younger users as they join social media. Social media usage is far more fragmented today than it was in 2012 when Facebook acquired Instagram, and Facebook isn't where the cool college kids hang out anymore. Meta needs Instagram to continue growing, especially as more advertisers think Instagram-first with their Meta budgets,\" she added.",
      "Meta, headquartered in Menlo Park, California, earned over $164 billion in revenue in 2024. Facebook and Instagram are the two most profitable social media platforms in the world.",
      "In a statement issued Sunday, April 13, Meta said the \"stakes could not be higher in this trial for U.S. consumers and businesses.\"",
      "What is Meta saying?",
      "The social media company has called the FTC's case \"weak\" and said it \"ignores reality,\" adding that it faces stiff competition from TikTok and YouTube. Both platforms outrank Facebook and Instagram in terms of how long users spend on each.",
      "\"Ultimately, an ill-conceived lawsuit like this will make companies think twice before investing in innovation, knowing they may be punished if that innovation leads to success,\" Meta's statement reads. \"On top of it, this weak case is costing taxpayers millions of dollars.\"",
      "\"The FTC's lawsuit against Meta defies reality,\" a Meta spokesperson told CBS MoneyWatch. \"The evidence at trial will show what every 17-year-old in the world knows: Instagram, Facebook and WhatsApp compete with Chinese-owned TikTok, YouTube, X, iMessage and many others.\"",
      "\"Regulators should be supporting American innovation, rather than seeking to break up a great American company and further advantaging China on critical issues like AI,\" the spokesperson added.",
      "The FTC did not reply to a request for comment.",

    "summary": "President Trump is considering exempting U.S. automakers from paying steep tariffs that could damage the industry.",
    "story": [
      "President Trump on Monday suggested he might temporarily exempt the auto industry from tariffs he previously imposed on the sector\u00a0to give carmakers time to overhaul their complex supply chains.",
      "Mr. Trump told reporters gathered in the Oval Office that automakers \"need a little bit of time\" to relocate production from Canada, Mexico and elsewhere to the U.S.",
      "Car manufacturers' supply chains are tightly interwoven with other nations, making it almost impossible to make vehicles entirely in the United States.",
      "Because U.S. automakers source many of their car parts from key trade partners, including Canada, Mexico and China, a fully American-made car doesn't exist, according to experts.",
      "Mr. Trump has previously reversed course on tariffs, causing upheaval in financial markets and leading economists to raise the odds of the U.S. economy entering a recession this year.",
      "The 25% tariffs on foreign-made cars, which Mr. Trump designed with the intention of reshoring auto manufacturing to the U.S., is likely to boost car prices by thousands of dollars, experts say.",
      "The price of a typical car could rise by between $5,000 to $10,000 \"out of the gates\" due to the new tariffs, according to a March 31 estimate from Wedbush Securities analyst Dan Ives."

    "published": "Sun, 13 Apr 2025 21:00:24 -0400",
    "summary": "President Trump's approvals on economy and inflation dip, as Wall Street has one of its most volatile weeks in recent years.",
    "story": [
      "Amid a tumultuous week in the markets, the outlook on President Trump's trade and tariff policy hinges not just on what Americans think will happen, but when.",
      "People split on whether they believe Mr. Trump has a clear plan, and most don't think the tariffs will be permanent \u2014 rather that he's using them to negotiate. More like his goals regarding\u00a0trade policy than his approach to it. For those who think he does have a plan \u2014 predominantly, Republicans \u2014 it'll take months or longer to judge the impact. Republicans stand apart from the public overall in showing that patience.",
      "But in the short term, a big majority of Americans think new tariffs are going to raise prices, and many think that's the case in the long term, too. So, an inflation-weary public is bracing for that to hit their bottom line: a growing number think Trump's policies are making them financially worse off, not better, and most think that tariffs will make the economy worse more immediately, too.",
      "In turn, Trump's ratings for handling inflation and the economy have become more negative.",
      "Either way one lasting impression may be this: in the public mind it is Donald Trump's economy now. A majority say his policies, not Joe Biden's, are responsible for it.",
      "Views about the potential impact on prices are especially important in this context because in recent years inflation has consistently been a top concern for Americans, and it is still a top way people evaluate their finances and the economy.",
      "Opinion is more mixed on how tariffs might impact U.S. manufacturing jobs: it is mostly Republicans who believe they will lead to more jobs.",
      "Trump's trade policies",
      "In all, more people say they like Trump's goals with tariff and trade policy than like his approach.",
      "And new tariffs continue to get net negative \u2014 but very partisan splits \u2014 in support.",
      "As does the view on whether or not Trump has a plan, where almost all Republicans say so.",
      "Most Americans don't think the tariffs will stay \u2014 they think Mr. Trump is using them for negotiations and will remove them later. Republicans especially think that \u2014 and it's related to how they view the long-term impact on prices.",
      "Despite many anticipating short-term price increases, Republicans and most independents say judging Trump's trade policies will take at least a few months to evaluate, while Democrats are more ready to evaluate them sooner.",
      "Support for tariffs is also connected to who people think they'll help or hurt. Either way large numbers think the wealthy and corporations will benefit. Those in favor see the middle and working class benefitting too.",
      "Trump's job handling",
      "When Mr. Trump was entering office, a sizable four in 10 Americans thought he'd make them financially better off \u2014 it was a key reason he won the election. That changed in March, with more seeing the impact as worse, and now that worsening view has continued today.",
      "The market was volatile this week while the poll was being conducted, but overall more Americans said Mr. Trump's policies were making the market go down.",
      "In all, the trend is for sliding ratings for Mr. Trump on handling the economy, handling inflation, and overall. (That overall number is down from its high at the start, but still higher than anything he had in his first term.)",
      "Some of the change in Mr. Trump's overall approval has come from independents disapproving more.",
      "As has been the case, Mr. Trump gets better marks for handling immigration than either the economy and inflation.",
      "Impacting the economy",
      "Ultimately, every president's policies put their stamp on the U.S. economy. In political terms, most of the public considers this Donald Trump's economy now: the majority view his policies (not Joe Biden's) as mostly responsible for the way things are today. And combined, three-quarters assign him at least shared impact.",
      "Here's another way Mr. Trump is a central figure in the economy: given a list of reasons why they might think the economy is either good or bad, in either case, sizable numbers give Mr. Trump as a reason. For the large majority who think it's bad, prices and general lack of confidence are top reasons, along with Donald Trump specifically. Those who think the economy is good \u2014 a group that includes a lot of Republicans \u2014 list Mr. Trump, along with general confidence, and the job market.",
      "Polarization also plays a role in a difference between people's assessments now and their outlook. In the last few weeks, their collective outlook has changed a little more.",
      "First, views about their own outlook for the economy got a little worse, with fewer expecting it to hold steady and more expecting a recession.",
      "And a slight majority of Americans \u2014 and slightly more than last month \u2014 said they think the economy is getting worse. That came from Democrats, as most Republicans say it's getting better. (Separately, in a different study, the consumer confidence index slipped in April.)",
      "Meanwhile, current views of the U.S. economy have been majority negative for years and still are. More Republicans are calling it good now, a partisan effect we often see over the years when the White House changes hands. And Republicans say that's in part due to their confidence in general and because of Donald Trump in particular. Those Republicans pushed the overall economy rating up a bit, even as Democrats and independents rated it worse.",
      "Partisan differences on trade \u2014 how the base sees it",
      "We can see more into Mr. Trump's support from the GOP base by where people go for trusted information about the tariffs and their impact: for Republicans, they trust Trump \"a lot\" for that information, far more than they do Wall Street or business leaders in general.",
      "Along with economics and jobs, Republicans also see tariffs and trade as a matter of fairness and patriotism.",
      "And most Republicans don't want Congress involved, even though it's a Republican-controlled Congress. Democrats and independents, who are less supportive of tariffs, likely for pragmatic reasons would call for more congressional involvement to stop them.",
      "This CBS News/YouGov survey was conducted with a nationally representative sample of 2,410\u00a0 U.S. adults interviewed between April 8-11, 2025. The sample was weighted to be representative of adults nationwide according to gender, age, race, and education, based on the U.S. Census American Community Survey and Current Population Survey, as well as 2024 presidential vote.

      "After one of the most turbulent weeks on Wall Street in recent history, stocks ended higher on Friday, with investors setting aside concerns \u2014 at least temporarily \u2014 about the growing trade war between the U.S. and China.",
      "The S&P 500 gained 95 points, or 1.8%, to 5,363, while the Dow Jones Industrial Average added 619 points, or 1.6%, and the Nasdaq Composite rose 2.1%.",
      "After a week full of monstrous swings, the S&P 500 posted its best weekly performance since November 23, while the Nasdaq saw its best week since November 2022, according to the financial data firm FactSet. Even so, economists are cautioning that the growing trade war between the U.S. and China could crimp the nation's growth.",
      "\"'Rollercoaster' is not a technical term but it is probably the best adjective to describe price action across equity markets this week,\" noted Adam Turnquist, chief technical strategist for LPL Financial, in an email.",
      "Beijing on Friday announced that it would raise tariffs on U.S. goods to 125%. That matches the 125% duties on Chinese goods that President Trump\u00a0announced this week\u00a0\u2014 those tariffs will rise to as much as 145% for some of the Asian nation's products.",
      "\"The U.S. alternately raising abnormally high tariffs on China has become a numbers game, which has no practical economic significance, and will become a joke in the history of the world economy,\" a Chinese finance ministry spokesman said in a statement announcing the new tariffs. \"However, if the U.S. insists on continuing to substantially infringe on China's interests, China will resolutely counter and fight to the end.\"",
      "Pressure also eased a bit from within the U.S. bond market. The typically more boring corner of Wall Street has been flashing signals of stress this week that have been serious enough to demand attention from both Wall Street and President Trump.",
      "\"China's tit-for-tat retaliation in its rapidly escalating trade war with the U.S. exerted some renewed pressure on equities and the dollar today, with bonds still buffeted by expectations of monetary easing and signs of market dislocation,\" John Higgins, chief market economist with Capital Economics, said in a report.",
      "Gold prices rose more than 2% to $3,250 per ounce Friday following China's tariff hike as investors crowd into safe havens.",
      "The S&P 500 remains down nearly 13% from its latest peak on Feb. 19, while the Dow and Nasdaq have fallen 12% and 17%, respectively.",
      "Those declines reflect investor concerns about the impact of multilateral tariffs on corporate profits and on the broader economy, with some analysts raising the odds of a recession.",
      "\"While the White House has tried hard in the last 1.5 days to spin things positively on trade, with a lot of talk about negotiations, investors are seeing through the noise and realize the irreparable damage inflicted on the global economy from Trump's reckless tariff campaign,\" equities analyst Adam Crisafulli, head of Vital Knowledge, told investors in a research note.",
      "The news for markets isn't uniformly grim. The Dow soared nearly 3,000 points on Wednesday, while the S&P 500 and Nasdaq enjoyed their biggest one-day gains in decades after Mr. Trump\u00a0paused \"reciprocal\" tariffs on dozens of countries, with the exception of China, for 90 days.",

      "Despite Mr. Trump's move this week to ratchet down trade tensions, Americans seem worried. New data from the University of Michigan shows consumer confidence sinking to its lowest level since the depths of the pandemic, with more people expecting unemployment to rise.",

    "summary": "Some people whose homes survived the Eaton wildfire in January are struggling to convince their insurers to test their properties for safety.",
    "story": [
      "All sense of survivors' guilt was fleeting for those residents whose homes remained standing after wildfires ripped through the Los Angeles area three months ago.",
      "Many worried that smoke from the Eaton wildfire that destroyed more than 9,000 structures and killed 18 people may have carried toxins, including lead, asbestos and heavy metals, into their homes. But they struggled to convince their insurers to test their properties to ensure it was safe to return.",
      "Nicole Maccalla, a data scientist, said embers burned more than half of her roof, several windows and eaves were damaged, and her house in Altadena was left filled with ash, debris, soot and damaged appliances. She said her insurance adjuster said USAA would pay for contamination testing, but after choosing a company and coming back with the results, her claim was rejected. The adjuster said the company only covered testing in homes with major damage.",
      "\"Every single item is a battle,\" said Maccalla. \"It's denials and appeals and denials and appeals, and you wait weeks and weeks and weeks for responses.\"",
      "Maccalla and others banded together as Eaton Fire Residents United, sharing indoor environmental testing data and compiling the results in an online map. Of 81 homes tested so far for lead, all show elevated levels, according to the group.",
      "\"I've already had multiple people reach out and say: 'Thank you for publishing this map \u2026 because my insurance company has changed their mind and approved testing,'\" said Maccalla, who helped design the data collection to verify results and maintain privacy.",
      "Many homeowners paid privately for the testing after their insurance companies refused, revealing gaps in coverage. The group hopes the data will help residents who can't afford it to convince their insurers to cover testing and remediation.",
      "\"If I can prove my community is not fit for human habitation then maybe I can show my home won't be,\" said Jane Lawton Potelle, founder of Eaton Fire Residents United.",
      "It's not easy to understand how and when it is safe to return home, Potelle said. The fine print of insurance policies can be frustrating and confusing, and the government has not stepped in to help.",
      "No help from FEMA",
      "The Federal Emergency Management Agency said it has no plans to conduct widespread environmental testing. The Los Angeles County Department of Public Health is tracking environmental testing largely by academic researchers and a handful from government agencies, but most studies assess outdoor contamination.",
      "Reports from other urban wildfires, in which building materials, appliances, cars and more burn at incredibly high temperatures, show increased levels of heavy metals including lead and polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) such as benzene that are tied to negative health risks. But insurance companies haven't standardized testing for those contaminants.",
      "Home insurance broadly covers fire damage, but there is a growing dispute over what damage must be covered when flames don't torch the property.",
      "California Insurance Commissioner Ricardo Lara released a bulletin in March that put the onus on companies to properly investigate reported smoke damage, saying they cannot deny such claims without investigating thoroughly, including paying for professional testing as warranted. But many residents have been left to fight for coverage anyway.",
      "Janet Ruiz, spokesperson for the Insurance Information Institute that represents many major insurance companies, said it's hard to compare neighbors because every claim is unique due to each home's physical structure, actual damage and defined insurance coverage limits.",
      "\"It can vary and insurance companies are sensitive to what the claim is,\" Ruiz said. \"You have to work with your insurance companies and be reasonable about what may have happened.\"",
      "Disputes over fire damage coverage",
      "Dave Jones, director of the Climate Risk Initiative at University of California, Berkeley, and former state insurance commissioner, said testing should be covered even though some insurance companies disagree.",
      "\"It's perfectly reasonable for people to have some kind of environmental test done so that their home is safe and their property is safe,\" Jones said. \"We're talking about very catastrophically high temperature fires where all sorts of materials are melted and some of them become toxic.\"",
      "The state's insurer of last resort, known as the California Fair Access to Insurance Requirements Plan, has been scrutinized for years over how it handles smoke damage claims. A 2017 change to the FAIR Plan limited coverage to \"permanent physical changes,\" meaning smoke damage must be visible or detectable without lab testing for claims to be approved. State officials said that threshold was too high and illegal, and ordered a change.",
      "Dylan Schaffer, an attorney leading a class action lawsuit challenging FAIR Plan's threshold, said he was surprised private carriers are disputing similar fire damage claims.",
      "\"The damage is not due to smoke, the damage is contamination from fire,\" Schaffer said. \"They make it complicated because it saves them money.\"",
      "Meanwhile, Altadena residents on the FAIR Plan say their claims are still being denied. Jones believes the debate will only end when lawmakers take action.",
      "FAIR Plan spokeswoman Hilary McLean declined to comment on the ongoing litigation and individual cases, but said the FAIR Plan pays all covered claims based on the adjusters' recommendations.",
      "\"Our policy, like many others, requires direct physical loss for there to be coverage,\" McLean said.",
      "Potelle said the first inkling that her house might be toxic came after meeting with her AAA insurance adjuster in the days after the fire. Even though she had worn a mask, her chest still ached and her voice rasped, and she wondered whether her home was safe for her 11-year-old.",
      "Stephanie Wilcox said her toddler's pediatrician recommended testing their home. Her Farmers Insurance policy includes coverage for lead and asbestos in addition to her wildfire coverage, but after multiple denials, she paid out of pocket.",
      "\"After the initial inspection, (Farmers) had told us remediation would cost about $12,000 and that it would be habitable, like we could move back in tomorrow,\" she said. \"But now there's no way.\"",
      "She plans to ask for a new estimate including lead abatement and other costs, citing the results.",
      "Similarly, Zach Bailey asked in late January for contamination testing. The house he shares with his wife and toddler sits in an island of largely spared homes among blocks wiped out by the fire. After months of denials, State Farm agreed to pay for lead and asbestos testing because the remediation company cited federal worker safety regulations.",
      "It shouldn't have been that hard, he said.",
      "\"It feels like the insurance companies should have a playbook at this point,\" he said. \"They should have a process to keep people safe because this isn't the first disaster like this.\"",

      "Fine also said she wants to be transparent with customers about what is happening, rather than quietly inflating prices.",
      "\"The intention of adding the Trump tariff surcharge as a line item at checkout was to remind people that this is an extra tax on us. I wanted people to understand why it's more expensive \u2014 that it's because of political decisions that were made,\" she said.",

In a quarterly earnings call last month, a senior executive with U.S. chip maker Micron said some of its products would be subject to higher U.S. tariffs on Canada, Mexico and China and that it plans to \"pass those costs along to our customers.\"",
      "Honeywell Building Automation, which designs safety and efficiency systems for buildings, in early March announced new pricing related to fresh tariffs on China, Mexico and Canada. The company started applying a 6.4% \"tariff surcharge\" on its building management systems, excluding software and subscription services, saying the move was necessary \"to mitigate the impact of tariffs.\" Honeywell also said it would eliminate the extra duty \"as soon as such tariffs are no longer in force.\"",
      "Lemonade out of lemons",
      "Other companies are using the situation as a promotional tool. While it's true that consumers could eventually pay more if they wait to purchase furniture, electronics, automobiles and more, \"pre-tariff sales\" play into consumers' fear that prices could rise, and can be an effective way to boost sales, according to experts.",
      "\"The tariffs are injecting uncertainty into the marketplace and when there is high uncertainty, consumers tend to overestimate their losses, so they try to hedge their losses as much as possible in a very irrational way,\" Denish Shah, professor of marketing at Georgia State University's Robinson College of Business, told CBS MoneyWatch.",
      "And in times of market uncertainty, explains Denish, consumers are prone to panic-buying.",
      "\"They tend to stockpile necessities, fearing that tomorrow, suddenly, prices could go up. So they'll say, 'Let me try to accelerate all the purchases I can that I would have made anyway,'\" he said.",
      "That said, consumers' overarching goal, particularly after battling years of relentless inflation, is to save money. \"Consumers are very price-sensitive in this environment, so they are going to react very strongly to sales that companies are promoting,\" Shah added.",
      "The pre-tariff sales strategy is already working for some sellers, such as Burlap & Barrel, a spice company that imports single-origin spices from around the world. It sources ingredients from small farms in Guatemala, Iceland, India, Spain, Turkey, Vietnam and more. Over the weekend, the spice importer announced\u00a0a \"spring cleaning-turned-impromptu Tariff sale,\" marking down all products by 20%, through Tuesday.",
      "\"When we planned this sale, we thought it'd be a routine springtime promotion, but in the last few days it has turned into something very, very different,\" Burlap & Barrel wrote in a social media post. The company said that it's waiting to see how tariffs are applied to its products, but it's sure that they \"will be bad for our business,\" given that it cannot easily overhaul its supply chains.",
      "The company states that it is running the sale \"To show that we're serious about not raising our prices, and to finance another year or purchasing from smallholder farmers in the face of economic instability and political crisis.\"",
      "Another company, Freewrite, sent an email to customers on Friday urging them to buy its digital typewriters before it hikes prices on its China-made products next week due to the tariffs.",
      "\"Everyone, including our contract manufacturing partners, is helping us explore our options, but the truth is that it is incredibly difficult to move factories. It takes careful planning, huge expense and much more time than we have,\" Freewrite CEO Adam Leeb wrote in the email. \"On Monday, we will be raising prices. Not because we want to, but because we have to.\"",
      "Large chains are putting their own spin on tariff-related promotions. Furniture maker Raymour & Flanigan is urging customers to \"lock in pre-tariff pricing\" in a banner on its website. The company does not indicate what kind of price hikes it could implement in the future, though, as a result of the new levies.",

      "JPMorgan Chase CEO Jamie Dimon said the U.S. economy faces a critical stretch, while also warning of the ongoing uncertainty caused by President Trump's tariff policies.",
      "\"The economy is facing considerable turbulence (including geopolitics), with the potential positives of tax reform and deregulation and the potential negatives of tariffs and 'trade wars,' ongoing sticky inflation, high fiscal deficits and still rather high asset prices and volatility,\" he said Friday during the banking giant's first-quarter earnings call.",
      "Dimon told Wall Street analysts that JPMorgan expects tariffs to increase inflation roughly 0.5% this year. But he also expressed confidence that the Trump administration is eager to negotiate trade agreements with other countries, which would ease the strain on the economy.",
      "\"I would like to see the administration negotiate trade deals. I think that will be good for everybody, and they want to do it, too,\" he said.",
      "Dimon, considered the country's most influential banking leader, said earlier this week that U.S. tariffs could lead to higher inflation, weaker economic growth and potentially even a recession.",
      "\"Whether or not the menu of tariffs causes a recession remains in question, but it will slow down growth,\" he said in his annual shareholder letter Monday.",
      "Mr. Trump this week\u00a0paused most country-based tariffs\u00a0for 90 days \u2014 a move that came as CEOs and Wall Street investors publicly pressed the White House to reconsider its trade measures and as financial markets gave a resounding thumb's down to U.S. trade policies.",
      "After suspending the \"reciprocal\" tariffs, Mr. Trump said he had watched an interview with Dimon on Fox Business in which the banker said the tariffs would make a recession a \"likely outcome,\" according to Bloomberg.",
      "Billionaire hedge fund manager Bill Ackman, CEO of Pershing Square, also decried the tariffs this week,\u00a0saying\u00a0on social media Sunday that \"we are in the process of destroying confidence in our country as a trading partner, as a place to do business, and as a market to invest capital.\"",

    "published": "Fri, 11 Apr 2025 12:27:10 -0400",
    "summary": "Recent cuts eliminated a small, specialized workforce that sets the poverty standards determining who is eligible for Medicaid as well as assistance with food, home heating, child care, and more.",
    "story": [
      "President Donald Trump's firings at the Department of Health and Human Services included the entire office that sets federal poverty guidelines, which determine whether tens of millions of Americans are eligible for health programs such as Medicaid, food assistance, child care, and other services, former staff said.",
      "The small team, with technical data expertise, worked out of HHS' Office of the Assistant Secretary for Planning and Evaluation, or ASPE. Their dismissal mirrored others across HHS, which came without warning and left officials puzzled as to why they were \"RIF'ed\" \u2014 as in \"reduction in force,\" the bureaucratic language used to describe the firings.",
      "\"I suspect they RIF'ed offices that had the word 'data' or 'statistics' in them,\" said one of the laid-off employees, a social scientist whom KFF Health News agreed not to name because the person feared further recrimination. \"It was random, as far as we can tell.\"",
      "Among those fired was Kendall Swenson, who had led development of the poverty guidelines for many years and was considered the repository of knowledge on the issue, according to the social scientist and two academics who have worked with the HHS team.",
      "The sacking of the office could lead to cuts in assistance to low-income families next year unless the Trump administration restores the positions or moves its duties elsewhere, said Robin Ghertner, the fired director of the Division of Data and Technical Analysis, which had overseen the guidelines.",
      "The poverty guidelines are \"needed by many people and programs,\" said Timothy Smeeding, a professor emeritus of economics at the La Follette School of Public Affairs at the University of Wisconsin. \"If you're thinking of someone you fired who should be rehired, Swenson would be a no-brainer,\" he added.",
      "Under a 1981 appropriations bill, HHS is required annually to take Census Bureau poverty-line figures, adjust them for inflation, and create guidelines that agencies and states use to determine who is eligible for various types of help.",
      "There's a special sauce for creating the guidelines that includes adjustments and calculations, Ghertner said. Swenson and three other staff members would independently prepare the numbers and quality-check them together before they were issued each January.",
      "Everyone in Ghertner's office was told last week, without warning, that they were being put on administrative leave until June 1, when their employment would officially end, he said.",
      "\"There's literally no one in the government who knows how to calculate the guidelines,\" he said. \"And because we're all locked out of our computers, we can't teach anyone how to calculate them.\"",
      "ASPE had about 140 staff members and now has about 40, according to a former staffer. The HHS shake-up merged the office with the Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality, or AHRQ, whose staff has shrunk from 275 to about 80, according to a former AHRQ official who spoke on the condition of anonymity.",
      "HHS has said it laid off about 10,000 employees and that, combined with other moves, including a program to encourage early retirements, its workforce has been reduced by about 20,000. But the agency has not detailed where it made the cuts or identified specific employees it fired.",
      "\"These workers were told they couldn't come into their offices so there's no transfer of knowledge,\" said Wendell Primus, who worked at ASPE during the Bill Clinton administration. \"They had no time to train anyone, transfer data, etc.\"",
      "HHS defended the firings. The department merged AHRQ and ASPE \"as part of Secretary Kennedy's vision to streamline HHS to better serve Americans,\"\u00a0 spokesperson Emily Hilliard said. \"Critical programs within ASPE will continue in this new office\" and \"HHS will continue to comply with statutory requirements,\" she said in a written response to KFF Health News.",
      "After this article published, HHS spokesperson Andrew Nixon called KFF Health News to say others at HHS could do the work of the RIF'ed data analysis team, which had nine members. \"The idea that this will come to a halt is totally incorrect,\" he said. \"Eighty million people will not be affected.\"",
      "Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. has so far declined to testify about the staff reductions before congressional committees that oversee much of his agency. On April 9, a delegation of 10 Democratic members of Congress waited fruitlessly for a meeting in the agency's lobby.",
      "The group was led by House Energy and Commerce health subcommittee ranking member Diana DeGette (D-Colo.), who told reporters afterward that Kennedy must appear before the committee \"and tell us what his plan is for keeping America healthy and for stopping these devastating cuts.\"",
      "Matt VanHyfte, a spokesperson for the Republican committee leadership, said HHS officials would meet with bipartisan committee staff on April 11 to discuss the firings and other policy issues.",
      "ASPE serves as a think tank for the HHS secretary, said Primus, who later was Rep. Nancy Pelosi's senior health policy adviser for 18 years. In addition to the poverty guidelines, the office maps out how much Medicaid money goes to each state and reviews all regulations developed by HHS agencies.",
      "\"These HHS staffing cuts \u2014 20,000 \u2014 obviously they are completely nuts,\" Primus said. \"These were not decisions made by Kennedy or staff at HHS. They are being made at the White House. There's no rhyme or reasons to what they're doing.\"",
      "HHS leaders may be unaware of their legal duty to issue the poverty guidelines, Ghertner said. If each state and federal government agency instead sets guidelines on its own, it could create inequities and lead to lawsuits, he said.",
      "And sticking with the 2025 standard next year could put benefits for hundreds of thousands of Americans at risk, Ghertner said. The current poverty level is $15,650 for a single person and $32,150 for a family of four.",
      "\"If you make $30,000 and have three kids, say, and next year you make $31,000 but prices have gone up 7%, suddenly your $31,000 doesn't buy you the same,\" he said, \"but if the guidelines haven't increased, you might be no longer eligible for Medicaid.\"",
      "The 2025 poverty level for a family of five is $37,650.",
      "As of October, about 79 million people were enrolled in Medicaid or the related Children's Health Insurance Program, both of which are means-tested and thus depend on the poverty guidelines to determine eligibility.",
      "Eligibility for premium subsidies for insurance plans sold in Affordable Care Act marketplaces is also tied to the official poverty level.",
      "One in eight Americans rely on the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program, or food stamps, and 40% of newborns and their mothers receive food through the Women, Infants, and Children program, both of which also use the federal poverty level to determine eligibility.",
      "Former employees in the office said they were not disloyal to the president. They knew their jobs required them to follow the administration's objectives. \"We were trying to support the MAHA agenda,\" the social scientist said, referring to Kennedy's \"Make America Healthy Again\" rubric. \"Even if it didn't align with our personal worldviews, we wanted to be useful.\"",

    "summary": "A new breed of veterinary clinic is changing how pets \u2014 and their owners \u2014 are treated. \"I'd rather see four pets a day,\" one vet said.",
    "story": [
      "When Kathleen Whitman's daughter's Bernadoodle, Cody, swallowed a Kong toy, the family faced a veterinary emergency requiring immediate surgery.",
      "X-rays at their local suburban clinic suggested what looked like a hair tie tangled in Cody's intestines. When referred to a corporate emergency hospital, the family was quoted $10,000 for the procedure.",
      "\"They literally told me in the waiting room with a clipboard, thinking I was just coming in and we were doing $10,000,\" Whitman said. \"I said, 'No, I'm just coming in to hear the price.\"",
      "Desperate for an alternative, Whitman reached out to Vetique, a boutique veterinary clinic in Chicago's Gold Coast neighborhood. There, Dr. Jessica Trice and Dr. Jennifer Remnes performed the surgery for what Whitman called \"an appropriate fee\" that was significantly less than $10,000.",
      "During the surgery, she and her daughter waited in the clinic's lobby with glasses of Prosecco while receiving regular updates.",
      "\"The humans were taken care of just as much as the puppy in distress was,\" Whitman said.",
      "This experience mirrors what many pet owners report when comparing corporate-owned emergency animal hospitals to independent practices. Kara Adams, whose 16-year-old rescue dog Shadow needed emergency eye surgery, also chose Vetique over corporate alternatives.",
      "When Adams called Vetique explaining she had only $1,000 available, staff accommodated her financial constraints.",
      "\"The planning manager came out with a payment plan for me,\" Adams said. \"I was crying because otherwise, what would I do? I didn't have any other options.\"",
      "\"You literally burn people out\"",
      "Drs. Trice and Remnes founded Vetique after witnessing firsthand how corporate consolidation was transforming veterinary medicine \u2014 often for the worse.",
      "\"Just coming from a corporation for many years, the whole thing is about quantity, getting all those pets,\" Trice explained after spending 10 years at Banfield Pet Hospital, followed by five years as a medical director at VCA Animal Hospitals. \"We feel the best way is not pushing about the number of quantity, because it gets very sloppy and you lose that interaction and relationship with the clients.\"",
      "Remnes' experience echoed her partner's concerns. At Banfield as a new graduate, she found herself overwhelmed by volume demands.",
      "\"As a new grad, you're still learning and trying to break into this brand-new world. I was seeing like 30 pets a day,\" Remnes said.",
      "She later moved to VCA before its Mars acquisition, initially enjoying the autonomy because \"each hospital was able to operate as they liked to.\" After the corporate takeover, however, the pressure intensified.",
      "\"It was like, 'Oh, you need to see this number of pets, or we're decreasing your salary.' That's what's burning out the industry,\" Remnes said. \"You literally burn people out doing that. You can't possibly offer your best when you're crammed with all of these patients.\"",
      "These pressures contribute to a profession in crisis. A 2024 study in the Journal of the American Veterinary Medical Association found that U.S. veterinarians are more likely to experience serious mental health struggles than most people.",
      "\"We have forums on Facebook where our industry has one of the highest suicide rates,\" Remnes noted. \"It's because of things like this, when you're given spreadsheets and quotas rather than focusing on patient care.\"",
      "Their solution was to create a different business model. Instead of maximizing patient volume, Vetique prioritizes extended appointment times and a calming environment with luxury touches like sparkling epoxy floors, examination tables with faux fur coverings and exam rooms named after the founders' pets.",
      "\"I'd rather see four pets a day. That meant that family was getting my full attention, that pet was getting everything that I do,\" Remnes explained.",
      "Alongside traditional veterinary medicine, Trice offers acupuncture, herbal remedies and chiropractic treatments \u2014 holistic approaches she had wanted to pursue at corporate practices but was discouraged from using.",
      "Surging pet care prices",
      "Setting prices at Vetique involves balancing fair market rates with the clinic's added value. What Remnes found surprising was how significantly corporate prices have increased in recent years. \"Prices are so drastically different from when I was at VCA seven years ago. They're charging actually close to what we're charging as a general practice for an exam,\" she noted.",
      "This observation led her to reconsider Vetique's own pricing strategy.",
      "\"It's like, 'Well, we can actually probably charge more, because we offer all these experiences along with it.' It's trying to find a happy medium, trying to be fair, but also knowing our value.\"",
      "Despite the appeal of the boutique model, both Remnes and Trice acknowledge significant business challenges. The clinic is in its third year of operation, still within the typical three-to-five-year window before seeing substantial returns. Unlike corporate-backed veterinary chains, Vetique is entirely funded through a bank loan.",
      "Vetique's founders see their clinic not as a competitor to corporate chains but as an alternative model for the industry. \"We're not competing,\" Trice said. \"We're creating a new veterinary culture.\"",
      "Corporate giants reshape vet landscape",
      "John Volk, senior consultant with Brakke Consulting, said veterinary practices historically grow 4-5% annually and carry minimal accounts receivable, making them attractive to investors.",
      "\"Pet care in general is very attractive to the financial community,\" Volk said. \"It's a very steady growth industry, and it's a cash business, so they carry very little accounts receivable because pet owners pay for their services at time of service.\"",
      "Mars Inc., best known for candy brands like M&M's and Snickers, has quietly become the largest owner of veterinary hospitals in the U.S. through a series of major acquisitions.",
      "The privately held company owns three of the nation's largest veterinary chains: Banfield Pet Hospital, VCA Animal Hospitals, and BluePearl Specialty and Emergency Pet Hospital \u2014 giving it control of more than 2,000 clinics across North America.",
      "Mars entered the pet care industry in 2007 by acquiring Banfield, which primarily operates inside PetSmart locations. In 2017, it significantly expanded its footprint by purchasing VCA for $9.1 billion \u2014 one of the largest acquisitions in veterinary history,\u00a0according to the American Veterinary Medical Association.",
      "VCA operates more than 900 hospitals in the U.S. and Canada, while Banfield has over 1,000 clinics nationwide. Unlike VCA, which grew by acquiring independent practices, Banfield has mostly launched new locations within retail stores.",
      "Mars's scale allows for standardized protocols, shared technology platforms and subscription-based wellness plans across its network. According to the company website, Mars Veterinary Health serves more than 25 million pets annually.",
      "While private equity firms have been acquiring veterinary practices since the late 1980s, the trend has accelerated significantly over the past 15 years. Volk estimates approximately 30% of veterinary practices are now corporate-owned.",
      "Despite the growth in corporate ownership, Volk sees no evidence that care quality differs significantly between corporate and independent practices.",
      "\"I've not seen any data to suggest that the services provided by corporately owned practices are materially different than services provided by independently owned practices,\" he said.",
      "However, some policymakers have raised concerns about the impact of consolidation on pricing. In January 2023, Sen. Elizabeth Warren, a Democrat from Massachusetts, specifically called out Mars Veterinary Health and other large veterinary corporations in a letter to the Federal Trade Commission. Warren cited \"troubling reports of anti-competitive consolidation\" and suggested these corporate entities were using market power to \"raise prices for consumers and lower wages for veterinarians.\"",
      "Even as consolidation continues, Volk finds that independent practices remain viable. \"If you have a DVM degree and don't have a bad personal history, you can get money to buy or start a practice,\" he said. \"Veterinarians are one of the lowest-risk borrowers of any category.\"",
      "For new veterinarians, the industry offers growing opportunities. The American Veterinary Medical Association reports the average starting salary in companion animal medicine reached approximately $137,000 in 2024.",
      "Design, investment, and a human touch",
      "When clients walk into a Bond Vet clinic, they won't find the sterile environment or cluttered waiting rooms traditionally associated with veterinary offices. Instead, they'll encounter soft pastel colors, comfortable seating and an atmosphere deliberately designed to feel more like a high-end hospitality experience than a medical facility.",
      "\"The industry has two categories of clinics historically \u2014 many designed very clinical, cold and sterile, and then others called mom and pop, which could be cluttered or dirty,\" said Garrett Lewis, CEO of Bond Vet. \"The question is how to solve both problems.\"",
      "That solution \u2013 creating premium veterinary experiences with transparent pricing and greater accessibility \u2013 has attracted significant private equity investment.",
      "While these premium services might suggest significantly higher costs, Lewis emphasizes transparency in Bond Vet's pricing model. \"When someone comes in, you can look at the laptop and see exactly what the pricing is,\" he said. \"Our prices are just a little bit above average, but the experience is what differentiates us.\"",
      "This transparency extends to digital platforms, where clients can check prices online or via text before visiting. During appointments, veterinarians show pricing information directly to clients on laptops, allowing for discussion about options.",
      "Bond Vet, backed by a $170 million investment from Warburg Pincus, has expanded to 57 locations across the Northeast and Midwest since its founding in 2019. The company was inspired by human-focused healthcare models like One Medical, focusing on convenience, design, and a better experience for both pets and owners.",
      "\"They saw the same issue, which was that the industry wasn't serving clients and pets at a much higher level,\" Lewis said of Bond Vet's founders, who included a veterinarian and her husband. \"They quickly found it was very different to change culture and design in existing practices, so they rebooted from the ground up.\"",
      "Bond Vet's approach represents a broader trend in veterinary medicine, where traditional practices are being reinvented with a focus on client experience alongside medical care.",
      "Bond Vet's model bridges the gap between traditional veterinary practices and emergency hospitals, offering urgent care alongside preventative services \u2013 all with a hospitality-focused approach.",
      "\"In the 90s, if you needed sick care, your veterinarian would say, 'Come on in.' If you needed preventive care, they'd say, 'Come on in,'\" Lewis explained. \"What happened in the 2000s is a lot of specialization occurred where practices became just preventative and started referring out anything that looked urgent or sick.\"",
      "Bond Vet handles non-emergency urgent cases that might otherwise end up in expensive emergency rooms. \"ER practices see about 40% of their volume as urgent rather than emergent cases. Clients go to ER and spend twice as much, often having to wait longer,\" Lewis noted.",
      "These clinics feature design elements specifically created to reduce stress for pets \u2014 an approach that appears to be working. \"I always see dogs dragging their owners into the clinic, which is not a common thing,\" Lewis said.",
      "The \"no walls\" philosophy breaking ground",
      "Imagine walking into a veterinary emergency room and instead of being separated from your pet during a crisis, you're welcomed directly onto the treatment floor. At  VEG ER for Pets, this isn't just possible \u2014 it's mandatory.",
      "\"We built an entire business around it,\" said Dr. David Bessler, founder and CEO of VEG ER for Pets. \"It's much easier doing something 100% of the time than trying to do it 90% of the time.\"",
      "With 102 locations across 28 states, VEG ER for Pets represents an approach to emergency veterinary medicine that stands apart from both traditional practices and newer primary care models.",
      "Unlike other veterinary innovators that blend primary and urgent care, VEG ER for Pets focuses exclusively on emergency medicine \u2013 a deliberate strategy that Bessler calls \"a bit of a crazy bet.\"",
      "\"We took the hardest part of an industry, emergency, and created an entire business around that,\" said David Glattstein, co-founder and president of VEG ER for Pets. \"It's hard to make money, it's hard to get the team, it's hard to recruit, it's hard to train.\"",
      "VEG ER for Pets' most distinctive feature is its commitment to keeping pets with their owners throughout the entire treatment process, even during emergencies \u2014 an approach not found in traditional emergency hospitals, where pets are typically treated in back rooms away from owners.",
      "This transparency extends to the physical design of newer hospitals, which have eliminated traditional waiting rooms entirely. \"Our newer hospitals don't even have a lobby,\" Glattstein explained. \"You literally walk in and you're in the middle of the treatment floor.\"",
      "In a notable departure from many veterinary innovators, VEG ER for Pets has achieved financial independence from its initial investors and now funds its expansion through its own operations.",
      "\"VEG ER for Pets is now independently able to do that,\" Glattstein stated. \"We don't need anyone else to advocate for us or to pay for us. We're not beholden to anybody. We're beholden to our customers, and we're beholden to our veggies.\"",
      "This independence allows the company to maintain its distinctive approach while continuing to open 25-30 new locations annually.",
      "The company's exclusive focus on emergency care, while limiting in some ways, has allowed it to \"crack the code\" on veterinary emergencies according to Glattstein. \"We've kind of cracked the code on one way of doing things in emergency that results in a better experience for all of the souls that are there experiencing that at the same time.\"",

      "\"The U.S.' arbitrary imposition of abnormally high tariffs on China seriously violates international economic and trade rules, disregards the post-World War II global economic order built by the U.S. itself, and violates basic economic laws and common sense,\"\u00a0a statement put out by China's Finance Ministry announcing the tariffs said.",
      "The statement called rising U.S. tariffs \"a joke\" and said it would not respond to future U.S. tariff hikes.",
      "\"If the U.S. continues to impose higher tariffs, it will no longer make economic sense and will become a joke in the history of world economy,\" China's statement said. \"At the current tariff level, there is no market acceptance for U.S. goods exported to China. If the U.S. continues to play the tariff numbers game, China will ignore it. However, if the U.S. insists on continuing to substantially infringe on China's interests, China will resolutely counterattack and fight to the end.\"",

The move followed a five-day plunge in U.S. and global financial markets, with investors sending a clear message to the White House about their concerns over the direction of American trade policy.",
      "Market analysts said Mr. Trump's decision this week to suspend most of the tariffs suggests he is willing to negotiate. But lowering the temperature with Beijing is likely to face obstacles given the escalating trade war between the two countries.",
      "\"The fact that China keeps retaliating in kind suggests that its leadership is less eager to settle,\" analysts with investment advisory firm Capital Economics told investors in a research note on Friday after China's move to up tariffs on the U.S. \"They would probably agree to a symmetrical rollback in exchange for something costless, like starting talks. But we aren't convinced that negotiations toward a more substantive deal would ultimately amount to much, given the deep mutual distrust and wider geopolitical forces pushing the two countries apart.\"",

      "The Fed has put the brakes on interest rate cuts this year due to sticky inflation, which has remained higher than its target growth rate of 2% per year.",
      "In the meantime, Mr. Trump has introduced a series of tariffs on major trading partners that economists say could reignite inflation. Powell highlighted those risks on Wednesday in saying that the Trump administration tariffs could create a \"challenging scenario\" for the U.S. that requires both managing both accelerating inflation and a slowing economy.",
      "Those types of conditions describe \"stagflation,\" a mashup of \"stagnation\" and \"inflation\" that describes periods when economic growth falters while price hikes accelerate.",

      "The president said he and Meloni discussed trade and \"many, many things\" in their first meeting of the day. But it's unclear how much progress Mr. Trump and Meloni made in discussing any sort of trade deal.",

      "Von der Leyen herself has not yet been granted a meeting with Mr. Trump, despite repeated requests. Meloni's sit-down at the White House will be the first with any European leader since the administration announced its tariffs on virtually every nation with which the U.S. conducts trade at the beginning of April. The EU was hit with a blanket 20% tariff rate on all exports to the U.S. with that announcement, though Mr. Trump put those higher rates on hold for 90 days about a week later, as global stock markets reeled, leaving a 10% universal rate in place.",
      "Meloni has gently chided the sweeping tariffs on the EU as \"wrong,\" but she's been one of the voices urging the continental bloc not to impose retaliatory measures, insisting that a calm response focused on negotiations would bring a more constructive resolution.",
      "The White House claims dozens of counties have come forward seeking to negotiate new trade agreements with the U.S., with Mr. Trump boasting that leaders were calling him and \"kissing my ass,\" begging to strike deals to avoid the reimposition of the higher levies.",
      "\"We know we're going through a difficult period, let's see how it goes in the coming hours. I am feeling no pressure, as you can imagine, for my next two days,\" Meloni said with a note of clear irony at an awards ceremony two days before her White House meeting. \"I am aware of what I represent, and I am aware of what I am defending.\"",
      "Not all European politicians were so sanguine about the potential outcome of the Trump-Meloni meeting, however.\u00a0 Italian opposition politician Carlo Calenda said, \"the most important thing is that Meloni does not allow herself to be used by Trump to split the European front.\"",

    "summary": "The Supreme Court will hear arguments on May 15 on a Trump administration request to partially enforce the president's executive order that seeks to end birthright citizenship.",
    "story": [
      "Washington \u2014 The Supreme Court on Thursday said that it will hear oral arguments next month over whether the Trump administration can partially enforce an executive order that seeks to end birthright citizenship while proceedings in a challenge to the directive move forward.",
      "The court said in an unsigned order that arguments on the Justice Department's request for emergency relief will take place during a special sitting on May 15. The administration has asked the Supreme Court to limit the scope of three separate injunctions that blocked implementation of President Trump's order nationwide.",
      "If the high court decides to grant the Justice Department's request, it would prevent the administration from enforcing Mr. Trump's birthright citizenship order only against the plaintiffs in the ongoing cases: seven individuals, specific members of immigrants' rights groups and residents of 22 states.",
      "The dispute over the president's attempt to unwind birthright citizenship is the latest in which the Supreme Court has been asked to intervene, with more requests expected. More than 100 cases that seek to knock down Mr. Trump's second-term policies have been filed since he returned to the White House in late January, and several have already made their way to the high court.",
      "The president's executive order on birthright citizenship was one of the first that he signed on his first day back in office and is among several directives that seek to target migrants who are in the U.S. unlawfully. The Trump administration's immigration policies have led to high-profile clashes with the courts \u2014 namely Mr. Trump's use of the wartime Alien Enemies Act to deport alleged members of a Venezuelan gang and the administration's mistaken removal of a Maryland man in the U.S. unlawfully to El Salvador.",
      "While the 14th Amendment has for more than a century been understood to guarantee citizenship to all people born in the U.S., Mr. Trump's order denied birthright citizenship to children born to a mother who is unlawfully present in the U.S. or who is lawfully present on a temporary basis; or whose father is neither a citizen nor lawful permanent resident.",
      "The president's order directed federal agencies to stop issuing documents recognizing U.S. citizenship to children born after Feb. 19.",
      "More than half-dozen lawsuits challenging the measure were filed in courts throughout the country before it took effect, and three federal district courts in Washington, Maryland and Massachusetts each blocked the government from implementing the birthright citizenship order.",
      "Federal appeals courts in San Francisco, Boston and Richmond, Virginia, then refused requests by the Trump administration to partly block the lower court orders.",
      "The Justice Department filed emergency appeals of the three decisions with the Supreme Court in mid-March and asked it to limit enforcement of the birthright citizenship order to 28 states and individuals who are not involved in the ongoing cases. Then-acting Solicitor General Sarah Harris said that a minimum, the Supreme Court should allow agencies to develop and issue public guidance regarding implementation of Mr. Trump's executive order while proceedings continue.",
      "Like other requests made to the Supreme Court, Harris took aim at the breadth of the injunctions issued by the district courts, which are nationwide in scope and cover states and individuals who are not involved in the litigation before them.",
      "The president and his allies have attacked judges for issuing nationwide injunctions in the slew of legal challenges to Mr. Trump's policies, and even called for some to be impeached.",
      "\"Universal injunctions have reached epidemic proportions since the start of the current administration,\" Harris wrote. \"Courts have graduated from universal preliminary injunctions to universal temporary restraining orders, from universal equitable relief to universal monetary remedies, and from governing the whole nation to governing the whole world.\"",
      "She argued that nationwide, or universal, injunctions prevent the executive branch from carrying out its work and impede Mr. Trump's ability to address what he says is a \"crisis\" at the U.S.-Mexico border.",
      "\"The district courts' universal injunctions threaten to perpetuate those problems by holding out a nationwide incentive for illegal immigration: the prospect of American citizenship for the unlawful migrants' children and of derivative immigration benefits for the migrants themselves,\" Harris wrote.",
      "But the challengers urged the Supreme Court to leave the district court orders untouched.",
      "In a filing with the Supreme Court, officials from 18 states, the District of Columbia and San Francisco called the Trump administration's request \"remarkable,\" as it would allow the government to strip hundreds of thousands of American-born children of their citizenship while the legal challenges move forward and render them \"deportable on birth and at risk of statelessness.",
      "The states argued that the Justice Department is seeking to violate binding Supreme Court precedent that recognized that birthright citizenship is guaranteed by the 14th Amendment.",
      "Two immigrants' rights groups, CASA Inc and the Asylum Seeker Advocacy Project, refuted the suggestion by the government that it needs emergency relief.",
      "\"The Executive Branch has been complying with the settled interpretation of the Citizenship Clause for 125 years, and the government has demonstrated no urgent need to change now,\"\u00a0 they wrote in a filing.",
      "The groups also noted that with more than 800,000 members across all 50 states, \"nationwide consistency\" is important in the context of U.S. citizenship.",
      "\"Whether a child is a citizen of our nation should not depend on the state where she is born or the associations her parents have joined,\" lawyers for the groups said.",

    "story": [
      "After nearly 11 hours of debate, the Texas House approved early Thursday a controversial bill that would provide eligible families with public funds to help pay for private school tuition.",
      "The school choice bill was passed in an 85-63 vote \u2013 two were absent. The measure will provide taxpayer-funded education savings accounts, also known as school vouchers, allowing students in public schools to attend private institutions if accepted into the state's program.",
      "Eligibility for Texas school vouchers and funds allocation",
      "Under the bill,\u00a0students will receive $10,000 each year\u00a0if they attend a private school. Disabled students would receive up to $30,000 a year and home-schooled students would get $2,000.",
      "\"This is an extraordinary victory for the thousands of parents who have advocated for more choices when it comes to the education of their children\u2026I applaud the legislators who took a stand with the overwhelming majority of Texans who support school choice,\" Texas Gov. Greg Abbott said.",
      "Abbott and Texas House Speaker Dustin Burrows have said for months that they have more than the 76 votes required to pass the bill.",
      "\"Today marks a historic chapter for education in our state, with the Texas House passing its landmark 'Texas Two Step' proposals to deliver more education opportunities for students alongside the largest-ever increase in public school funding,\" Burrows said.",
      "The vote marks the first time since 1957 that the Texas House has approved legislation making state money available for families to use on their children's private schooling, according to the Texas Tribune.",
      "The vote took place just after 2 a.m. Thursday, after the Texas House heard 43 amendment proposals to the bill. All proposed amendments were tabled. The vote was divided between Democrats and Republicans. Out of all the votes, two Republicans joined all Democrats to vote against the bill.",
      "\"Welfare for the rich\"",
      "Texas Democrats expressed disappointment about the outcome, calling it \"welfare for the rich.\" Democrats also expressed concern that the program will hurt school districts by taking money away from them.",
      "Most state Republicans supported the legislation.",
      "\"Working families are going to be the ones who will foot the bill for this voucher scam,\" said Texas Democrats Chair Kendall Scudder. \"We're deeply disappointed in the lawmakers who chose to fall in line instead of standing up for their communities.\"",
      "The House will take a final vote later on Thursday. The bill will then go to the Texas Senate, where lawmakers will decide whether to go along with the House's changes or make their own changes.",
      "Trump weighs in",
      "Ahead of the vote, Abbott said that President Trump supported school choice as well.",
      "\"[Trump] called this morning to share his support for the Texas House passing SB 2 today,\" Abbott posted on social media.",
      "Mr. Trump posted on social media on Thursday congratulating his \"friends\" Abbott, Burrows and Lt. Gov. Dan Patrick \"along with Texas Legislators for finally passing SCHOOL CHOICE, which I strongly endorsed.\"",
      "\"This is a gigantic Victory for students and parents in the Great State of Texas!\" Mr. Trump wrote. \"We will very soon be sending Education BACK TO ALL THE STATES, where it belongs. It is our goal to bring Education in the United States to the highest level, one that it has never attained before.\"",
      "HB 2: Public school funding bill",
      "On Wednesday, the Texas House passed HB 2, the public school funding bill. It passed 144-4, with two absent. Republican leaders said it represents the largest increase in funding for public schools.",
      "\"Texas public schools are the backbone of our communities, and today the House delivered a historic investment to bolster public education for the next generation,\" Burrows said Wednesday. \"House Bill 2 lays the foundation for a modernized, responsive school finance system that will grow with the needs of Texas students while targeting taxpayer dollars where they'll make the greatest impact for students and teachers.",
      "Under this bill's proposals and others, the House will inject $9 billion in new money. That includes raising the basic allotment to school districts by $395. Forty percent of the new funding will go toward teacher pay raises and salary increases for other staff. The basic allotment would increase every two years.",
      "Democrats have said the state doesn't spend enough money on public education when compared to other states. Republicans, though, said they have continued to spend more money on schools.",
      "As lawmakers debate the bills, various local school districts across North Texas have passed deficit budgets because of record inflation and after Republican lawmakers left $4.5 billion for schools on the sidelines. The districts have also faced declining student enrollment, which has cost them funding as well.",

      "At the time, the judge in the case ordered Abrego Garcia not to contact Vasquez, vacate their home, and stay away from the home of another family member. He was also ordered to surrender firearms.",
      "The case, however, was dismissed in June 2021 after Vasquez failed to appear for a final hearing, according to court records. The two returned to living together.",

      "\"After surviving domestic violence in a previous relationship, I acted out of caution after a disagreement with Kilmar by seeking a civil protective order in case things escalated,\" Vasquez said. \"Things did not escalate, and I decided not to follow through with the civil court process. We were able to work through this situation privately as a family, including by going to counseling. Our marriage only grew stronger in the years that followed. No one is perfect, and no marriage is perfect. That is not a justification for ICE's action of abducting him and deporting him to a country where he was supposed to be protected from deportation. Kilmar has always been a loving partner and father, and I will continue to stand by him and demand justice for him.\"",

Another federal judge who had ordered the three flights to El Salvador be turned around\u00a0found Wednesday\u00a0that there was probable cause to hold the Trump administration in criminal contempt for defying his orders.",

      "Abrego Garcia came to the U.S. illegally in 2011 when he was 16 years old.",
      "In 2019, he was arrested by Immigration and Customs Enforcement, but an immigration judge barred his removal from the U.S. after determining that he could face persecution by gangs if deported to El Salvador. The judge granted him what is known as \"withholding of removal\" status.",

      "Last year, he wrote: \"It is a precarious time for people of religious faith in America. It has been described as a post-Christian age.

    "story": [
      "A government memo obtained by CBS News shows the Trump administration created broad rules outlining which migrants can be held at Guantanamo Bay, allowing officials to send non-criminal detainees there despite a vow to hold \"the worst\" offenders at the naval base.",
      "As part of his aggressive crackdown on immigration, President Trump in late January directed officials to convert facilities inside the U.S. Naval Base at Guantanamo Bay, Cuba, into holding sites for migrants living in the country illegally. At the time, Mr. Trump said \"the worst\" migrants would be held at the base, directing officials to make space for \"high-priority criminal aliens.\"",
      "But a previously undisclosed agreement between the Department of Homeland Security and the Department of Defense indicates that the Trump administration gave officials wide-ranging discretion to decide who to send to Guantanamo Bay, enacting criteria not predicated on the severity of detainees' criminal history or conduct. In fact, the memo does not mention any criminality assessment. [Read the full memo at the bottom of this story.]",
      "Instead, the agreement, signed on March 7 by top DHS and Pentagon officials, says the departments agreed to use the Guantanamo base to detain migrants with final deportation orders who have \"a nexus to a transnational criminal organization (TCO) or criminal drug activity.\"",
      "Officials defined \"nexus\" in broad terms. A nexus can be satisfied, the memo says, if migrants with final deportation orders are part of a transnational criminal group or if they paid one \"to be smuggled into the United States.\" The latter condition could be used to describe many of the migrants and asylum-seekers who have illegally crossed the U.S. southern border, as criminal groups in Mexico largely control the illicit movement of people and drugs there.",
      "Migrants who overstayed a visa are not eligible to be sent to Guantanamo Bay, the document says. But if the nature of a migrant's entry is unclear, the memo allows officials to assume that the person paid a criminal group to enter the U.S. and to send them to Guantanamo if they hail from a nation \"where the preponderance of aliens from that country enter the United States in that fashion.\"",
      "The conditions for transferring migrants to Guantanamo, as outlined in the memo, seem to be at odds with statements by Mr. Trump and high-ranking members of his administration that have suggested the base would be used as a detention site for dangerous criminals.",
      "Theresa Cardinal Brown, a former U.S. immigration official during the administrations of Presidents George W. Bush and Barack Obama, said the memo's rules \"apply very broadly to any immigrant who came to the U.S. via the U.S.-Mexico border.\"",
      "\"It's very well known that almost every immigrant who makes it to the U.S.-Mexico border would have to pay some sort of money to the cartels that control the territory on the Mexican side, directly or indirectly,\" she said.",
      "Cardinal Brown added that the rules do not appear to include \"any individualized assessment\" to determine whether migrant detainees pose a threat, before transferring them to Guantanamo.",
      "Department of Defense spokeswoman Kingsley Wilson confirmed the existence of the memo, saying it \"strengthens DoD and DHS collaboration by clarifying roles and responsibilities, and fostering efficient and coordinated operations at Naval Station Guantanamo Bay.\"",
      "CBS News reached out to DHS representatives for comment.",
      "The Guantanamo operation is not the only Trump administration immigration effort to face scrutiny over who exactly has been targeted. In mid-March, for example, the administration deported 238 Venezuelans to El Salvador, so they could be imprisoned inside that country's infamous mega-prison. The Trump administration said they were all criminals and gang members, but a \"60 Minutes\" investigation did not find a criminal record for 75% of the Venezuelan deportees.",
      "A high-profile yet largely secretive operation",
      "The Trump administration first began sending migrants to Guantanamo in February, initially only transferring Venezuelans there, including men it accused of having ties to the Tren de Aragua prison gang. The first group of Venezuelan detainees was eventually flown to Honduras, where the Venezuelan government picked them up so they could be transported back to their homeland.",
      "Since then, the administration has sporadically flown migrants from different countries to the base, before transferring them back to the U.S. or other nations. Administration officials have regularly touted the flights to Guantanamo but have provided limited details about the operation, including on costs and who is eligible to be sent to the base.",
      "What has been publicly revealed, by CBS News and other media outlets, is that officials have transferred both detainees considered to be \"high-threat\" and \"low-risk\" to Guantanamo, including migrants whose relatives have denied allegations of gang membership and criminality.",
      "Government guidelines define migrant detainees as posing a \"high\" threat if they have violent or serious criminal records, histories of disruptive conduct or alleged gang ties. Low-risk detainees are defined as migrants who face deportation because they are in the U.S. illegally but who lack any serious criminal record \u2014 or any at all.",
      "Those sent to Guantanamo and considered to be \"high-threat\" migrants have been held at Camp VI, a section of the post-9/11 prison that still houses roughly a dozen terrorism suspects. Migrant detainees deemed to pose a \"low\" risk have been transferred to the base's Migrant Operations Center, a barrack-like facility that has historically housed asylum-seekers intercepted at sea.",
      "Wilson, the Department of Defense spokeswoman, said there are currently 42 migrants detained at Guantanamo, 32 of them housed at the Migrant Operations Center and 10 so-called \"high-threat\" detainees held at Camp VI.",
      "The March 7 memo obtained by CBS News sheds light on other aspects of operations at Guantanamo. For example, it confirms the migrant detainees transported there remain in the legal custody of Immigration and Customs Enforcement, even though the military is providing access to its facilities to detain them.",
      "As part of the agreement, DHS also accepted the conditions at Camp VI and the Migrant Operations Center as adequate to hold migrant adults, noting it would not transfer children to the base. The department agreed to send ICE officers or contractors to the base, including to oversee security at the Migrant Operations Center.",
      "The memo makes DHS responsible for providing detainees services like recreation and religious accommodations; determining whether migrants get access to lawyers; and administering \"involuntary medical treatment,\" such as force-feeding during hunger strikes.",
      "The agreement also charges DHS with overseeing the transfer of detainees from and to Guantanamo, requiring the department to relocate migrants from the base no more than 180 days after their deportation orders are issued.",
      "The military, as stipulated by the agreement, is principally responsible for providing security at Camp VI and in the perimeter of the facilities. It also agreed to provide toilets and hygiene facilities, as well as medical care to both ICE personnel and detained migrants.",
      "The memo says the Department of Defense committed to erect tents at the base to hold additional detainees, though those sites have not been used to detain migrants yet. The agreement notes, however, that those tents \"do not have power, lighting, or heating/air conditioning.\"",
      "The effort to hold migrants at Guantanamo faces legal challenges by advocates, including at the American Civil Liberties Union, the Trump administration's chief adversary in federal court.",
      "The ACLU alleged in court filings that migrants were initially held incommunicado at Guantanamo, without access to relatives or lawyers. The administration subsequently said it took steps to give migrant detainees access to lawyers.",
      "The ACLU has also described detention conditions at Guantanamo as deplorable, citing declarations from migrants held there. In one of those declarations, a Venezuelan man previously held at the base said he went on a hunger strike after feeling he had been \"kidnapped.\"",
      "White House deputy chief of staff Stephen Miller, the lead architect of the Trump administration's immigration agenda, said earlier this week there are no plans to stop using Guantanamo to detain migrants.",

    "story": [
      "California Gov. Gavin Newsom said Wednesday his state will file a lawsuit challenging President Trump's authority to impose sweeping tariffs that have set off a global trade war.",
      "The suit will argue Mr. Trump's use of the International Emergency Economic Powers Act to impose tariffs on Mexico, Canada and China or a 10% tariff on all imports is unlawful. The act enables a president to freeze and block transactions in response to foreign threats.",
      "The lawsuit, which will be filed in the U.S. District Court for the Northern District of California, will argue that enacting such tariffs requires approval from Congress, Newsom's office said in a news release.",
      "\"No other state will be more impacted by the impacts of this,\" Newsom said at a Wednesday press conference alongside California Attorney General Rob Bonta in the Central Valley.",
      "\"Already, vendors have warned us that they're going to pass the costs of Trump's tariffs onto the state of California,\" Bonta said.",
      "Bonta and Newsom noted that the lawsuit will be the 14th in less than 14 weeks that California has filed against the Trump administration.",
      "\"We're asking the court to rein in the president,\" Bonta said.",
      "Mr. Trump has offered many justifications for increasing tariffs, including that they are designed to spur U.S. manufacturing and stop the flow of illicit fentanyl into the country. California's move follows rapidly changing tariff plans by the Trump administration. The government briefly imposed steep \"reciprocal\" tariffs on dozens of countries\u00a0last week, before pausing most of those tariffs for 90 days \u2014 but Mr. Trump left in place a 10% tariff on most imported goods, and hiked levies on imports from China to a total of 145%.",

    "summary": "Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell said in a speech today that President Trump's tariffs are likely to boost U.S. inflation.",
    "story": [
      "Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell on Wednesday cautioned that the central bank could face a \"challenging scenario\" of managing both accelerating inflation and a slowing economy brought on by the impact of President Trump's tariffs.",
      "In written remarks\u00a0at the Economic Club of Chicago, Powell reiterated that the Trump administration's tariffs are \"significantly larger than anticipated.\"",
      "\"The same is likely to be true of the economic effects, which will include higher inflation and slower growth,\" he added.",
      "Even so, Powell said the Federal Reserve can stay patient and wait to see how tariffs and other economic policies of the Trump administration play out before making any changes to interest rates. The sharp volatility in financial markets since Mr. Trump announced sweeping tariffs April 2, only to put most of them on hold a week later, has led to speculation about whether the Fed would soon cut its key interest rate or take other steps to calm investors.",
      "\"For the time being, we are well positioned to wait for greater clarity\" on the impact of policy changes in areas such as immigration, taxation, regulation, and tariffs, Powell said.",
      "Powell said the inflation will likely be temporary, but \"could also be more persistent,\" echoing a concern expressed by a majority of the Fed's 19-member interest rate-setting committee in the minutes of their meeting last month.",
      "Mr. Trump's tariffs have led economists to lower their expectations for U.S. economic growth and forecast higher inflation this year. Because tariffs are taxes paid by importers like Walmart, they typically pass on the added costs to consumers in the form of higher prices.",
      "\"Tariffs likely lead to higher prices while softening consumer sentiment and business optimism possibly means slower growth,\" said Scott Helfstein, Global X's head of investment strategy, in an email. \"This is going to make economic forecasting more difficult, and the Fed is likely going to widen their bands growth and rates with risks to both price stability and full employment rising.\"",
      "Yet some splits among the Fed's interest rate-setting committee have emerged. On Monday, Fed governor Christopher Waller said that he expects the impact of even a large increase in tariffs to be temporary, even if they are left in place for several years. At the same time, he also expects such large duties would weigh on the economy and even threaten a recession.",
      "Should the economy slow sharply, even if inflation remained elevated, Waller said he would support cutting interest rates \"sooner, and to a greater extent than I had previously thought.\"",
      "But other Fed officials, including Neel Kashkari, president of the Fed's Minneapolis branch, have said they are more focused on fighting the effects of higher tariffs on inflation, suggesting they are less likely to support rate cuts anytime soon.",
      "For now, most recent reports suggest the economy is in solid shape. Hiring has been solid and inflation cooled in March. Yet measures of consumer and business confidence have plunged, raising concerns among economists that spending and business investment could weaken.",

    "story": [
      "Pensacola, Florida\u00a0\u2014 Emily Ley has spent the last 17 years building Simplified, her small stationery business based in Pensacola, Florida.",
      "The company produces its planners in China, but for American shoppers.",
      "\"I would love to make them here, but the U.S. simply doesn't have the infrastructure or the supply chain to do it,\" Ley told CBS News.",
      "That stationery is now subject to the recent slew of\u00a0sky-high tariffs.",
      "\"We don't have the same options as large businesses,\" Ley said. \"We don't have the same capital or ability to pivot.\"",
      "After President Trump raised tariffs on China this month,\u00a0eventually totaling 145%, Ley, with the help of the nonpartisan, conservative-funded New Civil Liberties Alliance, filed a federal lawsuit against the president, U.S. Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem, and acting U.S. Customs and Border Patrol Commissioner Pete Flores, alleging illegal use of emergency powers illegally to enact the fees.",
      "Ley said that because Congressional approval was bypassed to impose the tariffs, she and other voters didn't have their positions represented.",
      "\"Had (Congress) had a chance to debate, discuss, vote, be involved,\u00a0I would've then had the opportunity to make my voice heard,\" she explained. \"And same for other Americans who were gonna be impacted by the tariffs. That didn't happen.\"",
      "\"If this is the end of my American dream, I'm gonna go down swinging,\" Ley said.",
      "The president has argued that the tariffs represent short-term pain that will result in long-term gain.",
      "But according to Ley, \"We can't survive the short-term pain, and especially without any sort of plan in place to create the infrastructure here...It would take years and millions and millions of dollars to build such a thing that's been built overseas over decades.\"",
      "Ley said Simplified has paid nearly $1.2 million in tariffs since Mr. Trump's first term, and is facing between $830,000 and $1 million in payments this year alone under the administration's new tariffs.",
      "While the White House is\u00a0offering exemptions\u00a0to multibillion-dollar Chinese industries that produce smartphones and other electronics, Ley says that to just cover the cost of tariffs at 145%, she would have to raise prices on her $64 signature planner to $82. To maintain a profit on her planners, Ley would have to double the sticker price to about $120.",
      "\"I'm not paying $120 for a planner,\" Ley said.",
      "Ley employs eight other women, and disclosed that she is being forced to consider reducing salaries and possibly eliminating positions, something she says she really doesn't want to do.",
      "She says it comes down to keeping prices manageable for customers while balancing the new tariff burden on her bottom line.",
      "Ley said that China's unique manufacturing infrastructure isn't currently available in the U.S. or other countries internationally. Different elements of her planners are made in several different factories in the Shenzhen region. Because they are located close to one another, the final product is higher quality and more affordable.",
      "In response to Ley's lawsuit, Harrison Fields, a White House spokesperson, told CBS News in a statement that the president \"has broad authority to impose tariffs to address issues of national emergency, such as the opioid pandemic. The Trump Administration looks forward to victory in court.\"",
      "Ley says her business cannot survive such tariffs.",
      "\"That's what's terrifying,\" Ley said. \"...It's just not sustainable. And it's truly catastrophic to so many businesses, and big businesses and small businesses alike. But I really think small businesses are gonna be the casualty of this trade war.\"",

    "published": "Wed, 16 Apr 2025 20:29:13 -0400",
    "summary": "A federal judge said he could recommend criminal prosecutions against the Trump administration, setting up an unprecedented showdown.",
    "story": [
      "U.S. District Judge James Boasberg threatened on Wednesday to find the Trump administration in criminal contempt of court for defying a court order to return Venezuelan migrants en route to a Salvadoran prison last month \u2014 possibly setting the stage for an unprecedented showdown between President Trump and the judicial branch.",
      "Boasberg, who said the government \"deliberately flouted\" his orders, warned if the administration doesn't change course, he could hold hearings, recommend criminal charges and hire a private attorney to prosecute the case if the Department of Justice refuses.",
      "Why could Judge Boasberg hold the Trump administration in contempt of court?",
      "In a searing written decision, Boasberg said the Trump administration showed a \"willful disregard\" for his orders not to deport migrants under the Alien Enemies Act of 1798.",
      "The government has cited the 18th-century law to fly hundreds of alleged members of Venezuelan gang Tren de Aragua to El Salvador, whose government is holding scores of U.S. deportees in a notorious maximum-security prison. The Trump administration has touted the deportations as ridding the U.S. of foreign gang members, but an analysis by \"60 Minutes\" last week showed that 75% of the men sent to CECOT in El Salvador had no criminal records. At least 22% of the men on the list have criminal records here in the United States or abroad. The vast majority are for non-violent offenses like theft, shoplifting and trespassing. About a dozen are accused of murder, rape, assault and kidnapping. It was unclear if any criminal record existed for the other 3%.",
      "Some of those migrants sued to prevent their removal last month, and Boasberg quickly ordered the government verbally to return the migrants to the United States, even if that requires officials to \"turn a plane around.\" The judge later issued a written order barring the administration from removing migrants under the Alien Enemies Act.",
      "Boasberg wrote Wednesday the government disobeyed those orders by not returning the migrants to the United States. Since then, he said he's given officials \"ample opportunity\" to explain what happened, but found their responses unsatisfactory.",
      "The Trump administration has denied violating the judge's order, and White House communications director Steven Cheung says the government will appeal Boasberg's ruling. \"The President is 100% committed to ensuring that terrorists and criminal illegal migrants are no longer a threat to Americans and their communities across the country,\" he wrote in a statement.",
      "What is contempt of court?",
      "Under federal law, criminal contempt of court is defined as disobeying a federal court's \"lawful writ, process, order, rule, decree, or command.\"",
      "As with any criminal case, prosecutors would need to prove beyond a reasonable doubt that a defendant \u2014 in this case, potentially a federal official \u2014 willfully violated an order, says Mitchell Epner, a partner at the New York law firm Kudman Trachten Aloe Posner.",
      "Contempt cases are extremely rare, according to Epner. He said that during his three-year stint as a federal prosecutor in New Jersey, he can't recall anyone even threatening to bring a criminal contempt of court case, much less actually bringing charges.",
      "\"In my experience as a lawyer over the last 30 years, even the hint of being held in contempt by a judge is ordinarily enough in order to cause litigants to correct their behavior,\" Epner said.",
      "What happens next in this case?",
      "Before moving forward, Boasberg gave the government an opportunity to \"purge\" its alleged contempt, saying the government could take the migrants back into U.S. custody so they can potentially seek relief from a court. If the administration decides to go down that route, he gave officials one week to file court papers \"explaining the steps they have taken and will take.\"",
      "Boasberg said he is also open to other solutions.",
      "Otherwise, Boesberg says the Trump administration has one week to give the court the names of whoever \"made the decision not to halt the transfer\" of the migrants covered by his orders. If needed, Boasberg said he'll hold hearings or order depositions to gather more details.",
      "After that, Boasberg said he could recommend a criminal prosecution for contempt of court, though it's unclear who the defendant would be.",
      "However, Boasberg can't necessarily force charges to be brought. Federal prosecutions are generally handled by the Department of Justice, which has the power to decide which cases it pursues, making it highly unlikely the Trump administration will choose to criminally charge its own officials. Epner told CBS News he \"cannot imagine a circumstance\" where the DOJ chooses to bring those charges.",
      "Can Boasberg appoint a private lawyer to prosecute the administration?",
      "It's complicated. Boasberg notes that if the Justice Department decides not to bring contempt charges, he has the right to appoint a private attorney to step in and prosecute the case. That option isn't unheard-of: In one well-known 2023 case, the Supreme Court chose not to strike down a contempt conviction against lawyer Steven Donziger that was prosecuted by private attorneys.",
      "But that route is extremely unusual and would almost certainly face legal pushback, Epner says. In the small handful of situations where judges have appointed lawyers to step in and act as prosecutor, it has generally been because the DOJ simply decided bringing contempt charges wasn't worth its time, according to Epner. Boasberg's case is far thornier because it would involve a direct confrontation with federal officials.",
      "\"Actually trying to prosecute a criminal contempt here would be a mess because all of these issues would have to be unpacked,\" Epner said.",
      "Any effort to prosecute Trump administration officials privately could reach the Supreme Court, and Epner argues \"all evidence is that they are bending over in every possible supine position to avoid a showdown with Donald Trump.\" The court has already weighed in, overturning Boasberg's order on the grounds that cases should have been brought in another court district.",
      "For those reasons, Epner thinks it's unlikely that Boasberg will go with private attorneys, saying, \"it is literally setting up a constitutional crisis.\"",
      "Could the Trump administration face other contempt charges?",
      "It's unclear, though the administration has run into resistance from federal judges in other cases.",
      "Judge Paula Xinis has ordered the government to facilitate the return of Kilmar Abrego Garcia, a native of El Salvador who the Trump administration conceded was mistakenly sent to the same Salvadoran prison as the Venezuelan migrants. In a hearing Tuesday, Xinis said the administration \"has not yet fulfilled the mandate, the order, that I issued,\" and ordered expedited discovery in the case, saying, \"there will be no tolerance for gamesmanship or grandstanding.\"",
      "Abrego Garcia's lawyers have suggested the government be held in contempt. Xinis said Tuesday, \"I will have the record before me to call it like I see it\" before ruling on contempt.",

      "U.S. District Judge James Boasberg wrote in a 46-page decision that the government's actions on March 15 \"demonstrate a willful disregard\" for his order barring the government from transferring certain migrants into Salvadoran custody under the wartime Alien Enemies Act.",
      "Those actions, he wrote, are \"sufficient for the court to conclude that probable cause exists to find the government in criminal contempt. The court does not reach such conclusion lightly or hastily; indeed, it has given defendants ample opportunity to rectify or explain their actions. None of their responses has been satisfactory.\"",
      "\"The Constitution does not tolerate willful disobedience of judicial orders \u2014 especially by officials of a coordinate branch who have sworn an oath to uphold it,\" Boasberg wrote.",
      "The judge's ruling marks the most direct rebuke of the Trump administration amid its escalating tensions with the federal judiciary, which have particularly grown over challenges to the president's efforts surrounding immigration.",
      "President Trump and his allies have repeatedly attacked Boasberg over his handling of the case that arose after the president issued a proclamation in March invoking the Alien Enemies Act, a seldom-used law from 1798, to summarily deport Venezuelans who his administration claims are members of the gang Tren de Aragua.",
      "The judge said the Trump administration can remedy the breach of his order before contempt proceedings are initiated by asserting custody over the migrants who were removed in violation of it, so they can assert their right to challenge their removability. Administration officials will also have the chance to suggest \"other methods\" of coming into compliance with the order, Boasberg wrote.",
      "White House communications director Steven Cheung said the administration will seek immediate relief from the U.S. Court of Appeals for the D.C. Circuit.",
      "\"The president is 100% committed to ensuring that terrorists and criminal illegal migrants are no longer a threat to Americans and their communities across the country,\" he said in a statement.",
      "Boasberg, who sits on the district court in Washington, D.C., was overseeing a challenge brought by a group of Venezuelan migrants who sought to prevent their removal under the more than 200-year-old wartime law. The judge swiftly blocked the Trump administration from removing the plaintiffs from the U.S. for 14 days and, after convening an emergency hearing, told government lawyers in-person that they should return people subject to the proclamation who were on planes headed to El Salvador back to the U.S.",
      "A written order issued shortly after blocked the Trump administration from conducting any deportations of noncitizens in its custody under the Alien Enemies Act. Boasberg's order did not block the government from deporting the alleged gang members or others under other immigration authorities.",
      "But the judge said that despite his written and oral directives, the government did not stop the removal process, and planes carrying migrants subject to deportation under the Alien Enemies Act later landed in El Salvador, where most were transferred to its Center for Terrorism Confinement, or CECOT.",
      "The Trump administration's actions sparked questions as to whether it had violated Boasberg's order. The judge wrote in his opinion that \"boasts\" by Secretary of State Marco Rubio and Salvadoran President Nayib Bukele \"intimated that they had defied the court's order deliberately and gleefully.\"",
      "Who, exactly, in the Trump administration ordered the two planes to continue on to El Salvador, is unclear. In his opinion, Boasberg wrote that he plans to find that out through further proceedings and potentially live witness testimony under oath if needed.",
      "In the last hearing on the matter, a Justice Department attorney named two Department of Homeland Security officials and one State Department official as his points of contact after the judge's decision but said he did not know who directed the planes to continue their flights.",
      "Boasberg found that the Trump administration failed to dispel of any concerns that they violated his injunction, and during further proceedings, declined to \"admit to a grave mistake, explain how it transpired, and detail plans to rectify it.\"",
      "He accused the government of \"increasing obstructionism\" and \"stonewalling\" over its refusal to answer basic questions that aimed to resolve whether noncitizens who were removable solely under Mr. Trump's proclamation were transferred out of U.S. custody after the judge issued his order forbidding their deportation.",
      "\"Defendants provide no convincing reason to avoid the conclusion that appears obvious from the above factual recitation: that they deliberately flouted this court's written order and, separately, its oral command that explicitly delineated what compliance entailed,\" Boasberg wrote.",
      "The dispute over Mr. Trump's use of the Alien Enemies Act to remove alleged Tren de Aragua members reached the Supreme Court late last month. The high court last week said that the Trump administration could resume deportations of Venezuelan migrants it claims are Tren de Aragua members under the law, but only if they are given due process.",
      "The high court also said that migrants challenging their removals under the Alien Enemies Act must seek judicial review through habeas petitions filed in the district where they are detained. As a result, the dispute before Boasberg in Washington, D.C., should instead be filed in Texas, where the Venezuelan migrants are confined, the Supreme Court said.",
      "Boasberg wrote that the Supreme Court's order \"does not affect \u2014 let alone moot \u2014 the compliance inquiry presently teed up here.\"",
      "The Trump administration invoked the state-secrets privilege in an effort to keep details out of Boasberg's reach in his efforts to find out more information about the two flights. But the judge found it is \"exceedingly doubtful that the privilege applies here\" because he was not asking about diplomatic agreements between the U.S. and El Salvador, or the operational specifics of how the deportations were arranged.",
      "\"Instead, the court is simply seeking to confirm times and numbers: how many passengers the two flights carried, whether they were all deported pursuant to the proclamation, and when they were transferred out of U.S. custody,\" Boasberg wrote. \"The court is skeptical that such information rises to the level of a state secret.\"",
      "The judge also rejected the Trump administration's contentions that his order infringed on the president's authority, saying it merely restricted executive actions, which courts routinely do.",
      "\"It in no way invaded any Article II powers, despite defendants' effort to incant new ones into existence,\" he wrote. \"In any event, even if the TRO did somehow overstep the court's Article III power, defendants cannot now evade a contempt charge on that basis.\"",

      "President Trump plans to overhaul the Endangered Species Act to make it easier to build in the U.S. where endangered species live, a White House official confirmed Wednesday.",
      "The president has voiced frustration with the 1973 law and similar environmental protections, saying environmentalists are impeding growth. Real Clear Politics first reported Mr. Trump's plans to overhaul the law.",
      "A White House source was granted anonymity as the announcement is not official.",
      "It's not yet exactly clear how Mr. Trump would alter the use of the law, since only Congress can change or repeal it, but it would likely come through the federal rule-making process. The law was established to protect species of wildlife, fish and plants that have been depleted enough to be in danger of extinction.",
      "Last week, the president directed agencies regulating energy and the environment to sunset a number of environmental protections, among other steps to curb environmental protections to spur construction and economic growth.",
      "One step the administration is considering is to repeal the definition of 'harm,' which would remove nearly all habitat protections for endangered species across the country. Currently, if any business or activity harms a protected species, it's a violation of the law, as established by the ESA. The law defines \"harm\" as including \"any activity that can modify a species' habitat.\" Loss of habitat is the single greatest threat to most species, since many aren't \"taken\" or killed to the point of extinction.. By eliminating this legal definition of \"harm,\" it would clear the way for many forms of economic development, including logging, oil and gas drilling, or critical mineral mining that could eradicate a species, environmentalists say.",
      "\"We'll go to court to fight as many of these rollbacks as possible,\" said Brett Hartl, director of government affairs for the Center for Biological Diversity. \"The federal government is large and they're throwing everything at the wall hoping to overwhelm us, but we'll do our damnedest to make sure nothing becomes permanent.\"",
      "The Endangered Species Act was established in 1973 to protect \"various species of fish, wildlife, and plants in the United States that had been rendered extinct as a consequence of economic growth and development untampered by adequate concern and conservation.\" By designating\u00a0 species with a protected status, this ensures that the ecosystems where the species live will be conserved and steps are taken to help support the species to avoid extinction. This, by extension, means that Congress and federal agencies will work with state and local governments to address water resources that impact species, as well as habitat.",
      "Critics of the Endangered Species Act claim the law goes far beyond the initial intent and is overly burdensome. Republican Rep. Bruce Westerman of Arkansas, chairman of the House Committee on Natural Resources, has frequently suggested changes to the ESA and last month proposed the Endangered Species Amendment Act of 2025. He said in a statement, \"The Endangered Species Act has consistently failed to achieve its intended goals and has been warped by decades of radical environmental litigation into a weapon instead of a tool.\"",
      "Much of what the Trump administration is proposing, by sunsetting regulations and overhauling the ESA, aligns with Westerman's bill.\"Environmental is the biggest tool for stopping growth,\" Mr. Trump said in an interview with podcaster Joe Rogan last year.",
      "Environmentalists, however, are concerned about weakening the law.",
      "\"This is a full-out assault on America's heritage,\" said Andrew Wetzler, the senior vice president of nature at the Natural Resources Defense Council. \"If Trump is successful, it will turn the ESA into a shell of itself, and this would be open season for our most important wildlife.\"",
      "In the 50 years since the law was enacted, the ESA has been credited with saving 99% of the listed species. Notable species saved include the bald eagle, American alligators, whooping cranes and peregrine falcons.",
      "CBS News reported in 2023 that since the passage of the law, more than 1,7000 plants, mammals, fish, insects and other species in the U.S. have been listed as threatened or endangered. But federal data shows that of the roughly $1.2 billion a year spent on endangered and threatened species, about half goes toward recovery of just two types of fish: salmon and steelhead trout along the West Coast.",

      "During the first day of his trip to El Salvador, Maryland Sen. Chris Van Hollen was denied a meeting or phone call with Kilmar Abrego Garcia, the Maryland man who was mistakenly deported to that country. Van Hollen was able to meet with the vice president of El Salvador.",
      "Abrego Garcia's case has sparked a series of court proceedings, during which a federal judge ordered the government to return him to the U.S. from the El Salvador supermax prison, CECOT.",
      "The Trump administration raised the case to the Supreme Court, which also ordered the administration to facilitate Abrego Garcia's return.",
      "Van Hollen traveled to El Salvador to check on Abrego Garcia's well-being and to meet with Salvadoran government leaders after promising Abrego Garcia's family that he would try to aid in his release.",
      "Maryland senator hopes to see Abrego Garcia",
      "Sen. Van Hollen said he hoped to meet with El Salvador's President Nayib Bukele. Instead, he met with Vice President F\u00e9lix Ulloa on Wednesday. During that meeting, Van Hollen said that Ulloa indicated he would need a little more time to arrange an in-person prison meeting between Abrego Garcia and the senator.",
      "However, when the senator offered to return next week, he said Ulloa told him he could not promise a meeting would happen at all. Van Hollen was also denied a phone call with Abrego Garcia. Ulloa suggested that the requests be handled by the U.S. Embassy instead.",
      "\"We have an unjust situation here,\" Van Hollen said during a livestreamed news conference. \"The Trump administration is lying about Abrego Garcia. The American courts have looked at the facts.\"",
      "Kilmar Abrego Garcia's wrongful deportation",
      "During his update, Sen. Van Hollen emphasized that Abrego Garcia should not have been deported, as he had been granted a \"withholding of removal\" order from an immigration judge.",
      "\"Abrego Garcia is legally in the U.S.,\" Van Hollen said. \"An immigration judge found years ago that it would put his life in danger if he was returned to El Salvador.\"",
      "Abrego Garcia was arrested by U.S. Customs and Immigration Enforcement (ICE) in March as he was leaving his job in Baltimore, Maryland and returning home to Prince George's County. On March 15, he was deported to El Salvador on a plane with more than 200 other migrants that the Trump administration claims had gang affiliations.",
      "ICE later admitted that Abrego Garcia was deported because of an \"administrative error,\" however, they did not take action to return him to the U.S.",
      "Kilmar Abrego Garcia's alleged ties to MS-13",
      "The Trump administration has said that Abrego Garcia is a member of the MS-13 gang, a claim his attorney and family deny. He also has no criminal history in any country.",
      "\"The case of Abrego Garcia does not have to do with MS-13,\" Sen. Van Hollen said. \"If you listen to President Trump and the Trump administration, you would think that U.S. courts have found that Mr. Abrego Garcia is part of MS-13, but they have not found that. In fact, recently, a U.S. federal court judge said that the Trump administration did not have evidence to support the claim that he had ever been part of MS-13.\"",
      "Why can't El Salvador return Abrego Garcia to the U.S.?",
      "During his update in El Salvador, Sen. Van Hollen questioned why Abrego Garcia is still being held at CECOT and asked if the government has any evidence of Abrego Garcia's gang ties.",
      "\"The government of El Salvador has no evidence that he is part of MS-13, so why is El Salvador continuing to hold him in CECOT?\" the senator questioned.",
      "According to Van Hollen, the vice president said the Trump administration is paying El Salvador to keep Abrego Garcia at CECOT.",
      "When asked again why El Salvador could not release Abrego Garcia, Vice President Ulloa referred to a statement that Salvadoran President Nayib Bukele gave while visiting the White House, saying the country cannot smuggle Abrego Garcia back into the U.S."

    "story": [
      "Washington \u2014 Attorney General Pam Bondi announced Wednesday that the Justice Department is filing a civil lawsuit against Maine's Department of Education for \"discriminating against women by failing to protect women in women's sports\" in what she alleged is a violation of Title IX.",
      "\"The Department of Justice will not sit by when women are discriminated against in sports,\" Bondi said. \"This is about sports, this is also about these young womens' personal safety.\"",
      "The move marks an escalation between the Trump administration and Maine over the issue. President Trump signed an executive order in February to ban transgender girls and women from competing on sports teams that match their gender identity, mandating that Title IX, the federal law banning sex discrimination in schools, be interpreted as prohibiting the participation of transgender girls and women in female sports. President Trump said states not in compliance would jeopardize any federal funding they receive.",
      "Then, in a tense moment between Mr. Trump and Maine Gov. Janet Mills, a Democrat, later in February, the president threatened that her state wouldn't get federal funding if it didn't comply with the executive order barring transgender athletes from competing on women's sports teams. Mills replied, \"See you in court.\"",
      "Education Secretary Linda McMahon, who appeared alongside Bondi on Wednesday, said \"I hope Gov. Mills will recognize that her political feud with the president will deprive the students in her state of much more than the right to fair sporting events.\"",
      "The attorney general outlined that the Justice Department had \"exhausted every other remedy,\" saying it has \"repeatedly notified Maine of its infractions and urged them to remedy the situation to protect women.\" Bondi noted that the administration has stripped grants to Maine through other agencies, and would \"continue to fight for women.\"",
      "The federal government said in its lawsuit filed in Maine's federal court that the state's Department of Education is \"openly and defiantly flouting anti-discrimination law by enforcing policies that require girls to compete against boys in athletic competitions designated exclusively for girls,\" arguing that the practice violates Title IX's \"core protections.\"\u2028It cited three examples of boys participating in girls sports.",
      "\"The United States accordingly files this action to stop Maine's unapologetic sex-discrimination against female student athletes,\" the Justice Department said in the lawsuit.",
      "Mills pledged to \"vigorously defend our state against the action announced today from the Department of Justice\" in a statement Wednesday, arguing that the fight isn't about women's sports, but \"states rights and defending the rule of law against a federal government bent on imposing its will.\"",
      "\"Let today serve as warning to all states: Maine might be among the first to draw the ire of the Federal government in this way, but we will not be the last,\" Mills said.",
      "Last week, the state of Maine secured a temporary restraining order against the Trump administration, blocking the Agriculture Department from \"terminating, freezing, or otherwise interfering with the State's access to federal funds based on alleged Title IX violations without following the process required by federal statute.\" The lawsuit was brought by Maine after the Trump administration cut funds for administrative and technological funds in the state's schools.",
      "The Justice Department's actions against Maine may be followed by similar moves in other states, Bondi said.",
      "\"We're looking at Minnesota, we're looking at California,\" Bondi said. \"We're looking at many, many states, but they are the top two that should be on notice.\"",

      "An AP spokesperson said in a statement that its \"journalists were blocked from the Oval Office\" on Monday despite the order requiring the White House to rescind its restrictions on the AP's access to the Oval Office, Air Force One and other places where space is limited when they're open to other members of the White House press pool.",
      "The AP also reported that one of its reporters was not allowed to attend an event on the South Lawn of the White House recognizing the Ohio State University's championship football team that was open to credentialed media, though two AP photographers were permitted to cover it.",
      "A White House official separately confirmed Tuesday night that the White House is changing the makeup of the press pool, which is the small group of rotating journalists who cover the president each day, to remove a spot designated for news wire services like the AP. The official said the pool will instead consist of a second print journalist, and wire reporters will be eligible for the pool's daily print journalist position.",
      "Eugene Daniels, president of the White House Correspondents' Association, said in response to the changes that the wire services \u2014 the AP, Bloomberg News and Reuters \u2014 play a crucial role in coverage of the presidency and should have their traditional spot in the press pool.",
      "\"The changes to the press pool today show that the White House is \u00a0just using a new means to do the same thing: retaliate against news organizations for coverage the White House doesn't like,\" he said. \"The WHCA is working to find out what this means in practice but what we do know is that restrictions on White House media coverage only hurt the American people who rely on unfiltered journalism to stay informed and make decisions critical to their lives.\"",
      "Daniels said the White House's insistence that they will maintain discretion over the composition of the pool, instead of using regular rotations, \"underscores that the administration remains unwilling to provide guarantees they will not continue to engage in the viewpoint discrimination that was ruled unlawful by a federal court.\"",

      "The AP spokesperson said in the statement that the outlet expects \"the White House to restore AP's participation in the pool as of [Monday], as provided in the injunction order.\" The White House did not return a request for comment.",

      "Mr. Trump signed an executive order renaming the body of water in January. But the AP said it would not update its Stylebook, which is used in newsrooms worldwide, to reflect the change because the president's directive only carries authority within the U.S. The AP said that as an international news agency, it \"must ensure that places, names and geography are easily recognizable to all audiences.\"",
      "McFadden last week said that the White House likely violated the First Amendment when it excluded the AP from press events because of its refusal to change the Gulf of Mexico's name in its Stylebook.",
      "The judge stressed that he is not ordering the Trump administration to grant the AP permanent access to the Oval Office, East Room or other media events, and noted that the AP is not entitled to the permanent press pool access it previously enjoyed.",
      "But McFadden wrote that the AP \"cannot be treated worse than its peer wire services either. The court merely declares that the AP's exclusion has been contrary to the First Amendment, and it enjoins the government from continuing down that unlawful path.\"",
      "\"The AP seeks restored eligibility for admission to the press pool and limited-access press events, untainted by an impermissible viewpoint-based exclusion,\" he wrote. \"That is all the court orders today: For the government to put the AP on an equal playing field as similarly situated outlets, despite the AP's use of disfavored terminology.\"",

      "Washington \u2014 A federal judge on Tuesday said she will prevent the Trump administration from enforcing portions of an executive order that targets the law firm Susman Godfrey, finding that the directive likely retaliates against the firm and its clients for their exercise of constitutionally protected speech.",
      "U.S. District Judge Loren AliKhan granted the firm's request for a temporary restraining order following a hearing and said Susman Godfrey is likely to succeed on its claims that the executive order, signed by President Trump last week, violates the First and Fifth Amendments. She specifically blocked the administration from enforcing provisions relating to federal contracting and restricting Susman employees' access to federal buildings and from engaging with government workers.",
      "AliKhan said while delivering her ruling from the bench that the government \"sought to use its immense power to dictate the positions that law firms may or may not take,\" which threatens the foundation of legal representation in the U.S. She said the executive order is \"based on a personal vendetta\" against Susman Godfrey.",
      "\"The framers of our Constitution would see this as a shocking abuse of power,\" AliKhan, who sits on the federal district court in Washington, D.C., said.",
      "Following the hearing, the firm said in a statement it is grateful to the court for addressing the unconstitutionality of Mr. Trump's order.",
      "\"This fight is bigger and more important than any one firm. Susman Godfrey is fighting this unconstitutional executive order because it infringes on the rights of all Americans and the rule of law. This fight is right, it is just, and we are duty-bound to pursue it,\" it said.",
      "Susman Godfrey is the fourth law firm to succeed in the early stages of lawsuits that challenge executive orders signed by Mr. Trump. The orders, signed over the past few weeks, each threaten the firms with sanctions because of their legal work, as well as lawyers who are currently or were previously on their payrolls.",
      "Susman Godfrey represented Dominion Voting Systems in a defamation lawsuit filed against Fox News over baseless claims it aired about the 2020 election, which Mr. Trump falsely claims was rigged against him. The case ended with a $787 million settlement agreement before the start of the trial. The firm is also representing Dominion in a defamation case against Newsmax, a conservative television network. A jury trial in that dispute is slated to begin at the end of the month.",
      "During the hearing, Donald Verrilli, who is representing Susman Godfrey, called Mr. Trump's executive order \"one of the most brazenly unconstitutional exercises of executive power in the history of this nation.\" He told the court it \"runs roughshod\" over the separation of powers.",
      "Pointing to other law firms that have reached deals with the White House, likely to head-off being targeted by Mr. Trump, Verrilli said they have done so to \"stay on the president's good side.\" Those nine firms have agreed to provide between $40 million and $125 million in pro bono work to causes backed by the president.",
      "\"We're sliding very fast into an abyss,\" Verrilli said. \"There's only one way to stop that slide: for courts to act decisively and act decisively now.\"",

      "Joseph Mazzarra, acting general counsel of the Department of Homeland Security, said in a filing shortly before the hearing that if Abrego Garcia does show up at a port of entry, he would be detained by the Department of Homeland Security and either removed to a third country or stripped of a legal protection that he was granted in 2019, which forbid immigration authorities from removing him to his home country of El Salvador.",
      "To revoke that legal status, known as withholding of removal, the Department of Homeland Security would have to re-open his immigration case and ask an immigration judge to terminate it.",
      "Abrego Garcia's wife, Jennifer Vasquez Sura, said before the hearing that she is asking the Trump administration to \"stop playing games with the life of Kilmar.\"",
      "During the proceedings, Xinis said the Justice Department \"has not yet fulfilled the mandate, the order, that I issued,\" while lawyers for the Justice Department asked for any orders to be stayed after the Supreme Court ruling.",
      "Xinis said Tuesday that \"every day Mr. Abrego Garcia is detained in CECOT is another date of irreparable harm,\" and gave both sides two weeks to complete expedited discovery, or fact finding, in the case, including sworn depositions from Trump administration officials with first-hand knowledge of the efforts to return him.",
      "\"I've gotten nothing, I've gotten no real response [from the government],\" Xinis said, calling the Justice Department's arguments thus far \"two misguided ships passing in the night.\"",
      "Xinis responded to the Justice Department's suggestions that the back and forth is simply a legal dispute, and that there is \"so much daylight between what you keep saying and what the posture of the case is.\"",
      "\"I will have the record before me to call it like I see it\" before she rules on whether to hold the government in contempt of her order, Xinis said.",
      "Despite the Justice Department's filings this week citing the exchange between President Trump and Bukele, in which Bukele said he would not be returning Abrego Garcia to the United States, Xinis said that \"if that were in a court of law \u2014 it would have real infirmities in a trial, in a court of law.\"",
      "\"No press release is going to move the court the same way that sworn, under oath testimony from persons with knowledge,\" Xinis said.",
      "Xinis had ordered the Justice Department to provide her with answers to three questions about Abrego Garcia's whereabouts and efforts to bring him back to the U.S. after the Supreme Court last week\u00a0affirmed a portion of an earlier order that required the U.S. to \"facilitate\" Abrego Garcia's release from Salvadoran custody.",
      "Lawyers for Abrego Garcia argued in a filing that the Trump administration defied the district court and Supreme Court orders by refusing to provide \"even basic information\" about their client's location and what it is doing to follow the directive to return him to the U.S. They asked Xinis to provide three types of relief, including ordering the government to explain why it shouldn't be held in contempt for failure to comply with her prior rulings.",
      "During a hearing Friday, after the high court released its decision, Ensign, the Justice Department lawyer, repeatedly said he could not provide information about Abrego Garcia's whereabouts. Xinis said in a written order after the proceedings that the Trump administration \"failed to comply\" with her directive and \"made no meaningful effort to\" obey it.\u00a0 She ordered the government to provide daily updates to the court about Abrego Garcia's location and custodial status, as well as the efforts taken by the administration to bring him back to the U.S.",
      "In a declaration submitted to the court Saturday, Michael Kozak, a senior State Department official, said Abrego Garcia is currently being held in the Terrorism Confinement Center, known as CECOT, in El Salvador.",
      "\"He is alive and secure in that facility,\" Kozak wrote. \"He is detained pursuant to the sovereign, domestic authority of El Salvador.\"",
      "In another declaration filed Sunday, Evan Katz, assistant director for the Removal Division at ICE, said the administration had no updates for the court beyond what had already been shared. The latest filing, submitted Monday from Mazzara said the agency \"does not have the authority to forcibly extract an alien from the domestic custody of a foreign sovereign nation.\"",
      "Trump administration officials have been defiant in their response to Xinis' order that they take steps to bring Abrego Garcia back to the U.S. and have argued that their obligations are limited only to removing \"any domestic obstacles\" that would impede his ability to return to the U.S., where he has lived since arriving unlawfully in 2011.",
      "Federal courts, they said in a filing Sunday, are powerless \"to direct the Executive Branch to conduct foreign relations in a particular way, or engage with a foreign sovereign in a given manner.\"",
      "Abrego Garcia was arrested by immigration authorities in March and flown to El Salvador with more than 200 other migrants who are now confined at CECOT. His lawyers have argued that his removal to El Salvador was unlawful, as an immigration judge in 2019 granted him a withholding of removal, a legal status that forbids the Department of Homeland Security from returning him to his home country of El Salvador because he is likely to face persecution from local gangs.",
      "Numerous Trump administration officials at the Departments of Justice and Homeland Security \u2014 including Solicitor General John Sauer \u2014 have acknowledged that Abrego Garcia's deportation to El Savaldor was an \"administrative error\" because he was granted withholding of removal.",
      "But Katz, the ICE official, said in his declaration that Abergo Garcia is no longer eligible for that relief because of his alleged membership in the gang MS-13, which President Trump designated as a foreign terrorist organization.",
      "While the Department of Homeland Security has claimed that Abrego Garcia has ties to MS-13, citing allegations from a confidential informant, his lawyers argue that he is not a member of MS-13 or any other gang. They have also said he has never been charged or convicted of any crimes in the U.S., El Salvador or any other country.",
      "Abrego Garcia's case landed before the Supreme Court last week after Xinis issued an order on April 4 that directed the Trump administration to \"facilitate and effectuate\" Abrego Garcia's return by 11:59 p.m. on April 7.",
      "The Justice Department appealed, and Chief Justice John Roberts issued a temporary order pausing that deadline to allow the Supreme Court more time to consider whether to grant the Trump administration's request to block Xinis' order.",
      "The high court on Thursday upheld part of the decision that required the government to \"facilitate\" Abrego Garcia's release from Salvadoran custody, but said the district court should clarify its directive that the Trump administration \"effectuate\" his return.",
      "Xinis moved swiftly in responding, and issued a new order requiring the Trump administration to take all available steps to facilitate Abrego Garcia's return to the U.S. \"as soon as possible.\"",
      "Trump administration officials have claimed that it is up to the Salvadoran government to decide if they want to return Abrego Garcia to the U.S. But during a meeting with President Trump on Monday, Salvadoran President Nayib Bukele said he does not \"have the power\" to do so.",
      "\"How can I return him to the United States?\"he said in response to questions from reporters. \"I smuggle him into the United States or what do I do? Of course I'm not going to do it. The question is preposterous.\"",
      "The U.S. is paying the Salvadoran government $6 million to house migrants at CECOT.",

      "A man accused of trying to assassinate President Trump at his Florida golf club last September can hire an expert to examine the rifle recovered from the scene, but only to determine its operability, a federal judge said Tuesday.",
      "Ryan Routh's attorneys had asked that their expert be allowed to inspect, photograph and test the rifle in order to evaluate a government expert's findings, as well as test it for other information that they thought was relevant. In Tuesday's order, District Judge Aileen Cannon \u2014 who was nominated by Mr. Trump \u2014 limited the testing to just its operability, with a May 15 deadline.",
      "Routh, who has pleaded not guilty, was charged with attempted assassination of a presidential candidate and two firearm charges. His federal trial is scheduled for September, and he's expected to face additional state charges.",
      "Prosecutors say Routh methodically plotted to kill Mr. Trump \u2014 then a presidential candidate \u2014 for weeks before aiming a rifle through the shrubbery as Mr. Trump played golf on Sept. 15, 2024, at his West Palm Beach country club. Before the president came into view, Routh was spotted by a Secret Service agent. Routh allegedly aimed his rifle at the agent, who opened fire, causing Routh to drop his weapon and flee without firing a shot. Prosecutors say he left behind a note describing his intentions. He was arrested a short time later driving on a nearby interstate.",
      "Federal prosecutors alleged last week\u00a0Routh also tried to buy an anti-aircraft weapon online to shoot down Mr. Trump's plane. \"I need equipment so that Trump cannot get elected,\" Routh allegedly told an associate from whom he hoped to buy the weapon.",

    "published": "Tue, 15 Apr 2025 21:51:04 -0400",
    "summary": "Mohsen Mahdawi was arrested Monday at a citizenship interview in Vermont \u2014 one day after telling CBS News he'd \"accept the outcome.\"",
    "story": [
      "Just one day before Mohsen Mahdawi was detained by immigration agents at what he was told was his citizenship interview, the Columbia student and Palestinian activist told CBS News he thought there was a chance the long-awaited appointment could be a trap.",
      "\"It's the first feeling of like, I've been waiting for this for more than a year,\" Mahdawi \u2014 a native of the Israeli-occupied West Bank who has held a green card for the last decade \u2014 told CBS News on the eve of his detention. \"And the other feeling is like, wait a minute. Is this a honey trap?\"",
      "Mahdawi was taken into custody after arriving at his interview in Vermont on Monday. CBS News witnessed federal agents strapping on vests shortly after he walked into the building, emerging about an hour later with Mahdawi in handcuffs.",
      "His attorneys say he was detained under a little-used law allowing foreign nationals to be deported if they pose \"serious adverse foreign policy consequences\" \u2014 making him the latest student to face detention, including fellow Columbia activist and green card holder Mahmoud Khalil. Mahdawi's legal team has petitioned a judge to release him and alleged he is being punished for protected speech, in violation of the First Amendment and his right to due process.",
      "Shortly after Mahdawi's detention, federal Judge William Sessions ordered the Trump administration not to deport him or move him out of the state of Vermont while Sessions reviews the case, granting a request from Mahdawi's attorneys.",
      "The Department of Homeland Security referred a request for comment to the State Department, which declined to comment.",
      "Mahdawi \u2014 who says he was set to receive his bachelor's degree in philosophy in May \u2014 co-founded Columbia's Palestinian Student Union in 2023 along with Khalil. Mahdawi was later active in protests on Columbia's campus against Israel's war in Gaza, which began after Hamas' terrorist attack launched from the Gaza Strip on Oct. 7, 2023. His attorneys said in a court filing that Mahdawi \"took a step back\" from organizing the protests in March 2024, before the protests escalated later that spring, with demonstrators forming encampments and occupying a campus building.",
      "The nationwide wave of pro-Palestinian campus protests was a political lightning rod, with critics arguing the demonstrations \u2014 and their leaders \u2014 were disruptive and featured antisemitic rhetoric. Columbia is one of several schools to face a freeze in federal funding by the Trump administration, which alleges the Ivy League school \"failed to protect students and faculty from antisemitic violence and harassment.\"",
      "Mahdawi told CBS News last weekend he faced \"threats\" and \"intimidation\" after speaking about the protests in a late 2023 \"60 Minutes\" interview. Shortly after President Trump took office, he also drew the attention of Betar USA, a controversial pro-Israel group that tweeted in January that Mahdawi was on its \"deport list.\"",
      "The group's former Executive Director Ross Glick told CBS News that Betar USA has collected information on thousands of pro-Palestinian activists and passed it on to the Trump administration. He said it's up to the government to decide whether somebody actually supports Hamas: \"Once information is handed off, we're out of the process, right? It's ultimately up to the government, the various officials.\"",
      "Mahdawi pushed back on Betar's criticism, saying groups like Betar \"manipulate information, create lies, and attach them to the profiles of those either students or activists.\" Mahdawi has vehemently denied claims of antisemitism in the Columbia University protests more generally, calling them a \"false accusation.\"",
      "He also told CBS News over the weekend that if he's detained by federal agents, \"I want people to know that my compassion extended beyond the Palestinian people. My compassion is also for the Jewish people and for the Israelis as well.\"",
      "After Khalil was detained outside his Columbia-owned apartment last month, Mahdawi feared he could be ensnared next. Khalil is currently held in Louisiana, and his legal future is uncertain: An immigration judge ruled last week the Trump administration can move forward with deportation but gave his lawyers until late April to file applications for relief. His lawyers have indicated they will appeal the ruling, and they are separately suing the government for his release.",
      "Mahdawi told CBS News he began taking precautions for his own safety, including avoiding public spaces, after Khalil's detention. Still, when he received word of a citizenship appointment, he chose to attend \u2014 though he suspected it may lead to his detention.",
      "\"It's an irony. The irony of destiny. And I accept the outcome,\" Mahdawi said a day beforehand. \"If my story will become another story for the struggle to have justice and democracy in this country, let it be.\"",

      "During his speech at the Advocates, Counselors and Representatives for the Disabled conference in Chicago, Biden assailed President Trump's administration but did not name Mr. Trump directly. He also didn't address his departure from last year's presidential race.",
      "The former president called Social Security a \"sacred promise.\" He touted his administration's efforts to cut Social Security fraud, and mocked claims by the Trump administration \u2014 including Mr. Trump's cost-cutting czar Elon Musk \u2014 that scores of implausibly old people are collecting payments.",
      "\"By the way, those 300-year-old folk getting that Social Security, I want to meet them,\" Biden said. \"Hell of a thing, man. I'm looking for longevity.\"",
      "Biden criticized Mr. Trump's tax cuts in his first term by referring to \"the last time this guy had the job,\" and said \"this new administration\" has \"done so much damage\" to the Social Security Administration by cutting staff. He also assailed Musk for calling Social Security a \"Ponzi scheme\" and Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick for suggesting his mother-in-law wouldn't complain if she missed a payment \u2014 but didn't name either of them.",
      "He blasted \"some Republican members of Congress\" for, in his view, seeking to \"cut and gut\" Social Security: \"Who the hell do they think they are?\"",
      "The 82-year-old former president, who left office on Jan. 20, has until now largely remained out of the spotlight. And Biden's appearance comes as Democrats have sought to reorganize themselves after the party endured bruising losses in the 2024 elections, while Mr. Trump has continued to hurl criticism at his predecessor in the three months since he returned to office.",
      "Former Maryland Gov. Martin O'Malley, who served as Commissioner of the Social Security Administration under Biden, introduced Biden, and former Sens. Roy Blunt of Missouri and Debbie Stabenow of Michigan are set to make addresses later in the week.",
      "\"We are honored President Biden has selected the 2025 ACRD Conference to address the nation,\" O'Malley, an adviser to the group, said in a statement, while citing \"widespread concern the progress recently made for Social Security will be tragically reversed.\"",
      "The former president's appearance comes as Democratic leaders have warned of threats to Social Security amid the Trump administration's slashing of government programs and agencies under the Department of Government Efficiency, or DOGE. Concerns about the health of the program amid recent attempts to significantly shrink the agency have abounded.",
      "House Minority Leader Hakeem Jeffries is leading his members on a number of days of action focused on opposing the Trump administration as Congress is in recess, with a \"Save Social Security Day of Action\" Tuesday. The minority leader held a news conference Tuesday morning, where he stressed that Social Security \"faces an unprecedented assault.\"",
      "\"Donald Trump, Elon Musk and House Republicans think that Social Security is a ponzi scheme,\" Jeffries said, adding that \"it is unacceptable, unconscionable and un-American that Donald Trump, Elon Musk and House Republicans are dismantling and closing Social Security offices, jacking up wait times and preventing hard-working Americans from securing their benefits.\"",

    "story": [
      "Meta CEO Mark Zuckerberg sparred Tuesday with a Federal Trade Commission attorney over the meaning of emails the Facebook founder wrote about why he wanted to acquire Instagram, as a historic antitrust trial alleging Meta illegally monopolized the social media market went into its second day.",
      "Zuckerberg returned to the witness stand on Tuesday to defend Meta's purchase of Instagram and WhatsApp, in a trial that could force Meta to divest the two apps, startups the tech giant bought more than a decade ago which have since grown into social media powerhouses.",
      "Daniel Matheson, who is leading the FTC's case against Meta, contends that Zuckerberg bought Instagram because he saw it as a threat to his company, not because he thought he could make it thrive.",
      "While questioning Zuckerberg on Tuesday morning, Matheson noted that the CEO had referred to Instagram as being a \"rapidly growing, threatening, network.\"",
      "But Zuckerberg, who is the first witness called in the trial, said while Matheson was able to show documents in court that indicated his concern about Instagram's growth, he also had many conversations about how excited his company was to acquire Instagram to make a better product.",
      "Zuckerberg pushed back against Matheson's contention that the reason for buying the company was to neutralize a threat.",
      "\"I think that that mischaracterizes what the email was,\" Zuckerberg said.",
      "In his questioning of Zuckerberg, Matheson repeatedly brought up emails \u2014 many of them more than a decade old \u2014 written by Zuckerberg and his associates before the acquisition of Instagram.",
      "While acknowledging the documents, Zuckerberg has often sought to downplay the contents, saying he wrote them in the early stages of considering the acquisition and that what he wrote at the time didn't capture the full scope of his interest in the company.",
      "Matheson also brought up a February 2012 message in which Zuckerberg wrote to the former chief financial officer of Facebook that Instagram and Path, a social networking app, already had created meaningful networks that could be \"very disruptive to us.\"",
      "Zuckerberg testified that the message was written in the context of a broad discussion about whether they should buy companies to accelerate their own developments.",
      "The CEO was also questioned about why he bought Instagram and WhatsApp instead of building new apps.",
      "\"I'm sure we could have built an app, whether it would have succeeded or not, I think is a matter of speculation\u2026\u00a0 building a new app is hard, and many more times than not, when we've tried to build a new app, it hasn't gotten a lot of traction,\" Zuckerberg said.",
      "Zuckerberg also repeatedly disputed the government's claim that acquiring Instagram was bad for competition and for consumers.",
      "\"What I was focused on is the software infrastructure of different services that they (Instagram) can plug into. I think the explicit strategy for the Instagram integration was that we wanted to let Kevin and Mike, the founders basically tell us what services they needed from Meta in order to help improve the quality of growing Instagram faster,\" he said.",
      "The trial is one of the first big tests of President Donald Trump's FTC's ability to challenge Big Tech. The lawsuit was filed against Meta \u2014 then called Facebook \u2014 in 2020, during Trump's first term. It claims the company bought Instagram and WhatsApp to squash competition and establish an illegal monopoly in the social media market.",
      "Facebook bought Instagram \u2014 which was a photo-sharing app with no ads \u2014 for $1 billion in 2012.",
      "Instagram was the first company Facebook bought and kept running as a separate app. Until then, Facebook was known for smaller \"acqui-hires\" \u2014 a popular Silicon Valley deal in which a company purchases a startup as a way to hire its talented workers, then shuts the acquired company down. Two years later, it did it again with the messaging app WhatsApp, which it purchased for $22 billion.",
      "Narrow market definition",
      "WhatsApp and Instagram helped Facebook move its business from desktop computers to mobile devices, and to remain popular with younger generations as rivals like Snapchat (which it also tried, but failed, to buy) and TikTok emerged.",
      "However, the FTC has a narrow definition of Meta's competitive market, excluding companies like TikTok, YouTube and Apple's messaging service from being considered rivals to Instagram and WhatsApp.",
      "Meta, meanwhile, says the FTC's lawsuit \"defies reality.\"",
      "\"The evidence at trial will show what every 17-year-old in the world knows: Instagram, Facebook and WhatsApp compete with Chinese-owned TikTok, YouTube, X, iMessage and many others. More than 10 years after the FTC reviewed and cleared our acquisitions, the Commission's action in this case sends the message that no deal is ever truly final,\" the company said in a statement.",

    "story": [
      "The Trump administration can't immediately revoke the deportation protections and work permits of hundreds of thousands of migrants from Cuba, Haiti, Nicaragua and Venezuela who entered the U.S. legally under a Biden-era program, a federal judge ruled Monday.",
      "U.S. District Court Judge Indira Talwani blocked the Trump administration from moving forward with its plan to terminate the legal status of those migrants on April 24. The administration had warned those affected by its announcement that they would need to self deport by that date or face arrest and deportation by federal immigration agents.",
      "But Talwani suspended the deportation warnings the government had sent and prohibited officials from revoking the legal protection, known as immigration parole, that the Biden administration granted to more than half a million Cubans, Haitians, Nicaraguans and Venezuelans.",
      "Talwani said those mass parole terminations could not happen without each case being reviewed.",
      "The \"early termination, without any case-by-case justification, of legal status for noncitizens who have complied with DHS programs and entered the country lawfully undermines the rule of law,\" wrote Talwani, who sits on the federal district court in Boston.",
      "Monday's ruling is a significant reprieve for those who arrived under a policy the Biden administration argued promoted legal immigration and dissuaded migrants from crossing the southern border unlawfully.",
      "Under that program, known as CHNV, a total of 532,000 migrants from Cuba, Haiti, Nicaragua and Venezuela were allowed to fly to the U.S. after securing a sponsorship from U.S.-based individuals. Upon entry, they were granted immigration parole and allowed to work in the U.S. lawfully for two years.",
      "Biden administration officials partially credited the policy for a sharp reduction in illegal border crossings by migrants from the four countries whose citizens were eligible to be sponsored. But the program was not implemented without controversy.",
      "Republican-led states challenged the policy's legality in federal court, arguing that the parole authority did not grant the federal government the power to admit such large numbers of foreigners through a program with broad eligibility rules.",
      "The Biden administration paused the initiative for several weeks in 2024 due to concerns about fraudulent applications. It also declined to allow those who arrived under the policy to renew their parole beyond the two-year period, saying they could seek other benefits, like asylum or temporary protected status, to remain in the U.S.",
      "The CHNV policy was paused immediately after President Trump returned to the White House in January. His administration quickly took steps to dismantle parole-based immigration policies, which it argued exceeded the president's authority. Trump administration officials have also argued those allowed into the U.S. under the CHNV initiative were not properly vetted.",
      "Last month, the Department of Homeland Security said it would give CHNV beneficiaries 30 days to leave the U.S. voluntarily, or it would seek their arrest and removal from the country. Officials said they would prioritize the arrest of migrants who had failed to apply for another immigration benefit, like asylum or a green card.",
      "In a statement Tuesday, DHS spokeswoman Tricia McLaughlin denounced the CHNV policy, claiming it \"unleashed over 530,000 poorly vetted aliens into America, fueling crime and stealing jobs \u2014 forcing our agents in the field to ignore rampant fraud.\"",
      "\"While this ruling delays justice and undermines the integrity of our immigration system, Secretary (Kristi) Noem will use every legal option at the Department's disposal to end this chaos, prioritizing the safety of Americans,\" McLaughlin added.",
      "The ruling is another legal setback for the Trump administration and its effort to discontinue Biden administration immigration programs that protect hundreds of thousands of migrants from deportation.",
      "Late last month, a federal judge in California prevented the administration from ending a Temporary Protected Status policy that shields more than 350,000 Venezuelans in the U.S. from deportation.",

    "summary": "The federal government has frozen $2.2 billion\u200b in funding for the Ivy League school.",
    "story": [
      "President Trump issued a new threat to Harvard University on Tuesday after the federal government froze $2.2 billion in grant funding for the institution, suggesting that the Ivy League school \"should lose its tax-exempt status and be taxed as a political entity.\"",
      "The president's latest statement came after the Cambridge, Massachusetts institution announced Monday that it will reject a list of demands from the Trump administration governing the school's policies and leadership. Harvard is the latest university to be targeted by the Trump administration, which is using federal funding as leverage to try to change internal governance at universities and how they manage student expression on campus.",
      "\"Perhaps Harvard should lose its Tax Exempt Status and be Taxed as a Political Entity if it keeps pushing political, ideological, and terrorist inspired/supporting 'Sickness?'\" Mr. Trump wrote on Truth Social Tuesday. \"Remember, Tax Exempt Status is totally contingent on acting in the PUBLIC INTEREST!\"",
      "Nearly all public and private colleges in the United States are exempt from paying taxes because they are educational organizations, according to the Association of American Universities.",
      "Harvard rejects Trump's demands",
      "The conflict between some universities and the Trump administration stems from pro-Palestinian encampments that grew at Harvard Yard and on other college campuses last year. The Trump administration said at the end of March it was reviewing about $9 billion in grants with Harvard as it investigates alleged antisemitic incidents at colleges.",
      "A letter\u00a0the Trump administration sent Harvard on April 11 demanded several changes, including leadership reforms at the school and an end to diversity, equity and inclusion policies. Harvard President Alan Garber responded by saying the university \"will not surrender its independence or relinquish its constitutional rights.\"",
      "\"I think so many of us want to work at a place and be part of a community that stands up for its principles, right?\" Harvard political science professor Ryan Enos said. \"If you don't have that, you don't have anything.\"",
      "Harvard's endowment and federal funding",
      "Earlier this year, Harvard announced a hiring freeze in response to \"rapidly shifting federal policies.\" Much of the federal funding Harvard receives goes toward medical and scientific research.",
      "Harvard Medical School, for example, says federal support has \"enabled innovations in cancer immunotherapy, treatments for diabetes and obesity, therapies for autoimmune diseases, the first gene-editing therapy for\u00a0sickle cell disease, and more.\"",
      "\"It's not just that things have been stopped cold, which a lot of it has,\" Enos said. \"One day, they're doing research and then the next day they can't. It's also the fact that they can't plan.\"",
      "But Shabbos Kestenbaum, who received his master's degree from Harvard and campaigned for Mr. Trump, says this sort of penalty on the university is long overdue.",
      "\"What the federal government is doing is saying, 'You have a track record of discrimination, you have a track record of violating the civil rights of your own students, and we're not going to fund this,'\" he said. \"Harvard is trying to, you know, have its cake and eat it too.\"",
      "With Harvard reporting an endowment of more than $53 billion last year, some critics may wonder why the school needs federal funding at all.",
      "\"There is some truth to that, of course. That's why it's important for Harvard to fight,\" Enos said. \"They're sort of digging in for battle, and we all have to prepare to go through that now.\"",

    "summary": "Cody Balmer was charged with attempted murder, terrorism and other counts after officials said he intentionally set a fire at the Pennsylvania Governor's Residence.",
    "story": [
      "A Pennsylvania man has been charged with attempted murder, terrorism and other offenses after a fire at the Governor's Residence in Harrisburg forced Gov. Josh Shapiro and his family to evacuate the home early Sunday morning, according to court documents filed in Dauphin County.",
      "Officials said Cody Balmer, 38, hopped a fence and intentionally set a fire at the residence early on Sunday, April 13, while Shapiro and his family were home. Balmer, of Harrisburg, was charged Monday with criminal homicide/attempted murder, terrorism, aggravated arson and more.",
      "Balmer was arraigned on the charges on Monday evening, and a judge denied bail. Earlier Monday, Pennsylvania State Police said Balmer was treated at a hospital for a \"medical event not related to this incident or his arrest.\" He was taken into custody on Sunday in the Harrisburg area.",
      "Shapiro said the attack was targeted, but officials don't know Balmer's specific motive yet.",
      "\"This kind of violence is becoming far too common in our society,\" Shapiro said. \"And I don't give a damn if it's coming from one particular side or the other, directed at one particular party or another, or one particular person or another, it is not OK, and it has to stop. We have to be better than this. We have a responsibility to all be better.\"",
      "Balmer's mother, Christie Balmer, told CBS News her son is \"mentally ill and he went off his medication.\"",
      "Christie Balmer said she tried to get her son \"picked up\" last week and reached out to four different police departments, but \"couldn't get anybody to help. So he was mentally ill, went off his meds, and this is what happened.\"",
      "State police said crews from the Harrisburg Bureau of Fire went to the Governor's Residence on North Front Street in Dauphin County around 2 a.m. Sunday for a report of a fire.",
      "Shapiro said that he and his family were asleep at the home when the fire broke out. The Pennsylvania governor said they woke up to bangs on the door by the Pennsylvania State Police. Shapiro, his wife, Lori, and his children, along with two dogs and the relatives staying with them, evacuated the Governor's Residence as Harrisburg fire crews worked to extinguish the blaze.",
      "The Pennsylvania governor said that no one was injured, and the fire was brought under control.",
      "The fire happened after Shapiro, who is Jewish, and his family celebrated the first night of Passover. Shapiro declined to call the fire a hate crime but said that the blaze won't deter him from doing his job or celebrating his faith.",
      "\"I'm not fearful,\" Shapiro said. \"I'm obviously emotional. I'm worried about my family. I want my kids to be OK. When we were in the State Dining Room last night, gathered with the community and family and friends, we told the story of Passover, and it's a story of going from bondage, from slavery, into freedom. I think it's an important story, both literally and figuratively, to tell, and I refuse to be trapped by the bondage that someone attempts to put on me by attacking us, as they did here last night. I refuse to let anyone who had evil intentions like that stop me from doing the work that I love, stop me from being a leader of this commonwealth and looking out for all Pennsylvanians. I will not be deterred in my work, and I will not be afraid to do that work.\"",
      "Pennsylvania State Police Troop H is investigating the fire, which they said caused significant damage to a portion of the home. State police encourages anyone with information related to the fire to call 1-800-4PA TIPS (1-800-472-8477).",
      "The Governor's Residence was built on the Susquehanna River and is described as a 29,000-square-foot Georgian-style home designed by architect George Ewing.",
      "The home has housed eight governors and their families, according to the state's website.",
      "Shapiro spoke with FBI Director Kash Patel and said he promised all the resources necessary for the investigation.",
      "\"Lori and I are overwhelmed by the prayers and the messages of support that we've received from all across Pennsylvania and all across the United States,\" an emotional Shapiro said. \"We've heard from our fellow governors and first spouses. We've heard from several of the former governors of Pennsylvania. Heard from so many friends and loved ones. We've heard from so many caring citizens of this great commonwealth. I want you all to know that your prayers lift us up, and in this moment of darkness, we are choosing to see light. We appreciate the light that you have shined upon us.\"",
      "In the Oval Office on Monday, President Trump condemned the attack.",
      "\"The attacker basically wasn't a fan of anybody, probably just a whack job,\" Trump said. \"And certainly a thing like that cannot be allowed to happen.\"",
      "Who is Cody Balmer, and how did he enter the Pennsylvania Governor's Residence?",
      "Pennsylvania State Police Lt. Col. George Bivens said that Balmer climbed over a fence and \"evaded troopers\" while they were searching for him on the property before the fire.",
      "Bivens said that Balmer broke into the Pennsylvania Governor's Residence and set the fire with a homemade incendiary device.",
      "It's unclear if Balmer knew the layout of the Pennsylvania Governor's Residence, but he was inside the house for less than one minute, according to Bivens.",
      "\"That's all part of the ongoing investigation. In terms of the layout, I will tell you that he clearly had a plan,\" Bivens said. \"He was very methodical in his approach and moved through it without a lot of hurry, again, in a very methodical, planned manner, and carried it out, although in a very short period of time.\"",
      "A security review is currently underway to find out how Balmer was able to enter and then exit the property after allegedly setting the fire. There will also be extra security around Shapiro and the Pennsylvania Governor's Residence following the incident, officials said.",
      "Balmer served as a construction equipment repairer in the Army Reserve from April 2004 to June 2012 with no deployments, according to Heather J. Hagan, a U.S. Army spokesperson. Hagan said Balmer was a sergeant when he left the Army.",
      "Public records point to an unstable background for Balmer, including custody battles over his kids and a near foreclosure on a home.",
      "Court records show Balmer pleaded guilty a decade ago to a scheme involving forged documents.",
      "In 2023, he was arrested and charged with assault in connection with a violent domestic dispute involving his wife and son. According to the affidavit, Balmer told investigators he had taken a bottle of pills in an attempt to kill himself. That case is ongoing.",
      "Late Sunday night, an auto-repair shop where Balmer is believed to have worked in the past posted to Facebook, \"In light of current events regarding a former employee of ours, we would like to say that he has not worked for us for over two years. While we are saddened to learn of these current charges, we fully support our men and women in law enforcement as well as our government officials. \u00a0We have no further comment at this time.\"",
      "Pennsylvania leaders respond after Governor's Residence fire",
      "Leaders from the commonwealth and surrounding areas posted statements on social media about the fire, the Shapiro family's safety and the emergency crews' response.",
      "Former President Joe Biden wrote on social media Monday, \"Jill and I are disgusted by the attack on the Shapiro family and their home during the first night of Passover. We are relieved that they are safe and grateful to the first responders. There is no place for this type of evil in America, and as I told the Governor yesterday, we must stand united against hatred and violence.\"",
      "Former Pennsylvania Gov. Tom Ridge posted on\u00a0social media\u00a0that he and his wife are thankful the Shapiro family made it out safely, saying, \"The images showing the damage to the home we lived in with our children for nearly eight years are heartbreaking.\" Another former commonwealth leader, Gov. Mark Schweiker, called the fire, which state police are investigating as arson, a \"despicable act of cowardice.\"",
      "Lt. Gov. Austin Davis posted his sentiments on\u00a0social media, writing in part, \"I won't speculate on motivations, but I will say that targeting elected officials and their family members with violence is never acceptable.\"",
      "Democratic Speaker of the Pennsylvania House Rep. Joanna McClinton\u00a0said in part, \"cowardly acts of violence meant to stoke fear have no place in our commonwealth.\"",
      "New Jersey Sen. Andy Kim additionally condemned the fire,\u00a0writing, \"Violence can never be tolerated.\"",

    "summary": "The White House has taken pains to say administration officials are unified on the tariff effort announced on April 2, which the White House dubbed \"Liberation Day.\"",
    "story": [
      "In private conversations weeks ago, senior advisers close to President Trump warned that some tariff proposals could have devastating effects on global financial markets and send the U.S. economy spiraling.",
      "The White House has taken pains to say administration officials are unified on the tariff effort announced on April 2, which the White House dubbed \"Liberation Day.\"",
      "But internal disagreements over that policy manifested well before that, with leaders offering predictions of serious economic instability, multiple sources familiar with the exchanges told CBS News.",
      "One argument took place between Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent and White House trade adviser Peter Navarro in chief of staff Susie Wiles' office in late March, in the days before Mr. Trump's \"reciprocal\" tariffs were announced.",
      "The following account is from multiple sources familiar with the meeting. Navarro wanted 25% across-the-board tariffs on all $3 trillion of imported goods. Bessent, who made a career as a Wall Street investor, warned of market turmoil and outlined various scenarios.",
      "Heated words flew.",
      "Navarro sneered: \"You're doing the same thing they did in the first term. Don't pull this. Don't be him.\"",
      "Advisers in the room later told people close to them that they interpreted that to mean don't be like then-Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin or then-economic adviser Gary Cohn, both former Goldman Sachs executives who served in the first Trump administration and pushed back against hardline tariffs ideas.",
      "Spokespeople for the Treasury Department declined to comment on the spat.",
      "Navarro told CBS News: \"Fake news from malevolent anonymous sources. Scottie and I don't argue. We think things through.\"",
      "In other internal debates before the Rose Garden announcement, Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick predicted that certain tariffs could cause global disaster.",
      "Bessent on multiple occasions pushed for a calculated rollout with more targeted tariffs than what Navarro pushed.",
      "Elon Musk, the administration's top government efficiency adviser, was not part of key decision meetings on the tariffs. Musk was careful to not broadcast his strong disdain for certain aspects of the tariff policy except in very small circles, although some of that eventually emerged in criticism of Navarro on social media. Musk also publicly advocated for zero tariffs between the United States and the European Union.",
      "Navarro maintained that there should be no negotiations \u2014 the tariffs should be left in place to generate revenue and to muscle manufacturers into domestic production.",
      "But in the days after the \"Liberation Day\" announcement, financial markets reeled, proving correct some of Trump's advisers' predictions. Trillions of dollars were erased from the major stock indexes and the bond market sent alarming signals. Wall Street investment firms like Goldman Sachs predicted higher odds of recession and some of America's top CEOs publicly expressed their concerns.",
      "In an interview on the morning of April 9, America's top banker, JPMorgan Chase CEO Jamie Dimon told Maria Bartiromo that a recession was \"a likely outcome.\"",
      "Delta CEO Ed Bastian said on CNBC that the turmoil was \"self-inflicted,\" and announced that the company was suspending its full year guidance given the \"uncharted, unprecedented uncertainty.\"",
      "The same morning, Mr. Trump attempted to reassure investors and executives and posted: \"BE COOL! Everything is going to work out well.\"",
      "By the afternoon, with input from Bessent and Lutnick, Mr. Trump opened a pressure release valve and paused some of the tariffs for 90 days.",
      "\"Well, I thought that people were jumping a little bit out of line,\" Mr. Trump said. \"They were getting yippy \u2014 you know, they were getting a little bit yippy, a little bit afraid.\"",

      "There has been vigorous debate in scientific circles about whether the planet K2-18b, which is 124 light years away in the Leo constellation, could be an ocean world capable of hosting microbial life, at least.",
      "Using the James Webb Space Telescope, a British-U.S. team of researchers detected signs of two chemicals in the planet's atmosphere long considered to be \"biosignatures\" indicating extraterrestrial life.",
      "On Earth, the chemicals dimethyl sulfide (DMS) and dimethyl disulfide are produced only by life, mostly microscopic marine algae called phytoplankton.",
      "The researchers emphasized caution, saying that more observations were needed to confirm these findings, and that they were not announcing a definitive discovery.",
      "But the implications could be huge, according to Nikku Madhusudhan, a Cambridge University astrophysicist and lead author of the study, published in The Astrophysical Journal Letters.",
      "Madhusudhan told BBC News that he hopes to obtain the clinching evidence soon.",
      "\"This is the strongest evidence yet there is possibly life out there,\" he said. \"I can realistically say that we can confirm this signal within one to two years.\"",
      "But outside experts pointed to disputes over previous discoveries about the exoplanet, adding that these chemicals could have been created by unknown means having nothing to do with life.",
      "\"Goldilocks\" zone",
      "More than eight times the mass of Earth and 2.5 times as big, K2-18b is rare among the roughly 6,000 exoplanets discovered so far in that it orbits its star in a habitable or \"goldilocks\" zone.",
      "This means it is neither too hot nor too cold to have liquid water, considered the most important ingredient for life.",
      "Telescopes observe such far-off exoplanets when they cross in front of their star, allowing astronomers to analyze how molecules block the light streaming through their atmosphere.",
      "In 2023, the Webb telescope detected methane and carbon dioxide in K2-18b's atmosphere, the first time such carbon-based molecules were detected on an exoplanet in a habitable zone.",
      "It also detected weak signals of the chemical DMS, leading astronomers to turn Webb towards the planet again a year ago, this time using its mid-infrared instrument to detect different wavelengths of light.",
      "They found much stronger signs of the chemicals, though still well below the \"five sigma\" threshold of statistical significance scientists seek for such discoveries.",
      "Even if the results are confirmed, it would not necessarily mean that the planet is home to life.",
      "Last year, scientists found traces of DMS on a comet, which suggested it can be produced in non-organic ways and is perhaps not a \"biosignature.\"",
      "However the concentration of the chemical observed on K2-18b appears to be thousands of times stronger than levels on Earth, likely suggesting a biological origin, Madhusudhan said.",
      "\"Hellishly hot\"",
      "K2-18b has long been considered the premier candidate for a \"hycean planet\" \u2014 an ocean world bigger than Earth with a hydrogen-rich atmosphere.",
      "Hycean planets, much like Earth, are covered in oceans and have atmospheres rich with hydrogen, an element that is essential for life. Many of the planets are bigger and hotter than Earth \u2014 up to 2.6 times larger than our planet and reaching atmospheric temperatures up to nearly 200 degrees Celsius, or 392 degrees Fahrenheit.",
      "These planets would not be expected to be home to intelligent alien life, but rather tiny microbes similar to those in Earth's oceans billions of years ago.",
      "\"Hycean planets open a whole new avenue in our search for life elsewhere,\" Madhusudhan said previously.",
      "Some research has questioned whether the currently proposed hycean planets are too close to their stars to support liquid water \u2014 including K2-18b, which orbits its star every 33 days.",
      "Raymond Pierrehumbert, a planetary physics professor at Oxford University, has conducted separate research indicating K2-18b is too hot for life.",
      "If the planet did have water, it would be \"hellishly hot\" and uninhabitable, he told AFP, adding that oceans of lava were more plausible.",
      "Sara Seager, a professor of planetary science at MIT, called for patience, pointing to previous claims of water vapor in K2-18b's atmosphere that turned out to be a different gas.",
      "Madhusudhan estimated that it would take just 16 to 24 more hours of Webb's time to reach the five-sigma threshold, which could happen in the next few years.",
      "The current three-sigma is comparable to the odds of flipping a coin 10 times and getting the same result each time, Cambridge University statistician Stephen Burgess explained.",
      "Five sigma would be getting that result after 20 flips, and would mean \"we can be very confident that this observation isn't just a chance finding,\" he said.",
      "Even beyond K2-18b, Madhusudhan said Webb and future telescopes could allow humanity to discover life outside our home planet sooner than one might think.",

    "story": [
      "An ancient jawbone discovered in Taiwan belonged to an enigmatic group of early human ancestors called Denisovans, scientists reported Thursday.",
      "Relatively little is known about Denisovans, an extinct group of human cousins that interacted with Neanderthals and our own species, Homo sapiens.",
      "\"Denisovan fossils are very scarce,\" with only a few confirmed finds in East Asia, said study co-author Takumi Tsutaya at the Graduate University for Advanced Studies in Japan.",
      "So far, the only known Denisovan fossils include partial jawbones, a few teeth and part of a finger bone found in caves in Siberia and Tibet. Some scientists believe fossils found in a cave in Laos may also belong to Denisovans.",
      "The probable identification of the jawbone from Taiwan as Denisovan expands the region where scientists know these ancient people once lived, said Tsutaya.",
      "\"Denisovans must therefore have been capable of adapting to a wide range of habitat types,\" study co-author Frido Welker told the Reuters news agency.",
      "The partial jawbone was first recovered when a fishing operation dredged the seafloor in the Penghu Channel near the Taiwan Strait. After it was sold to an antique shop, a collector spotted it and purchased it in 2008, then later donated it to Taiwan's National Museum of Natural Science.",
      "Based on the composition of marine invertebrates found attached to it, the fossil was dated to the Pleistocene era. But exactly which species of early human ancestor it belonged to remained a mystery.",
      "The condition of the fossil made it impossible to study ancient DNA. But recently, scientists in Taiwan, Japan and Denmark were able to extract some protein sequences from the incomplete jawbone.",
      "An analysis showed some protein sequences resembled those contained in the genome of a Denisovan fossil recovered in Siberia. The findings were published in the journal Science.",
      "While the new research is promising, Rick Potts, director of the Smithsonian Institution's Human Origins Project, said he would like to see further data before confirming the Taiwan fossil as Denisovan.",
      "Potts, who was not involved in the new research, praised the study for \"a fantastic job of recovering some proteins.\" But he added, such a small sliver of material may not give a full picture.",
      "At one time, at least three human ancestor groups - Denisovans, Neanderthals and Homo sapiens - coexisted in Eurasia and sometimes interbred, researchers say.",
      "\"We can identity Neanderthal elements and Denisovan elements\" in the DNA of some people alive today, said Tsutaya.",
      "Scientists still don't know exactly why Denisovans went extinct.",
      "\"We have so little archaeological and fossil information about Denisovans that we can only speculate as to why they disappeared,\" Welker told Reuters. \"A lasting legacy, though, is that some human populations in East and Southeast Asia carry some Denisovan ancestry in their genomes today.\"",

      "They found much stronger signs of the chemicals, though still well below the \"five sigma\" threshold of statistical significance scientists seek for such discoveries.",
      "Even if the results are confirmed, it would not necessarily mean that the planet is home to life.",
      "Last year, scientists found traces of DMS on a comet, which suggested it can be produced in non-organic ways and is perhaps not a \"biosignature.\"",
      "However the concentration of the chemical observed on K2-18b appears to be thousands of times stronger than levels on Earth, likely suggesting a biological origin, Madhusudhan said.",
      "\"Hellishly hot\"",
      "K2-18b has long been considered the premier candidate for a \"hycean planet\" \u2014 an ocean world bigger than Earth with a hydrogen-rich atmosphere.",
      "Hycean planets, much like Earth, are covered in oceans and have atmospheres rich with hydrogen, an element that is essential for life. Many of the planets are bigger and hotter than Earth \u2014 up to 2.6 times larger than our planet and reaching atmospheric temperatures up to nearly 200 degrees Celsius, or 392 degrees Fahrenheit.",
      "These planets would not be expected to be home to intelligent alien life, but rather tiny microbes similar to those in Earth's oceans billions of years ago.",
      "\"Hycean planets open a whole new avenue in our search for life elsewhere,\" Madhusudhan said previously.",
      "Some research has questioned whether the currently proposed hycean planets are too close to their stars to support liquid water \u2014 including K2-18b, which orbits its star every 33 days.",
      "Raymond Pierrehumbert, a planetary physics professor at Oxford University, has conducted separate research indicating K2-18b is too hot for life.",
      "If the planet did have water, it would be \"hellishly hot\" and uninhabitable, he told AFP, adding that oceans of lava were more plausible.",
      "Sara Seager, a professor of planetary science at MIT, called for patience, pointing to previous claims of water vapor in K2-18b's atmosphere that turned out to be a different gas.",
      "Madhusudhan estimated that it would take just 16 to 24 more hours of Webb's time to reach the five-sigma threshold, which could happen in the next few years.",
      "The current three-sigma is comparable to the odds of flipping a coin 10 times and getting the same result each time, Cambridge University statistician Stephen Burgess explained.",
      "Five sigma would be getting that result after 20 flips, and would mean \"we can be very confident that this observation isn't just a chance finding,\" he said.",
      "Even beyond K2-18b, Madhusudhan said Webb and future telescopes could allow humanity to discover life outside our home planet sooner than one might think.",
      "\"This could be the tipping point, where suddenly the fundamental question of whether we're alone in the universe is one we're capable of answering,\" he said.",

      "\"We're throwing a lot at you,\" she told King.",
      "Knights said the astronauts have two phrases they can use up to 2 minutes and 30 seconds prior to liftoff, \"timeout\" and \"I will not fly.\" She said \"I will not fly\" removes an individual from the flight, which no one has ever done. On \"CBS Mornings\" on Tuesday, King said she didn't come close to using either phrase.",

      "\"My expectations were high, and they were drastically exceeded. The zero G (gravity) piece may have been one of the biggest surprises because it felt so normal, it felt almost like humans evolved to be in that environment. ... It's a very pleasurable experience,\" Bezos told reporters\u00a0after the successful 2021 spaceflight.",

      "How long was Gayle King and the crew in space?",
      "The journey to space and back, from liftoff to landing, lasted for about 11 minutes. Nearly three minutes into liftoff, the crew capsule separated from the booster and eventually reached the apogee, or the highest point of the flight.",
      "They floated for about 4 minutes before they made their return to Earth. First, drogue parachutes deployed followed by the main parachutes, bringing the history-making crew back down to the ground.

      "Unique design of Blue Origin's New Shepard spacecraft",
      "Blue Origin's spacecraft carries a crew of six and is fully autonomous, not controlled by a pilot on board.",
      "The crew capsule sits atop a liquid-hydrogen-fueled booster, which launches straight upwards, reaching a velocity of about 2,200 mph and subjecting the passengers to 3G \u2014 three times the normal force of gravity \u2014 before main engine cutoff, about two-and-a-half minutes into the flight.",
      "At an altitude of about 45 miles, the crew capsule is then released to continue soaring out of the lower atmosphere on its own, while the reusable booster heads back down to Earth to land on a nearby pad.",
      "About three-and-a-half minutes after lifoff, the crew capsule reaches a maximum altitude of just above 62 miles \u2014 the K\u00e1rm\u00e1n line, which the F\u00e9d\u00e9ration A\u00e9ronautique Internationale, an international body that certifies aerospace records, considers the dividing line between the discernible atmosphere and space.",
      "The crew experiences weightlessness from the moment the capsule separates from the booster until it arcs over the top of the trajectory and begins its descent. Moments after separating from the booster, passengers are able to unstrap and float about the cabin while enjoying spectacular views of Earth.",
      "After a few extraordinary minutes, though, it's time to strap in for the return home.",
      "\"It's about three minutes before the astronauts will get a warning to get back into their seats. And at that point, they have about 30 seconds. It's not going to be a rush, it's going to be very leisurely. All they have to do is be sitting in the seat and then as the G forces come on, our reentry will naturally push them back in the seat, so they have plenty of time to buckle back in,\" Gary Lai, a former Blue Origin engineer who helped design the New Shepard, said in an earlier interview with CBS News.",
      "Plunging back into the lower atmosphere, the capsule will rapidly decelerate, briefly subjecting the passengers to more than five times the normal force of gravity, before three large parachutes unfurl to slow the descent to about 16 mph. An instant before touchdown, pressurized nitrogen gas thrusters fire to slow the descent to walking pace.",
      "The New Shepard vehicle has a number of safeguards built in. It is equipped with a \"full envelope escape system\" that would propel the crew capsule away from a malfunctioning booster at any point from the launch pad on up, using an Aerojet Rocketdyne solid-fuel rocket motor embedded in the capsule.",
      "\"It will activate in a fraction of a second, it will light off and propel the capsule away from the booster to safety,\" Lai explained. \"Once it's far away, parachutes will deploy and we will execute a normal landing.\"",
      "The system is also designed to ensure a survivable landing even if two of the main parachutes fail to open and fully inflate.",

      "\"CBS Mornings\" co-host Gayle King took a historic trip to the edge of space on Monday alongside an all-women crew, whom she called fearless and inspiring.",
      "Journalist and philanthropist Lauren S\u00e1nchez led the all-female crew, an idea she pitched to her fianc\u00e9, Amazon and Blue Origin founder Jeff Bezos, shortly after he completed his own trip to space. King and S\u00e1nchez were joined by pop star Katy Perry, aerospace engineer Aisha Bowe, civil rights activist and astronaut Amanda Nguyen, and film producer Kerianne Flynn.",
      "\"These women are so badass. \u2026They have such amazing life stories, all that they've accomplished,\" King said on \"CBS Mornings\" after her trip to space was first announced.",
      "Here's a look at the women who joined Blue Origin's mission.",
      "Gayle King",
      "King, who recently celebrated her 70th birthday, said she was welcoming the new decade by jumping on the rare opportunity to travel to space \u2014 as long as she had the blessing of her family and friends.",
      "\"I wanted to open myself up to new adventures and step out of my comfort zone,\" King explained.",
      "\"I've made no secret of the fact that I'm very nervous but also very excited,\" said King, requesting that people send good wishes and good thoughts moving forward if they see her ahead of the launch. \"I'm nervous enough.\"",
      "Katy Perry",
      "Perry told \"CBS Mornings\" she would sing a tribute to Earth during the journey. She explained that her song choice would reflect the transformative perspective she anticipates experiencing in orbit.",
      "\"I think the perspective that we're all going to walk away from is like, 'Oh, my gosh, we have to protect our mother,'\" Perry said.",
      "Perry wrote on social media\u00a0in February, \"If you had told me that I would be part of the first ever all-female crew in space, I would have believed you. Nothing was beyond my imagination as a child. Although we didn't grow up with much, I never stopped looking at the world with hopeful WONDER!\"",
      "Perry said she wants to be a role model for her daughter.",
      "\"I work hard to live my life that way still, and I am motivated more than ever to be an example for my daughter that women should take up space (pun intended). That's why this opportunity is so incredible \u2014 so that I can show all of the youngest & most vulnerable among us to reach for the stars, literally and figuratively. I am honored to be among this diverse group of celestial sisters,\" she added.",
      "Lauren S\u00e1nchez",
      "S\u00e1nchez said the idea of leading an all-women crew emerged shortly after Bezos' 2021 spaceflight.",
      "\"When Jeff went up and he came back down, I was so excited for him,\" S\u00e1nchez told \"CBS Mornings.\" \"Within 24 hours he's like, 'Would you ever go up?' I was like, 'What?' I was like, 'Yes, I would go up.'\"",
      "She recalled that in that moment, she proposed an all-women mission.",
      "\"In that exact moment, I said, 'Could I take all women up?'\" S\u00e1nchez said. \"And he goes, 'That's a great idea.\"",
      "According to S\u00e1nchez, Bezos immediately supported the concept, noting that he believed there had never been an all-female flight.",
      "Aisha Bowe",
      "Bowe became the first person of Bahamian heritage to travel to space when she boarded the Blue Origin flight. She said she had been been preparing for this moment her whole life.",
      "\"I mean, I started my career thinking I was allergic to math. ... And here I'm sitting here, and I'm just like, we are going to space,\" Bowe, a former NASA rocket scientist and two-time tech company founder, told \"CBS Mornings\" in early April.",
      "She also gushed about her fellow crew members.",
      "\"This crew represents the best in the future of humanity. It's really space for the benefit of Earth,\" Bowe said.",
      "Bowe is excited for the endless possibilities awaiting future generations and is living proof that dreams can become reality.",
      "\"I did it because I saw all of you reach for the sky, and I knew it could, too,\" she said.",
      "Amanda Nguyen",
      "Nguyen, who transformed personal trauma into landmark legislation when she drafted the Sexual Assault Survivor Bill of Rights, made history as the first Vietnamese and Southeast Asian woman in space.",
      "\"What a historic crew. Each one of my crewmates represents a community. I'm so proud to be representing mine as the first Vietnamese woman in space,\" she told \"CBS Mornings\" in March.",
      "Nguyen discussed her plans to conduct two science experiments during the trip \u2014 one on plant pathology in partnership with the Vietnamese National Space Center and the second on women's health, focused specifically on menstruation.",
      "\"Women were barred from becoming astronauts at NASA early on because of menstruation. They didn't have the data to back that up,\" Nguyen, author of the newly released memoir \"Saving Five,\" explained.",
      "Kerianne Flynn",
      "Flynn, who grew up in Michigan, said she spent her childhood gazing at the stars with wonder but never imagined space travel would be in her future.",
      "\"This has been a dream of mine for a very long time,\" Flynn told \"CBS Mornings.\" \"It has felt mostly like a personal journey.\"",
      "Flynn reflected on meeting her fellow crew members on a video call in March on social media, writing that she was \"overwhelmed by profound joy and deep gratitude to be a part of this historic journey.\"",

      "\"It is very daunting when you think about the small number of people that have actually done it. I still get very uncomfortable when people say, 'astronaut,'\" King said. \"I in no means feel like an astronaut. They said, 'But, Gayle, if you go to space, you're an astronaut.'\"",
      "King said traveling to space was never her dream, but she considered the opportunity and message it would send.",
      "\"There was something about being part of the first female team to me,\" King said. \"The group of women that they put together is so extraordinary to me that I thought, 'Wow. Why would I not wanna be a part of that?'\"",
      "King, who turned 70 in December, said she never thought this experience would have been possible just 6 months ago.",
      "\"I look at some of these young people and say, 'keep up.' So I don't have hangups about 70, and what that means, and what that represents. I just think everybody can define it for themselves,\" she said.",
      "King admitted she's a nervous flier, but looks forward to the moment she achieves weightlessness.",
      "\"I'm looking forward to just floating in space, and just seeing what that feels like, and what that looks like,\" she said.",
      "She added she still has some practical concerns before liftoff.",
      "\"I find myself wondering, 'How do you get back into your seat after you get out of the seat and you're floating around?'\" King said laughing. \"'How do you get back down to your seat? Is it like swimming back down?' I'll learn that in training and try to float with some dignity.\"",
      "Astrophysicist Jackie Faherty gave King and Duthiers a preview at the American Museum of Natural History in New York of what she'll be looking at during the mission.",
      "\"You will reach an altitude where the atmosphere gets thinner, thinner, thinner, and then the sky will start to turn dark,\" Faherty told King about what she'll see 62 miles above the Earth.",
      "In a small bag that she plans on bringing with her to space, King has packed a locket from actress Drew Barrymore that has a photo of her daughter and son, a stuffed version of her grandson's favorite Sesame Street character, Tamir, and a bracelet made by a co-worker's 7-year-old daughter.",
      "Support for spaceflight",
      "Last week, King was surprised in a special \"Talk of the Table\" segment that featured a video of well-wishes and advice for her. The early sendoff included messages and advice from actor Tom Hanks, former NASA rocket scientist and tech founder Aisha Bowe, who is joining King on the spaceflight, the \"CBS Mornings\" family and many more.",
      "Most of all, she expressed her gratitude for her daughter, Kirby, son, Will, and Oprah for their support and encouragement.",
      "\"If any of the three of them had said, 'I don't think it's a good idea,' or, 'I'm worried,' I wouldn't have done it. But they were all so excited and enthusiastic for me.\"",
      "However, she acknowledged that if they were offered the same opportunity to fly to space, \"I don't think I would go, 'Yay! You should go,'\" though later added she would ultimately be supportive.",
      "Even her young grandchildren have shown their excitement.",
      "\"Luca's 3, so he understands. \u2026 He'll be 4 in September, so he knows Gaila's going on a rocket ship and he wanted to go.\"",
      "King explained they call her Gaila, a combination of Gayle and Gaia, a fitting reference for the surreal moment ahead of her.",

      "King's message to others",
      "Before the big countdown, King shared a simple message, saying she hopes others watching her and living the moment with her are proud, \"To know that I pulled this off that, it'll be an inspiration to somebody at some point in their lives. That's what I hope.\"",

    "link": "https://www.cbsnews.com/news/googles-digital-ad-network-illegal-monopoly-federal-judge/",
    "published": "Thu, 17 Apr 2025 14:20:00 -0400",
    "summary": "The ruling involving Google's online ad technology follows a similar case last year in which Google's search engine was declared a monopoly.",
    "story": [
      "Google has been branded an abusive monopolist by a federal judge for the second time in less than a year, this time for illegally exploiting some of its online marketing technology to boost the profits fueling an internet empire currently worth $1.8 trillion.",
      "The ruling issued Thursday by U.S. District Judge Leonie Brinkema in Virginia comes on the heels of a separate decision in August that concluded Google's namesake search engine has been illegally leveraging its dominance to stifle competition and innovation.",
      "After the U.S. Justice Department targeted Google's ubiquitous search engine during President Donald Trump's first administration, the same agency went after the company's lucrative digital advertising network in 2023 during President Joe Biden's ensuing administration in an attempt to undercut the power that Google has amassed since its inception in a Silicon Valley garage in 1998.",
      "Although antitrust regulators prevailed both times, the battle is likely to continue for several more years as Google tries to overturn the two monopoly decisions in appeals while forging ahead in the new and highly lucrative technological frontier of artificial intelligence.",
      "The next step in the latest case is a penalty phase that will likely begin late this year or early next year. The same so-called remedy hearings in the search monopoly case are scheduled to begin Monday in Washington D.C., where Justice Department lawyers will try to convince U.S. District Judge Amit Mehta to impose a sweeping punishment that includes a proposed requirement for Google to sell its Chrome web browser.",
      "Brinkema's 115-page decision centers on the marketing machine that Google has spent the past 17 years building around its search engine and other widely used products and services, including its Chrome browser, YouTube video site and digital maps.",
      "The system was largely built around a series of acquisitions that started with Google's $3.2 billion purchase of online ad specialist DoubleClick in 2008. U.S. regulators approved the deals at the time they were made before realizing that they had given the Mountain View, California, company a platform to manipulate the prices in an ecosystem that a wide range of websites depend on for revenue and provides a vital marketing connection to consumers.",
      "The Justice Department lawyers argued that Google built and maintained dominant market positions in a technology trifecta used by website publishers to sell ad space on their webpages, as well as the technology that advertisers use to get their ads in front of consumers, and the ad exchanges that conduct automated auctions in fractions of a second to match buyer and seller.",
      "After evaluating the evidence presented during a lengthy trial that\u00a0concluded just before Thanksgiving last year,\u00a0Brinkema reached a decision that rejected the Justice Department's assertions that Google has been mistreating advertisers while concluding the company has been abusing its power to stifle competition to the detriment of online publishers forced to rely on its network for revenue.",
      "\"For over a decade, Google has tied its publisher ad server and ad exchange together through contractual policies and technological integration, which enabled the company to establish and protect its monopoly power in these two markets.\" Brinkema wrote. \"Google further entrenched its monopoly power by imposing anticompetitive policies on its customers and eliminating desirable product features.\"",
      "Despite that rebuke, Brinkema also concluded that Google didn't break the law when it snapped Doubleclick nor when it followed up that deal a few years later by buying another service, Admeld.",
      "The Justice Department \"failed to show that the DoubleClick and Admeld acquisitions were anticompetitive,\" Brinkema wrote. \"Although these acquisitions helped Google gain monopoly power in two adjacent ad tech markets, they are insufficient, when viewed in isolation, to prove that Google acquired or maintained this monopoly power through exclusionary practices.\"",
      "That finding may help Google fight off any attempt to force it to sell its advertising technology to stop its monopolistic behavior.",
      "The Justice Department didn't immediately comment on the judge's decision.",
      "In a statement, Google said it will appeal the ruling.",
      "\"We disagree with the Court's decision regarding our publisher tools,\" said Lee-Anne Mulholland, Google's vice president of regulatory affairs. \"Publishers have many options and they choose Google because our ad tech tools are simple, affordable and effective.\"",
      "Analysts such as Brian Pitz of BMO Markets had been predicting that Google would likely lose the case, helping to brace investors for the latest setback to the company and its corporate parent, Alphabet Inc., whose shares declined 1% in afternoon trading. Alphabet's stock has plunged by 20% so far this year.",
      "As it did in the search monopoly case, Google and its corporate parent Alphabet vehemently denied the Justice Department's allegations. Their lawyers argued the government largely based its case on an antiquated concept of a market that existed a decade ago while underestimating a highly competitive market for advertising spending that includes the likes of Facebook parent Meta Platforms, Amazon, Microsoft and Comcast.",
      "The market as drawn in the Justice Department's case didn't include ads that appear on mobile apps, streaming television services, or other platforms to which internet users have increasingly migrated, prompting Google lawyer Karen Dunn to compare the government's definition a \"time capsule with a BlackBerry, an iPod and a Blockbuster video card\" during her opening statement\u00a0when the trial began last September.",
      "At trial, the Justice Department's lawyers emphasized the harm to news publishers that has arisen from Google's alleged dominance of the marketplace. Witnesses from Gannett, the publisher of USA Today and other newspapers, and News Corp., the publisher of The Wall Street Journal, testified about the difficulties they have faced and what they said was a lack of alternatives to Google's ad tech. Those companies rely on online advertising to fund their news operations and make their articles free to consumers on the internet, government lawyers have argued.",
      "Now, government is in position to try to dismantle that byzantine ad system. When the case was filed more than two years ago during the Biden administration, the Justice Department asserted Google should be forced to sell, at a minimum, its Ad Manager product, which includes the technology used by website publishers and the ad exchange.",

    "story": [
      "Meta Platforms CEO Mark Zuckerberg took the stand Monday in a Washington, D.C., courtroom to defend his social media company from federal allegations that the technology giant is a monopoly.",
      "Meta, the parent company of Facebook, Instagram and WhatsApp, is facing off with the Federal Trade Commission on Monday, for Day one of a landmark antitrust trial that could result in the company's breakup. For Zuckerberg, the case could determine whether the business empire he started building while still a student at Harvard University will be forced to break apart.",
      "The trial will be the first big test of the FTC's willingness under President Trump to challenge Big Tech, a long-time target of Republicans. The lawsuit was initially filed against Meta \u2014 then called Facebook \u2014 in 2020, during Mr. Trump's first term, before being amended in 2021.",
      "In its\u00a0complaint, the FTC accuses Meta of \"anticompetitive conduct,\" alleging that the company's ownership of Instagram and WhatsApp gives it excessive control of the social media market.",
      "\"There's nothing wrong with Meta innovating,\" said Daniel Matheson, lead attorney for the FTC in his opening statements for the agency Monday, \"It's what happened next that is a problem.\"",
      "During his testimony Monday, Zuckerberg defended his decision to buy Instagram and pushed back against FTC claims that he did not invest in developing the app.",
      "Purchased by Facebook in\u00a02012\u00a0and\u00a02014, respectively, Instagram and WhatsApp have grown into social media powerhouses.",
      "To restore competition, Meta must part ways with Instagram and WhatsApp, the government agency says in\u00a0court filings. The FTC also wants Meta to provide the government with prior notice for any future mergers and acquisitions.",
      "With the landmark trial underway, here's what you need to know.",
      "How long will the Meta trial last, and who will testify?",
      "The trial, which begins Monday in federal court in Washington, D.C., is expected to last several weeks.",
      "U.S. District Judge James Boasberg will preside over the case, which could see a range of witnesses including Meta CEO and founder Zuckerberg; former Meta Chief Operating Officer Sheryl Sandberg; former Meta Chief Technology Officer Mike Schroepfer; Instagram co-founder Kevin Systrom; and executives from rival social media platforms.",
      "What is happening in court today?",
      "The FTC and Meta made their opening arguments on Monday, with witness testimony expected to start in the afternoon.",
      "In his opening statement, lead FTC attorney Matheson said Meta was struggling to compete with the fast-growing WhatsApp and Instagram platforms and in buying them, the tech giant was \"eliminating immediate threats,\" to their market.",
      "Meta said the company \"did nothing wrong\" by acquiring Instagram and WhatsApp. Meta attorney Mark Hansen said in his opening statement that the two apps have grown substantially under the tech company's ownership and that there is no evidence to prove Meta is a monopoly.",
      "If Meta had monopoly power, it would exercise control over pricing in the social media space, Hansen said. But Meta's services are free, he noted. \"How can the FTC maintain this monopolization case when [Meta] has never charged users a cent,\" Hansen said.",
      "After the opening statements, Zuckerberg was the first person called to the stand to testify. His\u00a0testimony largely focused on Facebook's efforts to build a rival photo app that could compete with Instagram, before it decided to ultimately buy the company in 2012.",
      "Zuckerberg admitted Facebook was struggling with mobile users in the early 2010s. \"Our whole company had been built up to that point\" for desktop.",
      "Referencing email communications sent by the Meta executive, the FTC pointed out that Zuckerberg had been eyeing the progress of competitor Instagram. Facebook at the time was working on launching a new photo app.",
      "According to the FTC, Zuckerberg sent an email in Feb 2011 saying \"Instagram seems like it's growing quickly\" that mentioned their numbers and uploads.",
      "In 2012, Zuckerberg sent another email in which he described his rationale for buying Instagram, saying it was a good photo-sharing network, according to the FTC. At that point Facebook was \"so far behind that we don't even understand how far behind we are,\" he said, adding, \"I worry that it will take us too long to catch up.\"",
      "Zuckerberg is scheduled to return to court Tuesday morning to continue testimony.",
      "What's at stake?",
      "The showdown is the most significant legal challenge brought against Meta in the company's roughly 20-year history. If the FTC is successful, Meta could be forced to divest Instagram and WhatsApp. Instagram, which Meta has owned for over a decade, accounts for half of the company's overall advertising revenue.",
      "\"Instagram has also been picking up the slack for Facebook on the user front, particularly among young people, for a long time,\" Emarketer analyst Jasmine Enberg told the Associated Press.",
      "\"The trial also comes as Meta is trying to bring back OG Facebook in an effort to appeal to Gen Z and younger users as they join social media. Social media usage is far more fragmented today than it was in 2012 when Facebook acquired Instagram, and Facebook isn't where the cool college kids hang out anymore. Meta needs Instagram to continue growing, especially as more advertisers think Instagram-first with their Meta budgets,\" she added.",
      "Meta, headquartered in Menlo Park, California, earned over $164 billion in revenue in 2024. Facebook and Instagram are the two most profitable social media platforms in the world.",
      "In a statement issued Sunday, April 13, Meta said the \"stakes could not be higher in this trial for U.S. consumers and businesses.\"",
      "What is Meta saying?",
      "The social media company has called the FTC's case \"weak\" and said it \"ignores reality,\" adding that it faces stiff competition from TikTok and YouTube. Both platforms outrank Facebook and Instagram in terms of how long users spend on each.",
      "\"Ultimately, an ill-conceived lawsuit like this will make companies think twice before investing in innovation, knowing they may be punished if that innovation leads to success,\" Meta's statement reads. \"On top of it, this weak case is costing taxpayers millions of dollars.\"",
      "\"The FTC's lawsuit against Meta defies reality,\" a Meta spokesperson told CBS MoneyWatch. \"The evidence at trial will show what every 17-year-old in the world knows: Instagram, Facebook and WhatsApp compete with Chinese-owned TikTok, YouTube, X, iMessage and many others.\"",
      "\"Regulators should be supporting American innovation, rather than seeking to break up a great American company and further advantaging China on critical issues like AI,\" the spokesperson added.",
      "The FTC did not reply to a request for comment.",
      "When did this case get started?",
      "The history of the Meta case stretches back several years. The FTC initially filed the suit in 2020 during President Trump's first term in office.",
      "In June 2021, U.S. District Judge James Boasberg dismissed the antitrust lawsuit brought by the FTC, claiming the lawsuits were \"legally insufficient\" and did not supply sufficient evidence to prove Facebook was a monopoly.",
      "But the federal judge later cleared the path for the case to proceed after the FTC introduced more evidence in an amended complaint, according to The Washington Post.",

      "Nate, an e-commerce company, launched the nate app that claimed to streamline the online shopping checkout process via a single AI-powered tap option. But the app was not powered by advanced AI technology at all, according to the indictment.",
      "With the promise of custom-built \"deep learning models\" that would allow the app to directly purchase goods on product pages in fewer than three seconds, Saniger raised over $40 million. While instructing employees to keep nate's reliance on overseas workers secret, he pitched investors an AI-driven product capable of 10,000 daily transactions.",
      "Instead, the app allegedly relied heavily on overseas workers in two different countries who manually processed transactions, mimicking what users believed was being done by automation. Saniger, meanwhile, allegedly told investors and the public that the transactions were being completed by AI.",

When a deadly tropical storm struck the country in October 2021, the indictment said, nate established a new call center in Romania to handle the backlog of customer services. Investors were likely never exposed to the lull in transactions because Saniger directed that transactions by investors be prioritized to avoid suspicion.",

      "Read on to see how grocery prices\u00a0fluctuated in 12 major U.S. metros.",
      "Which cities are seeing price increases?",
      "Out of the 12 cities included in SmartAsset's analysis, Honolulu, Hawaii, experienced the largest uptick with a 5.3% increase in overall grocery prices since last year. Price hikes in Tampa Bay, Florida, are the second highest at 4.3%, followed by he Twin Cities, Minnesota, at 4.2%.",
      "When it comes to fresh produce, the Twin Cities saw the biggest spike among the 12 metro areas, with the cost of fruits and vegetables rising 6.9% from 2024. In Los Angeles, egg, meat, poultry and fish prices rose the most, at 9.8%, followed by the D.C. metro area at 9.4%.",
      "By contrast, residents of the Dallas-Fort Worth-Arlington experienced only a modest price hike of 2.1% on eggs, meat, poultry and fish.",
      "While the report doesn't specify the factors driving price changes from city to city, a combination of influences could be at play, said SmartAsset's DeJohn. \"A big factor for something like Honolulu is it's isolated from the rest of the U.S.,\" she said. \"So, that's a good illustration of how transportation costs where you're located geographically compared to where your food is sourced can impact the prices big time.\"",
      "While price fluctuations varied from city to city, prices for egg, meats, poultry and fish went up in all metro areas, which DeJohn says were behind overall grocery cost increases across all 12 metro areas. \"As we didn't see such intense price increases across any other category of grocery, it was the egg and meat prices that were really driving the increase in grocery prices across the board in these metros,\" she said.",
      "The rise in egg prices at the metro level tracks with national BLS data. Egg prices have been climbing in large part due to the bird flu outbreak which has\u00a0forced farmers to kill infected flocks to prevent the disease from spreading.",
      "Are any cities seeing lower grocery prices?",
      "Yes. Two metro areas in SmartAsset's study \u2014 Dallas-Fort Worth, Texas, and Boston \u2014 saw a decrease in grocery prices of 0.1% and 0.7%, respectively, from a year ago.",
      "Where are grocery prices headed?",
      "A recent analysis by the Yale Budget Lab estimates that overall food prices will rise by 2.6% in the next three years, as a result of U.S. tariffs as well as reciprocal tariffs from foreign nations in place as of April 15. Fresh produce is estimated to rise 5.4%, according to the think tank, before stabilizing at 3.6% higher.",
      "The USDA's\u00a0food price outlook, based on Consumer Price Index and Producer Price Index data from this year and last, forecasts a slightly larger rise in overall food prices of 3.2%, with grocery store or supermarket food purchases, or food-at-home, increasing 2.7%.",
      "Prices for dairy products and fresh vegetables will remain mostly unchanged, according to the USDA, but unfortunately for consumers, the cost of egg prices is expected to climb. Egg prices, which have\u00a0soared over the past year, are expected to rise 57.6% in 2025, according to the report.",

      "President Trump took aim at Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell on Thursday, writing in a social media post that Powell should be cutting interest rates and adding that his \"termination cannot come fast enough.\"",
      "Mr. Trump's comments on his social media app, Truth Social, come after Powell delivered a speech on Wednesday that warned of the potential consequences of the Trump administration's trade war, while reiterating that the central bank plans to hold interest rates steady for now.",
      "The Fed has put the brakes on interest rate cuts this year due to sticky inflation, which has remained higher than its target growth rate of 2% per year.",
      "In the meantime, Mr. Trump has introduced a series of tariffs on major trading partners that economists say could reignite inflation. Powell highlighted those risks on Wednesday in saying that the Trump administration tariffs could create a \"challenging scenario\" for the U.S. that requires both managing both accelerating inflation and a slowing economy.",
      "Those types of conditions describe \"stagflation,\" a mashup of \"stagnation\" and \"inflation\" that describes periods when economic growth falters while price hikes accelerate.",
      "In his social media post, Mr. Trump on Thursday pointed to the European Central Bank, which cut rates by 0.25 percentage points after the president posted his message.",
      "\"The ECB is expected to cut interest rates for the 7th time, and yet, 'Too Late' Jerome Powell of the Fed, who is always TOO LATE AND WRONG, yesterday issued a report which was another, and typical, complete 'mess!'\" Mr. Trump wrote.",
      "He added, \"Oil prices are down, groceries (even eggs!) are down, and the USA is getting RICH ON TARIFFS. Too Late should have lowered Interest Rates, like the ECB, long ago, but he should certainly lower them now. Powell's termination cannot come fast enough!\"",
      "Can Mr. Trump fire Powell?",
      "A landmark ruling by the Supreme Court in 1935 affirmed Congress' authority to create independent federal agencies whose boardmembers could only be forced out before their terms expired \"for cause.\"",
      "\"The fundamental necessity of maintaining each of the three general departments of government entirely free from the control or coercive influence, direct or indirect, of either of the others has often been stressed, and is hardly open to serious question,\" the court ruled\u00a0in the case, Humphrey's Executor v. United States.",
      "After Mr. Trump was elected in November, Powell said he wouldn't step down if asked by the president, who has previously criticized his performance. Powell has also noted that, under the law, presidents may not fire or demote the Fed chair.",
      "In a meeting Thursday with Italian Prime Minister Giorgia Meloni, Mr. Trump said of Powell, \"Oh, he'll leave. If I ask him to, he'll be out of there.\"",
      "Mr.\u00a0Trump nominated Powell\u00a0to lead the Fed in 2017, and Powell was re-nominated by President Joe Biden in November 2021. Powell's term as Fed chair ends May 15, 2026.",
      "Over the years, Powell has steadfastly defended the central bank's independence. In December, he said that insulating the Fed from political influence is \"for the benefit of all Americans,\" allowing it to make decisions based on economic data rather than at the behest of elected officials.",
      "Whether the White House chooses to respect the Fed's independence remains to be seen. Mr. Trump has long challenged political norms, ranging from refusing to accept the results of the 2020 presidential election to, since his return to power in January, empowering Elon Musk to slash the federal workforce through the billionaire's Department of Government Efficiency.",
      "Jaret Seiberg, an analyst with TD Cowen Research Group, notes that Mr. Trump this week fired two Democrats on the board of another financial regulator, the National Credit Union Administration. In March, the White House also dismissed two Democratic members of the Federal Trade Commission, which historically has operated as an independent, bipartisan commission.",
      "\"The President appears to be moving closer to justifying removal of Democrats on the Federal Reserve Board. By firing the two Democrats from the credit union regulator, the president is establishing the precedent that he has total discretion over financial regulators, which could include the Federal Reserve,\" Seiberg said in a report.",

    "story": [
      "Washington \u2014 The Supreme Court on Thursday said that it will hear oral arguments next month over whether the Trump administration can partially enforce an executive order that seeks to end birthright citizenship while proceedings in a challenge to the directive move forward.",
      "The court said in an unsigned order that arguments on the Justice Department's request for emergency relief will take place during a special sitting on May 15. The administration has asked the Supreme Court to limit the scope of three separate injunctions that blocked implementation of President Trump's order nationwide.",
      "If the high court decides to grant the Justice Department's request, it would prevent the administration from enforcing Mr. Trump's birthright citizenship order only against the plaintiffs in the ongoing cases: seven individuals, specific members of immigrants' rights groups and residents of 22 states.",
      "The dispute over the president's attempt to unwind birthright citizenship is the latest in which the Supreme Court has been asked to intervene, with more requests expected. More than 100 cases that seek to knock down Mr. Trump's second-term policies have been filed since he returned to the White House in late January, and several have already made their way to the high court.",
      "The president's executive order on birthright citizenship was one of the first that he signed on his first day back in office and is among several directives that seek to target migrants who are in the U.S. unlawfully. The Trump administration's immigration policies have led to high-profile clashes with the courts \u2014 namely Mr. Trump's use of the wartime Alien Enemies Act to deport alleged members of a Venezuelan gang and the administration's mistaken removal of a Maryland man in the U.S. unlawfully to El Salvador.",
      "While the 14th Amendment has for more than a century been understood to guarantee citizenship to all people born in the U.S., Mr. Trump's order denied birthright citizenship to children born to a mother who is unlawfully present in the U.S. or who is lawfully present on a temporary basis; or whose father is neither a citizen nor lawful permanent resident.",
      "The president's order directed federal agencies to stop issuing documents recognizing U.S. citizenship to children born after Feb. 19.",
      "More than half-dozen lawsuits challenging the measure were filed in courts throughout the country before it took effect, and three federal district courts in Washington, Maryland and Massachusetts each blocked the government from implementing the birthright citizenship order.",
      "Federal appeals courts in San Francisco, Boston and Richmond, Virginia, then refused requests by the Trump administration to partly block the lower court orders.",
      "The Justice Department filed emergency appeals of the three decisions with the Supreme Court in mid-March and asked it to limit enforcement of the birthright citizenship order to 28 states and individuals who are not involved in the ongoing cases. Then-acting Solicitor General Sarah Harris said that a minimum, the Supreme Court should allow agencies to develop and issue public guidance regarding implementation of Mr. Trump's executive order while proceedings continue.",
      "Like other requests made to the Supreme Court, Harris took aim at the breadth of the injunctions issued by the district courts, which are nationwide in scope and cover states and individuals who are not involved in the litigation before them.",
      "The president and his allies have attacked judges for issuing nationwide injunctions in the slew of legal challenges to Mr. Trump's policies, and even called for some to be impeached.",
      "\"Universal injunctions have reached epidemic proportions since the start of the current administration,\" Harris wrote. \"Courts have graduated from universal preliminary injunctions to universal temporary restraining orders, from universal equitable relief to universal monetary remedies, and from governing the whole nation to governing the whole world.\"",
      "She argued that nationwide, or universal, injunctions prevent the executive branch from carrying out its work and impede Mr. Trump's ability to address what he says is a \"crisis\" at the U.S.-Mexico border.",
      "\"The district courts' universal injunctions threaten to perpetuate those problems by holding out a nationwide incentive for illegal immigration: the prospect of American citizenship for the unlawful migrants' children and of derivative immigration benefits for the migrants themselves,\" Harris wrote.",
      "But the challengers urged the Supreme Court to leave the district court orders untouched.",
      "In a filing with the Supreme Court, officials from 18 states, the District of Columbia and San Francisco called the Trump administration's request \"remarkable,\" as it would allow the government to strip hundreds of thousands of American-born children of their citizenship while the legal challenges move forward and render them \"deportable on birth and at risk of statelessness.",
      "The states argued that the Justice Department is seeking to violate binding Supreme Court precedent that recognized that birthright citizenship is guaranteed by the 14th Amendment.",
      "Two immigrants' rights groups, CASA Inc and the Asylum Seeker Advocacy Project, refuted the suggestion by the government that it needs emergency relief.",
      "\"The Executive Branch has been complying with the settled interpretation of the Citizenship Clause for 125 years, and the government has demonstrated no urgent need to change now,\"\u00a0 they wrote in a filing.",

Mr. Trump's recent action\u00a0to eliminate the loophole beginning May 2 throws a wrench in the companies' business models.",

      "The changes come at a time when American shoppers have increasingly flocked to the low-cost retailers. The number of de minimis parcels shipped to the U.S. has surged to more than 1 billion in 2023, up from 153 million in 2015, with China accounting for the largest volume of shipments, according to a January Congressional Research Service report.

      "\"Just as it did during President Trump's first term, the administration's America First economic agenda of tariffs, deregulation, tax cuts and the unleashing of American energy will restore American Greatness from Main Street to Wall Street,\" White House spokesman Kush Desai told CBS MoneyWatch in a statement.",
      "Recently, however, tremors in the economy intensified by Mr. Trump's tariffs have eroded the optimism of small businesses, according to a closely watched confidence\u00a0gauge.",
      "\"The implementation of new policy priorities has heightened the level of uncertainty among small business owners over the past few months,\" William Dunkelberg, chief economist of the National Federation of Independent Businesses, said in a statement.",
      "The decline in optimism comes as Mr. Trump's economic agenda roils financial markets and raises concerns about slowing U.S. economic growth.",
      "\"Consumers are concerned about the inflationary effects of the tariffs hikes. They understand if\u00a0prices rise, their real spending power will go down,\" Steven J. Davis, a Stanford University economist who co-developed an economic policy uncertainty\u00a0index, told CBS MoneyWatch. \"Also, some of them also feel that maybe their jobs are at risk, so for both reasons many consumers will cut back on discretionary spending.\"",

      "To be sure, even in the best of times business owners can be caught flat-footed by abrupt changes in the competitive landscape. But risks surge when the economic climate become unpredictable.",
      "\"Uncertainty is the enemy of entrepreneurship,\" Neri Karra Sillaman, an entrepreneurship expert at Oxford University, told CBS MoneyWatch. \"When the rules of the game are constantly shifting \u2014 one day you have a pause on tariffs, another day you don't have tariffs, if there are interest rate changes or political and economic instability \u2014 businesses cannot then confidently invest in growth.\"",
      "Smaller businesses, which typically have less of a financial cushion than larger enterprises, tend to struggle more in such an environment, she added.",
      "Davis, whose own\u00a0index\u00a0shows a spike in uncertainty in recent months, said trade policy unknowns are \"the big source of uncertainty right now inhibiting business investment and hiring.\"",
      "\"When you have tariffs, they tend to introduce cost unpredictability, which makes it very hard to predict and forecast margins accurately, especially in a product-based business,\" Karra added.",
      "Busy Baby's Benike said the sudden swerves in U.S. trade policy have made planning all but impossible.",
      "\"If I invest time, energy and money and the policy changes again in a way that makes the decision a poor one, I am already invested, the wheels are in motion and I'd be screwed,\" she said.",

      "Meanwhile, the new 125% U.S. baseline tariff on Chinese imports means that Benike would owe $229,000 in duties on products worth roughly $158,000. She has launched a fundraising campaign to help cover the tariff costs.",
      "Her plan B, should the steep levies remain in place, is to continue manufacturing her products in China and to sell them to markets outside the U.S.",
      "\"There are babies everywhere. If I can't sell in America, there are other countries that are interested,\" she said.",
      "Business on the brink",
      "Kristin Bear, founder of Kilo Brava, an online lingerie and sleepwear company that sells both directly to consumers as well as to major retailers including Macy's, Nordstrom and Anthropologie, said the sky-high U.S. tariffs on Chinese imports \"wipe out our business completely\" if they stay in place.",
      "\"We have not imported anything yet with the 145% tariffs in place, but it really puts our business in complete jeopardy,\" she said.",
      "Another challenge is that U.S. factories aren't equipped to manufacture the types of garments she designs, Bear said. And because orders for garments intended for sale this fall must be placed with factories by May, it's too late to explore manufacturing options in other countries.",
      "Said Bear, noting that she can't afford to lose a whole season's worth of orders, equivalent to roughly $500,000 in sales: \"If tariffs are still in place when it's time to import them, we'll just have to abandon the goods and close the company.\"",

    "published": "Thu, 17 Apr 2025 11:08:18 -0400",
    "summary": "CDC experts were not made available to discuss the findings showing a rise in autism prevalence.",
    "story": [
      "One out of 31 children \u2014 more than 3% of kids \u2014 have been identified with autism, according to the latest results published Tuesday from a Centers for Disease Control and Prevention study that tracks trends of autism's prevalence across some communities in the U.S.",
      "\"They've again gone up dramatically, just in two years. We have in some states as low as 1 out of 20 boys having autism, 1 out of 31 kids. And when I was, in my generation today, the rate of autism was 1 in 10,000,\" Health and Human Services Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. said Tuesday in Indiana, announcing the new findings. \"And this is just one disease. This whole generation of kids is damaged by chronic disease.\"",
      "Kennedy often cites the CDC's figures from this study as evidence for his claim that the U.S. is now seeing a growing \"epidemic\"\u00a0of autism, which experts and advocacy groups have criticized as stigmatizing and misleading.",
      "\"As the report indicates, more children have access to evaluations for autism and more children are being identified as autistic. This is encouraging because when children are identified early, appropriate supports and services can be tailored to help them, and their families thrive,\" said Dr. Kristin Sohl, of the American Academy of Pediatrics subcommittee on autism, in a statement shared before Kennedy's remarks and the report's release.",
      "Dr. C\u00e9line Gounder, CBS News medical contributor and editor-at-large for public health at KFF Health News, told \"CBS Mornings Plus\"\u00a0that the definition of what autism is has also expanded.",
      "\"It's a spectrum. It's not just one thing. ... So that's part of it,\" she said. \"We also are being much more aggressive about looking for it \u2014 pediatricians, educators.\"",
      "The definitions used in this study are also quite broad, Gounder added.",
      "\"They were looking at both health records, educational records, did a student access special ed supports, that sort of thing,\" she said. \"So part of it is the way in which we're looking for it. But there also does seem to be an underlying increase that has been occurring over time.\"",
      "For years, CDC scientists have said that the data indicating a rise in diagnoses of autism spectrum disorder, or ASD, could be reflecting improved screening and access to autism services in some communities. However, the agency's experts were not made available for a press briefing about the latest findings, marking a change from previous years.",
      "\"Research has not demonstrated that living in certain communities puts children at greater risk for developing ASD,\" the CDC's authors said in their report.",
      "The study's authors said estimated autism prevalence was consistently higher among Asian, Black and Hispanic children compared to White children. Factors like disparities in preterm birth and lead poisoning could be contributing to this gap, the report says.",
      "Data from sites in 16 communities were collected for the new CDC report. The last report found a rate of 1 in 36 children through 2020, based on data from 11 communities.",
      "While the network's data is not nationally representative, figures from other federally-funded surveys and studies have also tracked a rise in autism's prevalence over the past two decades, accelerating in the early 2000s.",
      "\"Autistic children add value to our communities. Advocating for resources and funding to support autistic people across the lifespan is essential for a productive and healthy America,\" Sohl said in the statement.",
      "It comes as federal spending into autism research has also surged, largely going into efforts to study the biology suspected to underlie the condition. While scientists have linked up to 90% of autism to genetic traits, other factors are also suspected to play a role in changing its risk.",
      "Kennedy has said he believes \"an environmental toxin\" is causing autism, pointing to a range of potential culprits from food contaminants to vaccines.",
      "Many studies have debunked the claim that vaccines cause autism. But there is less research for some other factors that studies suggest might be linked to autism, ranging from pesticides to time between pregnancies.",
      "\"While the number of studies investigating the epidemiology of autism is increasing, most potential environmental factors have not been investigated sufficiently to draw firm conclusions,\" the federal government's autism research coordination office said in 2023.",
      "In a statement Tuesday, Kennedy claimed that autism was preventable and said that it was \"unforgivable that we have not yet identified the underlying causes.\"",
      "\"We are assembling teams of world-class scientists to focus research on the origins of the epidemic, and we expect to begin to have answers by September,\" he said. Leading autism organizations have expressed skepticism over that promise and concern that he will revive debunked theories.",
      "Finding an answer to the cause or causes of autism by September is \"not realistic,\" Gounder said.",
      "\"Some of the theories include diabetes during pregnancy that might be affecting the development of the child, air pollution, exposure to micro plastics, antibiotic use and the way that changes the microbiome and the gut,\" she said. \"There's a whole bunch of different theories. And again, because it's so many different diseases actually labeled Autism Spectrum Disorder, it's going to take a while to really tease that out.\"",
      "The CDC also released a statement noting that prevalence varied widely between different sites in the study. That variation \"could reflect differences in availability of services for early detection, evaluation, and diagnostic practices,\" Dr. Karyl Rattay, head of the CDC's Division of Human Development and Disability, said.",
      "CDC delayed report, barred agency experts from media",
      "The CDC's National Center on Birth Defects and Developmental Disabilities was initially planning to release the report in March this year, multiple officials told CBS News. Its publication was pushed back by CDC officials amid a department-wide pause on communications ordered by the Trump administration.",
      "Plans to make the agency's experts available to explain and interpret the results were also scrapped, said multiple CDC officials, who spoke on the condition of anonymity. Ahead of the agency's last release of autism figures in 2023, CDC scientists appeared at press briefings and interviews with media outlets about the report.",
      "That year, news outlets were also provided with embargoed copies of the report ahead of time to give journalists time to prepare their reports and interview experts. This longstanding practice has also now been abandoned agency-wide under the Trump administration, officials said, both for the autism report and many other studies published by the agency.",
      "The CDC and HHS did not respond to requests for the embargoed report, or to make any experts available for an interview.",
      "Most of the communications staff working with the center have also been laid off, officials said, as part of Kennedy's sweeping restructuring of the department this month.",
      "The branch responsible for producing the autism figures is one of the few teams remaining on the job in the CDC's birth defects and disabilities center.",
      "Officials expect it to be cleaved off from the CDC and merged into Kennedy's new Administration for a Healthy America agency.",

      "The case, however, was dismissed in June 2021 after Vasquez failed to appear for a final hearing, according to court records. The two returned to living together.",
      "In a statement provided to CBS News Wednesday evening, Vasquez confirmed seeking the court order.",
      "\"After surviving domestic violence in a previous relationship, I acted out of caution after a disagreement with Kilmar by seeking a civil protective order in case things escalated,\" Vasquez said. \"Things did not escalate, and I decided not to follow through with the civil court process. We were able to work through this situation privately as a family, including by going to counseling. Our marriage only grew stronger in the years that followed. No one is perfect, and no marriage is perfect. That is not a justification for ICE's action of abducting him and deporting him to a country where he was supposed to be protected from deportation. Kilmar has always been a loving partner and father, and I will continue to stand by him and demand justice for him.\"",

Another federal judge who had ordered the three flights to El Salvador be turned around\u00a0found Wednesday\u00a0that there was probable cause to hold the Trump administration in criminal contempt for defying his orders.",

      "During a\u00a0White House meeting\u00a0with Mr. Trump Monday, Bukele told reporters he would not be returning Abrego Garcia to the U.S., and U.S. Attorney General Pam Bondi said that same day it is \"up to El Salvador if they want to return him.\"",
      "Abrego Garcia came to the U.S. illegally in 2011 when he was 16 years old.",
      "In 2019, he was arrested by Immigration and Customs Enforcement, but an immigration judge barred his removal from the U.S. after determining that he could face persecution by gangs if deported to El Salvador. The judge granted him what is known as \"withholding of removal\" status.",

That's the height of a multi-story building. The squid caught on video in the South Atlantic was a juvenile and much smaller than a full-grown adult, with the research team placing its size at around 11 inches long.",
      "\"It's exciting to see the first in situ footage of a juvenile colossal and humbling to think that they have no idea that humans exist,\" said Kat Bolstad, a professor and researcher at the Auckland University of Technology in New Zealand, who the crew consulted to verify their squid footage after the expedition. \"For 100 years, we have mainly encountered them as prey remains in whale and seabird stomachs and as predators of harvested toothfish.\"",

      "Gov. Jenniffer Gonz\u00e1lez, who was traveling, said officials were \"working diligently\" to address the outage. Ferraiuoli said the governor is trying to return as soon as possible.",
      "Puerto Ricans react to another outage",
      "Thousands of Puerto Ricans were fuming over the latest outage, with many renewing their calls that the government cancel the contract with Luma and Genera PR, which oversees generation of power on the island.",
      "Puerto Rican artist Bad Bunny said in Spanish on X, \"when are we going to do something?,\" apparently referring to the outage.",
      "\"This is a total disaster,\" said Orlando Huertas, 68, as he sipped a drink with a friend at a streetside bar and criticized the government for not doing enough to tackle the chronic outages.",
      "Dozens of people were forced to walk next to the rails of the rapid transit system that serves the capital, San Juan, while scores of businesses including the biggest mall in the Caribbean were forced to close. Professional baseball and basketball games were cancelled as the hum of generators and smell of smoke filled the air.",
      "\"Following today's island-wide power outage, our administration is actively engaged in ongoing communication with the White House and all relevant federal agencies,\" the Puerto Rico Federal Affairs Administration said in a statement. \"We are working closely with the federal government to ensure that Puerto Rico receives the necessary support and that all essential services are restored as quickly and safely as possible.\"",
      "By late Wednesday afternoon, some 5,000 to 7,000 clients had their power restored, although that number is expected to fluctuate. Those without generators crowded around grocery stores and other businesses to buy ice.",

      "\"They have to improve,\" she said of the government. \"Those who are affected are us, the poor.\"",
      "The island of 3.2 million residents has a more than 40% poverty rate, and not everyone can afford solar panels or generators. While there was a push to use more renewable energy sources under the administration of former U.S. President Joe Biden, which\u00a0provided Puerto Rico with mega generators\u00a0and other resources, experts worry that won't happen under U.S. President Donald Trump.",
      "Puerto Rico has struggled with chronic outages since September 2017 when Hurricane Maria pummeled the island as a powerful Category 4 storm, razing a power grid that crews are still struggling to rebuild. As the island was just starting to rebuild, it was hit hard again by Hurricane Fiona in 2022.",
      "The grid already had been deteriorating as a result of decades of a lack of maintenance and investment.",
      "In the aftermath of Hurricane Maria, the Puerto Rico government in 2021 hired Luma, a private Canadian-American company based in San Juan, to handle the transmission and distribution of electricity on the island. Power was previously overseen by the state-owned Puerto Rico Electric Power Authority, which went\u00a0bankrupt in 2017\u00a0as the government faced billions of dollars in public debt payments.",

    "story": [
      "California Gov. Gavin Newsom said Wednesday his state will file a lawsuit challenging President Trump's authority to impose sweeping tariffs that have set off a global trade war.",
      "The suit will argue Mr. Trump's use of the International Emergency Economic Powers Act to impose tariffs on Mexico, Canada and China or a 10% tariff on all imports is unlawful. The act enables a president to freeze and block transactions in response to foreign threats.",
      "The lawsuit, which will be filed in the U.S. District Court for the Northern District of California, will argue that enacting such tariffs requires approval from Congress, Newsom's office said in a news release.",
      "\"No other state will be more impacted by the impacts of this,\" Newsom said at a Wednesday press conference alongside California Attorney General Rob Bonta in the Central Valley.",
      "\"Already, vendors have warned us that they're going to pass the costs of Trump's tariffs onto the state of California,\" Bonta said.",
      "Bonta and Newsom noted that the lawsuit will be the 14th in less than 14 weeks that California has filed against the Trump administration.",
      "\"We're asking the court to rein in the president,\" Bonta said.",
      "Mr. Trump has offered many justifications for increasing tariffs, including that they are designed to spur U.S. manufacturing and stop the flow of illicit fentanyl into the country. California's move follows rapidly changing tariff plans by the Trump administration. The government briefly imposed steep \"reciprocal\" tariffs on dozens of countries\u00a0last week, before pausing most of those tariffs for 90 days \u2014 but Mr. Trump left in place a 10% tariff on most imported goods, and hiked levies on imports from China to a total of 145%.",
      "Newsom said the tariffs have, in effect, resulted in inflated costs and billions of dollars in damage in California, which has the largest economy among the states and is a massive exporter of goods.",
      "\"No state is poised to lose more than the state of California,\" Newsom said.",
      "California's lawsuit makes it the first U.S. state to sue the Trump administration over tariffs. The state will ask the court to immediately block the tariffs.",
      "The announcement comes days after Newsom asked countries to exempt California exports from retaliatory tariffs. No deals have yet been announced.",

    "summary": "Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell said in a speech today that President Trump's tariffs are likely to boost U.S. inflation.",
    "story": [
      "Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell on Wednesday cautioned that the central bank could face a \"challenging scenario\" of managing both accelerating inflation and a slowing economy brought on by the impact of President Trump's tariffs.",
      "In written remarks\u00a0at the Economic Club of Chicago, Powell reiterated that the Trump administration's tariffs are \"significantly larger than anticipated.\"",
      "\"The same is likely to be true of the economic effects, which will include higher inflation and slower growth,\" he added.",
      "Even so, Powell said the Federal Reserve can stay patient and wait to see how tariffs and other economic policies of the Trump administration play out before making any changes to interest rates. The sharp volatility in financial markets since Mr. Trump announced sweeping tariffs April 2, only to put most of them on hold a week later, has led to speculation about whether the Fed would soon cut its key interest rate or take other steps to calm investors.",
      "\"For the time being, we are well positioned to wait for greater clarity\" on the impact of policy changes in areas such as immigration, taxation, regulation, and tariffs, Powell said.",
      "Powell said the inflation will likely be temporary, but \"could also be more persistent,\" echoing a concern expressed by a majority of the Fed's 19-member interest rate-setting committee in the minutes of their meeting last month.",
      "Mr. Trump's tariffs have led economists to lower their expectations for U.S. economic growth and forecast higher inflation this year. Because tariffs are taxes paid by importers like Walmart, they typically pass on the added costs to consumers in the form of higher prices.",
      "\"Tariffs likely lead to higher prices while softening consumer sentiment and business optimism possibly means slower growth,\" said Scott Helfstein, Global X's head of investment strategy, in an email. \"This is going to make economic forecasting more difficult, and the Fed is likely going to widen their bands growth and rates with risks to both price stability and full employment rising.\"",
      "Yet some splits among the Fed's interest rate-setting committee have emerged. On Monday, Fed governor Christopher Waller said that he expects the impact of even a large increase in tariffs to be temporary, even if they are left in place for several years. At the same time, he also expects such large duties would weigh on the economy and even threaten a recession.",
      "Should the economy slow sharply, even if inflation remained elevated, Waller said he would support cutting interest rates \"sooner, and to a greater extent than I had previously thought.\"",
      "But other Fed officials, including Neel Kashkari, president of the Fed's Minneapolis branch, have said they are more focused on fighting the effects of higher tariffs on inflation, suggesting they are less likely to support rate cuts anytime soon.",
      "For now, most recent reports suggest the economy is in solid shape. Hiring has been solid and inflation cooled in March. Yet measures of consumer and business confidence have plunged, raising concerns among economists that spending and business investment could weaken.",

    "summary": "The owner of a small stationery business based in Pensacola, Florida, says her company is facing up to $1 million in tariff payments this year alone under the Trump administration's new tariffs.",
    "story": [
      "Pensacola, Florida\u00a0\u2014 Emily Ley has spent the last 17 years building Simplified, her small stationery business based in Pensacola, Florida.",
      "The company produces its planners in China, but for American shoppers.",
      "\"I would love to make them here, but the U.S. simply doesn't have the infrastructure or the supply chain to do it,\" Ley told CBS News.",
      "That stationery is now subject to the recent slew of\u00a0sky-high tariffs.",
      "\"We don't have the same options as large businesses,\" Ley said. \"We don't have the same capital or ability to pivot.\"",
      "After President Trump raised tariffs on China this month,\u00a0eventually totaling 145%, Ley, with the help of the nonpartisan, conservative-funded New Civil Liberties Alliance, filed a federal lawsuit against the president, U.S. Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem, and acting U.S. Customs and Border Patrol Commissioner Pete Flores, alleging illegal use of emergency powers illegally to enact the fees.",
      "Ley said that because Congressional approval was bypassed to impose the tariffs, she and other voters didn't have their positions represented.",
      "\"Had (Congress) had a chance to debate, discuss, vote, be involved,\u00a0I would've then had the opportunity to make my voice heard,\" she explained. \"And same for other Americans who were gonna be impacted by the tariffs. That didn't happen.\"",
      "\"If this is the end of my American dream, I'm gonna go down swinging,\" Ley said.",
      "The president has argued that the tariffs represent short-term pain that will result in long-term gain.",
      "But according to Ley, \"We can't survive the short-term pain, and especially without any sort of plan in place to create the infrastructure here...It would take years and millions and millions of dollars to build such a thing that's been built overseas over decades.\"",
      "Ley said Simplified has paid nearly $1.2 million in tariffs since Mr. Trump's first term, and is facing between $830,000 and $1 million in payments this year alone under the administration's new tariffs.",
      "While the White House is\u00a0offering exemptions\u00a0to multibillion-dollar Chinese industries that produce smartphones and other electronics, Ley says that to just cover the cost of tariffs at 145%, she would have to raise prices on her $64 signature planner to $82. To maintain a profit on her planners, Ley would have to double the sticker price to about $120.",
      "\"I'm not paying $120 for a planner,\" Ley said.",
      "Ley employs eight other women, and disclosed that she is being forced to consider reducing salaries and possibly eliminating positions, something she says she really doesn't want to do.",
      "She says it comes down to keeping prices manageable for customers while balancing the new tariff burden on her bottom line.",
      "Ley said that China's unique manufacturing infrastructure isn't currently available in the U.S. or other countries internationally. Different elements of her planners are made in several different factories in the Shenzhen region. Because they are located close to one another, the final product is higher quality and more affordable.",
      "In response to Ley's lawsuit, Harrison Fields, a White House spokesperson, told CBS News in a statement that the president \"has broad authority to impose tariffs to address issues of national emergency, such as the opioid pandemic. The Trump Administration looks forward to victory in court.\"",
      "Ley says her business cannot survive such tariffs.",
      "\"That's what's terrifying,\" Ley said. \"...It's just not sustainable. And it's truly catastrophic to so many businesses, and big businesses and small businesses alike. But I really think small businesses are gonna be the casualty of this trade war.\"",

    "published": "Wed, 16 Apr 2025 20:29:13 -0400",
    "summary": "A federal judge said he could recommend criminal prosecutions against the Trump administration, setting up an unprecedented showdown.",
    "story": [
      "U.S. District Judge James Boasberg threatened on Wednesday to find the Trump administration in criminal contempt of court for defying a court order to return Venezuelan migrants en route to a Salvadoran prison last month \u2014 possibly setting the stage for an unprecedented showdown between President Trump and the judicial branch.",
      "Boasberg, who said the government \"deliberately flouted\" his orders, warned if the administration doesn't change course, he could hold hearings, recommend criminal charges and hire a private attorney to prosecute the case if the Department of Justice refuses.",
      "Why could Judge Boasberg hold the Trump administration in contempt of court?",
      "In a searing written decision, Boasberg said the Trump administration showed a \"willful disregard\" for his orders not to deport migrants under the Alien Enemies Act of 1798.",
      "The government has cited the 18th-century law to fly hundreds of alleged members of Venezuelan gang Tren de Aragua to El Salvador, whose government is holding scores of U.S. deportees in a notorious maximum-security prison. The Trump administration has touted the deportations as ridding the U.S. of foreign gang members, but an analysis by \"60 Minutes\" last week showed that 75% of the men sent to CECOT in El Salvador had no criminal records. At least 22% of the men on the list have criminal records here in the United States or abroad. The vast majority are for non-violent offenses like theft, shoplifting and trespassing. About a dozen are accused of murder, rape, assault and kidnapping. It was unclear if any criminal record existed for the other 3%.",
      "Some of those migrants sued to prevent their removal last month, and Boasberg quickly ordered the government verbally to return the migrants to the United States, even if that requires officials to \"turn a plane around.\" The judge later issued a written order barring the administration from removing migrants under the Alien Enemies Act.",
      "Boasberg wrote Wednesday the government disobeyed those orders by not returning the migrants to the United States. Since then, he said he's given officials \"ample opportunity\" to explain what happened, but found their responses unsatisfactory.",
      "The Trump administration has denied violating the judge's order, and White House communications director Steven Cheung says the government will appeal Boasberg's ruling. \"The President is 100% committed to ensuring that terrorists and criminal illegal migrants are no longer a threat to Americans and their communities across the country,\" he wrote in a statement.",
      "What is contempt of court?",
      "Under federal law, criminal contempt of court is defined as disobeying a federal court's \"lawful writ, process, order, rule, decree, or command.\"",
      "As with any criminal case, prosecutors would need to prove beyond a reasonable doubt that a defendant \u2014 in this case, potentially a federal official \u2014 willfully violated an order, says Mitchell Epner, a partner at the New York law firm Kudman Trachten Aloe Posner.",
      "Contempt cases are extremely rare, according to Epner. He said that during his three-year stint as a federal prosecutor in New Jersey, he can't recall anyone even threatening to bring a criminal contempt of court case, much less actually bringing charges.",
      "\"In my experience as a lawyer over the last 30 years, even the hint of being held in contempt by a judge is ordinarily enough in order to cause litigants to correct their behavior,\" Epner said.",
      "What happens next in this case?",
      "Before moving forward, Boasberg gave the government an opportunity to \"purge\" its alleged contempt, saying the government could take the migrants back into U.S. custody so they can potentially seek relief from a court. If the administration decides to go down that route, he gave officials one week to file court papers \"explaining the steps they have taken and will take.\"",
      "Boasberg said he is also open to other solutions.",
      "Otherwise, Boesberg says the Trump administration has one week to give the court the names of whoever \"made the decision not to halt the transfer\" of the migrants covered by his orders. If needed, Boasberg said he'll hold hearings or order depositions to gather more details.",
      "After that, Boasberg said he could recommend a criminal prosecution for contempt of court, though it's unclear who the defendant would be.",
      "However, Boasberg can't necessarily force charges to be brought. Federal prosecutions are generally handled by the Department of Justice, which has the power to decide which cases it pursues, making it highly unlikely the Trump administration will choose to criminally charge its own officials. Epner told CBS News he \"cannot imagine a circumstance\" where the DOJ chooses to bring those charges.",
      "Can Boasberg appoint a private lawyer to prosecute the administration?",
      "It's complicated. Boasberg notes that if the Justice Department decides not to bring contempt charges, he has the right to appoint a private attorney to step in and prosecute the case. That option isn't unheard-of: In one well-known 2023 case, the Supreme Court chose not to strike down a contempt conviction against lawyer Steven Donziger that was prosecuted by private attorneys.",
      "But that route is extremely unusual and would almost certainly face legal pushback, Epner says. In the small handful of situations where judges have appointed lawyers to step in and act as prosecutor, it has generally been because the DOJ simply decided bringing contempt charges wasn't worth its time, according to Epner. Boasberg's case is far thornier because it would involve a direct confrontation with federal officials.",
      "\"Actually trying to prosecute a criminal contempt here would be a mess because all of these issues would have to be unpacked,\" Epner said.",
      "Any effort to prosecute Trump administration officials privately could reach the Supreme Court, and Epner argues \"all evidence is that they are bending over in every possible supine position to avoid a showdown with Donald Trump.\" The court has already weighed in, overturning Boasberg's order on the grounds that cases should have been brought in another court district.",
      "For those reasons, Epner thinks it's unlikely that Boasberg will go with private attorneys, saying, \"it is literally setting up a constitutional crisis.\"",
      "Could the Trump administration face other contempt charges?",
      "It's unclear, though the administration has run into resistance from federal judges in other cases.",
      "Judge Paula Xinis has ordered the government to facilitate the return of Kilmar Abrego Garcia, a native of El Salvador who the Trump administration conceded was mistakenly sent to the same Salvadoran prison as the Venezuelan migrants. In a hearing Tuesday, Xinis said the administration \"has not yet fulfilled the mandate, the order, that I issued,\" and ordered expedited discovery in the case, saying, \"there will be no tolerance for gamesmanship or grandstanding.\"",
      "Abrego Garcia's lawyers have suggested the government be held in contempt. Xinis said Tuesday, \"I will have the record before me to call it like I see it\" before ruling on contempt.",

      "U.S. District Judge James Boasberg wrote in a 46-page decision that the government's actions on March 15 \"demonstrate a willful disregard\" for his order barring the government from transferring certain migrants into Salvadoran custody under the wartime Alien Enemies Act.",
      "Those actions, he wrote, are \"sufficient for the court to conclude that probable cause exists to find the government in criminal contempt. The court does not reach such conclusion lightly or hastily; indeed, it has given defendants ample opportunity to rectify or explain their actions. None of their responses has been satisfactory.\"",
      "\"The Constitution does not tolerate willful disobedience of judicial orders \u2014 especially by officials of a coordinate branch who have sworn an oath to uphold it,\" Boasberg wrote.",
      "The judge's ruling marks the most direct rebuke of the Trump administration amid its escalating tensions with the federal judiciary, which have particularly grown over challenges to the president's efforts surrounding immigration.",
      "President Trump and his allies have repeatedly attacked Boasberg over his handling of the case that arose after the president issued a proclamation in March invoking the Alien Enemies Act, a seldom-used law from 1798, to summarily deport Venezuelans who his administration claims are members of the gang Tren de Aragua.",
      "The judge said the Trump administration can remedy the breach of his order before contempt proceedings are initiated by asserting custody over the migrants who were removed in violation of it, so they can assert their right to challenge their removability. Administration officials will also have the chance to suggest \"other methods\" of coming into compliance with the order, Boasberg wrote.",
      "White House communications director Steven Cheung said the administration will seek immediate relief from the U.S. Court of Appeals for the D.C. Circuit.",
      "\"The president is 100% committed to ensuring that terrorists and criminal illegal migrants are no longer a threat to Americans and their communities across the country,\" he said in a statement.",
      "Boasberg, who sits on the district court in Washington, D.C., was overseeing a challenge brought by a group of Venezuelan migrants who sought to prevent their removal under the more than 200-year-old wartime law. The judge swiftly blocked the Trump administration from removing the plaintiffs from the U.S. for 14 days and, after convening an emergency hearing, told government lawyers in-person that they should return people subject to the proclamation who were on planes headed to El Salvador back to the U.S.",
      "A written order issued shortly after blocked the Trump administration from conducting any deportations of noncitizens in its custody under the Alien Enemies Act. Boasberg's order did not block the government from deporting the alleged gang members or others under other immigration authorities.",
      "But the judge said that despite his written and oral directives, the government did not stop the removal process, and planes carrying migrants subject to deportation under the Alien Enemies Act later landed in El Salvador, where most were transferred to its Center for Terrorism Confinement, or CECOT.",
      "The Trump administration's actions sparked questions as to whether it had violated Boasberg's order. The judge wrote in his opinion that \"boasts\" by Secretary of State Marco Rubio and Salvadoran President Nayib Bukele \"intimated that they had defied the court's order deliberately and gleefully.\"",
      "Who, exactly, in the Trump administration ordered the two planes to continue on to El Salvador, is unclear. In his opinion, Boasberg wrote that he plans to find that out through further proceedings and potentially live witness testimony under oath if needed.",
      "In the last hearing on the matter, a Justice Department attorney named two Department of Homeland Security officials and one State Department official as his points of contact after the judge's decision but said he did not know who directed the planes to continue their flights.",
      "Boasberg found that the Trump administration failed to dispel of any concerns that they violated his injunction, and during further proceedings, declined to \"admit to a grave mistake, explain how it transpired, and detail plans to rectify it.\"",
      "He accused the government of \"increasing obstructionism\" and \"stonewalling\" over its refusal to answer basic questions that aimed to resolve whether noncitizens who were removable solely under Mr. Trump's proclamation were transferred out of U.S. custody after the judge issued his order forbidding their deportation.",
      "\"Defendants provide no convincing reason to avoid the conclusion that appears obvious from the above factual recitation: that they deliberately flouted this court's written order and, separately, its oral command that explicitly delineated what compliance entailed,\" Boasberg wrote.",
      "The dispute over Mr. Trump's use of the Alien Enemies Act to remove alleged Tren de Aragua members reached the Supreme Court late last month. The high court last week said that the Trump administration could resume deportations of Venezuelan migrants it claims are Tren de Aragua members under the law, but only if they are given due process.",
      "The high court also said that migrants challenging their removals under the Alien Enemies Act must seek judicial review through habeas petitions filed in the district where they are detained. As a result, the dispute before Boasberg in Washington, D.C., should instead be filed in Texas, where the Venezuelan migrants are confined, the Supreme Court said.",
      "Boasberg wrote that the Supreme Court's order \"does not affect \u2014 let alone moot \u2014 the compliance inquiry presently teed up here.\"",
      "The Trump administration invoked the state-secrets privilege in an effort to keep details out of Boasberg's reach in his efforts to find out more information about the two flights. But the judge found it is \"exceedingly doubtful that the privilege applies here\" because he was not asking about diplomatic agreements between the U.S. and El Salvador, or the operational specifics of how the deportations were arranged.",
      "\"Instead, the court is simply seeking to confirm times and numbers: how many passengers the two flights carried, whether they were all deported pursuant to the proclamation, and when they were transferred out of U.S. custody,\" Boasberg wrote. \"The court is skeptical that such information rises to the level of a state secret.\"",
      "The judge also rejected the Trump administration's contentions that his order infringed on the president's authority, saying it merely restricted executive actions, which courts routinely do.",
      "\"It in no way invaded any Article II powers, despite defendants' effort to incant new ones into existence,\" he wrote. \"In any event, even if the TRO did somehow overstep the court's Article III power, defendants cannot now evade a contempt charge on that basis.\"",

    "summary": "President Trump plans to overhaul the Endangered Species Act, a White House official confirmed.",
    "story": [
      "President Trump plans to overhaul the Endangered Species Act to make it easier to build in the U.S. where endangered species live, a White House official confirmed Wednesday.",
      "The president has voiced frustration with the 1973 law and similar environmental protections, saying environmentalists are impeding growth. Real Clear Politics first reported Mr. Trump's plans to overhaul the law.",
      "A White House source was granted anonymity as the announcement is not official.",
      "It's not yet exactly clear how Mr. Trump would alter the use of the law, since only Congress can change or repeal it, but it would likely come through the federal rule-making process. The law was established to protect species of wildlife, fish and plants that have been depleted enough to be in danger of extinction.",
      "Last week, the president directed agencies regulating energy and the environment to sunset a number of environmental protections, among other steps to curb environmental protections to spur construction and economic growth.",
      "One step the administration is considering is to repeal the definition of 'harm,' which would remove nearly all habitat protections for endangered species across the country. Currently, if any business or activity harms a protected species, it's a violation of the law, as established by the ESA. The law defines \"harm\" as including \"any activity that can modify a species' habitat.\" Loss of habitat is the single greatest threat to most species, since many aren't \"taken\" or killed to the point of extinction.. By eliminating this legal definition of \"harm,\" it would clear the way for many forms of economic development, including logging, oil and gas drilling, or critical mineral mining that could eradicate a species, environmentalists say.",
      "\"We'll go to court to fight as many of these rollbacks as possible,\" said Brett Hartl, director of government affairs for the Center for Biological Diversity. \"The federal government is large and they're throwing everything at the wall hoping to overwhelm us, but we'll do our damnedest to make sure nothing becomes permanent.\"",
      "The Endangered Species Act was established in 1973 to protect \"various species of fish, wildlife, and plants in the United States that had been rendered extinct as a consequence of economic growth and development untampered by adequate concern and conservation.\" By designating\u00a0 species with a protected status, this ensures that the ecosystems where the species live will be conserved and steps are taken to help support the species to avoid extinction. This, by extension, means that Congress and federal agencies will work with state and local governments to address water resources that impact species, as well as habitat.",
      "Critics of the Endangered Species Act claim the law goes far beyond the initial intent and is overly burdensome. Republican Rep. Bruce Westerman of Arkansas, chairman of the House Committee on Natural Resources, has frequently suggested changes to the ESA and last month proposed the Endangered Species Amendment Act of 2025. He said in a statement, \"The Endangered Species Act has consistently failed to achieve its intended goals and has been warped by decades of radical environmental litigation into a weapon instead of a tool.\"",
      "Much of what the Trump administration is proposing, by sunsetting regulations and overhauling the ESA, aligns with Westerman's bill.\"Environmental is the biggest tool for stopping growth,\" Mr. Trump said in an interview with podcaster Joe Rogan last year.",
      "Environmentalists, however, are concerned about weakening the law.",
      "\"This is a full-out assault on America's heritage,\" said Andrew Wetzler, the senior vice president of nature at the Natural Resources Defense Council. \"If Trump is successful, it will turn the ESA into a shell of itself, and this would be open season for our most important wildlife.\"",
      "In the 50 years since the law was enacted, the ESA has been credited with saving 99% of the listed species. Notable species saved include the bald eagle, American alligators, whooping cranes and peregrine falcons.",
      "CBS News reported in 2023 that since the passage of the law, more than 1,7000 plants, mammals, fish, insects and other species in the U.S. have been listed as threatened or endangered. But federal data shows that of the roughly $1.2 billion a year spent on endangered and threatened species, about half goes toward recovery of just two types of fish: salmon and steelhead trout along the West Coast.",

    "summary": "In these major U.S. cities, a family of three earning $100,000 would have a hard time covering basic expenses.",
    "story": [
      "Reaching the six-figure salary threshold may be considered a financial victory for many Americans, but in a many big U.S. cities the once aspirational milestone just doesn't cut it anymore.",
      "In one out of four large metro areas in the United States, a family of three with a household income of $100,000 will still struggle to get by, a LendingTree\u00a0analysis\u00a0reveals. That's a stark realization for many Americans, who continue to face\u00a0rising household expenses\u00a0on everything from\u00a0a dozen eggs to a bag of coffee. The average median household income in then U.S. was $80,610 in 2023,\u00a0according\u00a0to the most recent estimate from the Census Bureau.",
      "\"For generations of Americans, $100,000 has long been a magic number. It has been seen as a level of yearly earnings that says: You've made it. You're successful,\" according to the report. \"However, that has changed dramatically in many of the nation's biggest metros. In 25 of the 100 largest metros in this country, a six-figure household income isn't enough to handle the basics.\"",
      "In determining the metro areas where a $100,000 salary wouldn't stretch far enough, LendingTree considered eight different spending categories a typical family of three might face \u2014 such as two-bedroom apartment and infant daycare \u2014 and then subtracted the total cost from the $8,333 in monthly income the family would be earning on a salary of $100,000. That left a slew of large metro areas, from Los Angeles to New York, with negative monthly income estimates.",
      "In 25 of the 100 largest U.S. cities LendingTree looked at for its report, researchers found that monthly expenditures \u2013 which ranged from food to childcare and health insurance costs \u2013 outweighed net monthly income. The analysis didn't factor in debt payments.",
      "\"It's a rough time out there. The fact that you can make six figures in many, many cities across this country and still be broke, even before you factor in debt payments, is scary,\" said Matt Schulz, chief consumer finance analyst at LendingTree and author of the study. \"That's the reality for many families today, though, and unfortunately, there's not much reason to think things are going to improve anytime soon. That means that families are going to be forced to make some tough decisions and real sacrifices to get by.\"",
      "The study comes at a time when consumer confidence has fallen to its lowest levels since the pandemic, as Americans weather a period of economic uncertainty amid the Trump administration's tariff rollout. Americans expect long-term inflation to reach 4.4%, up from 4.1% last month.",
      "Read on to see how your city ranked.",
      "Where is it hardest to get by on $100,000?",
      "In San Jose, the heart of California's pricey Silicon Valley, a family of three with household income of $100,000 a year would find themselves more than $2,000 short every month after covering basic expenses. Researchers say this is attributable to disproportionately high housing and transportation costs. Trailing San Jose are San Francisco and Boston which are the second and third hardest places, respectively, to get by on a $100,000 annual salary.",
      "Notably, the lion's share of locations where family breadwinners making $100,000 might still end up broke were cities on the West or East Coasts. California metro hubs figured prominently on the list, with all 10 of the state's largest cities among the top 25.\u00a0Colorado, Connecticut, Massachusetts and New York also had multiple metro areas included on the list.",
      "Which cities were the most affordable for a family making $100,000?",
      "In 1 in 3 cities, however, a $100,000 salary \"is still magical,\" even for a family of three. Earners in these areas could still pocket $1,000 or more each month after paying basic expenses, LendingTree found.",
      "McAllen, Texas, located on the U.S. - Mexico border, came in at the top for places where a $100,000 salary will give you the biggest bang for your buck. Residents there would have $1,770 left over after subtracting money for their monthly expenditures. Close behind McAllen are Little Rock, Arkansas and El Paso, Texas, according to the report.",
      "For those facing stubborn costs of living, LendingTree says there are still ways to\u00a0mitigate the impact\u00a0whether it's by staying in your rental longer or reducing the interest rate you're paying.",
      "Schulz's advice for consumers: Build your emergency fund.",
      "\"Even a small emergency fund can help firm up your financial foundation. It means that your next big unexpected expense won't necessarily have to go right on to your credit card,\" he told CBS MoneyWatch in an email. \"Plus, online high-yield savings accounts are still offering some of the best returns in years, even though they're down from last year's highs.\"",

      "Washington \u2014 Attorney General Pam Bondi announced Wednesday that the Justice Department is filing a civil lawsuit against Maine's Department of Education for \"discriminating against women by failing to protect women in women's sports\" in what she alleged is a violation of Title IX.",
      "\"The Department of Justice will not sit by when women are discriminated against in sports,\" Bondi said. \"This is about sports, this is also about these young womens' personal safety.\"",
      "The move marks an escalation between the Trump administration and Maine over the issue. President Trump signed an executive order in February to ban transgender girls and women from competing on sports teams that match their gender identity, mandating that Title IX, the federal law banning sex discrimination in schools, be interpreted as prohibiting the participation of transgender girls and women in female sports. President Trump said states not in compliance would jeopardize any federal funding they receive.",
      "Then, in a tense moment between Mr. Trump and Maine Gov. Janet Mills, a Democrat, later in February, the president threatened that her state wouldn't get federal funding if it didn't comply with the executive order barring transgender athletes from competing on women's sports teams. Mills replied, \"See you in court.\"",
      "Education Secretary Linda McMahon, who appeared alongside Bondi on Wednesday, said \"I hope Gov. Mills will recognize that her political feud with the president will deprive the students in her state of much more than the right to fair sporting events.\"",
      "The attorney general outlined that the Justice Department had \"exhausted every other remedy,\" saying it has \"repeatedly notified Maine of its infractions and urged them to remedy the situation to protect women.\" Bondi noted that the administration has stripped grants to Maine through other agencies, and would \"continue to fight for women.\"",
      "The federal government said in its lawsuit filed in Maine's federal court that the state's Department of Education is \"openly and defiantly flouting anti-discrimination law by enforcing policies that require girls to compete against boys in athletic competitions designated exclusively for girls,\" arguing that the practice violates Title IX's \"core protections.\"\u2028It cited three examples of boys participating in girls sports.",
      "\"The United States accordingly files this action to stop Maine's unapologetic sex-discrimination against female student athletes,\" the Justice Department said in the lawsuit.",
      "Mills pledged to \"vigorously defend our state against the action announced today from the Department of Justice\" in a statement Wednesday, arguing that the fight isn't about women's sports, but \"states rights and defending the rule of law against a federal government bent on imposing its will.\"",
      "\"Let today serve as warning to all states: Maine might be among the first to draw the ire of the Federal government in this way, but we will not be the last,\" Mills said.",
      "Last week, the state of Maine secured a temporary restraining order against the Trump administration, blocking the Agriculture Department from \"terminating, freezing, or otherwise interfering with the State's access to federal funds based on alleged Title IX violations without following the process required by federal statute.\" The lawsuit was brought by Maine after the Trump administration cut funds for administrative and technological funds in the state's schools.",
      "The Justice Department's actions against Maine may be followed by similar moves in other states, Bondi said.",
      "\"We're looking at Minnesota, we're looking at California,\" Bondi said. \"We're looking at many, many states, but they are the top two that should be on notice.\"",

Her husband, Brian Fanion, a Westfield Police detective, had called 911, reporting that Amy Fanion had shot herself.",

      "Detective Brendan O'Toole took Brian Fanion to the State Police barracks in Russell, Massachusetts, to get his statement of the events surrounding his wife's sudden death. At the end of the interview, \u00a0O'Toole asked Fanion to turn over his phone for data extraction. Fanion complied but gave a caveat.",

      "\"I mean, there's no doubt she was shot \u2026 but the question is, from what distance,\" O'Toole asked Fanion.",
      "Within a week, investigators seized all of Fanion's electronics, including his office computer and laptop at the Westfield Police Department. When Detective Tom Forest from the Cyber Crime Unit examined the computer's hard drive, it revealed peculiar web searches and online activity he considered notable to the investigation. The online activity began about three months before Amy Fanion's death, around the time Brian Fanion and Knowles' friendship turned flirtatious.",
      "\"\u2026 it's only when this affair starts up \u2026 that all of these incriminating searches start to appear,\" Hampden County Assistant District Attorney Mary Sandstrom told \"48 Hours.\"",
      "The first of these inquiries was related to common household poisons. On the morning of Feb. 12, Brian Fanion searched \"household poisons,\" \"dangerous sources of radiation,\" \"worst sources of radiation\" and \"common prescription overdoses.\" He also visited web pages titled, \"9 Surprising Sources of Radiation in Your Home;\" \"Carbon Monoxide: The Invisible Killer;\" \"Common and dangerous poisons;\" \"16 Common Household Items That Could Kill You;\" \"What Over-the-Counter Medications Can You Overdose From?;\" \"Which Drug Causes the Most Deaths Each Year?\" and, finally, \"Prescription Drugs Linked to Most Fatal Overdoses.\"",
      "At trial, Brian Fanion's defense attorney Jeffrey Brown argued that the Fanions were preparing to have a young niece stay with them and that some of the websites were related to potential hazards their 200-year-old house might pose.",
      "At the beginning of March 2018, Fanion repeatedly Googled his potential lover, Cori Knowles. On April 2, as things heated up between Fanion and Knowles, he began questioning the nuances of affairs, searching \"can you have an affair without sex.\"",
      "Two weeks later, on April 17, Fanion began researching divorce laws in Massachusetts. Several web pages he visited were related to pension rights after divorce. Fanion was planning for his upcoming retirement, and according to Knowles in an interview with police, he feared losing part of his pension if he were to divorce his wife. The following day, Brian Fanion's inquiries into infidelity resumed, visiting web pages titled \"My perfect affair \u2013 how I'm getting away with it\" and \"Emotional Infidelity: Worse Than A Sexual Affair?\"",
      "Eleven days before Amy Fanion died, on April 27, Brian Fanion searched \"gsr testing\" on his work computer. That morning between 9:22 and 9:38 a.m., Brian Fanion visited five web pages related to gunshot residue. Among those web pages were \"Gunshot Residue Collection: The Decisions that Make or Break a Case\" and a news report on YouTube called \"What gunshot residue tests tell us.\" Sandstrom told \"48 Hours\" this had nothing to do with Brian Fanion's work at the Westfield Police Department.",
      "\"He wasn't assigned to any active investigations in April and May of 2018 \u2026 that would necessitate looking up gunshot residue,\" Sandstrom told \"48 Hours.\" \"Nobody in the Westfield Police Department does gunshot residue testing.\"",
      "On May 7, 2018, the day before Amy Fanion was shot dead, Fanion repeatedly searched how to remove frequent contacts from his phone. At his trial, Fanion's defense argued that he was in the process of getting a new phone and wanted to know how to erase data from his current one. Sandstrom prosecuted the case.",
      "\"Now, the defendant suggests that he did these searches because he's in the process of getting a new phone right before his wife's demise,\" Sandstrom told the jury. \"But he's not looking to delete all data off of his phone \u2026 he's searching how to delete the frequently contacted list because he doesn't want evidence of his relationship with Corrine being discovered by the state police.\"",
      "Fanion's trial for the murder of Amy Fanion began on Feb. 23, 2023. Sandstrom's first witness was Amy Fanion's sister, Anna Hansen. Hansen testified that after Amy's death, Brian Fanion confided that he was concerned about some searches he had made.",
      "\"I asked him what that search was, and he said how to make a murder look like a suicide,\" Hansen said on the witness stand. Under cross examination by the defense, Detective Tom Forest testified that he never found any searches related to those terms.",
      "On the morning of May 8, 2018, while Brian Fanion was still at work, he searched \"massachusetts medical examiner offices\" and visited a website that listed the units within the Massachusetts State Police forensics section.",
      "In her closing arguments, Sandstrom stated that that morning, Brian Fanion was preparing for his wife's murder. \"He's looking up and researching the units that will appear \u2026 after he's committed this murder. \u2026 the evidence in this case proves beyond a reasonable doubt that the defendant knew he was going to murder Amy Fanion when he left the Westfield Police Department at 11:47 a.m. on May 8th.\"",
      "Brian Fanion's defense argued that Amy Fanion had anger issues and suffered from severe anxiety. After Amy's death, many members of her family signed a letter in support of Brian, stating that they were certain Amy had taken her own life. Several members of Amy Fanion's family took the stand, and although they were called as witnesses for the prosecution, their testimonies supported Brian Fanion's defense.",

    "summary": "Trump has lauded Italy's right-wing Prime Minister Giorgia Meloni as a \"fantastic leader.\" Their affinity has put pressure on the EU flag-bearer.",
    "story": [
      "Italian Prime Minister Giorgia Meloni is meeting at the White House on Thursday with President Trump, in what her aides have called a high-stakes \"commercial peace mission.\"",
      "European leaders are hoping Italy's right-wing premier\u00a0can position herself as a bridge between the Trump administration and the European Union, which Mr. Trump and his top aides have bashed as a deadbeat, if not abusive partner on defense and trade.",
      "Mr. Trump told reporters Thursday that \"of course\" there will be a trade deal with the EU, amid the 90-day pause on his \"reciprocal\" tariffs. Asked if the EU is on his priority list of nations for reaching trade deals, Mr. Trump said, \"Everybody's on my priority list.\"",
      "The president said he and Meloni discussed trade and \"many, many things\" in their first meeting of the day. But it's unclear how much progress Mr. Trump and Meloni made in discussing any sort of trade deal.",
      "The hope not only in Rome, but in EU capitals across the 27-nation bloc is likely that Meloni can persuade Mr. Trump not to impose the steep tariff hikes he's threatened, which could devastate European economies. A reporter asked Meloni if she believes the U.S. is a reliable partner.",
      "\"If I wouldn't think it's a reliable partner, I wouldn't be here,\" Meloni responded.",
      "Meloni said she's \"here to find the best way to make us both stronger.\"",
      "\"The goal for me is to make the West great again,\" Meloni said. \"And I think we can do it together.\"",
      "Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent told reporters he believes there have been trade calls with the EU already, and the U.S. is trying to work with the world's 15 largest economies first. The president said \"tariffs are making us rich.\"",
      "Meloni and Trump seem to \"get along great\"",
      "Meloni has positioned herself as the European leader Mr. Trump is most likely to listen to. The two have developed a relationship based on shared political and ideological affinities on issues including immigration and LGBTQ rights.",
      "Meloni was the only European leader to be invited to Mr. Trump's inauguration in January, and he has praised her multiple times, calling her a \"fantastic leader and person,\" and someone he could potentially work with to \"straighten out the world a little bit.\"",
      "After the reopening of the Notre Dame Cathedral in Paris last year, which both leaders attended, Mr. Trump was quoted by the New York Post as saying: \"I was with her a lot\" and \"we get along great.\"",
      "But the Italian leader will have to try to balance that budding special relationship with her mandate to protect the interests not only of her own nation's economy, but the EU's, with which Italy's financial future is inextricably linked.",
      "Europe has hope, and anxiety, over the Trump-Meloni meeting",
      "Meloni and European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen discussed strategies on how to approach her meeting with Mr. Trump during multiple phone calls ahead of the trip, according to a commission spokesperson.",
      "Von der Leyen herself has not yet been granted a meeting with Mr. Trump, despite repeated requests. Meloni's sit-down at the White House will be the first with any European leader since the administration announced its tariffs on virtually every nation with which the U.S. conducts trade at the beginning of April. The EU was hit with a blanket 20% tariff rate on all exports to the U.S. with that announcement, though Mr. Trump put those higher rates on hold for 90 days about a week later, as global stock markets reeled, leaving a 10% universal rate in place.",
      "Meloni has gently chided the sweeping tariffs on the EU as \"wrong,\" but she's been one of the voices urging the continental bloc not to impose retaliatory measures, insisting that a calm response focused on negotiations would bring a more constructive resolution.",
      "The White House claims dozens of counties have come forward seeking to negotiate new trade agreements with the U.S., with Mr. Trump boasting that leaders were calling him and \"kissing my ass,\" begging to strike deals to avoid the reimposition of the higher levies.",
      "\"We know we're going through a difficult period, let's see how it goes in the coming hours. I am feeling no pressure, as you can imagine, for my next two days,\" Meloni said with a note of clear irony at an awards ceremony two days before her White House meeting. \"I am aware of what I represent, and I am aware of what I am defending.\"",
      "Not all European politicians were so sanguine about the potential outcome of the Trump-Meloni meeting, however.\u00a0 Italian opposition politician Carlo Calenda said, \"the most important thing is that Meloni does not allow herself to be used by Trump to split the European front.\"",
      "In other European capitals, there was clear anxiety over the possibility that the White House could use the meeting to try to undermine EU unity.",
      "\"If we start having bilateral discussions, obviously it will break the current dynamic,\" the French government's Minister for Industry and Energy, Marc Ferracci, said last week, adding: \"Europe is only strong if it is united.\"",
      "The French news agency AFP said a government spokeswoman later stressed that any voices capable of encouraging dialogue between Washington and the EU were to be welcomed. That statement echoed the remarks by the EU spokesperson on Monday, who noted the close coordination between Meloni and Von der Leyen ahead of the Italian leader's trip to Washington and said the \"outreach is very welcome.\"",
      "After her brief visit to Washington the Italian leader will return home, where she's expected to meet on Friday with Vice President JD Vance during his visit to the Italian capital and the Vatican.",
      "French President Emmanuel Macron, British Prime Minister Keir Starmer and Irish Prime Minister Miche\u00e1l Martin have met with Mr. Trump in the Oval Office since he took office for his second term, but those encounters all came prior to the massive tariffs announcement on April 2.",

      "Jalisco state accounts for 12% of the roughly 127,000 missing people in Mexico, mainly young men.",

      "American pastor Josh Sullivan was rescued Tuesday amid a shootout between South African police and his captors that left three suspects dead, authorities said Wednesday. Sullivan, originally from Tennessee, was abducted at gunpoint\u00a0during a prayer meeting at his church in South Africa on the evening of April 10.",
      "According to a statement issued by the the South African Police Service, a specialized unit dedicated to serious crime, known as the Hawks, they led the operation to rescue the 45-year-old.",
      "The American was abducted from his Fellowship Baptist Church in Motherwell Township, outside the coastal city of Gqeberha, and was rescued from a safehouse being used by his captors in that city.",
      "\"The operation followed verified intelligence wherein a coordinated team (of several police units) moved swiftly to the identified location,\" police said. \"As officers approached the house, they observed a vehicle on the premises. The suspects inside the vehicle upon seeing law enforcement allegedly attempted to flee and opened fire on the team. The officers responded with tactical precision, leading to a high-intensity shootout in which three unidentified suspects were fatally wounded.\"",
      "Police said Sullivan was discovered in the same vehicle and \"miraculously unharmed, he was immediately assessed by medical personnel and is currently in an excellent condition.\"",
      "Police have said that four armed, masked male suspects entered the church on Thursday, stole two cellphones and then abducted Sullivan, in his car, a Toyota Fortuner, which was found a short time later in Motherwell.",

      "\"It may be claimed to be an adventure trip, but the fact is that there has been a violation of Indian laws. Outsiders meeting Sentinelese could endanger the tribe's survival,\" said a senior police officer, requesting anonymity as he isn't authorized to speak about the case under investigation.",

    "summary": "A government memo obtained by CBS News shows the Trump administration created broad rules outlining which migrants can be held at Guantanamo Bay\u200b.",
    "story": [
      "A government memo obtained by CBS News shows the Trump administration created broad rules outlining which migrants can be held at Guantanamo Bay, allowing officials to send non-criminal detainees there despite a vow to hold \"the worst\" offenders at the naval base.",
      "As part of his aggressive crackdown on immigration, President Trump in late January directed officials to convert facilities inside the U.S. Naval Base at Guantanamo Bay, Cuba, into holding sites for migrants living in the country illegally. At the time, Mr. Trump said \"the worst\" migrants would be held at the base, directing officials to make space for \"high-priority criminal aliens.\"",
      "But a previously undisclosed agreement between the Department of Homeland Security and the Department of Defense indicates that the Trump administration gave officials wide-ranging discretion to decide who to send to Guantanamo Bay, enacting criteria not predicated on the severity of detainees' criminal history or conduct. In fact, the memo does not mention any criminality assessment. [Read the full memo at the bottom of this story.]",
      "Instead, the agreement, signed on March 7 by top DHS and Pentagon officials, says the departments agreed to use the Guantanamo base to detain migrants with final deportation orders who have \"a nexus to a transnational criminal organization (TCO) or criminal drug activity.\"",
      "Officials defined \"nexus\" in broad terms. A nexus can be satisfied, the memo says, if migrants with final deportation orders are part of a transnational criminal group or if they paid one \"to be smuggled into the United States.\" The latter condition could be used to describe many of the migrants and asylum-seekers who have illegally crossed the U.S. southern border, as criminal groups in Mexico largely control the illicit movement of people and drugs there.",
      "Migrants who overstayed a visa are not eligible to be sent to Guantanamo Bay, the document says. But if the nature of a migrant's entry is unclear, the memo allows officials to assume that the person paid a criminal group to enter the U.S. and to send them to Guantanamo if they hail from a nation \"where the preponderance of aliens from that country enter the United States in that fashion.\"",
      "The conditions for transferring migrants to Guantanamo, as outlined in the memo, seem to be at odds with statements by Mr. Trump and high-ranking members of his administration that have suggested the base would be used as a detention site for dangerous criminals.",
      "Theresa Cardinal Brown, a former U.S. immigration official during the administrations of Presidents George W. Bush and Barack Obama, said the memo's rules \"apply very broadly to any immigrant who came to the U.S. via the U.S.-Mexico border.\"",
      "\"It's very well known that almost every immigrant who makes it to the U.S.-Mexico border would have to pay some sort of money to the cartels that control the territory on the Mexican side, directly or indirectly,\" she said.",
      "Cardinal Brown added that the rules do not appear to include \"any individualized assessment\" to determine whether migrant detainees pose a threat, before transferring them to Guantanamo.",
      "Department of Defense spokeswoman Kingsley Wilson confirmed the existence of the memo, saying it \"strengthens DoD and DHS collaboration by clarifying roles and responsibilities, and fostering efficient and coordinated operations at Naval Station Guantanamo Bay.\"",
      "CBS News reached out to DHS representatives for comment.",
      "The Guantanamo operation is not the only Trump administration immigration effort to face scrutiny over who exactly has been targeted. In mid-March, for example, the administration deported 238 Venezuelans to El Salvador, so they could be imprisoned inside that country's infamous mega-prison. The Trump administration said they were all criminals and gang members, but a \"60 Minutes\" investigation did not find a criminal record for 75% of the Venezuelan deportees.",
      "A high-profile yet largely secretive operation",
      "The Trump administration first began sending migrants to Guantanamo in February, initially only transferring Venezuelans there, including men it accused of having ties to the Tren de Aragua prison gang. The first group of Venezuelan detainees was eventually flown to Honduras, where the Venezuelan government picked them up so they could be transported back to their homeland.",
      "Since then, the administration has sporadically flown migrants from different countries to the base, before transferring them back to the U.S. or other nations. Administration officials have regularly touted the flights to Guantanamo but have provided limited details about the operation, including on costs and who is eligible to be sent to the base.",
      "What has been publicly revealed, by CBS News and other media outlets, is that officials have transferred both detainees considered to be \"high-threat\" and \"low-risk\" to Guantanamo, including migrants whose relatives have denied allegations of gang membership and criminality.",
      "Government guidelines define migrant detainees as posing a \"high\" threat if they have violent or serious criminal records, histories of disruptive conduct or alleged gang ties. Low-risk detainees are defined as migrants who face deportation because they are in the U.S. illegally but who lack any serious criminal record \u2014 or any at all.",
      "Those sent to Guantanamo and considered to be \"high-threat\" migrants have been held at Camp VI, a section of the post-9/11 prison that still houses roughly a dozen terrorism suspects. Migrant detainees deemed to pose a \"low\" risk have been transferred to the base's Migrant Operations Center, a barrack-like facility that has historically housed asylum-seekers intercepted at sea.",
      "Wilson, the Department of Defense spokeswoman, said there are currently 42 migrants detained at Guantanamo, 32 of them housed at the Migrant Operations Center and 10 so-called \"high-threat\" detainees held at Camp VI.",
      "The March 7 memo obtained by CBS News sheds light on other aspects of operations at Guantanamo. For example, it confirms the migrant detainees transported there remain in the legal custody of Immigration and Customs Enforcement, even though the military is providing access to its facilities to detain them.",
      "As part of the agreement, DHS also accepted the conditions at Camp VI and the Migrant Operations Center as adequate to hold migrant adults, noting it would not transfer children to the base. The department agreed to send ICE officers or contractors to the base, including to oversee security at the Migrant Operations Center.",
      "The memo makes DHS responsible for providing detainees services like recreation and religious accommodations; determining whether migrants get access to lawyers; and administering \"involuntary medical treatment,\" such as force-feeding during hunger strikes.",
      "The agreement also charges DHS with overseeing the transfer of detainees from and to Guantanamo, requiring the department to relocate migrants from the base no more than 180 days after their deportation orders are issued.",
      "The military, as stipulated by the agreement, is principally responsible for providing security at Camp VI and in the perimeter of the facilities. It also agreed to provide toilets and hygiene facilities, as well as medical care to both ICE personnel and detained migrants.",
      "The memo says the Department of Defense committed to erect tents at the base to hold additional detainees, though those sites have not been used to detain migrants yet. The agreement notes, however, that those tents \"do not have power, lighting, or heating/air conditioning.\"",
      "The effort to hold migrants at Guantanamo faces legal challenges by advocates, including at the American Civil Liberties Union, the Trump administration's chief adversary in federal court.",
      "The ACLU alleged in court filings that migrants were initially held incommunicado at Guantanamo, without access to relatives or lawyers. The administration subsequently said it took steps to give migrant detainees access to lawyers.",
      "The ACLU has also described detention conditions at Guantanamo as deplorable, citing declarations from migrants held there. In one of those declarations, a Venezuelan man previously held at the base said he went on a hunger strike after feeling he had been \"kidnapped.\"",
      "White House deputy chief of staff Stephen Miller, the lead architect of the Trump administration's immigration agenda, said earlier this week there are no plans to stop using Guantanamo to detain migrants.",

    "story": [
      "An island-wide blackout hit Puerto Rico on Wednesday as the largely Catholic residents of the U.S. territory prepared to celebrate the Easter weekend, a power company spokesman said.",
      "All hospitals on the island are operating on generators after the power went out at 12:38 p.m. Eastern Time, Veronica Ferraiuoli, acting governor and secretary of state for Puerto Rico, said at a news conference. All 1.4 million clients on the island were without power, Hugo Sorrentini, spokesman for Luma Energy, which oversees the transmission and distribution of power, told The Associated Press.",
      "\"The entire island is without generation,\" he said.",
      "Why is Puerto Rico without power?",
      "The source of the outage was in the southern part of the island where a transmission line was affected, according to Josu\u00e9 Col\u00f3n, executive director of Puerto Rico's Electric Power Authority.",
      "Late Wednesday, Luma said \"a combination of factors\" led to the blackout, the latest in a string of major outages on the island in recent years \u2014 with the last major blackout occurring\u00a0less than five months ago on New Year's Eve.",
      "\"Preliminary analysis points to a failure in the protection system as the initial trigger, followed by the presence of vegetation on a transmission line between Cambalache and Manat\u00ed,\" Luma said in an update. \"This sequence of failures triggered a chain of events that resulted in an island-wide outage.\"",
      "When will power in Puerto Rico turn back on?",
      "Restoring most of the power will likely at least 48-72 hours, Luma said Wednesday evening. At least 78,000 customers were also without water, according to the Puerto Rico Aqueduct and Sewer Authority.",
      "Gov. Jenniffer Gonz\u00e1lez, who was traveling, said officials were \"working diligently\" to address the outage. Ferraiuoli said the governor is trying to return as soon as possible.",
      "Puerto Ricans react to another outage",
      "Thousands of Puerto Ricans were fuming over the latest outage, with many renewing their calls that the government cancel the contract with Luma and Genera PR, which oversees generation of power on the island.",
      "Puerto Rican artist Bad Bunny said in Spanish on X, \"when are we going to do something?,\" apparently referring to the outage.",
      "\"This is a total disaster,\" said Orlando Huertas, 68, as he sipped a drink with a friend at a streetside bar and criticized the government for not doing enough to tackle the chronic outages.",
      "Dozens of people were forced to walk next to the rails of the rapid transit system that serves the capital, San Juan, while scores of businesses including the biggest mall in the Caribbean were forced to close. Professional baseball and basketball games were cancelled as the hum of generators and smell of smoke filled the air.",
      "\"Following today's island-wide power outage, our administration is actively engaged in ongoing communication with the White House and all relevant federal agencies,\" the Puerto Rico Federal Affairs Administration said in a statement. \"We are working closely with the federal government to ensure that Puerto Rico receives the necessary support and that all essential services are restored as quickly and safely as possible.\"",
      "By late Wednesday afternoon, some 5,000 to 7,000 clients had their power restored, although that number is expected to fluctuate. Those without generators crowded around grocery stores and other businesses to buy ice.",
      "\"I'm desperate. My generator is broken,\" said Carmen Suriel, who worried about the impact of the blackout on her two children, a six-month-old and a five-year-old with Down syndrome, as the temperature rose across Puerto Rico on Wednesday.",
      "Alma Ram\u00edrez, 69, said she was frustrated with the constant outages, some of which had already damaged her TV and microwave, forcing her to buy new appliances.",
      "\"They have to improve,\" she said of the government. \"Those who are affected are us, the poor.\"",
      "The island of 3.2 million residents has a more than 40% poverty rate, and not everyone can afford solar panels or generators. While there was a push to use more renewable energy sources under the administration of former U.S. President Joe Biden, which\u00a0provided Puerto Rico with mega generators\u00a0and other resources, experts worry that won't happen under U.S. President Donald Trump.",
      "Puerto Rico has struggled with chronic outages since September 2017 when Hurricane Maria pummeled the island as a powerful Category 4 storm, razing a power grid that crews are still struggling to rebuild. As the island was just starting to rebuild, it was hit hard again by Hurricane Fiona in 2022.",
      "The grid already had been deteriorating as a result of decades of a lack of maintenance and investment.",
      "In the aftermath of Hurricane Maria, the Puerto Rico government in 2021 hired Luma, a private Canadian-American company based in San Juan, to handle the transmission and distribution of electricity on the island. Power was previously overseen by the state-owned Puerto Rico Electric Power Authority, which went\u00a0bankrupt in 2017\u00a0as the government faced billions of dollars in public debt payments.",

Van Hollen said. \"If you listen to President Trump and the Trump administration, you would think that U.S. courts have found that Mr. Abrego Garcia is part of MS-13, but they have not found that. In fact, recently, a U.S. federal court judge said that the Trump administration did not have evidence to support the claim that he had ever been part of MS-13.\"",
      "Why can't El Salvador return Abrego Garcia to the U.S.?",
      "During his update in El Salvador, Sen. Van Hollen questioned why Abrego Garcia is still being held at CECOT and asked if the government has any evidence of Abrego Garcia's gang ties.",

    "summary": "The U.K. Supreme Court has ruled the country's 2010 Equality Act defines a woman as someone born biologically female in a potential landmark case for transgender rights.",
    "story": [
      "London \u2014\u00a0In a potential landmark decision, the U.K. Supreme Court ruled Wednesday that in a 2010 civil rights law called the Equality Act, the word \"woman\" refers to someone's biological sex.",
      "The five judges on the court stressed that their ruling was limited to interpreting the 2010 law as it pertains to women, and that \"it is not the role of the court to adjudicate on the arguments in the public domain on the meaning of gender or sex, nor is it to define the meaning of the word 'woman' other than when it is used in the provisions of\" that legislation.",
      "What the U.K. Supreme Court said about the definition of \"woman\"",
      "Monday's ruling was in response to a series of challenges brought by the campaign group For Women Scotland (FWS). The group initially challenged the definition of the term \"woman\" as included in Scottish legislation from 2018, which set targets to increase the proportion of women serving on public bodies.",
      "That legislation, for its own purposes, initially defined the term \"woman\" as including people \"(i) with the protected characteristic of gender reassignment; (ii) living as a woman; and (iii) proposing to undergo / undergoing / who have undergone a gender reassignment process,\" Monday's Supreme Court judgement said.",
      "FWS challenged that definition and subsequent statutory guidance was issued amending the definition of a \"woman\" under the Scottish law to bring it in line with the U.K.-wide Equality Act of 2010, which included people with Gender Recognition Certificates. Those government-issued GRCs allow a person's affirmed gender to be legally recognized in the U.K.",
      "That further guidance was appealed by FWS, however, and the case eventually made it to the Supreme Court, which ruled Wednesday that \"the terms woman and sex in the Equality Act 2010 refer to a biological woman and biological sex,\" though the court stressed that the definition was solely for the purpose of interpreting the specific part of the legislation in question.",
      "\"The questions raised by this appeal directly affect women and members of the trans community,\" the Supreme Court said. \"On the one hand, women have historically suffered from discrimination in our society and since 1975 have been given statutory protection against discrimination on the ground of sex. On the other hand, the trans community is both historically and currently a vulnerable community which Parliament has more recently sought to protect by statutory provision.\"",
      "\"It is not the role of the court to adjudicate on the arguments in the public domain on the meaning of gender or sex, nor is it to define the meaning of the word 'woman' other than when it is used in the provisions of the EA 2010,\" the judges said.",
      "The Supreme Court said using a wider definition of \"woman\" under the Equality Act could have created confusion among those trying to use the law to protect women and trans people from discrimination.",
      "\"Gender reassignment and sex are separate bases for discrimination and inequality,\" the judgement said.",
      "It explained that in the court's view, including trans people with a GRC certificate under the category of \"woman,\" for the purposes of interpreting the Equality Act, \"would create two sub-groups within those who share the protected characteristic of gender reassignment, giving trans persons who possess a GRC greater rights than those who do not. Those seeking to perform their obligations under the Act would have no obvious means of distinguishing between the two sub-groups to whom different duties were owed.\"",
      "Responses to the U.K. Supreme Court's judgement",
      "The ruling by the U.K. Supreme Court comes at the same time as efforts by the Trump administration in the United States to to\u00a0prohibit\u00a0gender-affirming care for minors and\u00a0bar trans people\u00a0from serving in the U.S. military or participating\u00a0in women's sports.",
      "Activist Grahame Park Girl told Britain's Press Association news service on Monday that the court's judgement was \"the only common sense decision you can make. Anything else would be farcical and appalling for women's rights.\"",
      "J.K. Rowling, who has campaigned for the primacy of biological sex, celebrated the judgement on social media.",
      "\"It took three extraordinary, tenacious Scottish women with an army behind them to get this case heard by the Supreme Court and, in winning, they've protected the rights of women and girls across the U.K.,\" Rowling said.",
      "LGBTQ+ rights group Stonewall said it would work with partners to understand the implications of Monday's ruling for trans people, and cautioned against anyone attempting to interpret it too broadly.",
      "\"Stonewall shares the deep concern at the widespread implications for today's ruling from the Supreme Court. It will be incredibly worrying for the trans community and all of us who support them,\" Stonewall CEO Simon Blake said in a statement.",
      "\"It's important to be reminded the Court strongly and clearly re-affirmed the Equality Act protects all trans people against discrimination, based on Gender Reassignment, and will continue to do so,\" Blake said.",
      "\"We are really shocked by today's Supreme Court decision \u2014 which reverses twenty years of understanding on how the law recognizes trans men and women with Gender Recognition Certificates,\" the rights group Scottish Trans said in a statement. \"The judgement seems to have totally missed what matters to trans people \u2014 that we are able to live our lives, and be recognized, in line with who we truly are.\"",

    "story": [
      "Deir al-Balah, Gaza Strip\u00a0\u2014 An Israeli airstrike hit the northern gate of a field hospital in the Gaza Strip on Tuesday, killing a medic and wounding 10 other people, the hospital's director said. The strike that hit the Kuwaiti Field Hospital in the Muwasi area was the second on a Gaza health facility in three days, coming after the last major hospital still providing critical care in the Palestinian enclave was hit Sunday in an attack the United Nations said had left it \"out of service.\"",
      "Israel's attacks in Gaza have continued for almost a month, since the country abandoned a ceasefire with Hamas that had been negotiated by the U.S., Egypt and Qatar. Efforts to strike a new ceasefire agreement have made little apparent headway since then, though Hamas has said it is considering a new proposal from Israel this week.",
      "Multiple news agencies cited Hamas officials as saying Israel had offered a 45-day halt in the fighting in exchange for the release of hostages. But Hamas officials cited by multiple news agencies reiterated that their would be no ceasefire agreement without a commitment by Israel to end the war and withdraw forces from Gaza. Hamas officials were also quoted as saying Israel had included a demand for the group to agree to disarm \u2014 something one representative was quoted as saying \"is not up for discussions.\"",
      "Israel's government had not confirmed the new offer to Hamas as of Tuesday afternoon.",
      "Hundreds of thousands of Palestinians had sought shelter in sprawling tent camps around the Kuwaiti Field Hospital, but the wounded from Tuesday's strike were all patients and medics, including two patients who were left in critical condition, according to hospital spokesman Saber Mohammed.",
      "There was no immediate comment from the Israel Defense Forces on the Tuesday strike. The IDF has bombed hospitals on several occasions during the 18-month war, accusing Hamas, which has long been designated a terrorist group by the U.S. and Israel, of hiding out in them or using them for military purposes. Hamas and Gazan hospital staff have denied the allegations and accused Israel of recklessly endangering civilians and deliberately gutting the territory's health system.",
      "On Sunday, Israel struck the Al-Ahli Hospital in Gaza City after ordering an evacuation. The United Nations said a child patient with a reported head injury died while being evacuated, and the strike severely damaged the emergency room, pharmacy and surrounding buildings.",
      "Al Ahli Hospital \"is out of service,\" Director-General of the U.N.'s World Health Program Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus said in a tweet, adding: \"Hospitals are protected under international humanitarian law. Attacks on health care must stop. Once again we repeat: patients, health workers and hospitals must be protected. The aid blockade must be lifted. Ceasefire.\"",
      "U.N. Secretary-General Antonio Guterres' spokesman echoed that sentiment, saying: \"Under international humanitarian law, wounded and sick, medical personnel and medical facilities, including hospitals, must be respected and protected,\" according to the Reuters news agency.",
      "The Episcopal Diocese of Jerusalem, which runs the hospital, also condemned the strike.",
      "Israel said it targeted a Hamas command and control center within the facility, without providing evidence. Hamas denied the allegations.",
      "Israel's retaliatory offensive has killed over 51,000 people, according to an updated toll released by the Gaza Ministry of Health on Tuesday. That includes more than 1,600 people killed since Israel ended the ceasefire and resumed its offensive last month to pressure Hamas to accept changes to the agreement. The ministry is led by medical professionals but reports to Gaza's Hamas-run government. Its casualty count is seen as generally reliable by U.N. agencies and independent experts, though Israel has challenged its numbers. Israel says it has killed some 20,000 militants, without providing evidence.",
      "The ministry does not say how many were civilians or combatants but says women and children make up more than half of the dead. The offensive has destroyed much of the territory and displaced around 90% of its population of roughly 2 million Palestinians.",
      "The war was sparked by the Hamas-orchestrated Oct. 7, 2023 terrorist attack on Israel, which killed some 1,200 people, mostly civilians, and saw 251 others taken as hostages back into Gaza. Israeli officials say 59 of those hostages remain in Gaza, 24 of whom are still believed to be alive, after most of the rest were released in ceasefire agreements or other deals.",

      "A Russian court on Tuesday convicted four journalists of extremism for working for an anti-corruption group founded by the late opposition leader Alexei Navalny and sentenced each to 5 1/2 years in prison.",
      "Antonina Favorskaya, Kostantin Gabov, Sergey Karelin and Artyom Kriger were found guilty of involvement with a group that had been labeled as extremist. All four had maintained their innocence, arguing they were being prosecuted for doing their jobs as journalists.",
      "The closed-door trial was part of an unrelenting crackdown on dissent that has reached an unprecedented scale after Moscow sent troops into Ukraine in February 2022.",
      "The authorities have targeted opposition figures, independent journalists, rights activists and ordinary Russians critical of the Kremlin with prosecution, jailing hundreds and prompting thousands to flee the country.",
      "Favorskaya and Kriger worked with SotaVision, an independent Russian news outlet that covers protests and political trials. Gabov is a freelance producer who has worked for multiple organizations, including Reuters. Karelin, a freelance video journalist, has done work for Western media outlets, including The Associated Press.",
      "The four journalists were accused of working with Navalny's Foundation for Fighting Corruption, which was designated as extremist and outlawed in 2021 in a move widely seen as politically motivated.",
      "Navalny was President Vladimir Putin's fiercest and most prominent foe and relentlessly campaigned against official corruption in Russia. Navalny died in February 2024 in an Arctic penal colony while serving a 19-year sentence on a number of charges, including running an extremist group, which he had rejected as politically driven.",
      "Favorskaya said at an earlier court appearance open to the public that she was being prosecuted for a story she did on abuse Navalny faced behind bars. Speaking to reporters from the defendants' cage before the verdict, she also said she was punished for helping organize Navalny's funeral.",

      "\"I understand perfectly well ... what kind of country I live in. Throughout history, Russia has never been different, there is nothing new in the current situation,\" Gabov said in the statement. \"Independent journalism is equated to extremism.\"",
      "In a statement Karelin prepared for his closing arguments that also was published by Novaya Gazeta, he said he had agreed to do street interviews for Popular Politics, a YouTube channel founded by Navalny's associates, while trying to provide for his wife and a young child. He stressed that the channel wasn't outlawed as extremist and had done nothing illegal.",
      "\"Remorse is considered to be a mitigating circumstance. It's the criminals who need to have remorse for what they did. But I am in prison for my work, for the honest and impartial attitude to journalism, FOR THE LOVE for my family and country,\" he wrote in a separate speech for court that also was published by the outlet, in which he emphasized his feelings in capital letters.",
      "Kriger, in a closing statement published by SotaVision, said he was imprisoned and added to the Russian financial intelligence's registry of extremists and terrorists \"only because I have conscientiously carried out my professional duties as an honest, incorruptible and independent journalist for 4 1/2 years.\"",
      "\"Don't despair guys, sooner or later it will end and those who delivered the sentence will go behind bars,\" Kriger said after the verdict.",
      "Supporters who gathered in the court building chanted and applauded as the four journalists were led out of the courtroom after the verdict.",
      "The Russian human rights group Memorial designated all four as political prisoners, among more than 900 others held in the country. That number includes Mikhail Kriger, Artyom Kriger's uncle, a Moscow-based activist who was arrested in 2022 and is serving a seven-year prison sentence.",
      "Mikhail Kriger was convicted of justifying terrorism and inciting hatred over Facebook comments in which he expressed a desire \"to hang\" Putin.",
      "The four journalists are not the only people linked to Navalny who have faced charges from the Russian legal system. In January , three lawyers who had defended Navalny were convicted of participating in an \"extremist organization\" and sentenced to prison. The lawyers had helped transmit Navalny's prison statements to the world before his death. Vadim Kobzev, the most high-profile member of the team, was given a 5 1/2 year sentence. Alexey Lipster was sentenced to five years, and Igor Sergunin was sentenced to 3 1/2 years.",
      "In July 2024, five months after Navalny's death was reported, Russia\u00a0issued an arrest warrant for his wife,\u00a0Yulia Navalnaya.

    "story": [
      "Two men with metal detectors recently discovered a trove of ancient treasure in Transylvania, which shed new light on early settlements in the storied historical region, local officials said. Encompassing much of present-day Romania, Transylvania is known for its medieval towns, Gothic architecture and vampiric folklore, with a mythical reputation tied to the fictional character Dracula and his real-life inspiration, the notorious 15th-century ruler Vlad the Impaler.",
      "The treasure unearthed this spring in the Transylvanian town of Breaza dates back much farther than the brutal monarch's reign. In an announcement shared last week, officials in Breaza said the metal detectorists found jewelry that originally belonged to Dacian people, who inhabited what is now Transylvania and some of its surrounding areas from around the 1st century B.C.E. until the 1st century of the common era. Dacia was eventually conquered by the Roman Empire.",
      "Silver brooches and a bracelet decorated with plant motifs were among the artifacts discovered, in addition to a chain necklace and a belt constructed out of circular metallic pendants, each marked with solar symbols. The treasure weighed 550 grams altogether, officials said, equating to more a pound.",
      "The Mures County Museum, near Breaza, confirmed the jewelry's origins in ancient Dacian society. An archaeologist at the museum, Daniel Ciota, will study the treasure as it is prepared for display.",
      "Officials in Breaza said the silver pieces were likely worn by a Dacian aristocrat, citing its lavishness as a signal of its owner's status, potentially as a \"high-ranking\" member of their society. As for why the jewels were ultimately buried in the ground, the officials suggested they could have been used as offerings to some unknown deity long ago. However, they also acknowledged someone may have hidden them for more personal reasons.",
      "There were no previous records of Dacian settlements in this part of Transylvania, and the treasure is the first physical evidence off Dacian people living around Breaza. Moving forward, officials said archaeologists and researchers will begin to explore the area in hopes of finding remnants of a settlement where the owner of the jewels may have lived.",
      "\"These historical artifacts remind us of the cultural heritage and importance of our region in the history of Dacia,\" the town of Breaza wrote in a social media post unveiling the treasure. \"This discovery honors and encourages us to proudly protect and promote our heritage.\"",

      "\"While this will accelerate fat loss and provide benefits to overall metabolic health, the body will still need to produce some of its own glucose in order to support brain function and will start to break down protein sources, like muscle, to maintain proper glucose levels.\"",
      "\"A five-day prolonged fast like the one Phil Mickelson follows will have profound effects on metabolism and weight loss.\"",

    "story": [
      "Ken Melban, the vice president of industry affairs and operations at the California Avocado Commission, joined Fox Digital to discuss how a Biden-era policy ending inspections of Mexican avocados has left U.S. farmers vulnerable to pest infestation.",
      "California avocado growers are sounding the alarm over a potential infiltration of crop pests from across the border after the Biden administration caved to Mexican cartel threats and ended a Clinton-era food inspection process that now threatens U.S. farmers.",
      "\"We understand the importance of free trade,\" Ken Melban, the vice president of industry affairs and operations at the California Avocado Commission, told Fox Digital in a Tuesday Zoom interview. \"Eight-five to 90% of the total U.S. demand for avocados is supplied by Mexico. However, that free trade should not increase risk on our California growers.\"",
      "\"Our growers are working hard to maintain a business, to drive their economic engine, to provide for their families, to support the economies around them,\" he said. \"And they shouldn't have to face a pest, no fault of their own, just because our government in the past was afraid to stand up to the cartel.\"",
      "Melban was reacting to a Biden administration decision in September 2024 to end a U.S. Department of Agriculture program called the Animal and Plant Health Inspection Service (APHIS) specifically in the context of inspecting farms in Mexico to ensure that avocados exported to the U.S. did not also include pests that could disrupt U.S. agriculture. The policy change came after criminals in Mexico reportedly assaulted and threatened the inspectors in recent years.",

      "Instead, Mexico was charged with ensuring avocados sent across the border were free of harmful pests, such as seed and stem weevils and seed moths. Weevils are small insects that typically have long snouts, and are notorious for damaging or destroying crops.",
      "The avocado industry is a multibillion business in Mexico, but it is often rocked by crime and exploitation of farmers, as cartels work to control the supply chain to help finance their operations and often exploit farmers through rackets that level fees on avocado growers in exchange for protection from violence, various studies and reports on crime affecting the Mexican lime and avocado industry show.",
      "Weevils are beetles belonging to the superfamily Curculionoidea, known for their elongated snouts.\u00a0 (Soumyabrata Roy/NurPhoto via Getty Images)",
      "Mexico's Agriculture Department confirmed the Animal and Plant Health Inspection Service program ended in a statement in September 2024, claiming \"with this agreement, the U.S. health safety agency is recognizing the commitment of Mexican growers, who in more than 27 years have not had any sanitary problems in exports,\" the Associated Press reported at the time.",

      "President Biden's administration is under fire from the avocado industry.\u00a0 (Getty Images)",
      "Former President Bill Clinton established the inspection program to better bolster U.S. farming communities, with the California Avocado Commission and Department of Agriculture reaching an agreement with Mexico in 1997 to allow for Mexican avocados to be exported to the U.S. under the condition that the fruit be inspected. All expenses related to the program's inspections of orchards and packing houses were footed by Mexico, not U.S. taxpayers, according to the commission.",
      "The Biden administration also paused the program in 2022 after an inspector in Mexico's western state of Michoacan received a threat \"against him and his family,\" the USDA said at the time. Two other USDA employees were also reportedly assaulted and temporarily held by suspects in the same Mexican state in June 2024, leading to another pause before Mexico ultimately was charged with conducting inspections in September 2024.",
      "\"We know that without the U.S. government present, the likelihood for corruption exists,\" Melban said of the lack of USDA inspector currently in Mexico. \"You can't just show up one day and pretend that your grove has been certified and that you're taking all the measures necessary to keep pests out and free. We also know that there has been fruit brought in from other non-certified groves in the past, and that's part of the problem. That's where we need the USDA to have boots on the ground and make sure that the inspections and the integrity of the inspections are maintained.\"",

      "\"We've all heard the stories and see the reporting that the cartel is very prevalent in Michoacan, which is a big growing area and the first state that was ever allowed access to the U.S. And so it only stands to reason that they're going to be involved at some level. And in many instances, they are actually exploiting our pure growers in Mexico too. We're just looking for the safety of the entire program, so the integrity can be maintained to protect our growers' interests here in the U.S.,\" Melban explained.",
      "The USDA told Fox Digital on Wednesday that the APHIS program continues to inspect fruit entering the U.S. at the border and is comitted to \"mitigating plant health risk in a way that does not compromise the safety and security of our employees or the phytosanitary security of the United States.\"",
      "\"USDA\u2019s Animal and Plant Health Inspection Service (APHIS) understands the vital importance of the avocado industry to the State of California and recognizes the concerns raised by residents. APHIS staff continue to fulfill their inspection responsibilities regarding fruit entering the United States from Mexico. Nearly 30 years of experience administering this program has proved the effectiveness of the avocado program\u2019s system of overlapping safeguards to prevent the entry of invasive pests,\" a spokesperson said.",
      "\"Staffing levels and budget levels for the inspection program remain the same, and our officials continue to conduct inspections in the packing houses, and provide audit oversight of orchard inspections conducted by Mexican Plant Health Authorities. APHIS remains committed to mitigating plant health risk in a way that does not compromise the safety and security of our employees or the phytosanitary security of the United States,\" the spox continued.",
      "APHIS is slated to continue working with and speaking to U.S. avocado growers, according to the spokesperson, and will keep them \"apprised of any future changes to the Mexico program.\"",
      "\"APHIS recognizes that, given the dynamic nature of the avocado industry\u2014including fluctuating high and low seasons in Mexico and California\u2014time is of the essence with many of these decisions. \u00a0We will work to ensure that U.S. producers continue to safely grow avocados, packinghouses continue to ship healthy fruit from Mexico, and American consumers continue to enjoy this important commodity,\" the spokesperson said.",

      "California is the top U.S. producer of avocados, with roughly 3,000 growers statewide that generate $1.5 billion annually, Melban said. The industry, however, could be rocked if weevils or other pests are brought into the U.S. due to lack of inspection or corrupt inspections of the fruit.",
      "\"We farm on about 50,000 acres, representing about 3,000 farmers,\" Melban said. \"That's just an average of 17 acres per farmer. So we are a small-scale industry by and large. And, I think that's important because you're looking at family farms that have been in business, this is the second, third, fourth generation for many of them. I've heard from them. I've been with the industry for 15 years and I heard all about the fight 30 years to go to keep Mexico out. And it was strictly from a phytosanitary risk perspective, which is we don't want to see pests introduced into our growing production areas that would decimate our industry.\"",
      "In addition, avocado trees take years to mature, meaning a potential pest infestation could result in a three-to-four-year waiting period as the plants prepare to actually produce fruit. While the cost for recovery would fall on the roughly 3,000 farmers, who would also have to wade through state law on whether they could even use pesticides to kill the insects.",
      "\"We're basically pesticide-free,\" Melban said. \"But if you bring a pest in that we have no other means to control, that's what's going have to happen, just so these growers can fight to save their businesses. And now you get into the domino effect and the collateral damage of using additional pesticides in an industry that we don't wanna use them in. And I think the environmentalists should be very concerned. There are collateral costs to this, to our government in the past administration retreating in the face of threats from cartels.\"",

      "RFID skimming: Some credit and debit cards are equipped with RFID chips that enable contactless payments. Thieves carrying\u00a0handheld RFID readers can capture your card\u2019s data simply by being near you. No physical contact is required, and you often won\u2019t even notice it happening.Card skimming at ATMs and terminals: In some regions, criminals install\u00a0fake card readers over legitimate machines at airports, gas stations or retail locations. These skimmers copy your card\u2019s information when you insert it. In many cases, a hidden camera is also installed nearby to record your PIN as you type it.Pickpocketing and physical theft: Airports are full of distractions, which thieves rely on. A quick bump in a security line or a moment of inattention at the check-in counter is all it takes for someone to slip your wallet out of a bag or pocket.Public Wi-Fi snooping: Using\u00a0unsecured airport or hotel Wi-Fi can expose your private data. Hackers connected to the same network can intercept sensitive information, including credit card numbers and login credentials, especially if you're making purchases or accessing banking apps without protection.Lost or stolen cards: It's not uncommon to misplace a card during travel.

      "Some credit cards include RFID chips that make contactless payments easy and convenient. However, this same feature can be exploited if someone with the right equipment gets close enough to scan your card without your knowledge. Using\u00a0RFID-blocking gear such as a wallet, card sleeve or passport holder is a simple and affordable way to prevent this type of theft. These items are widely available and effective at blocking unauthorized scans.",
      "Limiting the number of cards you bring reduces the risk of your wallet being lost or stolen. Ideally,\u00a0take only one or two credit cards that you plan to use during your trip. Keep any backup cards in your hotel safe and store a secure digital record of your card details in a\u00a0password manager.

      "Most credit card companies offer instant notifications through their mobile apps. Turning on transaction alerts ensures you\u2019ll be notified the moment your card is used, allowing you to spot suspicious activity quickly. If your card issuer offers the ability to lock your card directly from the app, enable that feature as well, so you can act immediately if anything looks off.",

Gently wiggle the card reader or look for anything that seems loose, bulky or out of place. When possible, use ATMs inside banks or secure buildings instead of freestanding machines, which are easier for thieves to target.",
      "Many credit card apps now allow you to temporarily lock your card with a single tap. If you're not planning to use a card for a day or two, consider locking it until you're ready to make a purchase. This simple habit adds an extra layer of protection. If someone tries to use the card while it\u2019s locked, the transaction will be declined.",
      "Apple Pay and\u00a0Google Pay provide an additional level of security by creating unique, one-time-use codes for every transaction.

In the context of sports, this means replicating entire stadiums and live games with incredible accuracy. For example, Arcturus places cameras around the edges of baseball stadiums to capture real-time action and generate a 3D digital clone of the game.

Coaches can use digital twins to simulate different game strategies without risking player fatigue or injury.",

      "If you think you were affected or just want to be cautious, here are 11 steps you can take right now to stay safe from the LSC data breach.",
      "1. Watch out for phishing scams and use strong antivirus software:\u00a0With access to your email, phone number or even lab records, attackers can craft convincing phishing emails pretending to be from healthcare providers or banks. These emails might include malicious links designed to install malware or steal login information. To defend yourself, use a strong antivirus program.\u00a0Get my picks for the best 2025 antivirus protection winners for your Windows, Mac, Android and iOS devices.",
      "2. Scrub your data from the internet using a personal data removal service:\u00a0The more exposed your personal information is online, the easier it is for scammers to use it against you. Following the LSC breach, consider removing your information from public databases and people-search sites.\u00a0Check out my top picks for data removal services here.",
      "3. Safeguard against identity theft and use identity theft protection:\u00a0Hackers now have access to high-value information from the LSC breach, including Social Security numbers, insurance info and even medical IDs. This makes you a prime target for identity theft. They can also assist you in freezing your bank and credit card accounts to prevent further unauthorized use by criminals. Signing up for identity theft protection gives you 24/7 monitoring, alerts for unusual activity and support if your identity is stolen. See my tips and best picks on how to protect yourself from identity theft.",
      "4. Set up fraud alerts: Requesting fraud alerts notifies creditors that they need extra verification before issuing credit in your name. You can request fraud alerts through any one of the three major credit bureaus; they\u2019ll notify the others. This adds another layer of protection without completely freezing access to credit.",
      "5. Keep tabs on your medical records:\u00a0The LSC breach included lab results, diagnoses and treatment data, making medical identity theft a growing concern. Someone could use your info to get care or prescriptions under your name. Regularly review your medical records and insurance claims. If anything looks off, report it to your provider or insurer immediately.",
      "6. Watch out for suspicious snail mail: After the LSC data breach, attackers may use your stolen information to send official-looking letters by post, posing as healthcare providers, insurers or even government agencies. These letters might ask you to call a number, visit a website or provide additional personal information. Just because it arrives in your mailbox doesn\u2019t mean it\u2019s trustworthy. Always verify the source by looking up contact details independently and avoid responding directly to unsolicited mail asking for sensitive information.",
      "7. Use multifactor authentication (MFA): Enable\u00a0MFA on all critical accounts like email, banking apps and healthcare portals. Look in account settings under \"security\" or \"login options\" to activate it. MFA ensures that even if hackers have your password, they\u2019ll need another verification method (like a text code) before accessing your account.",
      "8. Monitor your credit reports: Check your credit reports regularly through\u00a0AnnualCreditReport.com, where you can access free reports from each bureau once per year, or more frequently if you're concerned about fraud. Spotting unauthorized accounts early can prevent larger financial damage.",
      "9. Change passwords and use a password manager: Update passwords on any accounts tied to compromised data. Use unique passwords that are hard to guess and let a password manager do the heavy lifting by generating secure ones for you. Reused passwords are an easy target after breaches. Consider\u00a0password managers for convenience and security.\u00a0Get more details about my best expert-reviewed password managers of 2025 here.",
      "10. Be wary of social engineering attacks: Hackers may use stolen details like names or birth dates from breaches in phone scams or fake customer service calls designed to trick you into revealing more sensitive info. Never share personal details over unsolicited calls or emails. Social engineering attacks rely on trust, and vigilance is key.",
      "11. Secure your online accounts: Review security settings across all important accounts (email, especially). Update recovery options like backup emails or phone numbers and log out of devices you don\u2019t recognize. Compromised accounts can lead hackers straight into other parts of your digital life.",
      "By following these steps, you\u2019ll be taking comprehensive action against potential threats stemming from the LSC data breach.",

      "Windows 11 is the latest and greatest operating system from Microsoft, but it has its flaws, so much so that even four years after its release, some people are sticking with older versions. Windows 10 remains the operating system of choice for many, even though Microsoft has shifted its focus entirely to Windows 11. In fact, the Redmond-based company will end security updates for Windows 10 this October.",
      "If that\u2019s not enough to push you toward upgrading, the latest news might be. The 240 million Windows 10 users are vulnerable to dozens of security vulnerabilities, six of which are reportedly already being exploited by bad actors.",

      "A person typing on a Windows laptop (Kurt \"CyberGuy\" Knutsson)",
      "Critical Windows 10 security flaws exploited",
      "The vulnerabilities in question were part of a recent Microsoft Patch Tuesday update, a monthly release where the company addresses security flaws. In this case, six specific exploits were identified as being actively used by hackers to target Windows 10 systems. These exploits are particularly alarming because they are already in the wild, meaning attackers are leveraging them to compromise systems before all users have had a chance to update their devices.",
      "The affected population, estimated at 240 million, refers to users whose PCs cannot upgrade to Windows 11 due to hardware limitations, such as lacking TPM 2.0 (Trusted Platform Module) or other system requirements.",
      "The six exploits include a mix of flaws that allow hackers to achieve various malicious outcomes, such as executing arbitrary code, escalating privileges to take full control of a system or bypassing security features.",
      "For example, one exploit might overload system memory to overwrite critical data (a buffer overflow), while another could allow attackers to access sensitive information by exploiting a flaw in the Windows Kernel. These vulnerabilities are especially dangerous because they can be triggered remotely or through seemingly innocuous actions, like opening a malicious file or mounting a compromised virtual hard disk.",

The agency even suggested turning off unpatched computers as a precaution. Updating to the latest Windows 10 patch is the simplest and most effective way to protect against these exploits right now.",
      "However, a bigger problem looms later this year. Microsoft will officially end free security updates for Windows 10 on October 14, 2025. After that, systems running Windows 10 will no longer receive critical security patches, unless users enroll in Microsoft\u2019s Extended Security Updates (ESU) program.",
      "This ESU program will be available to individual users for the first time and will cost $30 per device for one additional year of updates. It\u2019s designed to give users more time to transition, especially those who can\u2019t upgrade to Windows 11 due to hardware limitations. While this offers a temporary reprieve, it's not a long-term solution; the ESU program will only extend support for a limited time (typically three years in enterprise settings) and prices may increase annually.",
      "The scale of the problem remains significant. Millions of devices lack the hardware requirements for Windows 11, such as TPM 2.0 and newer CPUs, making the shift costly or impractical for some.

      "2) Limit exposure:\u00a0Many exploits rely on user interaction, such as clicking a shady link, downloading a compromised file or mounting an untrusted virtual disk. Stick to reputable websites, avoid opening unsolicited email attachments and use a browser with built-in security features (like Microsoft Edge or Chrome with Safe Browsing enabled).",
      "3) Plan for the future:\u00a0The clock is ticking on Windows 10\u2019s security updates. If your hardware can\u2019t handle Windows 11, weigh your long-term options. Buying a new PC might be inevitable, but you could also explore alternatives like Linux, which offers free, secure operating systems (e.g., Ubuntu or Linux Mint) that run well on older hardware.",

      "The road ahead for Windows 10 users is anything but smooth. With critical vulnerabilities emerging and official support coming to an end, millions are being pushed into a difficult decision. They can upgrade their hardware, pay for temporary patches or continue using increasingly vulnerable systems. As October draws closer, the risks will only increase. Updating your system is essential, but it\u2019s just a short-term measure. Now is the time to start preparing for what comes after, before the window of protection closes for good.",

These tasks include milking, feeding and manure management. Lely's robots automate these tasks, allowing dairy farmers to focus on other aspects of their business and enjoy a more flexible lifestyle. The Astronaut A5 milking robot, for example, uses a laser-guided robot arm to clean the cow's udder before attaching teat cups. It also monitors milk output and collects data on 32 parameters, including milk quality and cow health indicators.",

      "CHINA'S TRON 1 ROBOT HURDLES OVER OBSTACLES LIKE IT'S NOTHING",
      "Dairy industry 4.0",
      "The introduction of milking machines in the early 1900s and rural electrification in the 1950s significantly increased farm size and milk production. Lely believes that robots will enable small dairy farms to continue scaling sustainably. While dairy robots are expensive, Lely argues that they pay for themselves over time through increased milk production and lower labor costs. Other robots, such as the Vector mobile robot for continuous feeding and feed pushing, and the Discovery Collector, a robotic manure vacuum, further reduce labor needs.",
      "AI also plays a critical role in optimizing feeding systems, reducing waste and improving sustainability, which are key factors in modern dairy farming. Wearable technology and smart sensors are also becoming increasingly important tools in herd health monitoring, offering farmers real-time insights into cow well-being and productivity.",

      "Cows vs robots",
      "Cows are curious animals and tend to interact with robots. Lely has had to cow-proof its robots to ensure they can function autonomously around cows. This includes modifying the robots' design and programming, such as adding contact-sensing bumpers and relocating emergency stop buttons. Engineers have also had to consider the social dynamics within a herd. For example, the Discovery Collector robot had to be programmed to assert its dominance within the herd to avoid being blocked by cows.",
      "Lely recognizes the importance of designing robots that are not only functional but also trustworthy and reliable. Jan Jacobs emphasizes that the robots are not intended to be friends with the cows or the farmers but rather professional employees.",

      "From dairy farmers to robot managers",
      "Lely is working to integrate its robots seamlessly into the daily lives of dairy farmers, who are increasingly becoming robot managers. This requires farmers to manage the robots and learn how to interpret the data they generate. The additional time and flexibility afforded by robots have allowed some dairy farmers to diversify their operations. One Lely customer, for example, has added a restaurant and farm shop to his dairy, allowing patrons to observe the robots at work while enjoying cheese made from the cows they care for.",
      "Lely helps farmers prepare for the shift to robotic dairy farming, both in terms of the physical environment and their mindset. This includes managing the massive amount of data generated by the robots and using it for long-term optimization.",
      "Astronaut milking robot (Lely) (Kurt \"CyberGuy\" Knutsson)",
      "Flexibility and sustainability",
      "Many dairy farms are adopting robots to decrease their dependence on hired help and gain greater flexibility. Farmers report that robots have allowed them to prioritize their personal lives and spend more quality time with their families. Robots also contribute to the long-term viability of smaller dairy farms by making the profession more appealing to younger generations. The reduced workload and commitment associated with robotic farming make it a more attractive career path.",
      "Astronaut milking robot (Lely) (Kurt \"CyberGuy\" Knutsson)",
      "Price",
      "The cost of a milking robot can be several hundred thousand dollars, plus an additional $5,000 to $10,000 per year in operating costs.",
      "SUBSCRIBE TO KURT\u2019S YOUTUBE CHANNEL FOR QUICK VIDEO TIPS ON HOW TO WORK ALL OF YOUR TECH DEVICES",
      "Kurt's key takeaways",
      "So, what's the future of dairy farming look like? It seems like robots are poised to play a huge role, helping farmers work smarter, not harder. It's interesting to think about how these technologies will continue to evolve and shape the industry in the years to come.",
      "At the end of the day, dairy farming is about people and animals. While robots can handle many of the repetitive tasks, it's the farmer's knowledge and care that truly make a difference. These technologies are tools, and how farmers use them will determine the future of their farms and the well-being of their herds. It's definitely a blend of the old and the new for dairy farmers who are purchasing these robots.",

      "Quantum internet is a next-generation network that uses the power of physics to send data in a way that\u2019s ultra-secure and computationally infeasible to hack. Quantum internet, quantum networks and quantum communication are all connected but have different roles.",
      "Quantum internet refers to the entire system that allows ultra-secure communication. Quantum networks are the infrastructure that connect quantum devices. Quantum communication is the actual exchange of information over these networks. Unlike today\u2019s internet, which sends data as either a 0 or a 1, quantum internet relies on quantum bits, or qubits, which can exist as both 0 and 1 at the same time.",
      "This results in an encryption method that is nearly impossible to break, making it one of the most secure ways to communicate. What makes quantum internet even safer is a phenomenon called entanglement. When qubits become entangled, they stay connected no matter how far apart they are. If one qubit is changed, the other changes instantly. Any attempt to disrupt the entanglement, such as hacking, would immediately alert both people communicating.",

      "While the potential of quantum internet is exciting, there are still hurdles to overcome. The technology is still in early development, with most experiments confined to research labs. Unlike the traditional internet, quantum networks need specialized equipment to keep signals strong across cities or even countries. Developing this technology requires massive investments and breakthroughs before quantum internet can become widely available. Another key challenge is the transition from today\u2019s internet to quantum internet.",
      "Since most existing technology is built for current networks, the shift won\u2019t happen overnight. Instead, hybrid systems that combine elements of both traditional and quantum communication can serve as a bridge, helping businesses, governments and everyday users to adapt without disrupting the current digital infrastructure.",
      "Despite these challenges, progress is happening. Major countries, including the U.S., are investing heavily in quantum research, and scientists have successfully demonstrated that the technology works. While it may take years before quantum internet reaches everyday users, these breakthroughs are laying the foundation for a safer, more private digital future.",

      "While quantum internet is a ways away, it's important to stay safe on the internet we use today. Until that new technology arrives, here are a few ways to protect yourself online.",
      "1) Have strong antivirus software:\u00a0Until a more secure internet becomes available, it's important to use tools that help protect against everyday threats like unsafe links and malware. The best way to safeguard yourself from malicious links that install malware, potentially accessing your private information, is to have antivirus software installed on all your devices. This protection can also alert you to phishing emails and ransomware scams, keeping your personal information and digital assets safe. Get my picks for the best 2025 antivirus protection winners for your Windows, Mac, Android and iOS devices.",
      "2) Be careful when using public Wi-Fi: Public Wi-Fi remains one of the easiest ways for hackers to access your data.\u00a0The temptations and risks of free Wi-Fi make it important to think twice before connecting to an unsecured network. Avoid logging into sensitive accounts or entering personal details unless you're using a VPN or other form of encryption.",
      "3) Use a VPN: Consider using a VPN to protect against hackers snooping on your device as well. VPNs will protect you from those who want to track and identify your potential location and the websites that you visit. A reliable VPN is essential for protecting your online privacy and ensuring a secure, high-speed connection.\u00a0For the best VPN software, see my expert review of the best VPNs for browsing the web privately on your\u00a0Windows, Mac, Android and iOS devices.",
      "4) Invest in personal data removal services: While no service promises to remove all your data from the internet, having a removal service is great if you want to constantly monitor and automate the process of removing your information from hundreds of sites continuously over a longer period of time.\u00a0Check out my top picks for data removal services here.",
      "5) Enable two-factor authentication (2FA): Until more advanced security becomes mainstream,\u00a02FA is a simple way to protect your accounts. It adds an extra layer of security by requiring a second step to log in, like a code sent to your phone. For even stronger protection, consider using a\u00a0security key that plugs into your device.",
      "Kurt\u2019s key takeaways",
      "Quantum internet represents a large shift in how we think about communication, privacy and security. By harnessing the power of physics, it promises to create a network that\u2019s faster, more secure and more private than anything we\u2019ve seen before. While the technology is still emerging, it has the potential to change the internet forever.",

      "What is Windows Defender Application Control (WDAC) bypass?",
      "Windows Defender Application Control (WDAC) is a security feature in Windows that enforces strict rules about which applications can run. It helps block unauthorized software, but researchers have found ways to bypass these protections.",
      "Bobby Cooke, a red team operator at IBM X-Force Red,\u00a0confirmed that Microsoft Teams could be used as a WDAC bypass. He explained that during Red Team Operations, they were able to get around WDAC and execute their Stage 2 Command and Control payload.",

      "DOUBLECLICKJACKING HACK TURNS DOUBLE-CLICKS INTO ACCOUNT TAKEOVERS",
      "How hackers bypass Windows Defender Application Control",
      "One of the key ways attackers get around WDAC is by using Living-off-the-Land Binaries, or LOLBins. These are legitimate system tools that come pre-installed with Windows, but hackers can repurpose them to execute unauthorized code while avoiding security detection. Since these tools are trusted by the system, they provide an easy way to slip past defenses.",
      "Some bypass techniques involve DLL sideloading, where attackers trick legitimate applications into loading malicious DLLs instead of the intended ones. Additionally, if WDAC policies are not enforced properly, attackers can modify execution rules to allow unauthorized software to run.",
      "Hackers also use unsigned or loosely signed binaries. WDAC relies on code signing to verify an application\u2019s authenticity. However, attackers sometimes exploit misconfigurations where loosely signed or unsigned binaries are mistakenly allowed, letting them execute malicious payloads.",
      "Once an attacker bypasses WDAC, they can execute payloads without being flagged by traditional security solutions. This means they can deploy ransomware, install backdoors, or move laterally within a network without triggering immediate suspicion. Since many of these attacks use built-in Windows tools, detecting malicious activity becomes even more difficult.",

      "Since this attack exploits a vulnerability within WDAC, there is little you can do to fully protect yourself. It is up to Microsoft to fix the issue. However, here are three best practices you can follow to reduce your risk.",
      "1. Keep Windows updated:\u00a0Microsoft regularly releases security updates that patch vulnerabilities, including those related to WDAC. Keeping Windows and Microsoft Defender up to date ensures you have the latest protection against known threats. If you\u2019re not sure how to do that, see my\u00a0guide on how to keep all your devices and apps updated.",
      "2. Be cautious with software downloads:\u00a0Only install applications from trusted sources like the Microsoft Store or official vendor websites. Avoid pirated software, as it can come bundled with malicious code that bypasses security protections like WDAC.",
      "WHAT IS ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE (AI)?",
      "3. Use strong antivirus software: Based on the report, it does not appear that hackers require user interaction to bypass WDAC. The methods described suggest that an attacker could exploit these vulnerabilities without direct user input, especially if they already have some level of access to the system.",
      "However, in real-world scenarios, attackers often combine such exploits with social engineering or phishing to gain initial access. For example, if an attacker gains access through a phishing attack, they might then use WDAC bypass methods to execute further malicious payloads.",
      "So, while direct user input may not be necessary for some bypass techniques, attackers often use user actions as an entry point before exploiting WDAC vulnerabilities. The best way to avoid becoming a victim is to have a strong antivirus software installed.\u00a0Get my picks for the best 2025 antivirus protection winners for your Windows, Mac, Android and iOS devices.",
      "CLICKFIX MALWARE TRICKS YOU INTO INFECTING YOUR OWN WINDOWS PC",
      "Kurt\u2019s key takeaways",
      "While Windows Defender Application Control (WDAC) offers a valuable layer of security, it isn\u2019t foolproof. Hackers are actively developing and using WDAC bypass techniques to exploit gaps in system defenses. Understanding how WDAC bypass works is essential to protecting your devices. By keeping your software up to date, using trusted applications, and relying on reputable security tools, you can significantly lower your risk.",

      "\"Clara has had a history of seizures that, unfortunately, were uncontrolled with medications. In these cases, surgery may be the only option to reduce and potentially cure the seizure disorder. After a thorough diagnostic evaluation, our group at Mayo Clinic Florida recommended implantation of electrodes (stereoelectroencephalography, or stereo EEG) in the brain to determine where her seizures were originating, in order to develop a surgical plan to treat them.",
      "\"Clara and her family were very much in agreement with this plan, given how debilitating her seizures had been and the failure to control her seizures with medications. Clara underwent implantation of NeuroOne electrodes in order to record seizure activity to determine where her seizures were arising from and then to potentially treat them by performing radiofrequency ablation in these areas.\"",

      "The NeuroOne system uses ultra-thin electrodes to pinpoint the exact source of seizures in the brain. Once identified, it employs radiofrequency energy to disrupt abnormal electrical signals in problematic brain tissue without permanently damaging surrounding areas. This dual functionality, diagnostic and therapeutic, is what sets it apart from traditional methods that require two separate surgeries.",

      "Freund emphasized this advantage:",
      "\"Stereo EEG electrodes provide the ability to localize seizure onset with excellent precision as long as the electrode implantation is planned thoroughly and accurately. With regards to the NeuroOne electrodes, they allow for radiofrequency ablation to be performed while the electrodes are still implanted without having to remove them. We can therefore not only localize the seizure onset but provide a surgical treatment and potentially avoid a second and potentially more extensive or invasive procedure such as a craniotomy and resection of brain tissue.",
      "\"The NeuroOne electrodes allow us to control the conditions of the ablative procedure. They also provide us more confidence that the electrodes will withstand the duration of the implantation, which would include recording seizure data, performing the ablation and then recording more data after the ablation to ensure that the treatment achieved the intended goal.\"",
      "Brain implant patient Clara Fuller (NeuroOne)",
      "THIS MIND-READING TECH USING AI CAN CONVERT BRAIN ACTIVITY INTO TEXT",
      "The results",
      "The results have been nothing short of life-changing for Clara. Since undergoing the procedure, she has been completely seizure-free. She\u2019s now back to enjoying school, sports and uninterrupted sleep \u2013 things most people take for granted but were once unimaginable for her.",
      "According to Freund:",
      "\"Regarding the implantation itself, she did very well and there were no adverse effects. The first ablation did not cause any acute complications. We then performed a second ablation a few days later after data was recorded from the electrodes demonstrating ongoing seizure activity to ensure that her seizures would not recur. This was also well-tolerated without complications. We have now followed up months after the electrodes were removed and there have been no signs of ill effects due to the implantation or the ablations. She has been seizure-free since the ablation and has done amazingly well.\"",
      "Clara\u2019s story offers hope for others living with drug-resistant epilepsy, which affects about one-third of the 3 million Americans with epilepsy. According to Rosa, \"The desire to expand ablation therapy to patients suffering from seizures that do not respond to drug therapy was our driving force.\"",
      "NeuroOne One RF Ablation System (NeuroOne)",
      "A broader impact on medicine",
      "NeuroOne\u2019s innovative technology isn\u2019t just limited to epilepsy treatment. The company plans to expand its applications to other areas, such as pain management for facial pain and lower back pain, using the same RF ablation technology. Rosa also sees potential for treating neurological conditions beyond epilepsy:\u00a0\"Pain management appears to be the largest opportunity outside of brain ablation.\"",
      "Dr. Freund believes this technology could dramatically improve long-term care for pediatric epilepsy patients like Clara:",
      "\"This technology could allow for limiting the number of procedures that are required to treat drug-resistant focal epilepsy and also provide immediate feedback as to whether or not a surgical treatment was effective. This could potentially reduce the risk of adverse events by limiting the number of times that a brain surgery would be needed. This technology also allows us to access deeper parts of the brain to provide surgical treatment.\"",
      "He added that the impact may soon be widespread:",
      "\"In our practice, we are now using these electrodes in every case that requires Stereo EEG for treatment of drug-resistant epilepsy. I think as these types of electrodes are used at more centers and they get more experience, there would be no reason not to use them.\"",

    "summary": "Luigi Mangione&apos;s defense is ramping up its fight against the death penalty early in a federal case in the alleged assassination of UnitedHealthcare CEO Brian Thompson.",
    "story": [
      "\u2018Fox News @ Night\u2019 panelists Nicole Parker and Deon Joseph discuss Taylor Lorenz's comments about Luigi Mangione and online fundraising for alleged 17-year-old murderer Karmelo Anthony.",
      "Luigi Mangione's defense is asking a federal judge to throw out the possibility of the death penalty before Mangione is indicted on federal charges in the assassination of Brian Thompson, the CEO of UnitedHealthcare who was gunned down from behind outside a New York City hotel last year.",
      "In a fiery back-and-forth through court filings, prosecutors said it was too early for the defense to move to have the death penalty taken off the table because Mangione has not been indicted or arraigned, and they have not formally filed notice that they intend to seek capital punishment.",
      "Unofficially, however, Attorney General Pam Bondi said April 1 she was directing prosecutors to seek the death penalty, and the defense took issue with the announcement itself and how she made it in an Instagram post. They argued that the language suggested Mangione has already been convicted of the charges \u2014 he has not \u2014 and that such language prejudiced the grand jury process, which could still be underway with the deadline to file an indictment Friday.",

      "Last week, Mangione's lawyers argued that seeking death in the federal case, which was filed after New York prosecutors leveled their own murder and terrorism charges against him, is \"arbitrary and capricious\" and that the directive for U.S. attorneys to seek capital punishment is politically motivated and influenced by Thompson's status as a prominent CEO.",
      "\"Bigger picture, this may reflect a shift in DOJ policy where they will seek the death penalty in blue states that have a moratorium on or have an outright ban on capital punishment.\"",
      "Federal prosecutors replied with a filing of their own, arguing it was too early to make the argument and that the defense has no authority over how the government shows evidence to a grand jury.",
      "LUIGI MANGIONE PROSECUTORS DIRECTED TO SEEK DEATH PENALTY IN FEDERAL CEO MURDER CASE",
      "On Wednesday, Mangione's attorneys, Karen Friedman Agnifilo and Avi Moskowitz, shot back, accusing the government of violating their client's right to due process by allegedly violating rules about commenting on a pending case outside the courtroom.",
      "Luigi Mangione is escorted from an NYPD helicopter in New York City Dec. 19, 2024. (Rashid Umar Abbasi for Fox News Digital)",
      "Central to the issue is the death penalty announcement, which appeared on the Justice Department's Instagram in a quote attributed to Bondi, which they said was prejudicial to the jury pool.",
      "Mangione's defense said waiting for an indictment would mean waiting too long.",
      "\"Once a prejudiced grand jury returns a death-eligible indictment, it is simply too late,\" they argued.",
      "But the defense faces an uphill battle with those arguments of selective prosecution, according to Neama Rahmani, a Los Angeles-based former federal prosecutor who has been following the case.",
      "UnitedHealthcare CEO Brian Thompson, left, was shot and killed in midtown Manhattan on his way to a shareholder conference. Surveillance cameras captured the ambush. (Businesswire; NYPD Crimestoppers)",
      "\"It didn\u2019t work for Donald Trump. It didn\u2019t work for Hunter Biden and it won\u2019t work for Mangione,\" he told Fox News Digital. \"It\u2019s a very difficult and high legal burden to meet.\"",
      "He predicted that the Justice Department under Bondi, a Trump nominee, may begin to more aggressively seek ways to impose the death penalty for crimes committed in blue states that don't have capital punishment on the books.",
      "\"Bigger picture, this may reflect a shift in DOJ policy where they will seek the death penalty in blue states that have a moratorium on or have an outright ban on capital punishment,\" he said.",
      "Trump has previously said he wants to expand the federal death penalty to cover more crimes and end a moratorium on federal executions put in place by former President Joe Biden.",

      "The attack happened in broad daylight at 10 a.m. about two miles from the University of Arizona campus and just blocks away from Tucson police headquarters.",
      "\"He's got the biggest heart that I believe I've ever met,\" Couch's younger brother, Luke Couch, told Fox News Digital. \"And I really do mean that. He was just a caring person. He loved his family. He was really big about his family.\"",
      "Authorities have released few details about the potential motive for the crime. Michael's lawyer in the initial bond hearing claimed \"self-defense\" couldn't be ruled out in asking the judge for a lesser bond.",
      "The victim's brother, however, told Fox News Digital that detectives said they determined \"there is no evidence to support any claims of self-defense.\"",
      "\"And they said that he was going to be trying to grasp straws, grasp anything. I mean, my brother was attacked from behind while he was bent over. That is not self-defense,\" Luke Couch said.",
      "\"I want to make sure this man never does this again and no other family has to go through what my family has went through. To see my brother lying in a hospital bed and unable to move, unable to do anything, it hurts so bad to know that I wasn't able to be there to protect him because he would have done it for me in a heartbeat,\" the brother told Fox News Digital. \"We as a family want swift justice.\"",
      "\"My brother is a good person and he did not deserve this. Nobody deserves to be attacked with a hatchet on the side of their neck. It's very heinous,\" he added.",
      "Luke Couch further relayed what he was told what had happened, according to investigators and eyewitnesses.",
      "\"They were on the way home from Los Angeles. Their bus stopped in Tucson. They had always wanted to see the desert,\" Luke Couch said of his brother and sister-in-law. \"Somebody told them to get up, and my brother told him to mind his own business, you know, they weren't doing anything, weren't causing any trouble. And then Kristen could tell that the guy was really agitated, and so she told him they were getting up, and they were going to leave.\"",

      "\"My brother bent down to gather his things because they just got off the bus so they had their suitcases and their belongings with them,\" he told Fox News Digital. \"He bent down to gather his things, and the man came up behind him and swung a hatchet. And witnesses said that he lifted the ax up over his head and swang it.\"",

      "His brother said doctors assessed he has limited brain function after suffering heavy blood loss.",
      "\"Doctors haven't given us much hope,\" Luke Couch told Fox News Digital. \"Even though we are just a small family from a small town in Alabama, you know, we do believe that God can move mountains and the power of prayer works. So we please encourage people just to keep praying for him because he is not gone yet and miracles have happened before.\"",

      "\"Please do not let this slip through the cracks. We will not let this slip through the cracks as a family. Do not let this man get out and do this again,\" he said. \"If anybody is on the fence about whether it's ethical or whatnot for \u2018an eye for an eye\u2019 or a harsher punishment, I encourage them to go and look at my brother lying up in a hospital bed.\"",
      "\"This country is not as safe as we thought,\" Luke Couch continued. \"Please don't let these criminals think that they can just get away with this because, from my understanding, this has become a pattern in Tucson. I'm not from this area, I don't know for sure, but I can speak on what has happened to me and my family and it's senseless. No parent should have to bury their child.

      "Nearly a month into Israel\u2019s renewed ground operation, U.S. backing appears to be shaping the conflict on multiple levels\u2014militarily, diplomatically and politically. Israeli officials have suggested the chances of a hostage deal have significantly increased, with some anticipating developments within the next two weeks.",
      "On Monday, sitting beside Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu in the Oval Office, President Donald Trump told reporters, \"We are trying very hard to get the hostages out. We're looking at another ceasefire. We'll see what happens.\" The remarks highlighted Trump\u2019s dual-track approach: continued diplomatic pressure on Iran and direct support for Israel\u2019s military campaign in Gaza.",
      "With what Israeli officials describe as a \"free hand\" to operate, Israel has expanded its offensive into Rafah and the strategically significant Morag Corridor. The stated aim is to increase pressure on Hamas and help secure the release of the remaining 59 hostages.",
      "ISRAEL LAUNCHES NEW GROUND OPERATION IN GAZA",
      "A senior Israeli security official told Fox News Digital that the campaign is being carried out in close coordination with the United States. \"Everything is coordinated with the Americans \u2014 both the negotiations and the operational activity. The goal is to bring the hostages home. We now have a free hand to act, and no longer facing the threat of a veto at the UN Security Council, unlike during the previous administration.\"",
      "The same official pointed to a shift in humanitarian policy that, in their view, has enhanced Israeli leverage. \"Unlike the previous administration, the U.S. is not forcing 350 aid trucks into Gaza every day. That gives us leverage,\" the official said, adding that limiting aid reduces Hamas\u2019s ability to control the population.",
      "On Saturday, Israeli Defense Minister Israel Katz announced the IDF had completed the takeover of the Morag Axis. The Morag Corridor \u2014 which separates Rafah from Khan Younis \u2014 is part of an effort to establish a new buffer zone and degrade Hamas\u2019s operational capabilities. \"The logic is that the more territory Hamas loses, the more likely it will be to compromise on a hostage deal,\" the official said.",
      "IDF Chief of Staff Lt. Gen. Eyal Zamir reinforced that strategy during a visit to front-line units this week. \"I expect you to defeat the Rafah Brigade and lead to victory wherever you are fighting,\" he told troops. The IDF had previously declared the Rafah Brigade dismantled in September, but forces have returned to key strongholds, where tunnel networks remain.",

Hamas leaders are hiding in tunnels with their families or living in luxury hotels abroad, with billions in bank accounts, using you as human shields. Now is the time to rise up, to get rid of Hamas, and to release all the Israeli hostages \u2014 that is the only way to stop the war.\"",
      "In their Oval Office meeting, Trump and Netanyahu reiterated their alignment on core issues. Netanyahu stated that Gazans should be \"free to choose to go wherever they want,\" in what some analysts view as a reference to renewed discussions about third-country resettlement. Trump went further, floating the idea of a U.S. presence in the Strip, noting, \"Gaza is an incredible piece of important real estate. Having a peace force like the United States there, controlling and owning the Gaza Strip would be a good thing.\"",
      "Javed Ali, a former senior director at the U.S. National Security Council and now a professor at the University of Michigan, offered a more measured view of the current military strategy. \"Now that we're almost a full month into the resumption of high-intensity IDF operations in the Gaza Strip against Hamas, Israel's military strategy appears to be focused on clearing and holding remaining pockets of known Hamas elements, which at the same time is displacing Palestinians throughout the territory.\"",
      "CEASEFIRE OVER AS ISRAEL STRIKES GAZA AFTER HAMAS REFUSED TO RELEASE HOSTAGES, OFFICIALS SAY",
      "Israeli forces establish the Morag Corridor in Gaza. (IDF)",
      "Ali said it remains unclear how Israel intends to manage or govern areas it clears. He drew comparisons to the U.S. experience in Iraq and Afghanistan. \"The U.S. encountered its own challenges in the post-9/11 wars with similar 'clear and hold' approaches, since insurgent and jihadist elements in both conflicts utilized guerrilla warfare tactics and terrorist attacks.\"",
      "While the Biden administration had previously emphasized humanitarian access, Ali noted that the current White House has not publicly pressed Israel to scale back its operations. \"That could change,\" he said, particularly as humanitarian conditions worsen or if negotiations with Iran over its nuclear program progress. \"If those talks gain momentum, Iran may pressure the U.S. to rein in Israel\u2019s campaign against Hamas to preserve what remains of the group. Whether the U.S. team, led by Steve Witkoff, entertains such demands will be a key regional development to watch.\"",
      "On the ground, Israel has moved to reshape the humanitarian landscape in Gaza. The decision to restrict Hamas\u2019s access to aid reflects a broader policy shift under IDF Chief of Staff Lt. Gen. Eyal Zamir, who reversed his predecessor's stance and authorized the military to directly oversee the distribution of supplies. \"Hamas will not regain control over the aid, because that was its lifeline,\" an Israeli security official explained. \"It\u2019s what allowed it to maintain control over the territory throughout this period. People in Gaza know that Hamas controls the aid; if they realize that Hamas no longer does, its control within the Strip becomes ineffective.\"",
      "Israeli troops deployed to Gaza. (IDF)",
      "Humanitarian organizations and international leaders continue to condemn Israel. U.N. Secretary-General Ant\u00f3nio Guterres, speaking on April 8, condemned the ongoing blockade of aid. \"More than an entire month has passed without a drop of aid into Gaza. No food. No fuel. No medicine. Gaza is a killing field \u2014 and civilians are in an endless death loop,\" he said.",
      "Israel\u2019s Foreign Ministry spokesperson, Oren Marmorstein, strongly rejected the Secretary-General\u2019s claims. \"As always, you don\u2019t let the facts get in the way when spreading slander against Israel,\" he posted on X. \"There is no shortage of humanitarian aid in the Gaza Strip \u2014 over 25,000 aid trucks have entered during the 42 days of the ceasefire. Hamas used this aid to rebuild its war machine. Yet, not a word in your statement about the imperative for Hamas to leave Gaza. The people of Gaza are braver than you \u2014 they\u2019re calling, loud and clear, on Hamas to leave and stop abusing them.\"",
      "Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu with Defense Minister Israel Katz (Israeli PM)",
      "Eugene Kontorovich, a senior legal scholar at the Heritage Foundation, told Fox News Digital: \"One doesn\u2019t need the Israeli Supreme Court to say there is no starvation in Gaza \u2014 this was admitted by the UN\u2019s own Food Security Phase Classification, which in June found that prior UN reports were inaccurate and that there is no famine. There is no serious evidence of starvation in Gaza, and what food scarcity does exist can be attributed to Hamas pillaging and hoarding aid.

    "summary": "The Trump administration released a series of documents after weeks of pressure to prove its contention that Kilmar Abrego Garcia was a member of the MS-13 gang.",
    "story": [
      "The Trump administration released documents Wednesday that revealed new details in the case of Kilmar Abrego Garcia, a Maryland man deported to El Salvador a month ago in what a government lawyer called an \u201cadministrative error.\u201d",
      "The documents were released after weeks of pressure on the government to prove its contention that Abrego Garcia was a member of the MS-13 gang. The Trump administration sent him to a notorious megaprison in the Central American country as part of its promised deportation program of alleged criminals.",
      "The Justice Department shared records, not previously made public, detailing how police officers in Maryland assessed Abrego Garcia was a member of the MS-13 gang during an arrest in 2019. He had no criminal history at the time, which the documents also state, and his attorneys have denied that he is a gang member.",
      "In a document titled \u201cgang field interview sheet,\u201d the Prince George\u2019s County Police Department detailed how in March 2019 it approached Abrego Garcia along with three other people for loitering at a Home Depot parking lot in Hyattsville. Abrego Garcia said in a court filing that he was there looking for day labor work.",
      "Police said he was wearing \u201ca Chicago Bulls hat and a hoodie with rolls of money covering the eyes, ears and mouth of the presidents\u201d on the bills.",
      "The officers said such insignia \u2014 indicating \u201cver, oir, y callar\u201d or \u201csee no evil, hear no evil and say no evil\u201d \u2014 was \u201cindicative of the Hispanic gang culture.\u201d The officers said they consulted with a reliable confidential source, who \u201cadvised that [Abrego Garcia] is the rank of \u2018Chequeo\u2019 with the moniker of \u2018Chele\u2019\u201d in the gang.",
      "Abrego Garcia was handed over to immigration authorities, and he wound his way through the legal process. Later in 2019, an immigration judge barred him from being sent to El Salvador. The order said he proved he had a \u201cwell-founded fear of future persecution\u201d from local gangs, and he was granted a withholding of removal\u00a0to the country, which allowed him to stay in the United States temporarily and receive a work permit.",
      "Years later, in 2025, immigration agents stopped Abrego Garcia in an Ikea parking lot. He was deported to El Salvador days later, on March 15.",
      "The Supreme Court ruled last week that the government must \u201cfacilitate\u201d his release from the prison. Salvadoran President Nayib Bukele said in a meeting at the White House this week that he would not release Abrego Garcia.",
      "\"Mr. Abrego Garcia has never been convicted of a crime. If the government believes there is a legitimate case to be made, it should present that case in a court of law and have a judge review and decide his fate\u2014not on social media,\" his lawyers said in a statement.\u00a0\"We look forward to the government complying with the Court\u2019s order and facilitating Mr. Abrego Garcia\u2019s immediate release from custody in El Salvador.\u00a0We will continue to fight for our client\u2019s safe return and to ensure his constitutional rights are fully restored.\"",
      "Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem said in a statement Wednesday, \u201cWe hear far too much in the mainstream media about sob stories of gang members and criminal illegals and not enough about their victims.\u201d",
      "Police determined during the 2019 arrest that two other people who were with Abrego Garcia in the Home Depot parking lot were gang members, citing one man\u2019s criminal history and another man\u2019s tattoos, as well as information from an unidentified person who was a \u201cpast proven and reliable source of information.\u201d",
      "The documents said that the four men said they were citizens of El Salvador and were \u201cpresent in the United States illegally\u201d and that they did not have immigration documents on them.",
      "Another document released Wednesday, from the Department of Homeland Security in 2019, said police identified two men, one of whom was Abrego Garcia, as being having been previously detained in a murder investigation. Abrego Garcia denied being connected to a murder investigation, the documents say, and he was never charged.",
      "A page of the document includes a contradiction \u2014 at one point it says Abrego Garcia did not claim a fear of returning to his country, but later it says he did claim fear of returning to El Salvador.",
      "The document said Abrego Garcia claimed he had presented sufficient evidence to refute the gang allegation, including character references and his lack of criminal record, minus traffic offenses.",
      "In another document from the Justice Department\u2019s Executive Office of Immigration Review, a court agreed to deny Abrego Garcia bond after his arrest outside the Home Depot in 2019 and wrote that the allegation that he is a gang member \u201cappears to be trustworthy and is supported by other evidence in the record\u201d in the Prince George\u2019s County police documents.",
      "\u201cThe reason for the Respondent\u2019s arrest given on his Form 1-213 does appear at odds with the Gang Field Interview Sheet, which states that the Respondent was approached because he and others were loitering outside of Home Depot,\u201d the document said, but it added that it still found the allegations of his gang membership to be supported.",
      "Abrego Garcia responded that \u201cthere is no reliable evidence in the record to support\u201d that he is a member of MS-13 and that the allegation \u201cis based on hearsay relayed by a confidential source.\u201d",
      "Aside from the new documents, the Department of Homeland Security posted on social media earlier Wednesday that Abrego Garcia\u2019s wife had sought a temporary protective order against him in 2021. The case was ultimately dismissed. Abrego Garcia\u2019s wife, Jennifer Vasquez Sura, has been a strong, vocal supporter of her husband and has fought for his return.",
      "\u201cAfter surviving domestic violence in a previous relationship, I acted out of caution after a disagreement with Kilmar by seeking a civil protective order in case things escalated,\u201d Vasquez Sura said in a statement Wednesday. \u201cThings did not escalate, and I decided not to follow through with the civil court process.",
      "\u201cNo one is perfect, and no marriage is perfect. That is not a justification for ICE\u2019s action of abducting him and deporting him to a country where he was supposed to be protected from deportation,\u201d she added.",
      "Meanwhile, the Trump administration, Abrego Garcia\u2019s lawyers and an appeals court judge continue to litigate the Supreme Court\u2019s instruction that the government facilitate his release.",
      "The Trump administration Wednesday afternoon filed an appeal of U.S. District Judge Paula Xinis\u2019 order last Thursday to the 4th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals, in which she directed the Trump administration to \u201ctake all available steps to facilitate the return of Abrego Garcia to the United States as soon as possible.\u201d",
      "Xinis questioned the evidence an immigration judge used to determine that Abrego Garcia is a gang member. She said in a ruling that he has no criminal record in the United States or El Salvador and that the \u201c\u2018evidence\u2019 against Abrego Garcia consisted only of his Chicago Bulls hat and hoodie, and a vague, uncorroborated allegation from a confidential informant claiming he belonged to MS-13\u2019s \u2018Western\u2019 clique in New York \u2014 a place he has never lived.\u201d",
      "Xinis said Tuesday that she was considering contempt proceedings against\u00a0the Trump administration.",
      "She had ordered the government to supply evidence of efforts it has  taken to \u201cfacilitate\u201d Abrego Garcia\u2019s release, and on Tuesday she criticized the government\u2019s lack of response.",
      "\u201cI\u2019ve gotten nothing,\u201d Xinis said. \u201cI\u2019ve gotten no real response and no real legal justification for not answering.\u201d",
      "In a court-ordered daily status update, DHS general counsel Joseph Mazzara wrote, \u201cGiven the government\u2019s prior clear and unequivocal notice to the court regarding how the government will facilitate Abrego Garcia\u2019s return within the counters of existing law and regulation, there are no further updates.\u201d"

It has been the place to prep for wash day as they transitioned to natural hair in their adulthood. Korean Americans own many of the stores, but Black ownership is slowly growing.",
      "In the United States, Black hair care is estimated to be a more than $2.5 billion industry. And foreign exporters are critical to that engine, providing everything from the wefts used in sew-ins to ingredients for ethnic hair care products, like shea butter imported from Ghana and elsewhere."

      "Noem also said she sent a letter to Harvard demanding \"detailed records\" on foreign student visa holders\u2019 \"illegal and violent activities\" by April 30.",
      "If Harvard does not meet that deadline, it\u2019ll immediately lose its Student and Exchange Visitor Program certification, she warned.",

    "story": [
      "An E. coli outbreak linked to romaine lettuce ripped across 15 states in November, sickening dozens of people, including a 9-year-old boy in Indiana who nearly died of kidney failure and a 57-year-old Missouri woman who fell ill after attending a funeral lunch. One person died.",
      "But chances are you haven\u2019t heard about it.",
      "The Food and Drug Administration\u00a0indicated in February that it had\u00a0closed the investigation without publicly detailing what had happened \u2014 or which companies were responsible for growing and processing the contaminated lettuce.",
      "According to an internal report obtained by NBC News, the FDA did not name the companies because no contaminated lettuce was left by the time investigators uncovered where the pathogen was coming from.",
      "\u201cThere were no public communications related to this outbreak,\u201d the FDA said in its report, which noted that there had been a death but provided no details about it.",
      "Federal officials are not required by law to reveal detailed information about all known outbreaks of foodborne illnesses, and there are reasons the FDA may choose not to publicize an outbreak, including when the cause is unknown or when officials are still working behind the scenes with the companies responsible.",
      "But the FDA had shifted in recent years toward greater transparency in the wake of large-scale outbreaks and heightened public concern about contaminated food, said Frank Yiannas, the former deputy commissioner of food policy and response at the agency.",
      "\u201cIt is disturbing that FDA hasn\u2019t said anything more public or identified the name of a grower or processor,\u201d said Yiannas, who was at the FDA from 2018 to 2023.",
      "By declining to name the culprit, he said, the FDA was withholding critical information that consumers could use to make decisions about what they buy. It\u2019s also possible that someone could have been sickened during the outbreak and not have realized the cause, and serious bacterial illness can cause long-term damage.",
      "Do you have a news tip you\u2019d like to share about food safety or outbreaks of foodborne illness? You can message Suzy Khimm on Signal: SuzyKhimm.42 or contact NBC News securely\u00a0here.",
      "The FDA, which is a part of the Department of Health and Human Services, denied that its response to the recent E. coli outbreak marked any shift in policy.",
      "\u201cThe FDA names firms when there is enough evidence linking an outbreak to a firm and there is\u202factionable advice for consumers, as long as naming the firm is not legally prohibited,\u201d a spokesperson said in a statement to NBC News. \u201cBy the time investigators had confirmed the likely source, the outbreak had already ended and there was no actionable advice for consumers.\u201d",
      "Food safety advocates argue that disclosing such information is still critical to ensure that people will dispose of contaminated food they may have frozen and stored and to allow consumers to make informed choices.",
      "\u201cPeople have a right to know who\u2019s selling contaminated products,\u201d said Sandra Eskin, a former official at the U.S. Agriculture Department who now works as a food safety advocate.",
      "But much of the staff responsible for developing and distributing information to the public about foodborne illnesses was terminated this month as part of the Trump administration\u2019s sweeping effort to shrink the federal government.",
      "\u201cWe no longer have all the mechanisms in place to learn from those situations and prevent the next outbreak from happening,\u201d said Taryn Webb, who led the FDA\u2019s public engagement division for human foods until she was laid off during the mass firing this month.",
      "And the administration has separately moved to delay a new federal rule requiring food companies and grocery stores to rapidly track down contaminated food and pull it off the shelves, though the FDA said the delay was meant to give time to ensure better compliance.",
      "The FDA said its staff members \u201ccontinue to provide critical communications to consumers associated with foodborne outbreaks,\u201d including information about recalls and investigations.",
      "The morning the first cases of E. coli started coming in, Dr. Amanda Brzozowski sensed something was very wrong.",
      "It was early November, and all three were E. coli 0157:H7 \u2014 an especially dangerous strain that can result in severe illness, organ damage and, in rare cases, death \u2014 and the people sickened were all high school students who lived in the same area of St. Louis County.",
      "Brzozowski, a senior epidemiologist for the county, immediately reached out to the school they attended, and, within hours, more families were reporting symptoms of E. coli infection: bloody diarrhea, stomach cramps, vomiting and dehydration.",
      "Ultimately, the county Public Health Department found 115 confirmed or probable E. coli cases linked to food served by a local catering company \u2014 and that the salads they ate were a likely culprit.\u00a0The catering company has declined to comment.",
      "\u201cIt was really scary,\u201d Brzozowski told NBC News. \u201cThis type of situation we\u2019ve never seen before.\u201d",
      "The victims included 15-year-old Austin Carnaghi, who opted for more salad instead of a brownie at his marching band\u2019s annual banquet before he developed severe stomach pain and needed to be hospitalized, according to his mother, Kristiana Carnaghi. \u201cIt was an unbelievable amount of cramping,\u201d she said.",
      "Miles away in Indiana, the same strain of E. coli had stricken another boy.",
      "The morning after he played basketball, Colton George, 9, woke up and was doubled over in pain. His parents rushed him to the hospital, where testing confirmed the presence of E. coli 0157:H7.",
      "He had developed hemolytic uremic syndrome, a life-threatening complication from the E. coli infection, and needed to be put on around-the-clock dialysis, without food or drink for days.",
      "His parents, Christopher and Amber George, tried to prepare Colton for what was happening. \u201cUnfortunately, if we don\u2019t do this,\u201d his mother said she told him,\u00a0\u201cthere is a chance you won\u2019t make it.\u201d",
      "Colton was on dialysis in a hospital bed for two weeks \u2014 including over his 10th birthday \u2014 before he was released. Months later, he is back to playing basketball but still experiences chronic stomach pain and fatigue because of the complications.",
      "And his parents have been wrestling with the same question ever since the doctors told them that the E. coli must have come from something Colton had eaten.",
      "\u201cWhere did he get this from?\u201d his father said. \u201cSomething must have gone wrong somewhere.\u201d",
      "Colton's parents say it wasn't just a coincidence their son had symptoms similar to those of the Missouri high-school students, around the same time and with the same diagnosis of E. coli 0157:H7.",
      "The bacteria that infected them had the same genetic sequencing, according to a lawsuit by the Georges that alleges the tainted produce came from Taylor Farms, one of the country\u2019s largest producers of salads and fresh cut vegetables.",
      "Public health officials use genetic fingerprints of bacteria to help pinpoint the source of foodborne illnesses. In late November, FDA officials were alerted to a cluster of E. coli O157:H7 cases after Missouri officials investigated the cases linked to the catering company, according to the FDA\u2019s report on the outbreak.",
      "The genomic fingerprint of the pathogen was also posted to a\u00a0national laboratory network for tracking foodborne illnesses.",
      "That data was used to help connect 89 cases across 15 states: The youngest victim was 4, and the oldest was 90. They all first had symptoms in November; more than a third were hospitalized, and seven had developed hemolytic uremic syndrome, a disease that affects kidney function. But the number of probable cases local health officials tallied was significantly higher, since not all victims went to the hospital and had samples that were genetically sequenced, Brzozowski said.",
      "Using the genetic analysis, local health surveys and other evidence, federal investigators came to a conclusion. \u201cBased on epidemiologic and traceback data, romaine lettuce was confirmed as the source of this outbreak,\u201d according to the report, which noted the contaminated produce came from \u201ca sole processor\u201d that had obtained the lettuce from a grower.",
      "But the FDA redacted the name of the companies that processed and grew the lettuce before it released the report in response to a public records request filed by the Georges\u2019 attorney, Bill Marler.",
      "As part of the lawsuit, Marler obtained receipts, also reviewed by NBC News, that he says show the salad linked to the outbreak originally came from Salinas, California-based Taylor Farms, which supplies major supermarkets and chain restaurants across the country.",
      "The Georges, the Carnaghis and other victims have all accused Taylor Farms in nine different lawsuits, arguing in court papers that it sold \u201cdefective and unreasonably dangerous\u201d food products.",
      "Taylor Farms denied that any of its products were responsible for the outbreak.",
      "\u201cWe don\u2019t believe Taylor Farms was the source of the referenced recent E. coli outbreaks, based on information collected during thorough third-party investigations and robust food safety controls,\u201d it said in a statement.",
      "After this article was published, Taylor Farms released an updated statement saying, in part, \u201cTaylor Farms product\u00a0WAS NOT\u00a0the source of the referenced 2024 E. Coli outbreak. We perform extensive raw and finished product testing on all our product and there was no evidence of contamination.\u201d",
      "Asked whether Taylor Farms had produced the contaminated lettuce involved in the outbreak, the FDA said in a statement that it was restricted by federal law from disclosing \u201cconfidential commercial information.\u201d",
      "The accusations against the company come on the heels of another deadly outbreak: In October, just weeks before the St. Louis cases surfaced, Taylor Farms had voluntarily recalled yellow onions linked to a separate E. coli outbreak \u2014 one that also infected more than 100 people and killed one.",
      "In that case, though, the FDA issued an advisory notifying the public about the contaminated onions, which were served on McDonald\u2019s hamburgers, making headlines across the country.",
      "Taylor Farms said it would always act out of an abundance of caution to protect consumers. It added that it had robust food safety and pathogen testing procedures and that onion samples that health officials had taken at McDonald\u2019s restaurants had tested negative for E. coli O157:H7.",
      "On the romaine lettuce outbreak, the FDA said only that it was investigating an E. coli O157:H7 outbreak involving 89 cases.",
      "In mid-January, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention declared the outbreak was over, according to a letter sent to state health departments obtained by NBC News. And in February, the FDA moved its outbreak investigation from \u201cactive\u201d to \u201cclosed,\u201d without providing further details, according to archived versions of its website.",
      "The full scope of the outbreak came to light only in response to the public records requests filed by the victims' attorneys.",
      "Even in outbreaks without recalled products, Yiannas said, he pushed the FDA to publish more advisories describing the cases and where they occurred, the symptoms to watch for and the brands of contaminated food that were sold, as well as investigative reports detailing the FDA\u2019s findings.",
      "In 2022, for instance, the FDA issued public health advisories in cases of hepatitis A in fresh strawberries and E. coli in packaged salad greens, even though they were not subject to recalls and were no longer sold.",
      "The FDA told NBC News that it had issued such statements because \u201cconsumers could have frozen product for later use\u201d and the outbreaks were still ongoing when it pinpointed the source, unlike with the 2024 E. coli case linked to romaine lettuce.",
      "Federal officials may also hold off on making public statements while they are privately pushing food growers and processors to change their safety practices and procedures or because elements are still under investigation, former FDA staff members said. Other times, the federal government may not have enough definite evidence to pinpoint the source of an outbreak.",
      "It\u2019s especially challenging for FDA investigators to hunt down and identify foodborne illness linked to fresh produce, because the products have a short shelf life compared to canned goods, which can be stored for years. Highly perishable, fresh produce is often considered out of circulation once it is no longer available for sale.",
      "But publicly identifying the source can help pressure companies to adopt and improve practices to prevent food from being contaminated in the first place, said Barbara Kowalcyk, a professor and food safety expert at George Washington University.",
      "E. coli cases can stem in some cases from contamination between animal waste and produce while fruits and vegetables are still being grown in fields, because of runoff from livestock farms, the design of irrigation systems or even extreme weather that results in an unexpected flooding of contaminated water.",
      "\u201cThe whole purpose of investigating these outbreaks is to stop the illnesses and to learn how to prevent future outbreaks,\u201d Kowalcyk said. \u201cIf you don\u2019t come out and talk about what happened, we\u2019ve lost that opportunity.\u201d",
      "And the FDA\u2019s reticence about the romaine lettuce outbreak has angered families like the Georges, who say they are still struggling to pay off about $20,000 in medical bills while their son continues to recover. Even if that contaminated lettuce is no longer sold, they believe the public has a right to know.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s not fair for them to get off the hook,\u201d Amber George said. \u201cPeople are still going out and buying their product every day and have no idea what happened.\u201d"

      "Rodgers, considered one of the greatest signal-callers in league history, played his first 18 seasons with the Green Bay Packers, leading the franchise to a Super Bowl victory in 2011. He was named the NFL's most valuable player four times and was a 10-time Pro Bowler.",
      "He joined the Jets in 2023 and had an up-and-down experience in New York. He missed almost the entire first season after tearing his Achilles just four plays in.

So I have a lot of things that are taking my attention \u2014 and have, beginning in January \u2014 away from football.\u201d",

The franchise could be an ideal landing spot for Rodgers, as the only quarterbacks on the roster, Mason Rudolph and Skylar Thompson, are largely unproven over the course of an entire NFL season.",
      "\"(Tomlin is) more than I even thought from afar as far as the type of person he is,\u201d Rodgers said. \u201cI have a lot of respect for what he\u2019s accomplished in the league.\u201d",

      "\u201cI was honest from the jump of where I was at mentally and some of the constraints I have in my life right now that warrant my attention,\u201d he said. \u201cRetirement could still be a possibility, but right now my focus has been and will continue to be my personal life.

      "Donald Trump, the candidate, pledged to get \u201ctransgender insanity the hell out of our schools\u201d and \u201ckeep men out of women\u2019s sports.\u201d",
      "Donald Trump, the president, wasted little time delivering on his promise to address a topic that seemed to resonate across party lines. Trump issued an executive order on the day his second term began that called for \u201crestoring biological truth to the federal government\u201d and signed another on Wednesday titled \u201c Keeping Men Out of Women\u2019s Sports. \u201c",
      "The federal government now has wide latitude across multiple agencies to penalize federally funded entities that \u201cdeprive women and girls of fair athletic opportunities.\u201d",
      "\u201cThe war on women\u2019s sports is over,\u201d Trump declared.",
      "Probably not. Legal challenges like the ones against other executive orders aimed at transgender people are likely and on Wednesday, the Trump administration sued Maine for not complying with the government\u2019s push to ban transgender athletes in girls and women\u2019s sports.",
      "What is in the executive order?",
      "The biggest takeaway is that the Trump administration has empowered the federal government to take aggressive steps to go after entities \u2014 be they a school or an athletic association and now a state \u2014 that do not comply. Federal funding, and potentially grants to educational programs, could be pulled.",
      "The threshold for noncompliance: Any entity that denies \u201cfemale students an equal opportunity to participate in sports and athletic events by requiring them, in the women\u2019s category, to compete with or against or to appear unclothed before males.\u201d",
      "The Education Department announced less than 24 hours after the order\u2019s signing that it was investigating San Jose State University, the University of Pennsylvania and the Massachusetts Interscholastic Athletic Association, all of which have had Title IX violations reported against them for allowing transgender athletes to compete. It also investigated Maine and last week referred the case to the Justice Department.",
      "Determining \u201csex\u201d vs. \u201cgender\u201d and how will that affect Title IX?",
      "Every administration has the authority to issue its own interpretations of the landmark legislation best known for its role in ensuring gender equity in athletics and preventing sexual harassment on campuses.",
      "Given the push-pull of how recent presidencies view Title IX, it has created a whiplash effect.",
      "Joe Biden signed an executive order on his first day in office that interpreted sex as \u201cgender identity\u201d under Title IX, a move that protected transgender athletes from being discriminated against if they wanted to participate in a sport that aligned with their gender identity, not their sex assigned at birth.",
      "Yet it took more than three years for Title IX regulations saying that to be finalized. And when they were, they lacked specifics sports and were put on hold by courts.",
      "Trump\u2019s order explicitly states that sex means the \u201cimmutable biological classification as either male or female.\u201d \u2018Sex\u2019 is not a synonym for and does not include the concept of \u201cgender identity.\u201d The order adds that \u201csexes are not changeable and are grounded in fundamental and incontrovertible reality.\u201d",
      "The decision marks a significant shift in the way Title IX is viewed and more explicitly, how it will be enforced.",
      "How many transgender athletes will be affected?",
      "That number is hard to pin down.",
      "The NCAA, for example, does not track data on transgender athletes among the 544,000 currently competing on 19,000 teams at various levels across the country, though NCAA President Charlie Baker testified in Congress in December that he was aware of fewer than 10 active NCAA athletes who identified as transgender.",
      "A 2019 survey of high school students by the Gay, Lesbian and Straight Education Network (GLSEN) noted just 5% of respondents said they participated in a sport that aligned with their gender identity. A 2022 report by the Williams Institute estimated about 300,000 high school-age students (ages 13-17) identified as transgender. How many of those young people participate in sports is unknown, but it is likely a tiny fraction.",
      "Does the order have actual teeth?",
      "The reach of Title IX extends far beyond the participation of transgender athletes. Noncompliance is believed to be widespread.",
      "The Women\u2019s Sports Foundation noted in a 2022 report that there were still \u201cgross gender inequities\u201d across all college divisions and that there was \u201ccause for concern about widespread Title IX noncompliance in high school and college and university athletic programs\u201d even before the COVID-19 pandemic made women\u2019s sports even more vulnerable.",
      "Yet to date no school at any level has had its federal funding rescinded for not meeting Title IX standards that require institutions to provide women with equal access and treatment, said Cheryl Cooky, a professor at Purdue University who studies the intersection of gender, sports, media and culture. She wondered where all this support for women\u2019s sports in general \u2014 and not on this issue specifically \u2014 has been for the last five decades.",
      "\u201cAll of these other inequalities have existed and now you\u2019re in a position of power to address those opportunities and this is what you\u2019re addressing?\u201d Cooky said earlier this year. \u201cThe fact that this is the issue that the administration is concerned about speaks volumes in terms of how we value women in this society and how we value women\u2019s sports in this society.\u201d",
      "Yet given Trump\u2019s unpredictable approach to governing, precedent and history might not apply.",
      "How will this work at the state level?",
      "About half the states have already enacted legislation that effectively bars transgender athletes from competing in the category that aligns with their gender identity. The AP reported in 2021 that in many cases, states introducing a ban on transgender athletes could not cite instances where their participation was an issue.",
      "Some states are already planning to challenge the Trump order in court. Connecticut Attorney General William Tong called the order \u201cmean spirited and unlawful\u201d and called for those opposed to the order to \u201cstand together and fight back.\u201d",
      "What also remains unclear is whether a federal agency can go after specific organizations \u2014 like state high school sports associations \u2014 that do not receive money directly from the federal government.",
      "How will this affect college sports?",
      "The NCAA Board of Governors moved quickly, amending its transgender participation policy to limit competition in women\u2019s sports to athletes assigned female at birth. The NCAA has more than 500,000 athletes competing for some 1,100 schools.",
      "\u201cWe strongly believe that clear, consistent, and uniform eligibility standards would best serve today\u2019s student-athletes instead of a patchwork of conflicting state laws and court decisions,\u201d Baker said then. \u201cTo that end, President Trump\u2019s order provides a clear, national standard.\u201d",
      "The National Association of Intercollegiate Athletics, the governing body for more than 200 small schools across the country, voted unanimously in 2023 to effectively ban transgender athletes from competing in women\u2019s sports.",
      "What about the Olympics?",
      "On a move most saw coming once Trump won a second term, his administration still managed to sneak in a curveball.",
      "The order calls for the office of the secretary of state to use \u201call appropriate and available measures\u201d in hopes of having the International Olympic Committee come up with a uniform transgender policy. The organization has passed the buck for years, deferring to the international federations for each sport.",
      "Kirsty Coventry, the sports minister of Zimbabwe, has replaced Thomas Bach as IOC president. A two-time Olympic champion swimmer, she told the BBC before her election that it is the IOC\u2019s duty to ensure equal opportunity and fairness.",
      "\u201cI don\u2019t believe we can do that based off of the medical and science research that I\u2019ve seen if we add or allow for transgender women to compete in the female category right now,\u201d she said then. \u201cIt is very clear that transgender women are more able in the female category, and can take away opportunities that should be equal for women.\u201d"

      "Israeli officials maintain there is \"no shortage\" of aid in Gaza and accuse Hamas of withholding supplies. Israel says its blockade is crucial to its goal of weakening the militant group's control over the population.",
      "The United Nations Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs (OCHA) and the World Food Programme (WFP) told NBC News they had seen \"no evidence\" of a diversion of aid in Gaza. Both warned that supplies in the enclave were running out.",
      "'Scraping the barrel'",
      "Humanitarian groups describe a spiraling crisis on the ground, with bakeries shuttered for weeks because of a lack of wheat, food parcels for families running out, supplies of hot meals dwindling and medical supplies drying up.",
      "\"In terms of humanitarian supplies ... I mean, to say dwindling would be putting it nicely,\" \u00a0Liz Allcock, head of humanitarian protection of Medical Aid for Palestinians, a United Kingdom-based humanitarian organization, told NBC News on Tuesday.",
      "\u201cWe\u2019re really scraping the barrel in terms of being able to provide anything of substance,\" Allcock, said, speaking from Gaza.",
      "Abeer Etefa, a spokesperson for the World Food Programme, described the situation in Gaza as \"dire and worsening,\" with all WFP-supported bakeries across the territory closing after wheat flour ran out March 31. By early April, she said, the WFP had also exhausted its stocks of food parcels for distribution.",
      "\"Remaining stocks of hot meals commodities are being dispatched to the kitchens of partners providing hot meals,\" she said, adding: \"We have around 1,000 tons or less left for these hot meals kitchens.\"",
      "The WFP and its partners have 85,000 tons of food waiting to enter the enclave, she said.",
      "The\u00a0Global Nutrition Cluster, a coalition of humanitarian groups, has warned that in March alone, 3,696 children were newly admitted for care for acute malnutrition alone, out of 91,769 children screened \u2014 a marked increase from February, when 2,027 children were admitted from a total of 83,823 screened, OCHA said in a report Tuesday.",
      "Meanwhile, the United Nations has sounded the alarm that medical supplies in the enclave are running low, while casualties continue to fill hospitals.",
      "Etefa added that Israeli military activity across the enclave was affecting humanitarian groups' ability to deliver aid, with the decision to block the flow of aid coming just more than two weeks before Israel shattered its ceasefire with Hamas last month, bringing two months of relative calm in the Gaza Strip to an end.",
      "Israeli policy on aid",
      "In a statement Wednesday, Israeli Defense Minister Israel Katz said his country\u2019s policy in Gaza was \u201cclear and unequivocal,\u201d including the policy to stop humanitarian aid, a move he said \u201cundermines Hamas' control over the population, and creating an infrastructure for distribution through civilian companies later.\"",
      "Meanwhile, the Israeli Foreign Ministry has maintained that there is \"no shortage of aid,\" pointing to the fact that more than 25,000 aid trucks entered the territory during Israel\u2019s ceasefire with Hamas.",
      "Hamas was withholding supplies from civilians \"in order to create an image of shortage,\" Foreign Ministry spokesman Oren Marmorstein told NBC News on Wednesday without providing evidence.",
      "OCHA spokesman Jens Laerke said the U.N. body's team on the ground described \"no evidence of diversion of aid.\" Etefa said the WFP also had not seen any evidence, adding that the organization did not experience any looting during the ceasefire.",
      "Hamas did not immediately respond to a request for comment on the accusation. But Thursday, the militant group, which has faced protests calling for its ouster and an end to the war, accused Israel of committing a war crime by \"declaring the use of starvation as a weapon.\"",
      "Under international humanitarian law, parties of a conflict cannot use starvation of a civilian population as a method of warfare or deprive civilians of essential supplies as a legitimate means to subdue an enemy.",
      "Marmorstein previously denied that Israel is violating international humanitarian law with its blockade in a post on X, saying war parties are not obliged to allow aid in if  it is \"likely to assist the military or economic efforts of the enemy.\"",
      "The war in Gaza began after Hamas' Oct. 7, 2023, terrorist attack, which killed 1,200 and saw around 250 kidnapped, according to Israeli counts. Israel's military offensive in the enclave since then has killed more than 51,000 people, including thousands of children, according to the Palestinian Health Ministry in Gaza, which has been run by Hamas since 2007.",
      "By the numbers",
      "Data published by COGAT, the Israeli military's liaison with the Palestinians, shows that 25,200 aid trucks entered Gaza during the ceasefire, carrying more than 447,500 tons of aid into the enclave.",
      "Before the war began, around 500 trucks carrying food and other supplies were entering Gaza each day, according to the British Red Cross. This suggests that by prewar standards, the 25,200 trucks that entered during the ceasefire, according to COGAT's data, would likely be sufficient for around 1\u00bd months, a point reached this week.",
      "COGAT's database shows \u201cno data\u201d for aid entering the enclave between March 2 and April 16.",
      "Presented with the above data and asked to comment on the current aid situation on the ground, a spokesperson for COGAT told NBC News they could only confirm that more than 25,000 aid trucks had entered Gaza during the ceasefire. The spokesperson referred other questions related to the flow of aid to Israel's political leadership.",
      "In a report released this month, the WFP warned that humanitarian aid is the \u201cprimary food source\u201d for 80% of households across Gaza.",
      "Meanwhile, it said Israel\u2019s closure of crossings into the territory had \u201cexacerbated the fragility of the Gaza market,\u201d leading prices to soar between 150% and 700% compared with prewar levels, and by 29% to as much as 1,400% above prices during the ceasefire.",
      "As officials debate the reality of the situation on the ground, families across the enclave tell NBC News that they are struggling to survive.",
      "\u201cWe\u2019ve been deprived of everything \u2014 food, water, school \u2014 even clothes,\u201d 12-year-old Hasan Abu Jazar told NBC News\u2019 crew on Monday after waiting in line in Al-Mawasi to gather water at an increasingly rare distribution point. \"I'm tired.\""

    "summary": "Wesley Stanovsek was a dream hire for the IRS in 2024.",
    "story": [
      "Wesley Stanovsek was a dream hire for the IRS in 2024.",
      "With $80 billion in new funding from Congress, the IRS went shopping for young, tech savvy accountants and engineers who could deconstruct the complex returns of the wealthy and private companies. Stanovsek, based in Columbus, Ohio, specialized in S-corps, trusts and partnerships before getting hired by the IRS\u2019s High Wealth division.",
      "In February he was fired, along with other IRS agents who were considered \u201cprobationary\u201d since they had been there less than a year. Stanovsek was working on three \u201centerprise\u201d cases at the time \u2014 two involving partnerships and one involving a wealthy sports team owner, totaling millions of dollars of potential additional taxes.",
      "When he left, the cases were dropped due to lack of staff.",
      "\u201cThey\u2019ll most likely be closed with no change,\u201d said Stanovsek.",
      "With the IRS expected to lose about a third of its staff after firings and buyouts, wealthy taxpayers and attorneys are struggling to navigate the new regime. The upside for high earners is clear: Fewer agents means fewer audits and reviews.",
      "Under the Biden administration, the IRS made a concerted effort to target the wealthy, aiming to double audit rates for those making more than $10 million a year and launching a campaign to\u00a0investigate private-jet owners.\u00a0Now, especially with the potential dismantling of the Department of Justice Tax Division, the tax enforcement ranks are rapidly dwindling.",
      "\u201cThe agency is like a zombie right now,\u201d said Kathleen Pakenham, partner at Vinson & Elkins, who handles corporate and high-net-worth tax cases. \u201cThere is no brain in charge of what\u2019s happening on the ground.\u201d",
      "Attorneys say many of their audits have gone dark. With the statute of limitations on an assessment typically limited to three years after the taxes are filed, many are expected to expire without attention.",
      "Some wealthy taxpayers are asking their attorneys and accountants whether they even need to bother filing returns. The answer: an emphatic yes.",
      "Since the IRS has historical data on every taxpayer who has ever filed, a missing filing in one year would immediately raise an audit flag by the IRS\u2019s automated system.",
      "More likely than an all-out boycott, say attorneys, is a new era in which taxpayers and their accountants push the envelope with aggressive tax-planning techniques that may escape the review of an understaffed agency. Pakenham said IRS budget cuts in 1999 and 2000 led to wave of esoteric tax structures that more than a decade later proved to be illegal.",
      "\u201cThis is exactly the kind of environment in which tax shelters are devised and sold and more widely implemented,\u201d she said.",
      "A Yale Budget Lab study found that if the IRS staff cuts endure for the next 10 years, tax revenue will fall at least $160 billion over the next decade. Other reports estimate the lost revenue at over $500 billion this year alone. Former IRS agents and tax attorneys say the specific nature of the recent cuts will have an outsized impact on collections from the wealthy \u2014 and therefore a larger impact on overall revenue collecton.",
      "Jack McCumber was a real estate and business appraiser with an information systems background before getting hired by the IRS for its Large Business and International unit, which audits high-net-worth individuals and companies with more than $10 million in assets. Before he was fired, he was working on cases totaling more than $150 million in taxes under question. Some related to syndicated conservation easements, which the IRS included on its 2024 list of \u201cDirty Dozen\u201d tax schemes.",
      "McCumber said the majority of his LB&I team was new hires at the agency, who were swiftly fired. The group had one of the highest returns-on-investment at the IRS: Every 33 cents the group spent on enforcement resulted in $100 of added revenue, he said.",
      "I don\u2019t think there will be enough people to take over all those projects,\u201d he said.",
      "At the same time IRS audits and enforcement fall, accountants and tax lawyers say it\u2019s likely the agency will have less capacity to provide decisions or paperwork that can solve a tax problem.",
      "Robert Romashko, a partner at Husch Blackwell, said he has one audit case open in which the IRS claims the taxpayer owes up to $8 million. He requested an appeal in December, but an appeals officer has yet to be assigned to the case.",
      "\u201cTypically that would have happened by now,\u201d he said. \u201cI attribute that to a lack of personnel.\u201d",
      "The taxpayer is left in limbo. If the case isn\u2019t resolved by the end of the year, the statute of limitations expires.",
      "Another of Romashko\u2019s clients is trying to sell a business that includes a property with a legacy tax lien. The client is trying to pay off the lien plus interest so he can sell the business but can\u2019t get anyone at the IRS to respond, which is holding up the sale.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s been a nightmare,\u201d Romashko said. \u201cIt should be easy.\u201d",
      "IRS personnel are also critical for helping with delayed filings. Many wealthy investors have overseas bank accounts or investments they\u2019re required to disclose but often take months to receive. Typically, an agent can help resolve the delay without a penalty. But an IRS with fewer people allows its automated systems to take over and possibly impose a tax lien on a client\u2019s assets, Romashko said.",
      "\u201cThere are areas where we need the service, otherwise things disappear into a black hole,\u201d he said.",
      "Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent, who oversees the IRS,\u00a0told CNBC in March\u00a0that cost-cutting at the agency won\u2019t impact collections. In fact, he said AI and other new technologies will allow the agency to be more efficient and even do a better job at collections and service.",
      "\u201cI have three priorities with the IRS,\u201d Bessent said at the time. \u201cCollections,\u00a0privacy and customer service \u2014 in that order. So, there\u2019s nothing, nothing I\u2019m gonna do to hurt the collections over time. We are in the midst of this great AI boom, and, you know, I think increasing headcount now would be just the wrong time as the private corporations are moving into AI. I can\u2019t think of a better application for AI than auditing tax returns.\u201d",
      "Attorneys say they\u2019ve already had several encounters with the IRS\u2019s AI agents, and the results are mixed. AI is highly effective at selecting the types of returns that might contain certain kinds of abuses or strategies.",
      "\u201cNormally for an auditor, it\u2019s like they open the closet door and start digging around and asking questions,\u201d Pakenham said. \u201cNow it\u2019s like they have X-ray vision. They already knew some of the things in the closet.\u201d",
      "Once the issues are discovered, however, attorneys said it takes a highly skilled auditor with years of experience to ask the right follow-up questions and make judgements.",
      "\u201cWith a human, you can reason and explain,\u201d Romashko said. \u201cIf AI comes to the wrong conclusion, it\u2019s much harder to shake it. You can\u2019t talk to a computer.\u201d",

      "American Express\u2019 affluent cardmembers are showing few signs of curbing their spending, and younger customers drove growth in first-quarter transaction volumes, Chief Financial Officer\u00a0Christophe Le Caillec\u00a0told CNBC.",
      "Billed business on AmEx cards rose 6% in the period, or 7% when adjusted for the impact of leap year, the company reported Thursday, which shows that the bump in spending\u00a0late last year\u00a0continued into 2025, according to Le Caillec.",
      "Those trends have continued into April, the CFO said, despite sharp declines in stocks this month amid concerns that President\u00a0Donald Trump\u2019s tariff policies will cause a recession.",
      "The dynamic, which helped AmEx top expectations for first-quarter profit, shows that the company\u2019s wealthier customer base may help to insulate it from concerns about tariffs and stubborn inflation. On the other end of the credit spectrum,\u00a0Synchrony Financial, which offers store cards for dozens of popular retailers, has\u00a0warned\u00a0of a spending slowdown.",
      "\u201cThere\u2019s a lot of stability and strength, despite the news and the environment,\u201d Le Caillec said.",
      "Growth at AmEx came from younger cardholders, with millennial and Gen Z members spending 14% more in the quarter. Gen X and Baby Boomer cardholders showed more caution, registering 5% and 1% increases, respectively.",
      "Le Caillec said it\u2019s difficult to discern whether cardmembers were pulling forward purchases because of the looming tariffs, creating an artificial boost to purchase volumes, as JPMorgan executives\u00a0said\u00a0last week. But some small businesses may be doing so to build inventory because of concerns about the duties increasing costs, he added.",
      "Airline slump",
      "One category in particular gave Le Caillec confidence that the spending trends may be durable.",
      "\u201cRestaurant spend is up 8%,\u201d the CFO said. \u201cThis is the ultimate discretionary expense, it\u2019s not something you can bring forward, and so it\u2019s really a good indicator of the strength of our cardmember base and the confidence they have.\u201d",
      "If there was a weak area besides the spending slowdown from older Americans, it was in airline transactions, according to the company\u2019s earnings\u00a0presentation. The category grew just 3%, or 4% when adjusted for leap year, after climbing 13% in the fourth quarter.",
      "But while airlines, retailers and other corporations have\u00a0pulled\u00a0their earnings guidance on tariff uncertainty, AmEx was holding firm.",
      "It maintained its guidance for revenue growth of 8% to 10% and earnings of $15 to $15.50 per share this year, Le Caillec said.",
      "In the company\u2019s presentation, though, it added a new caveat to its guidance: \u201cSubject to the Macroeconomic Environment.\u201d",

      "Following the success of the YouTube series \u201cPop the Balloon or Find Love,\u201d Netflix decided to collaborate with the digital show\u2019s creators \u2014married couple Arlette Amuli and Bolia Matundu \u201cB.M.\u201d \u2014 to launch its rendition of the dating experiment, with a few twists. When \u201cPop the Balloon Live\u201d premiered on April 10, Orji replaced Amuli as host and the contestants featured were reality television stars like \u201cThe Challenge\u201d vet Johnny Bananas and boxer Chase DeMoor from Season Two of \u201cToo Hot to Handle.\u201d",
      "Viewers instantly reacted to the celebrity-filled episode on social media, with many expressing their disappointment.",
      "One X user referred to the streamer\u2019s version as \u201cnot only inauthentic but corny.\u201d",
      "\u201cReally flabbergasted on how Netflix missed the mark. All they had to do was copy & paste,\u201d another tweeted.",
      "One fan even vowed to go back to watching the original series, writing on X, \u201cChileeeeeee let me go watch my regular Pop The Balloon on YouTube.\u201d",
      "Ahead of Episode Two, Orji speaks to TODAY.com about some potential changes in upcoming episodes and why fans should not expect it to be a carbon copy of the original digital series.",
      "\u201cI think some of the fans may think it\u2019s a replica of the show. But just by the nature of it being live, it\u2019s not going to be a replica,\u201d she says. \u201cIt\u2019s more of an adaptation, if you will, but still keeping some of the things that make the show, the show. Then, because it\u2019s Netflix, they can add to it in different ways.\u201d",
      "That doesn\u2019t mean they won\u2019t encounter some bumps along the way. She reveals that she, the producers and the streamer spoke following the premiere about how to improve \u201cPop the Balloon Live\u201d going forward.",
      "\u201cI think we\u2019re all kind of finding our footing, because it does take on a different shape when it\u2019s live. So we\u2019re all like, \u2018Alright, did that work?\u2019 What I love about the producers and network (is) we\u2019re all on the same page in terms of refining and just keeping the show what we intended it to be,\u201d she explains.",
      "When asked about some of the negative responses to the episode, Orji acknowledges that the premiere did not go as planned.",
      "\u201cListen, I was in the heat of it,\u201d she replies. \u201cI said, \u2018This is not what we rehearsed. This is not what we practiced. This is not the show.\u2019\u201d",
      "She continues, \u201cI, on stage, had to let a couple people know, like, \u2018Hey, babe, this is not what we\u2019re doing.\u2019 But, it\u2019s live. We can\u2019t reset. We can\u2019t stop. The train had left the station, and so I was like, as the conductor, I just got to get us to our final destination.\u201d",
      "Orji shares that there were conversations all week about how to make Episode Two better.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s continually getting refined and renewed,\u201d she assures. \u201cSo just keep watching.\u201d",
      "What did some of those conversations address? Well, Orji wants to make sure the show reflects some of the reasons she agreed to be the host: love and joy.",
      "She says, \u201cI love, love. I had conversations with the producers. I had a conversation with the network. I was like, \u2018What\u2019s the tone? Are we really going for love? Because that\u2019s why I would sign on. They were like, \u2018Yes, we want people to find their matches, if possible. But we also know that it\u2019s live. So we also want someone that can carry that aspect of the show, as well.\u2019\u201d",
      "Given her background as a comedian, she knew she was up for the task, but that it would still be a challenge. She has been working with the creative team and Netflix to ensure the tone of future episodes focuses on kindness and joy.",
      "\u201cThey all agree that\u2019s the tone of the show that they want. Obviously we cannot control what people say or do, but what I can do is make the pivots in real time,\u201d she explains.",
      "The \u201cInsecure\u201d star compliments Amuli and B.M., who are executive producers of the Netflix version. The two continue to upload new YouTube episodes every week of their flagship series as their Netflix show also continues to air. Orji says the couple have been \u201csupportive\u201d of her leading the live show.",
      "As the host, the actor plans to use her comedic skills to lighten the mood in uncomfortable or unexpected moments and guide the cast in her own way.",
      "\u201cI think that\u2019s what\u2019s different from the YouTube show,\u201d Orji notes. \u201cI think even some of the comments were like, \u2018She\u2019s funny.\u2019 I\u2019m like, yeah, I\u2019m a comedian! I\u2019m going to be me. All I can be is myself, right? So if you want me to be a replica of someone else, all I can be is Yvonne Orji.\u201d",
      "Although she is not an executive producer on the series, the \u201cInsecure\u201d alum says she has talked to the producers about being involved with casting the contestants. Orji says she feels she'd be able to anticipate possible matches if she knew more about the cast ahead of time, though she says she'd stay away from trying to influence their decision. She adds that it was challenging seeing some contestants dismiss others too quickly when they could be a good fit.",
      "\u201cMy tagline for the show is, \u2018We listen, we don\u2019t judge, but I do have follow up questions,\u2019\u201d she says, laughing.",
      "Fans can tune in to see what changes are implemented and how Orji holds up to the next batch of contestants when new episodes of \"Pop the Balloon Live\" stream Thursdays at 8 p.m. ET / 5 p.m. PT."

      "\u201cI thought it was a great moment in a small amount of real estate,\u201d Meloni says of the mother-son scene, \u201cbecause there are no more dire circumstances than will or will not your son be buried before you. Right? There\u2019s no greater stakes \u2014 that in that moment she\u2019s able to share a truth with herself.\u201d",

I think the younger generations don\u2019t \u2014 I know don\u2019t have the lived experience I do.",

    "summary": "Christopher Meloni reveals in a TODAY.com interview the intention of Elliot Stabler's coma dreams about Olivia Benson (Mariska Hargitay) on \"Law & Order: Organized Crime.\"",
    "story": [
      "Warning: This post contains spoilers for Season Five of \u201cLaw & Order: Organized Crime.\u201d",
      "\u201cLaw & Order: Organized Crime\u201d star Chris Meloni took Season Five into his own hands \u2014 literally.",
      "The actor, who also serves as an executive producer on the series, wrote the second episode of the new season, \u201cDante\u2019s Inferno,\u201d which premiered Thursday, April 17, on Peacock.",
      "(Peacock is part of our parent company, NBCUniversal.)",
      "One of the most unique elements of the hour is the series of dreams his character, Detective Elliot Stabler, has while in a coma. In Episode One, \u201cLost Highway,\u201d Stabler gets hit by a semitruck while in the driver\u2019s seat of his truck, which also has a little girl, Bunny, he rescued hiding out in the back seat.",
      "Stabler is undercover at the time of the accident while his team at the Organized Crime Control Bureau investigates a biker gang using trucking operations to transport weapons and drugs. There\u2019s also another layer to the madness, as some of the men involved appear to be sex trafficking young girls, which is why Stabler gets concerned when Bunny goes missing before he saves her.",
      "As the first episode rolls into the second, Stabler is wheeled into the hospital and experiences his first of many dream sequences. He\u2019s calling from his bed for a nurse in a scene that\u2019s clearly set decades earlier, based on visuals including the uniform on a police officer who walks by (a reference to Stabler\u2019s late father, maybe?). Then Stabler sees a bunny in the hallway before he hears a voice calling his name. The voice belongs to Capt. Olivia Benson (Mariska Hargitay), his former longtime partner at the Special Victims Unit. He calls for her, and her voice shouts back, \u201cI\u2019m here! I\u2019m here!\u201d Back in the real world, Benson actually is there, at Stabler\u2019s bedside while he\u2019s in a coma.",
      "\u201cI wrote it from, obviously, Elliot\u2019s perspective and what are the imageries that are rattling around in his noodle,\u201d Meloni tells TODAY.com of his thought process for crafting the script for the episode, \u201cand how much of it is the trauma?\u201d",
      "A second dream shows the girl he saved earlier, Bunny, telling him to find a missing woman, nicknamed \u201cSad Eyes.\u201d A later one again shows the old-school cop walking the halls and Bunny dead under a sheet on a table in the hospital (Benson later informs Stabler Bunny did die after the accident). In Stabler\u2019s final dream, he\u2019s in his hospital bed with Benson beside him staring at him intently. He asks her what\u2019s wrong, and she gets up and walks out of his room without answering.",
      "\u201cLiv, don\u2019t leave!\u201d Stabler shouts after her.",
      "\u201cMy intention was for each person to have their own intention,\u201d Meloni says when asked about the purpose of including Stabler\u2019s dreams and what they mean.",
      "\u201cI try not to spoon-feed, because I think in the end that\u2019s not as nourishing or satisfying for the person. I like it,\u201d Meloni adds. \u201cI like people to lean forward and go, \u2018OK, what the heck was that? And why?\u2019 And have, just, differing opinions about it.\u201d",
      "When pressed about if the throwback hospital and police uniform imagery is supposed to symbolize Stabler\u2019s father, Joe Sr. \u2014 who was also a cop and eventually took his own life \u2014 and the possible guilt associated with that relationship, Meloni jokes, \u201cGive me the answer! You can\u2019t handle the truth.\u201d",
      "He remains similarly vague about if Stabler\u2019s guilt increases with each dream, like how in Dante Alighieri\u2019s \u201cInferno\u201d the circles intensify the further he proceeds on his journey through hell. Stabler\u2019s final dream is about Benson, so could that mean he holds the most guilt about that relationship? He left her without any explanation or contact after over 12 years as partners at the Special Victims Unit before returning to her life after a 10-year absence.",
      "Meloni laughs and says, \u201cThese are all really good interpretations of it all. I feel as though if I were to confirm any of these \u2014 kind of like, you know, I\u2019m the spoiler-alert guy.\u201d",
      "\u201cI like it when other people interpret it and actually come back to me and give me theirs,\u201d Meloni says, adding he isn\u2019t intentionally trying to be coy.",
      "\u201cI can\u2019t even tell you if there was a conscious message or mission,\u201d he explains. \u201cI wrote what felt right to me. \u2026 There was not a conscious \u2014 I didn\u2019t go like this: \u2018Ah, this is the road.\u2019 I just went, \u2018Oh, that feels good. That feels right.\u2019 You know, it\u2019s a feeling.\u201d",
      "Another reason Meloni wanted to write this episode was because Hargitay would be guest starring.",
      "\u201cI intentionally wrote this because when she and I are together, I inevitably rewrite it, and not out of \u2014 you know, just simply because I don\u2019t think there\u2019s anyone alive that knows the relationship as intimately and as well as I do. Or she does,\u201d he says of his and Hargitay\u2019s characters, which have a history that spans over 25 years.",
      "\u201cI feel as though, the episode I wrote, it\u2019s Olivia that\u2019s able \u2014 she\u2019s the icebreaker that can almost break through his, where (Stabler\u2019s) at in his coma,\u201d Meloni says. \u201cIt\u2019s her voice that he hears.\u201d"

      "Cynthia is inspired by the real-life Cynthia Mans, who did meet the real Natalia Grace while she was living alone in Tippecanoe County, Indiana, according to a 2021 document from the Court of Appeals in Indiana obtained by TODAY.com.",
      "Grace, a Ukrainian orphan with dwarfism, had been adopted by the Barnetts in 2010, before they accused her of being a grown woman pretending to be an adult. The Barnetts had Grace tested and were able to legally change her birth certificate to show that she was born in 1989, the document from the Court of Appeals in Indiana stated.",
      "The couple then moved her into her own apartment, helping her get disability funding before they moved to Canada with their three biological children.",

      "In real life, according to a document from the Court of Appeals of Indiana viewed by TODAY.com, the Manses filed a court petition in 2016 to seek guardianship of Grace. They also testified against Michael Barnett during his 2022 trial, where he and his wife were accused of multiple charges including neglect of a dependent.

      "Michael Urie has come a long way since his big break on \"Ugly Betty\" in 2006.",
      "The role of Marc St. James, assistant to the fearsome creative director Wilhelmina Slater in \"Ugly Betty,\" paved the way for a long list of credentials \u2014 from cameos in hit series like \"Hot in Cleveland\" and \"Modern Family\" to reoccurring roles in \"Younger\" and \"Shrinking.\"",
      "Urie tells TODAY.com that he watched himself while he was on \"Ugly Betty\" to further understand his strengths and weaknesses as a performer.",
      "\"I'd never been on TV before, I was so like ... watch it over and over again, just to learn from myself and be like, 'I hated that, I love that,'\" he explains.",
      "Now, nearly two decades after his start on the TV series, he co-hosts an \u201cUgly Betty\u201d rewatch podcast, appropriately called \u201cStill Ugly,\" and says he sees his younger self in a different light.",
      "\u201cI was so fearless back then. It\u2019s pretty cool to be like, \u2018Remember, oh yeah, I used to just try anything.\u2019 I think I need to do that again and remind myself of what that\u2019s like,\u201d he says.",
      "Looking at his long list of accolades that includes TV actor, Broadway lead, awards show host and now, podcast host, it\u2019s apparent that he never really stopped.",
      "Urie made his Broadway debut in 2012 as Bud Frump in \u201cHow to Succeed in Business Without Really Trying,\" and has since appeared in many a playbill for shows like \"Chicken & Biscuits,\" \"Spamalot,\" and most recently, \"Once Upon a Mattress\" with his former \"Younger\" co-star, Sutton Foster.",
      "Additionally, Urie hosted the 2025 GLAAD Media Awards in March, which are now available to stream on Hulu. But he hasn't just given out awards: In February, at the 2025 Critics Choice Awards, Urie was crowned best supporting actor in a comedy series for his role in \"Shrinking.\"",

      "Urie's revelation about his 'Shrinking' character \u2014 and what is therapist thinks of the show",
      "In the award-winning show \"Shrinking,\" Urie plays Brian, the best friend of the series' protagonist, Jimmy (Jason Segal).",
      "The second season sees Brian go through a transformative experience when, instead of being the one who is helped, he plays a crucial role in mending Jimmy's family's relationship with Louis (Brett Goldstein), the man who killed Jimmy's wife in a drunk driving incident.",
      "\"On 'Shrinking,' every time I get a scene, I think, 'OK, who's on the couch, who is in the chair? Who's the shrink, who's the patient?'\" Urie describes. \"Sometimes I'm the shrink, sometimes I'm the patient ... and Brian got the opportunity to be a shrink for Louis.\"",
      "Urie said it was a \"huge thing\" for Brian to \"help someone\" because of his narcissistic ways \u2014 a part of his character that even he didn't realize until a scene in Season 2.",
      "\"There was part where Jimmy said to me, 'Are you really such a narcissist, making this about you?' My line was, 'Yes, that's what narcissism is, Jimmy. Having the courage to put yourself above everyone else.' He's like, 'That's not what narcissism is,' and that was the first time I was like, 'Oh, is Brian a narcissist?'\" Urie recalls.",
      "Other people in Urie's life has surfaced this revelation, too, including a therapist who praised his character for being a narcissist.",
      "\"This woman was like, 'I love your show and I love your character. I'm a therapist and I love your character. Such a narcissist.' I was like, 'This is the greatest compliment, that I'm accurately playing a narcissist.\"",
      "Turns out, Urie's own therapist loves his character, too.",
      "\"(My therapist) said, 'I watched the show, you were very good,'\" Urie recounts, but that her opinion of Jimmy was an entirely different story.",
      "\"And I was, well, OK, but what did she think of the show? And she said, I think (Jimmy) is unorthodox and unprofessional,\" he explains, saying that Jimmy's \"whole thing is that he breaks the rules\" as a therapist.",
      "Urie on 'Younger' turning 10 years old \u2014 and its potential reboot name",
      "As Urie continues to trek forward in filming the next chapter of \"Shrinking,\" he looks back on the decade-long legacy of \"Younger\" in light of its recent resurgence after it found a new home on Netflix.",
      "\"There's something about ('Younger'). It's also such an easy show to watch, it's basically people being good to each other or trying to be great for each other and it's pretty and, yes, all the characters are quite lovely, and it's sexy and romantic,\" he says.",
      "Urie is the first to admit that his \"Younger\" character, Redmond, a snarky publicist who often looks out for his own best interests, is \"so mean\" and is a \"real jerk,\" but that the cast and crew working on the show were anything but that.",
      "\"I've been on other shows where you come back ... and you kind of know what the real atmosphere of the show is like, based on the crew,\" he says. \"They're actually there every day. That 'Younger' crew was so happy, and over seven seasons, it didn't change.\"",
      "Urie and Foster have stayed close, and in 2024, they starred alongside one another in the Broadway revival of \"Once Upon a Mattress.\"",

      "Once the girls learned that they were related, they started sending postcards to one another until they met up for the first time in New York City.",
      "When asked how Rundgren felt about Liv learning the truth about their relationship, Liv Tyler said that he always knew that they weren\u2019t related to one another. Still, despite him knowing this, she said he probably still had a \u201chard\u201d time dealing with everything.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s probably still very hard and painful and I don\u2019t speak to him enough,\u201d she said. \u201cI love him and I have brothers from him and I had a whole family with them, but I was a kid, so it was really hard because he was mad at my mom, and then suddenly Steven was there, and we did a paternity test, and it was positive.\u201d",
      "Along with Liv and Mia Tyler, Steven Tyler is also a proud dad to two more kids: Chelsea Tyler, 36, and Taj Monroe Tallarico, 34, whom he shares with his ex-wife, Teresa Barrick."

      "\u201cIt did feel kind of like an achievement for not just my character, but also for myself,\u201d Scanavino tells TODAY.com, \u201cand, you know, kind of growing up on original \u2018Law & Order.\u2019 I\u2019d been in it as a guest star, but to be in it as this character, it felt great.\u201d",
      "The actor portrays ADA Dominick \u201cSonny\u201d Carisi on \u201cLaw & Order: Special Victims Unit\u201d and previously had guest roles as other characters on both \u201cLaw & Order\u201d and \u201cSVU\u201d before landing full time as Carisi, who started out as a cop before transitioning to the legal side.",

      "\u201cBut I\u2019m certainly glad that I am \u2026 I\u2019m very grateful to have been on this show, which has changed my life completely,\u201d he says.",
      "He explains his character becoming a lawyer \u201ccoincided\u201d with the return of Warren Leight as \u201cSVU\u201d showrunner. Leight led the show from Seasons 13-17 and later returned for Seasons 21-23.",
      "\u201cWarren Leight created my character, and one of the character details that he put in, and it\u2019s in the first episode, was that my character was going to night school at Fordham Law \u2014 that he had aspirations to be a lawyer,\u201d Scanavino says about Carisi, who\u2019s also this \u201cblue-collar kid from Staten Island\u201d with \u201cambition\u201d to pursue the rules of law.",
      "Scanavino says when Leight came back for Season 21, the showrunner approached him with the idea of Detective Carisi\u2019s career change.",
      "\u201cHonestly, the parts I had always loved about \u2018Law & Order\u2019 the most, when I would watch it, were the trial scenes,\u201d he says, explaining it has been \u201cquite a journey\u201d for Carisi.",
      "\u201cWhen I became the ADA, it was starting from scratch,\u201d he says. \u201cUsually, you would see the attorneys or the ADAs are more polished. They\u2019re already at the peak of their career, and I really had to have some runway to get there.\u201d",
      "Five seasons later, Carisi (and Scanavino) is getting his chance to shine with the \u201cLaw & Order\u201d legal powerhouses, which include ADA Samantha Maroun (Odelya Halevi) and EADA Nolan Price (Hugh Dancy), and their boss, DA Nicholas Baxter (Tony Goldwyn).",

      "Scanavino explains the case comes from the pasts of both Maura Tierney\u2019s and Mariska Hargitay\u2019s characters. Tierney joined the mothership this season as Lt. Jessica Brady, and Hargitay has played Olivia Benson, currently captain of the Special Victims Unit, on \u201cSVU\u201d since the show debuted in 1999.",
      "\u201cThey have personal stakes in the crime,\u201d Scanavino explains, \u201cand then it moves forward through the legal system.\u201d",
      "In the two-part crossover, \u201cPlay with Fire,\u201d Benson's team responds to the scene of a brutal murder after she receives a mysterious phone call. The squad teams up with Brady's crew to investigate a pattern of rape and murder targeting marginalized women.",
      "An April 10 promo offered more insight, implying the victim is Maria Recinos, a police officer who joined the department last year. Benson has a history with Maria and saved her as a young girl in the Season Seven episode \"911,\" which also won Hargitay an Emmy Award.",
      "Carisi works with Price to see if they\u2019re able to prosecute the case and if they have enough evidence even though, Scanavino says, \u201cit becomes somewhat obvious as to who\u2019s responsible\u201d for the crime \u201cthrough several twists and turns.\u201d",

      "\u201cI almost felt like I was an animal that had been raised with a different species of animal, and then I came home to the den for the first time,\u201d he says while laughing, \u201cbecause they had this really nice legal set, and the district attorney\u2019s offices, and there were all these lawyer extras zooming around. We don\u2019t really have that on our show. So I felt, \u2018Oh my goodness, look at this whole other world! I\u2019m a lawyer, and so are these people.\u2019\u201d",
      "He adds it was \u201cawesome\u201d working with Dancy and Goldwyn and visiting their \u201cbeautiful\u201d set.",
      "Scanavino says his favorite part of the experience happens when the team is not filming and \u201cjust busting chops and joking around in between takes.\u201d",
      "\u201cEveryone there is very funny. Hugh is very funny, Tony is very funny, Maura is very funny,\u201d he says before laughing. \u201cYou put Mariska into it, who\u2019s hilarious, and everyone is really kind of like a bunch of unruly third graders. And the directors are like, \u2018Everyone! Please focus.\u2019 So those are the best parts.\u201d",
      "As for how his character gels with Dancy\u2019s, Scanavino says while they have different styles, they \u201cget along very well.\u201d",
      "\u201cI get a sense in the crossover Carisi is kind of more headstrong in terms of prosecuting, and Price is more kind of, \u2018OK, let's slow down. Let\u2019s make sure we can go in with the amount of evidence that we need.\u2019\u201d",
      "\u201cThere\u2019s not a lot of animosity,\u201d he adds. \u201cIt seems a mutual respect.\u201d",
      "Someone else Carisi has mutual respect for is his wife, Amanda Rollins (Kelli Giddish). Giddish has made a few guest appearances so far in Season 26.",
      "\u201cI have a feeling that you will see Rollins again,\u201d Scanavino says, adding, \u201cWhat a gift that is considering that Kelli Giddish is such an amazing actress and person.\u201d",
      "Until then, Scanavino is excited for fans to see what goes down this week.",
      "\u201cI think if you\u2019re a fan of either show, you\u2019re going to really love this,\u201d he says about the crossover. \u201cAnd if you love both shows, this is going to be a real mind-blowing event.\u201d",

      "Right now, there is little love lost between these transatlantic trading partners.",
      "The Italian leader is part of a relatively new crop of hard-right European leaders who have developed ties with the Trump administration. Sharing the president's predilection for hard-line anti-immigration policies, Meloni has gained a reputation as something of a Trump whisperer \u2014 the president has called her \u201ca real live wire\u201d and a \u201cfantastic woman.\u201d",
      "Meloni is just one of dozens of leaders scrambling to react to Trump\u2019s sweeping global tariffs. The E.U. faced a 20% tax on all goods sold into the United States, before an international market meltdown saw Trump pause these levies and instead impose a 10% rate across the board.",
      "Trump has claimed countries have been lining up and \u201ckissing my ass\u201d to try to strike deals with his administration.",
      "But Meloni\u2019s Italy is part of the European Union and therefore cannot strike trade deals on its own. It must act in unison with the 27-member trading bloc, which Trump has described as a competitor formed to \u201cscrew\u201d over Washington. He has made no secret of his enmity for the E.U. \u2014 as with many other international, multilateral organizations \u2014 and would prefer to deal one on one.",
      "In this sense, Meloni arrives in Washington as an unofficial ambassador for the E.U., whose real president, Ursula von der Leyen, has not once spoken with Trump since he was sworn in.",
      "The E.U. leader aimed a thinly veiled criticism Wednesday at the \u201cbros\u201d running the White House, telling the German newspaper Die Zeit that Trump\u2019s trade war meant that \u201cthe West as we knew it no longer exists.\u201d",
      "Von der Leyen and Meloni had been in regular contact ahead of the trip, a spokesperson for the European Commission told Reuters. And even those centrist European figures who may disagree with Meloni on her hard-line domestic agenda are hoping that she will act as a bridge to Washington.",
      "\u201cEverybody hopes that, but nobody knows what she\u2019s going to be able to achieve,\u201d said Charles Grant, founding director of the Center for European Reform think tank.",
      "Despite her rapport with Trump, Meloni\u2019s Italy is to some extent also \u201cin the doghouse\u201d with Trump's team, Grant said, because of its low defense spending and trade deficit with Washington \u2014 two of Trump\u2019s biggest bugbears.",
      "Italy spends 1.49% of its gross domestic product on its military, lower than NATO\u2019s recommended 2% and only ahead of Canada, Belgium, Luxemburg, Slovenia and Spain, according to the alliance\u2019s latest figures. At the same time, it has a $45 billion trade deficit with the U.S., selling far more goods \u2014 mainly manufacturing and medical products, cars and wine \u2014 than it buys from the U.S.",
      "This also makes Rome particularly vulnerable to Trump\u2019s tariffs, with American trade making up around 10% of its total exports.",
      "\u201cWhether her personal charm can overcome these problems,\u201d Grant said, \u201cremains to be seen \u2014 but I\u2019m sure she will give it a go.\u201d",
      "Meloni is not the first leader headed to the Oval Office with hopes of sanctuary from Trump's trade storm. Nor will she likely be the last.",
      "On Wednesday, Trump inserted himself directly into negotiations between the Japanese delegation visiting Washington and Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent.",
      "Before stepping back from the brink, Trump initially slapped a 24% tax on all Japanese goods coming into the U.S. Nevertheless, the president's own glowing view of the talks \u2014 championing \"Big Progress!\" on Truth Social afterward \u2014 was echoed by Japan's chief negotiator, Ryosei Akazawa.",
      "\"One of the messages he was sending was that these negotiations with Japan are a top priority,\" Akazawa told reporters. \"What really impressed me was that he showed that if it\u2019s a task that\u2019s really important to you, is to show leadership and be directly involved.\""

      "Children crowding around a charity kitchen holding empty pots and pans clamoring for food to take to their families. Hours spent in search of clean water and scouring piles of garbage looking for trash to burn for a fire to cook or keep warm.",
      "These scenes, which NBC News\u2019 crew in the Gaza Strip captured over the past week, come as humanitarian agencies sound the alarm over a dire and worsening situation in in the Palestinian enclave as Israel enforces a blockade on food, water, fuel, medical supplies and other aid and goods.",
      "Israeli officials maintain there is \"no shortage\" of aid in Gaza and accuse Hamas of withholding supplies. Israel says its blockade is crucial to its goal of weakening the militant group's control over the population.",
      "The United Nations Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs (OCHA) and the World Food Programme (WFP) told NBC News they had seen \"no evidence\" of a diversion of aid in Gaza. Both warned that supplies in the enclave were running out.",
      "'Scraping the barrel'",
      "Humanitarian groups describe a spiraling crisis on the ground, with bakeries shuttered for weeks because of a lack of wheat, food parcels for families running out, supplies of hot meals dwindling and medical supplies drying up.",
      "\"In terms of humanitarian supplies ... I mean, to say dwindling would be putting it nicely,\" \u00a0Liz Allcock, head of humanitarian protection of Medical Aid for Palestinians, a United Kingdom-based humanitarian organization, told NBC News on Tuesday.",
      "\u201cWe\u2019re really scraping the barrel in terms of being able to provide anything of substance,\" Allcock, said, speaking from Gaza.",
      "Abeer Etefa, a spokesperson for the World Food Programme, described the situation in Gaza as \"dire and worsening,\" with all WFP-supported bakeries across the territory closing after wheat flour ran out March 31. By early April, she said, the WFP had also exhausted its stocks of food parcels for distribution.",
      "\"Remaining stocks of hot meals commodities are being dispatched to the kitchens of partners providing hot meals,\" she said, adding: \"We have around 1,000 tons or less left for these hot meals kitchens.\"",
      "The WFP and its partners have 85,000 tons of food waiting to enter the enclave, she said.",
      "The\u00a0Global Nutrition Cluster, a coalition of humanitarian groups, has warned that in March alone, 3,696 children were newly admitted for care for acute malnutrition alone, out of 91,769 children screened \u2014 a marked increase from February, when 2,027 children were admitted from a total of 83,823 screened, OCHA said in a report Tuesday.",
      "Meanwhile, the United Nations has sounded the alarm that medical supplies in the enclave are running low, while casualties continue to fill hospitals.",
      "Etefa added that Israeli military activity across the enclave was affecting humanitarian groups' ability to deliver aid, with the decision to block the flow of aid coming just more than two weeks before Israel shattered its ceasefire with Hamas last month, bringing two months of relative calm in the Gaza Strip to an end.",
      "Israeli policy on aid",
      "In a statement Wednesday, Israeli Defense Minister Israel Katz said his country\u2019s policy in Gaza was \u201cclear and unequivocal,\u201d including the policy to stop humanitarian aid, a move he said \u201cundermines Hamas' control over the population, and creating an infrastructure for distribution through civilian companies later.\"",
      "Meanwhile, the Israeli Foreign Ministry has maintained that there is \"no shortage of aid,\" pointing to the fact that more than 25,000 aid trucks entered the territory during Israel\u2019s ceasefire with Hamas.",
      "Hamas was withholding supplies from civilians \"in order to create an image of shortage,\" Foreign Ministry spokesman Oren Marmorstein told NBC News on Wednesday without providing evidence.",
      "OCHA spokesman Jens Laerke said the U.N. body's team on the ground described \"no evidence of diversion of aid.\" Etefa said the WFP also had not seen any evidence, adding that the organization did not experience any looting during the ceasefire.",
      "Hamas did not immediately respond to a request for comment on the accusation. But Thursday, the militant group, which has faced protests calling for its ouster and an end to the war, accused Israel of committing a war crime by \"declaring the use of starvation as a weapon.\"",
      "Under international humanitarian law, parties of a conflict cannot use starvation of a civilian population as a method of warfare or deprive civilians of essential supplies as a legitimate means to subdue an enemy.",
      "Marmorstein previously denied that Israel is violating international humanitarian law with its blockade in a post on X, saying war parties are not obliged to allow aid in if  it is \"likely to assist the military or economic efforts of the enemy.\"",
      "The war in Gaza began after Hamas' Oct. 7, 2023, terrorist attack, which killed 1,200 and saw around 250 kidnapped, according to Israeli counts. Israel's military offensive in the enclave since then has killed more than 51,000 people, including thousands of children, according to the Palestinian Health Ministry in Gaza, which has been run by Hamas since 2007.",
      "By the numbers",
      "Data published by COGAT, the Israeli military's liaison with the Palestinians, shows that 25,200 aid trucks entered Gaza during the ceasefire, carrying more than 447,500 tons of aid into the enclave.",
      "Before the war began, around 500 trucks carrying food and other supplies were entering Gaza each day, according to the British Red Cross. This suggests that by prewar standards, the 25,200 trucks that entered during the ceasefire, according to COGAT's data, would likely be sufficient for around 1\u00bd months, a point reached this week.",
      "COGAT's database shows \u201cno data\u201d for aid entering the enclave between March 2 and April 16.",
      "Presented with the above data and asked to comment on the current aid situation on the ground, a spokesperson for COGAT told NBC News they could only confirm that more than 25,000 aid trucks had entered Gaza during the ceasefire. The spokesperson referred other questions related to the flow of aid to Israel's political leadership.",
      "In a report released this month, the WFP warned that humanitarian aid is the \u201cprimary food source\u201d for 80% of households across Gaza.",
      "Meanwhile, it said Israel\u2019s closure of crossings into the territory had \u201cexacerbated the fragility of the Gaza market,\u201d leading prices to soar between 150% and 700% compared with prewar levels, and by 29% to as much as 1,400% above prices during the ceasefire.",
      "As officials debate the reality of the situation on the ground, families across the enclave tell NBC News that they are struggling to survive.",
      "\u201cWe\u2019ve been deprived of everything \u2014 food, water, school \u2014 even clothes,\u201d 12-year-old Hasan Abu Jazar told NBC News\u2019 crew on Monday after waiting in line in Al-Mawasi to gather water at an increasingly rare distribution point. \"I'm tired.\""

      "The Israel Defense Forces would not confirm if Nassasra was in its custody when asked about his whereabouts by NBC News.",
      "The Israeli military has been widely criticized after it walked back its account of the incident March 23, which saw 15 Palestinian paramedics and emergency workers killed.",
      "The IDF\u00a0\u2014\u00a0having initially said that its soldiers opened fire as the vehicles approached its position \u201csuspiciously\u201d without headlights\u00a0or emergency signals, killing what it described as nine Hamas and Islamic Jihad militants\u00a0\u2014\u00a0later changed its account after contradicting video of the incident emerged.",
      "Recovered\u00a0from the phone of one of the paramedics killed, the footage which has been reviewed by NBC News shows an ambulance with its lights on and its emergency lights flashing.",
      "The vehicle was also marked with the Palestine Red Crescent Society\u2019s insignia. Lights on two other vehicles can also be seen flashing when soldiers opened fire on the convoy.",
      "The bodies of the killed workers were found buried in a mass grave in the southern Gaza Strip a week later.",
      "Autopsy reports for 14 of the 15 people killed revealed that they had died mainly from gunshots to the head or chest, according to The New York Times, which obtained the results and published the findings Wednesday.",
      "It did not obtain the autopsy result for one United Nations worker who was also killed.",
      "The reports showed that four had been shot in the head, while at least six were shot in their chests or backs, the newspaper reported, adding that 11 had gunshot wounds and had been shot multiple times.",
      "All 14 had been wearing either part of or their whole Red Crescent or Civil Defense uniforms at the time they were killed, the Times reported citing the reports about the autopsies. The autopsies were carried out between April 1 and April 5 by Ahmad Dhair, the forensic head of the Health Ministry in Gaza.",
      "Norwegian pathologist Arne Stray-Pedersen, who had been in Gaza earlier in March, subsequently reviewed photos of the autopsies and consulted with Dhair to write the summary report, the Times reported.",
      "NBC News has not been able to view the autopsy reports.",
      "The IDF did not comment on the reported autopsy findings but said in a statement to NBC News on Wednesday that the incident had been \u201ctransferred to the General Staff\u2019s Fact-Finding and Assessment Mechanism for investigation.\u201d",
      "Meanwhile, Cardon of the ICRC said the organization had not been granted access to Nassasra or any other Palestinian detainees since the Hamas-led terrorist attacks on Oct. 7, 2023 which saw 1,200 killed and around 250 people taken hostage, according to Israeli counts, marking a major escalation in a decadeslong conflict.",
      "More than 51,000 people have been killed in the Israeli military assault on the Gaza Strip since then, according health officials in the enclave, which has been run by Hamas since 2007.",
      "\u201cThe ICRC continues to call for access to all places of detention and reiterates publicly and privately that all detainees must always be treated humanely and with dignity,\u201d Cardon said."

      "According to a study from Barcelona\u2019s Universitat Pompeu Fabra, the number of Chinese students taking its translation and language science classes has risen 37% from five years ago, but China\u2019s formal educational resources for learning Spanish are far less developed than they are for learning English.",

That means starring out frowned-upon language can alter the meanings of lyrics and add an extra challenge to translators.",

      "The signs were found on K2-18b, an exoplanet planet orbiting a red dwarf star twice the size of Earth and 124 light-years away, according to a team of researchers led by Cambridge University. In the scale of the universe, the planet is a neighbor, sharing the Milky Way galaxy with Earth.",
      "They made their groundbreaking discovery after conducting a repeated analysis of observations made on K2-18b using NASA\u2019s James Webb Space Telescope, detecting the chemical fingerprints that on Earth are primarily produced by microbial life, such as  algae, seaweed or marine phytoplankton.",
      "The findings are \"the strongest evidence yet that life may exist on a planet outside our solar system,\" Cambridge University said in a press statement Thursday.",
      "But the team \u2014 which published its study in the Astrophysical Journal Letters on the same day \u2014 remains cautious about what exactly the new findings can reveal about life beyond the solar system.",
      "\u201cIt is in no one\u2019s interest to claim prematurely that we have detected life,\u201d Cambridge astrophysicist Nikku Madhusudhan, who led the study, said during a news conference Tuesday.",
      "But, he added, \u201cWe want to remain open and do more experiments and theoretical calculations\u201d that can strengthen evidence that the molecule they detected, known as dimethyl sulfide (DMS), is present on the exoplanet that was discovered in 2015 by NASA\u2019s Kepler mission.",
      "Madhusudhan and his colleagues are building on their research from 2023, in which they detected carbon-based molecules in the atmosphere of K2-18b using the James Webb Telescope's mid-infrared instrument.",
      "That finding suggested that an almost identical molecule to DMS, known as dimethyl disulfide (DMDS), could also be present on the exoplanet \u2014 the first hint that K2-18b may be a hycean world, meaning one with a warm ocean abundant with life under a hydrogen-rich atmosphere.",
      "\u201cThe only scenario that currently explains all the data obtained so far from JWST, including the past and present observations, is one where K2-18 b is a hycean world teeming with life,\u201d Madhusudhan said.",
      "At the same time, he noted, there was still a 0.3% chance that their observation was a statistical fluke. \u201cWe need to be open and continue exploring other scenarios,\u201d he added.",
      "K2-18b is part of the \u201csub-Neptune\u201d class of nearly 6,000 exoplanets that have been discovered beyond the solar system since the 1990s.",
      "Finding evidence of life in the cosmos was the \"holy grail\" of exoplanet science, Madhusudhan said.",
      "Jake Taylor, an astrophysics and supernumerary fellow at Oxford University, also expressed caution over the findings while adding that they were \u201ca good first step\u201d in the search for biosignature gases, which are found in a planet\u2019s atmosphere and suggest the presence of life.",
      "\u201cI do not believe this is the biosignature detection that will revolutionize astronomy,\u201d he said, adding that DMS and DMDS molecules could also be produced abiotically, for example, in comets.",
      "Taylor added that a re-analysis of the data from the MIRI instrument, which has proven to be difficult among the exoplanet community in the past, along with an independent verification from a different team of scientists, would \u201cconvince me that these signals are real.\u201d",
      "Despite the unknowns that can only be answered by repeated observations and more theoretical and experimental studies, Madhusudhan said in a video, finding signs of life elsewhere was \u201cone of the most profound moments for me personally as well as an astronomer.\u201d",
      "He added that even suggestions of \u201ca new chemical process that is not produced by life,\u201d could be a monumental breakthrough, because, \u201chowever you put it, we are seeing new chemical processes on a planet that could be habitable.\u201d",
      "\u201cThis is, in my view, a transformational moment for finding our place in the universe as a species,\u201d Madhusudhan said.",
      "CORRECTION: Due to an editing error, the article previously stated that K2-18b is 7 trillion miles away. It is 729 trillion miles away."

      "Macron also announced the creation of a joint French-Haitian historical commission to \u2018\u2019examine our shared past\u2019\u2019 and assess relations, but did not directly address longstanding Haitian demands for reparations.",
      "France \u201csubjected the people of Haiti to a heavy financial indemnity, ... This decision placed a price on the freedom of a young nation, which was thus confronted with the unjust force of history from its very inception,\u2019\u2019 Macron said in a statement.",
      "It comes on the 200th anniversary of the April 17, 1825 document issued by King Charles X of France, which recognized Haiti\u2019s independence after a slave revolt \u2014 but also imposed a 150 million gold francs debt as compensation for the loss of France\u2019s colony and enslaved labor force.",
      "Although the indemnity was later reduced to 90 million gold francs, the debt crippled the Caribbean nation, which continued to pay it off through French and American banks until 1947. Economists estimate it\u2019s the equivalent of billions of dollars today.",

      "A ruling Wednesday from the top court in the United Kingdom that says the legal definition of a woman is someone whose birth sex is female is the latest high-profile action globally involving the issue of what legal recognitions transgender people are allowed. The spectrum of protections around the world ranges widely, from none at all in a number of countries to the existence of anti-discrimination protections and legal gender identity changes in some others.",
      "Here\u2019s a look at actions in some countries recently:",
      "United Kingdom",
      "The decision from U.K. Supreme Court revolved around the U.K. Equality Act, which bars discrimination along protected categories including age, race and sex. The court\u2019s ruling said that for the purposes of the act, the definition of a woman is someone born biologically female, which excludes transgender people. The unanimous decision means trans women can be barred from places like women-only changing rooms and homeless shelters and kept from groups like those offering medical or counseling services only to women. But the ruling also said the decision didn\u2019t mean transgender people were without any legal protection, because the Equality Act also recognizes gender reassignment as a protected category.",
      "Supporters of For Women Scotland, the group that brought the suit, celebrated the decision while advocates for transgender rights called it a setback.",
      "Hungary",
      "Rights for transgender people were restricted as part of a wider crackdown on LGBTQ communities in Hungary through an amendment to its constitution passed on April 14. The measure was proposed by the ruling coalition led by populist Prime Minister Viktor Orb\u00e1n, and easily sailed through Hungary\u2019s parliament.",
      "Under the new amendment, the nation\u2019s constitution says there are two sexes, male and female. A government spokesman called it \u201ca clarification that legal norms are based on biological reality.\u201d It lays a constitutional groundwork for denying transgender people the ability to have their gender identities protected.",
      "Critics of the amendment said it was about humiliating and excluding people, and part of the ruling party\u2019s moves toward authoritarianism. The amendment also banned any public events from LGBTQ communities, which Hungary\u2019s government has strongly campaigned against in recent years.",
      "United States",
      "President Donald Trump has made a ban on transgender participation in sports a central focus of his administration. On Wednesday, he sued the state of Maine for not following an executive order he signed that banned transgender athletes from participating in girls\u2019 and women\u2019s sports.",
      "In a February meeting with state governors, Trump called out Gov. Janet Mills for not complying with his order, and threatened to pull federal funding, to which Mills replied, \u201cWe\u2019ll see you in court.\u201d",
      "The administration\u2019s lawsuit calls for Maine to be ordered to tell its schools that it\u2019s prohibited for males to participate in athletic competition designated for females.",
      "Another of Trump\u2019s executive orders insists on a rigid definition of the sexes, rather than gender, for federal government purposes. The orders are facing court challenges. For its part, Maine sued the administration after the Department of Agriculture said it was pausing some money for the state\u2019s educational programs. A federal judge on Friday ordered the administration to unfreeze funds intended for a Maine child nutrition program.",
      "It\u2019s not just on the federal level; the question of legal protections for transgender people is a political issue in many American states as well. In twenty-six states, transgender girls from are banned from girls school sports. Other issues around the country include access to gender-related health care for minors and bathroom access in public spaces like schools and government buildings."

      "The World Trade Organization (WTO) warned on Wednesday that the outlook for global trade has \u201cdeteriorated sharply\u201d in the wake of U.S. President Donald Trump\u2019s tariffs regime.",
      "\u201cThe outlook for global trade has deteriorated sharply due to a surge in tariffs and trade policy uncertainty,\u201d the WTO said in its latest \u201cGlobal Trade Outlook and Statistics\u201d report out Wednesday.",
      "More from CNBC",
      "China strikes back with 125% tariffs on U.S. goods as trade war intensifies Trump temporarily drops tariffs to 10% for most countries, hits China harder with 125% Trump open to tariff negotiations, contradicting White House aides",
      "China strikes back with 125% tariffs on U.S. goods as trade war intensifies",
      "Trump temporarily drops tariffs to 10% for most countries, hits China harder with 125%",
      "Trump open to tariff negotiations, contradicting White House aides",
      "Based on the tariffs currently in place, and including a 90-day suspension of \u201creciprocal tariffs,\u201d the volume of world merchandise trade is now expected to decline by 0.2% in 2025, before posting a \u201cmodest\u201d recovery of 2.5% in 2026.",
      "The decline is anticipated to be particularly steep in North America, where exports are forecasted to drop by 12.6% this year.",
      "The WTO also warned that \u201csevere downside risks exist,\u201d including the application of \u201creciprocal\u201d tariffs and a broader spillover of policy uncertainty, \u201cwhich could lead to an even sharper decline of 1.5% in global goods trade,\u201d particularly hurting export-oriented, least-developed countries.",
      "The recent tariff disturbances follow a strong year for world trade in 2024, during which merchandise trade grew 2.9% and commercial services trade expanded by 6.8%, the WTO said.",
      "The new estimate of a 0.2% decline in world trade for 2025 is nearly three percentage points lower than it would have been under a \u201clow tariff\u201d baseline scenario, the WTO added, and marks a significant reversal from the start of the year when the trade body\u2019s economists expected to see continued trade expansion supported by improving macroeconomic conditions.",
      "\u201cRisks to the forecast include the implementation of the currently suspended reciprocal tariffs by the United States, as well as a broader spillover of trade policy uncertainty beyond U.S.-linked trade relationships,\u201d the WTO said.",
      "\u201cIf enacted, reciprocal tariffs would reduce world merchandise trade growth by an additional 0.6 percentage points, posing particular risks for least-developed countries (LDCs), while a spreading of trade policy uncertainty (TPU) would shave off a further 0.8 percentage points. Taken together, the reciprocal tariffs and spreading TPU would lead to a 1.5% decline in world merchandise trade volume in 2025.\u201d",
      "Trump stunned trading partners and global markets in early April, when he announced a raft of \u201creciprocal\u201d tariffs on imports from more than 180 countries. Beijing was hit the hardest of all, with the U.S. duty on Chinese imports now effectively totaling 145%. China in turn hit back at Washington with retaliatory tariffs of\u00a0up to 125% on U.S. imports.",
      "Widespread market turbulence following the tariffs announcement prompted a temporary climbdown by Trump, with the president last week announcing that\u00a0the new duties on imports from most trading partners would be reduced to 10% for 90 days\u00a0in order to allow for\u00a0trade negotiations\u00a0with Washington\u2019s counterparts.",
      "The WTO said in its Wednesday report that the impact of recent trade policy changes is likely to vary sharply from region to region.",
      "In the adjusted forecast, North America now subtracts 1.7 percentage points from global merchandise trade growth in 2025, turning the overall figure negative.",
      "Meanwhile, Asia and Europe continue to contribute positively, but less than in the baseline scenario, with Asia\u2019s input halved to 0.6 percentage points.",
      "The disruption in U.S.-China trade is expected \u201cto trigger significant trade diversion,\u201d the WTO added, raising concerns among third markets about increased competition from China.",
      "\u201cChinese merchandise exports are projected to rise by 4% to 9% across all regions outside North America as trade is redirected. At the same time, U.S. imports from China are expected to fall sharply in sectors such as textiles, apparel and electrical equipment, creating new export opportunities for other suppliers able to fill the gap,\u201d the trade organization remarked, noting that this could open the door for some least-developed countries to increase their exports to the U.S. market."

    "story": [
      "President Donald Trump is looming large in the final weeks of Australia\u2019s general election campaign, spelling trouble for conservative opposition leader\u00a0Peter Dutton\u00a0just as a new poll shows Australians\u2019 faith in the United States at an all-time low.",
      "A survey released on Wednesday by the Lowy Institute, a research foundation, found only 36% of Australians expressed any level of trust in the U.S. to act responsibly, down 20 points since the last survey in June 2024 and the lowest since the annual poll was launched two decades ago.",
      "Trump\u2019s blustery style and often disruptive policies, including \u201creciprocal\u201d tariffs against long-time allies and attacks on U.S. government agencies, have begun to alarm Australian voters, analysts and academics say, as they have\u00a0in Canada\u00a0where the ruling party\u2019s fortunes revived dramatically ahead of elections this month.",
      "Similarly, the Labor Party of Australian Prime Minister Anthony Albanese has surged in the polls from a deficit of six points against Dutton\u2019s conservative coalition as recently as January to a lead now of as much as nine points, with only three-and-a-half weeks until the May 3 election.",
      "\u201cTrump has emerged as the third candidate in this election campaign,\u201d said Mark Kenny, a professor specializing in politics at the Australian National University in Canberra.",
      "\u201cHe\u2019s made it quite difficult for Peter Dutton to get his message across, and made it difficult for Dutton to be seen as an entirely independent figure in this election campaign.\u201d",
      "Polled before tariff announcements",
      "The Lowy survey reinforced polling by Resolve Strategic, conducted after Trump\u2019s April 2 tariff announcement and released on Monday, that showed a third of voters \u2014 and 35% of undecided voters \u2014 said they were now less likely to vote for Dutton because of Trump.",
      "\u201cGiven President Donald Trump\u2019s norm-shattering approach to his second term, it\u2019s no surprise that Australians are less trusting of the United States,\u201d said Ryan Neelam, the Lowy Institute\u2019s Director of Public Opinion and Foreign Policy.",
      "The Lowy Institute polling was conducted in March, before Trump announced his swathe of tariffs, including a\u00a0blanket 10%\u00a0on all Australian imports.",
      "Dutton has campaigned on several policies seen widely as emulating Trump and his Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE), set up by Elon Musk. In January, Dutton appointed Jacinta Nampijinpa Price as a shadow minister for government efficiency, a position inspired by Musk\u2019s role, analysts said.",
      "\u201cWith Australians sick of the wasteful spending that is out of control ... Jacinta will be looking closely at how we can achieve a more efficient use of taxpayers\u2019 money,\u201d Dutton said at the time.",
      "But concerns over Trump\u2019s policies have begun dragging down Dutton\u2019s popularity.",
      "'DOGE-y Dutton'",
      "After a voter backlash, Dutton was\u00a0forced to abandon a policy\u00a0that would have required government workers to return to the office full time while cutting tens of thousands of public sector jobs.",
      "Polling showed those policies were turning off voters in outer metropolitan areas, home to many of Australia\u2019s battleground seats.",
      "The Labor Party has capitalized on the shift in public sentiment, with Treasurer Jim Chalmers repeatedly referring to the opposition leader as \u201cDOGE-y Dutton\u201d.",
      "Albanese said on Tuesday Dutton would enact \u201cDOGE-style cuts\u201d to the public sector if he were elected.",
      "\u201c(Australians) are not enjoying the turmoil and the capriciousness of the White House, and Dutton\u2019s early enthusiasm along with other conservatives to celebrate Trump\u2019s win has been pretty much lead in his saddlebags all the way through this campaign,\u201d Australian National University\u2019s Kenny said.",
      "\u201cThat weight has just got heavier and heavier as Trump has become less and less popular.\u201d"

      "Visiting Toulon prison in southern\u00a0France, whose entrance was shot at with an AK-47 automatic rifle, Justice Minister Gerald Darmanin said he could not be sure if the attacks were linked to government efforts to clamp down on\u00a0France\u2019s fast-growing drug trade.",
      "But he said authorities were making life much harder for imprisoned gangsters, and the government would not shy away from tackling drug crime, which has boosted support for the far right.",

      "The National Anti-Terrorism Prosecutor\u2019s Office (PNAT) said it had taken charge of the probe into the attacks, which also targeted the National School of Prison Administration. The PNAT said officers from\u00a0France\u2019s domestic intelligence agency DGSI would assist in the investigation.",
      "\u201cThe nature of these facts, the targets chosen and the concerted character of an action committed on multiple points on the territory, as well as the objective to seriously disturb public order with intimidation ... leads, at this stage, the national anti-terrorism prosecutor\u2019s office to take charge to ensure, in this unprecedented context, national coordination of the probes involved,\u201d PNAT said in a statement.",
      "PNAT said its investigation may involve charges, including attempted murder with a terrorist outfit committed against a person in a position of public authority.",
      "Darmanin said it was unusual for PNAT, rather than specialized organized crime prosecutors, to take charge of the investigation, but it was justified due to the national scale of attacks against symbols of the state.",
      "The letters \u201cDDPF\u201d \u2014 apparently an acronym for \u201cFrench prisoners\u2019 rights\u201d \u2014 were tagged on many of the attack sites, and police sources suggested it could be the work of a far-left militant group.",
      "Darmanin said there had been DDPF groups on Telegram and Signal that had encouraged attacks against\u00a0prisons, but \u201cthere hasn\u2019t been any claim of responsibility.\u201d",
      "\u201cI don\u2019t know who\u2019s behind this slogan, and I don\u2019t care because what I remember is not that a prison door was tagged, but that it was shot at by a Kalashnikov,\u201d he said.",
      "Darmanin said the prison attacks reminded him of contracts given to gangsters to threaten, assault or kill rivals.",
      "\u201cWe generally see such things between thugs; we rarely see it against the forces of the Republic,\u201d he said.",
      "Interior Minister Bruno Retailleau said he had instructed law enforcement to step up protection of staff and\u00a0prisons.",
      "The rise in gang crime has increased support for the far-right National Rally party and helped drag French politics rightward.",
      "Darmanin has proposed measures to tighten prison security, including building high-security jails to isolate the country\u2019s top 100 kingpins.",
      "Lawmakers are also close to approving a sweeping new anti-drug trafficking law that would create a new national organized crime prosecutors\u2019 office and give greater investigative powers to police probing drug gangs.",
      "Authorities scored a win in February, when they\u00a0recaptured Mohamed Amra, a French fugitive known as \u201cThe Fly.\" His high-profile escape as he was being transported from prison to court resulted in the deaths of two prison guards."
