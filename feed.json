      "Diane Keaton has always stood out in Hollywood",
      "Diane Keaton never really played the part of glamorous movie star. She was in iconic films and she dated some of the biggest stars of her generation, and yet she somehow remained other and defiantly herself despite so many years working in the Hollywood system. Eccentric and approachable, with a sort of effervescent charm, it\u2019s no surprise that she played muse to so many, from Woody Allen to Nancy Meyers.",
      "People often describe her as self-deprecating, as if it was a choice and not a product of deep-seated insecurity. Keaton was someone who thought herself ugly, who battled eating disorders and who never seemed to give herself enough credit for her successes. But she was also able to channel that into her performances spanning five decades unlike none other.",
      "There are so many Keaton films worth noting, including her full run with Allen. There are the Instagram favorites like \u201cThe First Wives Club\u201d (available to rent), nostalgic classics like \u201cFather of the Bride\u201d (streaming on Hulu) and dramatic turns in \u201cMarvin\u2019s Room\u201d (streaming on Kanopy) and \u201cShoot the Moon\u201d (available to rent).",
      "Here are six essential roles to get you started.",
      "Kay Adams, the future Mrs. Corleone, could have been a wallpaper role. But Keaton, in her breakout role, held the screen next to her flashier counterparts. She was the wife who had something going on behind her eyes, who could hold the screen in the chilling final shot of the first film. Social media doesn\u2019t often produce anything worthwhile but in 2023 Francis Ford Coppola and Keaton had an exchange on an Instagram story \u201cask me anything\u201d session. She wondered why he\u2019d picked her.",
      "\u201cI chose you, because although you were to play the more straight/vanilla wife, there was something more about you, deeper, funnier, and very interesting. (I was right),\u201d Coppola wrote.",

      "Allen encouraged her to wear what she wanted to wear, and so she assembled her iconic outfit \u2014 khaki pants, vest, tie \u2014 from \u201ccool-looking women on the streets of New York.\u201d The hat was lifted from actor Aurore Clement.",
      "\u201cNo one had any serious expectations. We were just having a good time moving through New York\u2019s landmark locations,\u201d she wrote in her memoir. \u201cAs always, Woody concerned himself with worries about the script.

      "In this comedy from Charles Shyer and Nancy Meyers, Keaton plays a Manhattan yuppie who unexpectedly inherits a 14-month-old and begins to reassess her life, eventually moving to Vermont where she meets a veterinarian played by peak handsome Sam Shepard. An ahead-of-its-time commentary on the have-it-all discourse of the next 30 years, Roger Ebert wrote at the time that \u201c\u2019Baby Boom\u2019 makes no effort to show us real life.

      "Oh Erica Barry and her fabulous Hamptons home and ivory turtleneck sweaters. This was purely the brainchild of Meyers, the writer-director who had the glorious idea to make a 50-something woman the object of desire in a mainstream romantic comedy. Keaton plays this brilliant playwright who catches the eye of both an older playboy (Jack Nicholson) with a proclivity for much younger women and a young, handsome doctor (Keanu Reeves). Keaton has called it her favorite movie, in part because she got to kiss Nicholson (who she had acted alongside before, in \u201cReds\u201d) \u201cbecause it was so unexpected at age 57.\u201d",

      "ROME (AP) \u2014 For the first time in nearly 2,000 years, visitors to Rome\u2019s world-renowned Colosseum will have the opportunity to walk through a hidden imperial passage that once allowed Roman emperors to reach the ancient amphitheater unseen.",
      "The once-secret corridor \u2014 known as the \u201cCommodus Passage\u201d and named after the Roman emperor turned into a pop icon by Ridley Scott\u2019s movie \u201cGladiator\u201d \u2014 opens to the public on Oct. 27, marking an extraordinary milestone in archaeological preservation and access.",
      "Archaeologists at the Colosseum Archaeological Park explained that Roman emperors would use the passage to enter the arena unseen and protected, leading them directly to their reserved honor box overlooking the games.",
      "The passage was named after Emperor Commodus, who ruled alone between 180 A.D. and 192 A.D., when it was initially discovered in the 1810s. Commodus was known to be passionate about gladiators\u2019 games and history relates that while he was passing through the tunnel, someone attempted to assassinate him, but was unsuccessful.",
      "At the passage entrance, archaeologists discovered remnants of decorative elements directly related to arena spectacles, including depictions of boar hunts, bear fights and acrobatic performances. These artistic elements provided a fitting prelude to the brutal entertainments that awaited beyond, they noted.",
      "The corridor is shaped as an \u2019S\u2019 and continues outside the Colosseum arena, but its final destination remains uncertain.",

      "It\u2019s not so often that the font of a movie\u2019s opening credits is, itself, a provocation.",
      "But in Luca Guadagnino \u2019s muddled but darkly absorbing \u201cAfter the Hunt,\u201d the white Windsor Light Condensed lettering against a black background, with cast in alphabetical order and soft jazz playing, is immediately recognizable as the style of a Woody Allen movie opening.",
      "In the juggling act to follow in \u201cAfter the Hunt,\u201d where Guadagnino will playfully twirl a twisting narrative of alleged sexual assault, cancel culture, privilege in academia and Gen Z victimization, the credits are not so much an opening salvo than they are an introductory wink.",
      "Like many an Allen film, \u201cAfter the Hunt\u201d is set among a well-educated, self-involved class. It takes place around Yale University. But unlike Allen\u2019s anxious, existential, chattering characters, Guadagnino\u2019s cocktail party collection of professors and students is a more scheming and unpleasant lot.",
      "That includes a philosophy professor, Alma Imhoff (Julia Roberts), on the precipice of tenure, her friend and department colleague, Hank Gibson (Andrew Garfield), and Imhoff\u2019s star pupil, a Ph.D. student named Maggie Resnick (Ayo Edebiri), who after a party at Alma\u2019s house accuses Hank of sexual assault.",
      "Guadagnino\u2019s film, shot by Malik Hassan Sayeed, is somberly and flatly lit and rife with reflections. Under these drab surfaces, the central characters of \u201cAfter the Hunt\u201d \u2014 an ensemble of singularly charming actors who here have drained away much of their natural charisma \u2014 go at each other on everything from Foucault to feminism in a psychological battle set across a #MeToo minefield.",
      "That, at least, is the promise of \u201cAfter the Hunt.\u201d But Guadagnino\u2019s dour and languid film, scripted by Nora Garrett, only fitfully coheres as the conversation piece it aspires to be. Its plot turns can be rash or implausible, and the movie increasingly feels like ideas and set pieces strung tenuously together.",
      "Yet I also enjoyed the prickliness of \u201cAfter the Hunt.\u201d Though there\u2019s a strong anti-woke vein to it, Guadagnino\u2019s film is more about how seemingly quite different generations have much more in common than they might appear. The cultural debates depicted in the movie are often so colored by moralistic superiority, but that\u2019s not the case here. Everyone is kind of rotten in \u201cAfter the Hunt.\u201d",
      "That\u2019s especially unusual for Roberts, whose Alma is far more complicated a character than she normally tackles. Alma is esteemed, fiercely intelligent, ambitious and hard to read. Her husband, a psychiatrist named Frederik (a fabulous Michael Stuhlbarg as combustible cocktail of cuckold and cook) worships her, but her affection is less evident.",

      "\u201cWhen did offending someone become a cardinal sin?\u201d Hank asks at the party that opens the movie.",

While they hash out what\u2019s true and what\u2019s fiction in Maggie\u2019s account, it\u2019s hard not to notice the mirrors that surround Hank.",
      "The real mirror of \u201cAfter the Hunt\u201d is Alma and Maggie. Edebiri is here a kind of stand-in for Gen Z, and her case expands to include a wider range of issues of inclusivity and othering. As things spiral and Maggie\u2019s case leads to increasing intensity on campus and in Alma\u2019s personal life, Alma shifts from Maggie\u2019s mentor to something more like a foe. But Alma\u2019s own past begins to play a role in the fallout, adding a new frame to \u201cAfter the Hunt\u201d that casts Alma and Maggie\u2019s plights in a different light.",
      "Is this a good time? Not especially, though Garfield is great in a rage. Glib insertions don\u2019t help. In one scene, when Alma meets a fellow faculty member (Chlo\u00eb Sevigny) in a bar, a Smiths song plays and she seems surprised a Morrissey tune isn\u2019t outlawed.",

But \u201cAfter the Hunt\u201d deserves credit not so much more wading into these hot-button topics, but for trying to find its own way through them. It's not a #MeToo procedural but more like a tragedy. When \u201coptics over substance\u201d governs all, as one character laments, no one lives happily ever after.",

      "According to Luminate, an industry data and analytics company, Latin music is primarily consumed via streaming. They found that Bad Bunny saw a 26% increase in on-demand streams in the United States following the Sept. 28 announcement, soaring from 173 million nine days before the announcement to 218.5 million streams in the eight days that followed.",
      "The singer born Benito Antonio Mart\u00ednez Ocasio recently said concerns about the mass deportation of Latinos played into his decision to bypass the mainland U.S. during his residency. He performs in Spanish and will do so at the Super Bowl, further proving that connecting with a U.S. and international audience does not require singing in English.",
      "Since the NFL, Apple Music and Roc Nation announced Bad Bunny will lead the halftime festivities from Levi\u2019s Stadium on Feb. 8 in Santa Clara, California, the selection has provoked conversation.",
      "For his fans, Bad Bunny's booking at the Super Bowl is viewed as a landmark moment for Latino culture. That feeling is no doubt related to his just-concluded, 31-date residency in Puerto Rico that brought approximately half a million people to the island during the slow summer tourism season and generated an estimated $733 million for the island.",

      "JOHANNESBURG -- JOHANNESBURG (AP) \u2014 South Africa's health minister on Tuesday called lenacapavir, the first twice-yearly HIV prevention jab in the world, a \u201cgroundbreaking\u201d tool to fight the disease, but warned initial donated supply would be limited to nearly half a million people in the African country with the highest prevalence rate.",
      "This comes just weeks after the U.S. announced plans to buy 2 million doses of the HIV prevention drug for low-income countries.",
      "The initial supply in South Africa is set to begin in April 2026, funded by a $29.2 million Global Fund grant with an additional $5 million allocated by the Networking HIV and AIDS Community of Southern Africa (NACOSA).",
      "Addressing a national healthcare roundtable dialogue in Johannesburg, Minister Aaron Motsoaledi said the Global Funds\u2019 catalytic commitment will deliver around 456,000 lenacapavir initiations over two years, translating into 912,000 doses.",
      "\u201cWe plan to roll out lenacapavir initially in about 23 high-incident districts across six provinces, targeting around 360 high-performing public clinics within these areas for phase one implementation,\u201d said the minister.",
      "\u201cAbout half a million people will be able to begin using lenacapavir, and thanks to this support, but demand will likely outstrip supply at first,\u201d said Motsoaledi, highlighting that research data suggested that prioritizing vulnerable populations in high-burden districts first would result in the highest impact in terms of new infections prevented.",
      "The minister was quick to caution against complacency with the initial investment after South Africa\u2019s health system was significantly hit by the abrupt cuts to funding from USAID and other U.S. government sources in early 2025. These cuts have had a severe impact on HIV/AIDS and tuberculosis (TB) treatment, prevention, and research programs across the country.",
      "Although Motsoaledi expressed gratitude that Gilead had lowered the price from the $28,000, initially touted to $40, per person annually, he said that South Africa aimed to fund its program independently, with long-term funding hinging on lenacapavir\u2019s integration into local systems, such as the essential medicines list.",
      "The World Health Organization in July recommended the six-month HIV prevention jab that\u2019s already approved in the U.S. and Europe, as an additional prevention choice as part of combination approaches. Gilead is expediting registration in 18 high-incidence countries, including South Africa, to deliver lenacapavir until generic versions become available in 2027.",
      "Early in October, Gilead Sciences announced it had executed voluntary, non-exclusive, royalty-free license contracts with six pharmaceutical companies in Egypt, Pakistan, and India to produce and market generic lenacapavir. Despite participating in the clinical trials for the drug in recent years, South African companies were excluded from Gilead Sciences\u2019 voluntary licensing, which has infuriated civil society.",

      "According to Wendy Cupido, country manager for Gilead, the South African manufacturers that were evaluated in 2024 did not satisfy the technical specifications for the production of sterile injectables at that time. She said, though, that Gilead was still willing to look at further voluntary licensing if a South African manufacturer could develop the required capabilities and meet quality standards.",
      "Welcoming the over $34 million in investment into the rollout, UNAIDS South Africa country director Eva Kiwango said at a time when foreign assistance funding cuts could lead to an additional 6 million HIV infections globally by 2029, long-acting injectable medicines were a \u201cfresh option for all people at risk,\u201d.",
      "\u201cIt is not a cure or a vaccine, but it could be a game changer if made accessible to all who could benefit,\u201d said Kiwango. \u201cFor many, lenacapavir expands choice, strengthens agency, and reduces barriers linked to stigma, disclosure, or daily adherence.\u201d",

Most markets will still have several choices, but some options are becoming particularly sparse for shoppers with low-income subsidies. And help may be harder to find because some insurers no longer pay brokers commissions for new business.",
      "Shoppers have from Oct. 15 to Dec. 7 to find new coverage that starts in January.",
      "Some things to consider:",
      "Regular Medicare, which most people qualify for after turning 65, does not come with prescription coverage, known as Part D. People must choose that separately.",
      "About 23 million people with regular Medicare have this standalone coverage, according to the non-profit KFF, which studies health care.",
      "Another roughly 34 million people have Medicare Advantage plans, which are privately run versions of Medicare that often come with prescription coverage.",
      "A typical shopper will be able to choose a standalone drug plan from among eight to 12 options for 2026, according to KFF Medicare expert Juliette Cubanski. That\u2019s down from 12 to 16 options in 2025.",
      "Shoppers had nearly 30 choices as recently as 2021, according to the Commonwealth Fund\u2019s Gretchen Jacobson.",
      "Depending on the state, a range of one to four plans will be available at no premium to people who qualify for low-income subsidies, according to KFF. Eight were available in 2021.",
      "Some insurers are reducing their presence in standalone Part D plans, while the Blue Cross-Blue Shield carrier Elevance is leaving the market entirely. Insurers and analysts who follow the industry note that the Inflation Reduction Act, which will cap annual out-of-pocket drug costs at $2,100 in 2026, puts more financial pressure on insurers. The same law now allows patients to spread the cost of prescriptions over the year.",
      "Most markets will have several choices. But experts say Medicare Part D customers don\u2019t like to shop, especially if they already have a plan that covers their medications. Finding affordable coverage for multiple prescriptions can be tricky.",
      "\u201cI think there\u2019s a lot of inertia and, frankly, people may be concerned that if they switch, they\u2019re going to end up worse off,\u201d Cubanski said.",
      "More people are being pushed to shop. Nearly 11% of those with standalone prescription drug coverage lost their plan in 2024, according to research published recently in the Journal of the American Medical Association.",
      "Before 2023, that figure was often under 1%, said Dr. Christopher Cai, one of the researchers involved in the study.",

      "But while plans may provide lower coverage prices, they could also raise deductibles or offer more limited lists of covered drugs, which are called formularies. Shoppers should check these details.",
      "Insurers will be allowed to raise premiums by as much as $50 a month for 2026, up from a $35 increase allowed this year. But Cubanski said only some plans will hit that higher limit and not necessarily in all states.",
      "Shoppers can use a federal government website to compare plan prices and coverage.",

      "\u201cThe evidence presented at trial establishes there is a legitimate concern regarding the capacity of minors to understand and appreciate the long-term consequences of the practices prohibited by the Health Care Law,\u201d the judge wrote, adding that he doesn't believe the law violates the state constitution.",
      "The ruling means parents who decided to seek gender-affirming medical care for their children after the state's ban took effect in April 2023 will need to do so out of state.",
      "\u201cThis ruling is devastating for transgender youth and their families in North Dakota. The evidence in this case was overwhelming: this law inflicts real harm, strips families of their constitutional rights, and denies young people the medical care they need to thrive,\u201d Jess Braverman, the legal director for the gender equity nonprofit Gender Justice, which represented the plaintiff, said in a statement.",

      "About half of U.S. states, nearly all of which have fully Republican-led governments, have banned gender-affirming care for minors.

The news hit me hard: She was 14, the same age as my youngest daughter, and the lioness responsible may have been one of the animals we see in our neighborhood almost weekly.",
      "Our children are growing up in a part of Nairobi where lions roam free. We see them while taking our kids to school. We\u2019ve lost pets and livestock. Neighborhood WhatsApp groups share warnings when big cats come close \u2014 and feature CCTV footage of lions hunting family pets.",
      "It\u2019s a conservation headache for the Kenya Wildlife Service (KWS), which is tasked with keeping people who share space with wildlife safe, while protecting the wildlife as well \u2014 especially endangered species. KWS estimates that \u201cjust over 2,000\u201d lions remain in Kenya.",
      "\u201cDuring the rainy season, tall grass and shifting herbivore patterns make it difficult for carnivores to hunt,\u201d KWS wrote on a reel of a Nairobi lion cub rescue posted to its social media in July. The cub in the video had been seen starving in the park, causing a public outcry. KWS added it was \u201cconducting a feeding intervention, providing meat daily to the pride residing in the park to help them regain their strength and resume natural hunting.\u201d",
      "Nairobi National Park, bordering the city to the north, has long relied on vast southern grazing lands for its wildlife to migrate to other protected areas. With those areas fast turning into residential and industrial developments, Kenya\u2019s State Department for Wildlife announced a nearly $5 billion plan to create a migratory corridor between Nairobi and conservancies to the south. There are also nongovernment initiatives that pay landowners bordering Nairobi National Park a small annual fee to keep their properties unfenced for wildlife.",

      "What\u2019s missing is greater awareness on how to behave around predators, especially among increasingly urban communities who are coming into contact with them.",
      "My children never learned this in school. Their closest encounter with a lion was in 2020, when we took advantage of a post-COVID bookings slump to show them the Maasai Mara National Reserve. An incredibly knowledgeable local guide led us through the southern reserve in a completely open safari vehicle, surrounded by surging wildebeest.",
      "On one outing, our guide stopped the car for a passing trio of hunting lionesses. The first strode by, ignoring us. The second looked as if she was going to pass behind the car, but was distracted by the glint of a seatbelt buckle, which my daughter was absentmindedly playing with. The lioness stopped, turned to stare, then wandered up to us. Stretching her head up towards my child, she sniffed the buckle before taking it between her teeth. My daughter sat stiff, perhaps ten inches from the lioness\u2019s head, which suddenly seemed impossibly huge.",
      "\u201cKeep still,\u201d the guide murmured under his breath. \u201cDon\u2019t move. Don\u2019t make a sound.\u201d",
      "Her curiosity satisfied, the lioness ducked under the car and moved on.",
      "That day, we learned a lesson in predator behavior during a holiday experience very few Kenyans can afford. It may have recently saved my wife\u2019s life when she encountered a lioness in our garden. Checking to see what our dog was barking at, she spotted a lioness under a bush less than 10 yards away. Only its head was visible.",

      "\u201cI reached for the maize flour and saw Simon\u2019s head. It was separated from his body. I reached for the head and saw a hand, then a leg inside a gumboot,\u201d Daniel remembers. Horrified, he called me. As we started on the grisly task of trying to find Simon\u2019s remains, we were pushed back by a warning growl. It was a male lion, still guarding the kill.",
      "At this point, Simon had been missing for 2 1/2 days. No one knows whether the lion that was with him by the time we found him was responsible for his death. Lions who kill humans \u2013 the notorious man-eaters \u2013 are shot to avoid recurrence, and KWS claim to have shot the lioness that killed Peace Mwende the night of that attack.",
      "Although human-wildlife conflict has existed for as long as humans have, predator attacks are likely to rise as space for Kenya\u2019s lions shrinks and their hunting opportunities diminish. This can only spell doom for Nairobi\u2019s world-famous national park, which some already want to see turned into housing developments.",
      "I mourn Simon like the friends and colleagues who died on assignment in Sierra Leone and Afghanistan. Every lion sighting also still fills me with joy and wonder, in spite of the horrors of that day in 2019. I hope solutions can be found to keep both people and lion populations safe, and that this remarkable wilderness that makes Nairobi such a unique capital city survives for the joy and wonder of many others.",

      "Robert Roberson hopes he will again avoid becoming the first person in the U.S. executed for a murder conviction tied to the diagnosis of shaken baby syndrome",
      "LIVINGSTON, Texas -- LIVINGSTON, Texas (AP) \u2014 Robert Roberson was calm and hopeful as he pondered his mortality and whether he could again avoid becoming the first person in the U.S. executed for a murder conviction tied to the diagnosis of shaken baby syndrome.",
      "With days to go before his scheduled Oct. 16 execution, Roberson maintained his innocence in the 2002 death of his 2-year-old daughter, Nikki Curtis, in the east Texas city of Palestine. He is set to die by lethal injection nearly a year to the day after a group of Texas lawmakers, who say he is innocent, secured an extraordinary last-minute court reprieve as Roberson waited outside the death chamber in Huntsville.",
      "Roberson said he was placing his hopes for another execution stay in the hands of his lawyers, his supporters and God.",
      "\u201cI\u2019m not going to stress out and stuff because I know God has it, you know. He\u2019s in control. No matter what, God\u2019s in control, you know, and he does have the last say, you know,\u201d Roberson, 58, told The Associated Press last week as he sat behind a glass partition in the visiting area of the Polunsky Unit in Livingston, where Texas' male death row inmates are housed.",
      "During an hourlong interview, Roberson said he thinks about his daughter every day and what kind of life she would have today.",
      "Prosecutors at Roberson\u2019s 2003 trial argued he hit his daughter and violently shook her, causing severe head trauma and that she died from injuries related to shaken baby syndrome. Roberson\u2019s lawyers and some medical experts say his daughter died not from abuse but from complications related to pneumonia. They say his conviction was based on flawed and now outdated scientific evidence.",
      "The diagnosis of shaken baby syndrome refers to a serious brain injury caused when a child\u2019s head is hurt through shaking or some other violent impact, like being slammed against a wall or thrown on the floor.",
      "Roberson\u2019s attorneys have argued his undiagnosed autism helped convict him as authorities and medical personnel felt he didn\u2019t act like a concerned parent because his flat affect was seen as a sign of guilt.",
      "Last year, Roberson was on the verge of being put to death when a flurry of last-minute legal maneuvering on the night of his scheduled execution, including an unprecedented intervention by a bipartisan group of Texas lawmakers, stayed his lethal injection. In July, a judge set the new execution date, Roberson's third.",
      "During his interview with the AP, Roberson often would not keep eye contact and would repeat words or phrases \u2014 behaviors that experts say are associated with autism.",
      "\u201cThey assumed (guilt) because of the way I was acting, you know. And I didn\u2019t know I was autistic, you know, until years and years later, you know,\u201d said Roberson, who wasn\u2019t diagnosed with autism until 2018.",
      "Roberson\u2019s supporters and his legal team are again holding rallies and asking state and federal appeals courts and Texas Gov. Greg Abbott to halt his execution. His supporters include both liberal and ultraconservative lawmakers, Texas GOP megadonor and conservative activist Doug Deason, bestselling author John Grisham and Brian Wharton, the former police detective who helped put together the case against him.",
      "\u201cThe whole world is watching. Texas, do not kill this innocent man,\u201d Wharton said during a rally Saturday outside the Texas Capitol building in Austin.",
      "The office of Texas Attorney General Ken Paxton, as well as some medical experts and other family members of Nikki, maintain the girl died because of child abuse and that Roberson had a history of hitting his daughter.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s been a long time coming. \u2026 In my opinion he did it, 100%,\u201d Matthew Bowman, Nikki's half brother, told reporters in July. Bowman declined to speak with the AP.",
      "Abbott's office did not immediately reply to emails seeking comment. Abbott has the power to grant a one-time 30-day reprieve.",

      "Shaken baby syndrome has come under scrutiny in recent years as some lawyers and medical experts have argued the diagnosis has wrongly sent people to prison. Prosecutors and medical societies say it remains valid.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s no longer a mystery what happened to Nikki. It was not shaking. It was her chronic, serious health conditions,\" Gretchen Sween, one of Roberson\u2019s lawyers, said at Saturday\u2019s rally. \"A crime didn\u2019t occur.\u201d",
      "But in a Sept. 26 op-ed in The Dallas Morning News, three pediatricians, including two with the Yale School of Medicine, said they reviewed the case and \u201care convinced that Nikki was a victim of child abuse.\u201d",
      "Roberson was arrested after he took Nikki to a hospital when she became unresponsive following a fall off their bed. He said he had never heard of shaken baby syndrome.",
      "\u201cIt was bad enough losing my little girl. And then when they accused me of it, I couldn\u2019t believe it,\u201d Roberson said.",
      "In a press release issued after Roberson\u2019s execution was delayed last year as well as in recent court filings, Paxton\u2019s office has stressed that \u201cthis was no mere shaken baby case but involved a child who was beaten and received multiple blows to the head.\u201d Paxton\u2019s office said the jury \u201cdid not convict Roberson on the basis of \u2018Shaken Baby Syndrome.\u2019\u201d",
      "Yet one of the jurors who convicted Roberson, Terre Compton, told lawmakers last year that, \u201ceverything that was presented to us was all about shaken baby syndrome. That is what our decision was based on.\u201d",
      "Grisham, who is writing a book about the case, said Roberson's trial \u201cwas grossly unfair\u201d because his autism contributed to people believing he was guilty and his defense lawyers told jurors it was a case of shaken baby syndrome.",
      "Roberson said he remains optimistic he will one day get a chance to prove his innocence with a new trial.",
      "\u201cI\u2019m not scared to die, but I\u2019m not ready to die, you know. I would like to believe God has more for me to do and stuff, you know,\u201d Roberson said.",

      "Planned Parenthood officials say in court filings that Missouri's Republican attorney general is trying to get the medical records of patients who\u2019ve had abortions",
      "Missouri's Republican attorney general is trying to get the medical records of Planned Parenthood patients who've had abortions, officials who oversee clinics in Kansas City and St. Louis said in legal filings.",
      "The fight over the subpoenas is playing out in a lawsuit filed last year by Planned Parenthood Great Plains, the abortion provider's affiliate for Kansas City, and Planned Parenthood Great Rivers, the affiliate for St. Louis. Planned Parenthood officials argue that the state's restrictions violate an amendment to the Missouri Constitution narrowly approved by voters in November to protect abortion rights.",
      "The Missouri attorney general\u2019s office issued subpoenas starting in late August to two employees of the Kansas City Planned Parenthood affiliate, a physician contracting with it, and two former board members of the St. Louis-area Planned Parenthood affiliate, according to Planned Parenthood court filings last month. One filing seeking to quash the subpoenas said the attorney general demanded patient records, reports on adverse events and communications about patient care, along with clinical protocols, equipment maintenance records, contract documents and records related to compliance with state requirements.",
      "\u201cDespite the Missouri Attorney General\u2019s blatant attempts to overturn the will of the people, all patients expect and have the right for their medical records to be private,\u201d the two affiliates said in a joint statement Tuesday. \u201cPoliticians have no place in the exam room with patients and their medical providers.\u201d",
      "Attorney General Catherine Hanaway\u2019s office did not immediately respond to an email Tuesday requesting comment. But in a filing in June, the state questioned Planned Parenthood officials\u2019 repeated statements that \u201cabortion rarely involves medical complications\u201d and that state requirements do not improve patients\u2019 health.",
      "\u201cThe purpose of litigation is to \u2018ascertain the truth,\u2019\u201d the filing said.",
      "Abortion policy has been in flux nationally since the 2022 U.S. Supreme Court decision that overturned Roe v. Wade and allowed states to enforce bans. Twelve states now ban abortion at any stage of pregnancy, with limited exception, and women now are more likely to cross state lines for abortions or to obtain them via pills shipped in by prescribers elsewhere.",
      "A multiyear legal battle has seen Missouri swing back and forth between banning and allowing most abortions. Before last year's ballot question, the state had a near-total ban.",
      "In July, Jackson County Circuit Court Judge Jerri Zhang, in Kansas City, blocked enforcement of many of the restrictions while the lawsuit proceeds, including licensing requirements and a 72-hour waiting period for abortions.",
      "Planned Parenthood clinics are doing procedural abortions in St. Louis, Kansas City and Columbia, home to the University of Missouri\u2019s main campus. Planned Parenthood Great Plains also has two clinics performing abortions on the Kansas side of the Kansas City metropolitan area.",
      "Medication abortions remain on hold in Missouri while Planned Parenthood officials wrangle with the state over abortion regulations.",

After perusing decorations ranging from animals to kitchen cutting boards, one woman bought a small black-stained tree.",

      "To avoid censorship and deliver a budget for the European Union\u2019s second-largest economy before looming deadlines, Lecornu may be forced to abandon an unpopular pension reform that was one of Macron\u2019s signature policies in his second presidential term. Rammed through parliament without a vote in 2023 despite mass protests, the pension change gradually raises the retirement age from 62 to 64. Opposition parties want it scrapped.",

      "BUENOS AIRES, Argentina -- BUENOS AIRES, Argentina (AP) \u2014 Argentina\u2019s libertarian leader is lavishing praise on Donald Trump ahead of his first White House meeting with the U.S. president on Tuesday. It's a tactic that has helped transform President Javier Milei \u2019s cash-strapped country into one of the Trump administration\u2019s closest allies.",
      "The effusive declarations are nothing new for Milei \u2014 whose dramatic cuts to state spending and attacks on \u201cwoke leftists\u201d have won him a following among U.S. conservatives.",
      "\u201cYour commitment to life, freedom and peace has restored hope to the world,\u201d Milei wrote on social media Monday, congratulating the U.S. president on securing a ceasefire deal in Gaza, where a truce is holding after a devastating, two-year Israel-Hamas war.",
      "\u201cIt is an honor to consider you not only an ally in the defense of those values, but also a dear friend and an example of leadership that inspires all those who believe in freedom,\u201d he said.",
      "The Trump-Milei bromance has already paid off for Argentina \u2014 most recently, to the tune of a $20 billion bailout.",
      "Experts say Milei comes to the White House with two clear objectives. One is to negotiate U.S. tariff exemptions or reductions for Argentine products.",
      "The other is to see how the United States will implement a $20 billion currency swap line to prop up Argentina\u2019s peso and replenish its depleted foreign currency reserves ahead of crucial midterm elections later this month.",
      "The Trump administration made a highly unusual decision to intervene in Argentina\u2019s currency market after Milei's party suffered a landslide loss in a local election last month.",
      "Along with setbacks in the opposition-dominated Congress, the party's crushing defeat created a crisis of confidence as voters in Buenos Aires Province registered their frustration with rising unemployment, contracting economic activity and brewing corruption scandals.",
      "Alarmed that this could herald the end of popular support for Milei's free-market program, investors dumped Argentine bonds and sold off the peso.",
      "Argentina\u2019s Treasury began hemorrhaging precious dollar reserves at a feverish pace, trying shore up the currency and keep its exchange rate within the trading band set as part of the country\u2019s recent $20 billion deal with the International Monetary Fund.",
      "But as the peso continued to slide, Milei grew desperate.",
      "He met with Trump on Sept. 23 while in New York City for the United Nations General Assembly. A flurry of back-slapping, hand-shaking and mutual flattery between the two quickly gave way to U.S. Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent publicly promising Argentina a lifeline of $20 billion.",
      "Markets cheered, and investors breathed a sigh of relief.",
      "In the days that followed, Argentine Economy Minister Luis Caputo spent hours in meetings in Washington trying to seal the deal.",
      "Reassurance came last Thursday, when Bessent announced that the U.S. would allow Argentina to exchange up to $20 billion worth of pesos for an equal sum in dollars. Saying that the success of Milei\u2019s program was \u201cof systemic importance,\u201d Bessent added that the U.S. Treasury directly purchased an unspecified amount of pesos.",

      "Cyprus has a cat problem",
      "NICOSIA, Cyprus -- NICOSIA, Cyprus (AP) \u2014 The island of cats has a cat problem.",
      "Officials in Cyprus, the small island nation in the eastern corner of the Mediterranean, estimate there is roughly one feral cat for every one of its 1 million inhabitants \u2014 though activists contend the actual population is hundreds of thousands higher.",
      "In late September, the island\u2019s parliamentary committee on the environment was told that an existing sterilization program is too limited to contain the burgeoning cat population.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s a good program, but it needs to expand,\u201d said Environment Commissioner Antonia Theodosiou, noting that the program conducts only about 2,000 sterilizations annually on a budget of just 100,000 euros ($117,000).",
      "While there is no official comparative data, Theodosiou said Cyprus has gained a reputation for having a cat population that is exceptionally large relative to its human inhabitants.",
      "Change might be on the way, but funding alone won\u2019t solve Cyprus\u2019s cat problem.",
      "Appearing to heed calls for more funding, Environment Minister Maria Panayiotou announced on Oct. 4 \u2014 World Animal Day \u2014 that the government would raise cat sterilization funding to 300,000 euros annually. The decision was hailed as a significant step forward.",
      "However, Charalambos Theopemptou, chairman of the Parliamentary Environment Committee, warned against relying on money alone. \u201cThere has to be a plan,\" he said. \"We can't just go ahead with sterilizations without having a plan,\u201d he said.",
      "Given cats\u2019 predatory nature, a large population not only has the potential to wreak havoc with the island\u2019s ecosystem, but it could cause undue suffering for feral felines roaming car-choked streets in search of food and shelter.",
      "Cyprus has a long history as a cat-loving nation where cat food dispensaries and clusters of tiny houses are a regular sight along popular footpaths.",
      "Two decades ago, French archaeologists unearthed what they believed to be the earliest evidence of a domesticated cat in a 9,500-year-old neolithic village. They found the bones of a cat close to the skeletal remains of a human, suggesting that they were buried together.",
      "Adding to this long history of human-feline connection is the 4th century legend of Saint Helen who, after finding the True Cross in the Holy Lands, brought over a couple of boatloads of cats to deal with a snake infestation. A monastery that serves as a feline safe haven, St. Nicholas of the Cats, still exists today.",
      "With tourism a key economic driver for Cyprus, the island\u2019s cats have become a major attraction for the millions of vacationers who descend on the island every year. The well-fed felines are a common sight, often seen feasting on leftovers provided by visitors at the plethora of restaurants where they like to hang out.",
      "Demetris Epaminondas, president of the Veterinary Association, attributes the exploding population to unchecked breeding, particularly in high-concentration urban areas, and to more kittens surviving birth, thanks to ordinary folks offering care.",

      "Authorities acknowledge the program is ineffective.",
      "The country\u2019s state-run Veterinary Services, which is in charge of sterilizations, conceded that the program\u2019s capabilities are \"lesser than the real need.\u201d To reassess where available funding could be redistributed, it has asked local government authorities to submit reports on locations with large feral cat concentrations.",
      "Elias Demetriou who runs the private sanctuary Friends of Larnaca Cats said tripling sterilization funds won't have the desired effect unless conservationist groups who have the know-how are recruited to round up cats for sterilization.",
      "Eleni Loizidou, head of Cat Alert, a volunteer organization caring for strays in Nicosia, said her organization\u2019s recent efforts to round up 397 feral cats from the city center were a mere drop in the ocean \u2014 and that too few females are being sterilized, partly because of the difficulty in trapping feral cats.",
      "Epaminondas, the Veterinary Association president, said Cyprus' cat population can be brought under control in as few as four years. This would be possible, he said, if authorities cobble together a unified sterilization plan that would put private clinics at the forefront of the effort by offering free-of-charge neutering without all the red tape that complicates the process.",
      "\u201cPeople will be more motivated to get cats neutered if we make it easier for them to do so,\u201d he said.",
      "His association has proposed a plan that would identify major cat concentration centers where authorities can round them up and take them for sterilization at designated vets. The initiative includes the creation of a smartphone application that would allow anyone to help authorities locate such large cat concentrations.",
      "The state can avoid bearing the full cost of the program by setting up a fund where people and businesses can donate, according to Epaminondas. The minister's announcement about tripling the sterilization budget, he said, could act as a significant incentive for more corporate donations.",
      "The cost of sterilizing a female feral cat in Cyprus is 55 euros ($64), which goes up to 120 euros for domesticated cats brought in by owners, as they receive more specialized care.",
      "Theodosiou, the environment commissioner, said her staff have worked on a long-term strategy that would bring together government, conservationists, and volunteers to establish a precise cat population count and pave the way for a mass sterilization program. The plan would also legalize private cat sanctuaries.",
      "\u201cThere are solutions,\u201d Cat Alert's chief Loizidou said.",

The missiles would allow Ukraine to strike deeper into Russian territory.",

      "Zelenskyy will join a Ukrainian delegation already in the U.S. for preliminary talks, led by Prime Minister Yulia Svyrydenko. Russia has stepped up attacks in recent weeks targeting electricity and gas infrastructure ahead of winter, in an effort to cripple Ukraine\u2019s power grid ahead of freezing temperatures to erode public morale. Ukraine's State Emergency Service said the worst attacks early Monday using drones and missiles occurred around the Black Sea port of Odesa and in the northern Chernihiv region, where one person was killed.",

      "WASHINGTON -- WASHINGTON (AP) \u2014 A sharp slowdown in hiring poses a growing risk to the U.S. economy, Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell said Tuesday, a sign that the Fed will likely cut its key interest rate twice more this year.",
      "Powell said in written remarks that despite the federal government shutdown cutting off official economic data, \u201cthe outlook for employment and inflation does not appear to have changed much since our September meeting,\u201d when the Fed reduced its key rate for the first time this year.",
      "Fed officials at that meeting also forecast that the central bank would reduce its rate twice more this year and once in 2026. Lower rates from the Fed could reduce borrowing costs for mortgages, car loans, and business loans. Powell is speaking before a meeting of the National Association of Business Economics in Philadelphia.",
      "Powell reiterated a message he first delivered after the September meeting, when he signaled that the Fed is slightly more worried about the job market than its other congressional mandate, which is to keep prices stable. Tariffs have lifted the Fed's preferred measure of inflation to 2.9%, he said, but outside the duties there aren't \u201cbroader inflationary pressures\u201d that will keep prices high.",
      "\u201cRising downside risks to employment have shifted our assessment of the balance of risks,\u201d he said.",
      "Powell also said that the central bank may soon stop shrinking its roughly $6.6 trillion balance sheet. The Fed has been allowing roughly $40 billion of Treasuries and mortgage-backed securities to mature each month without replacing them. The shift could weigh on longer-term Treasury interest rates.",
      "Separately, Powell spent most of his speech defending the Fed's practice of buying longer-term Treasury bonds and mortgage-backed securities in 2020 and 2021, which were intended to lower longer-term interest rates and support the economy during the pandemic.",

      "Other critics have long argued that the Fed kept implementing the purchases for too long, keeping interest rates low even as inflation began to spike in late 2021. The Fed beginning in 2021 stopped the purchases and then sharply boosted borrowing costs to combat inflation.",
      "\u201cWith the clarity of hindsight, we could have\u2014and perhaps should have\u2014stopped asset purchases sooner,\u201d Powell said. \"Our real-time decisions were intended to serve as insurance against downside risk.\"",

      "California state Sen. Caroline Menjivar, a Democrat, said the bill was inspired in part by her own experiences living with severe allergies to many nuts and fruits.",
      "\u201cSoon, the millions of Californians with food allergies, many of whom are young children, will be able to fully enjoy dining out without fear or apprehension at these qualifying restaurants,\u201d she said when the bill passed in the Legislature. \u201cIn turn, these businesses will be able to offer allergen families a unique additional assurance that will drive customers to their establishments.\u201d",
      "But the California Restaurant Association has said previously the law will be costly and burdensome for businesses. The group said it is pleased the bill no longer applies to small restaurants, but is concerned the legislation could lead to \u201cpredatory lawsuits\u201d against businesses.",

      "The regulations, or \u201cNet-zero Framework,\u201d sets a marine fuel standard that decreases, over time, the amount of greenhouse gas emissions allowed from using shipping fuels. The regulations also establish a pricing system that would impose fees for every ton of greenhouse gases emitted by ships above allowable limits, in what is effectively the first global tax on greenhouse gas emissions.",
      "There's a base-level of compliance for the allowable greenhouse gas intensity of fuels. There's a more stringent direct compliance target that requires further reduction in the greenhouse gas intensity.",
      "If ships sail on fuels with lower emissions than what's required under the direct compliance target, they earn \u201csurplus units,\" effectively credits.",
      "Ships with the highest emissions would have to buy those credits from other ships under the pricing system, or from the IMO at $380 per ton of carbon dioxide equivalent to reach the base level of compliance.

      "Ships that meet the base target but not the direct compliance one must pay the $100 per ton penalty, too.",
      "Ships whose greenhouse gas intensity is below a certain threshold will receive rewards for their performance.",

That would go into an IMO fund to invest in fuels and technologies needed to transition to green shipping, reward low-emission ships and support developing countries so they aren\u2019t left behind with dirty fuels and old ships.",
      "The IMO, which regulates international shipping, set a target for the sector to reach net-zero greenhouse gas emissions by about 2050, and has committed to ensuring that fuels with zero or near-zero emissions are used more widely.",

      "Toby Talbot, a great patron of art house cinema, has died at age 96",
      "NEW YORK -- NEW YORK (AP) \u2014 Toby Talbot, a great patron of art house cinema who with her husband, Dan, helped introduce movie lovers to celebrated works from Jean-Luc Godard,Pedro Almod\u00f3var and hundreds of other international filmmakers and to American favorites old and new, has died at age 96.",
      "Talbot died Sept. 15 at her home in Manhattan, The New York Times reported Monday. The cause was complications from Guillain-Barr\u00e9 syndrome, an autoimmune disease.",
      "The Talbots, through their distribution company, New Yorker Films, and such prominent Manhattan theaters as The New Yorker and Lincoln Plaza Cinemas, were a prolific force behind the transformation of movies in the 1960s and '70s from popular entertainment to an art form regarded with the seriousness of literature or painting. Martin Scorsese, Pauline Kael, Wim Wenders and Susan Sontag were among their many friends and customers, turning up for the latest Godard release, a documentary about Sen. Joseph McCarthy or a double feature of Cary Grant movies.",
      "\u201cThe New Yorker was a very special place. It was a place of communion, where the customers, the owners, the programmers, and the filmmakers seemed to be part of the same family,\u201d Scorsese wrote in the foreword to Toby Talbot's memoir, \u201cThe New Yorker Theater,\u201d which came out in 2009. \u201cDan and Toby were right there on the front lines, showing films ... distributing films, sticking their neck out on pictures by Godard and Bertolucci and Fassbinder and Straub and Huillet and Oshima and Sembene.\u201d",
      "The New Yorker theater had a special role in movie history, as the setting for a classic scene from Woody Allen's \u201cAnnie Hall\u201d: While Allen and Diane Keaton wait on line in the lobby, they overhear a fellow moviegoer's pedantic thoughts on the Canadian philosopher-media theorist Marshall McLuhan, who turns up in a cameo to rebuke the man.",
      "For foreign language directors or for such contemporary American filmmakers as Allen or Jim Jarmusch who depended on the art house market, support from the Talbots was essential. The feature releases they championed were a template for cinephiles: Satyajit Ray's \u201cPather Panchali\u201d and Jarmusch's \u201cStranger Than Paradise,\u201d Yasujiro Ozu's \u201cLate Spring\u201d and Werner Herzog's \u201cAguirre, the Wrath of God.\u201d The Talbots also helped inspire a reevaluation of Hollywood's past, with retrospectives of Preston Sturges, Humphrey Bogart and Buster Keaton among others.",
      "Toby Talbot was born Toby Tolpen, a native New Yorker who met her future husband in 1949, went to the movies with him on dates and married him the following year. (They had three children). In the 1950s, Dan Talbot worked as an editor at Gold Medal Books among other jobs and Toby Talbot was an editor and translator.",
      "Their art house years began spontaneously, on a road trip. The Talbots had been thinking about opening a book store in New Hampshire, but while driving north to look for possible locations they found themselves talking about the movies they loved. Soon after, Toby Talbot's sister and brother-in-law mentioned that their accountant wanted to buy a theater on Manhattan's Upper West Side. The Talbots convinced him to let them run it, on the condition that after a year they would have turned a profit.",

      "The New Yorker Theater opened in March 1960, starting with Laurence Olivier's \u201cHenry V\u201d and the French release \u201cThe Red Balloon.\u201d The theater was a hit with critics and the general public, who loved not just the blend of foreign and American movies, but the New Yorker's decorative touches, whether the mural designed by Jules Feiffer or the wall of black and white photos of Greta Garbo, Gloria Swanson and other stars. One summer night, Swanson herself emerged from a white limousine and headed inside for a showing of her most famous movie, \u201cSunset Boulevard,\u201d while pausing first to look at the gallery of pictures.",
      "\u201cShe lit up on finding herself in that stellar company and promptly checked her aging self on the mirrored wall, still angling for the best profile,\u201d Talbot wrote in her memoir.",
      "From The New Yorker, the Talbots expanded into bookselling, film distribution and additional venues. They opened a short-lived New Yorker bookstore and theaters on Manhattan's Upper East Side and Upper West Side. In 1964, the Talbots were so impressed by a New York Film Festival screening of \u201cBefore the Revolution,\u201d Bernard Bertolucci's debut feature, they launched New Yorker Films so they could release it themselves.",
      "Over the next 40 years, they acquired hundreds of films, from Senegalese director Ousmane Sembene's \u201cBlack Girl\u201d to Federico Fellini's \u201cCity of Women.\u201d Some releases enjoyed commercial success, such as the Wallace Shawn-Andre Gregory collaboration \u201cMy Dinner With Andre\u201d and the Japanese comedy \u201cTampopo.\u201d Others set off broader discussions, notably Claude Lanzmann's epic Holocaust documentary, \u201cShoah,\u201d which the Talbots premiered in the U.S. in 1985.",
      "As the Talbots aged, the competition increased and the appeal of foreign films declined; their business holdings also contracted.

      "The New York Times, The Associated Press and the conservative television network Newsmax are among five outlets on Monday who say they won't sign a new Defense Department document about its new press rules",
      "News organizations including The New York Times, The Associated Press and the conservative Newsmax television network said Monday they will not sign a Defense Department document about its new press rules, making it likely the Trump administration will evict their reporters from the Pentagon.",
      "Those outlets say the policy threatens to punish them for routine news gathering protected by the First Amendment. The Washington Post, The Atlantic and Reuters on Monday also publicly joined the group that says it will not be signing. AP confirmed Monday afternoon that it would not sign.",
      "\"Reuters is bound by its commitment to accurate, impartial and independent news,\" the agency said in a statement. \u201cWe also steadfastly believe in the press protections afforded by the U.S. Constitution, the unrestricted flow of information and journalism that serves the public interest without fear or favor. The Pentagon\u2019s new restrictions erode these fundamental values.\u201d",
      "Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth reacted by posting the Times' statement on X and adding a hand-waving emoji. His team has said that reporters who don't acknowledge the policy in writing by Tuesday must turn in badges admitting them to the Pentagon and clear out their workspaces the next day.",
      "The new rules bar journalist access to large swaths of the Pentagon without an escort and say Hegseth can revoke press access to reporters who ask anyone in the Defense Department for information \u2014 classified or otherwise \u2014 that he has not approved for release.",
      "Newsmax, whose on-air journalists are generally supportive of President Donald Trump\u2019s administration, said that \u201cwe believe the requirements are unnecessary and onerous and hope that the Pentagon will review the matter further.\u201d",
      "Chief Pentagon spokesman Sean Parnell said the rules establish \u201ccommon sense media procedures.\u201d",
      "\u201cThe policy does not ask for them to agree, just to acknowledge that they understand what our policy is,\u201d Parnell said. \u201cThis has caused reporters to have a full blown meltdown, crying victim online. We stand by our policy because it's what's best for our troops and the national security of this country.\u201d",
      "Hegseth also reposted a question from a follower who asked, \u201cIs this because they can't roam the Pentagon freely? Do they believe they deserve unrestricted access to a highly classified military installation under the First Amendment?\u201d",
      "Hegseth answered, \u201cyes.\u201d Reporters say neither of those assertions is true.",
      "Pentagon reporters say signing the statement amounts to admitting that reporting any information that hasn't been government-approved is harming national security. \u201cThat's simply not true,\u201d said David Schulz, director of Yale University's Media Freedom & Information Access Clinic.",

      "Rising tariff costs and other economic factors are forcing retailers to pull back or even delay their plans to hire seasonal workers",
      "NEW YORK -- NEW YORK (AP) \u2014 Uncertainty over the economy and tariffs is forcing retailers to pull back or delay plans to hire seasonal workers who pack orders at distribution centers, serve shoppers at stores and build holiday displays during the most important selling season of the year.",
      "American Christmas LLC, which creates elaborate holiday installations for commercial properties such as New York's Rockefeller Center and Radio City Music Hall, plans to hire 220 temporary workers and is ramping up recruitment nearly two months later than usual, CEO Dan Casterella said. Last year, the company took on 300 people during its busy period.",
      "The main reason? The company wants to offset its tariff bill, which Casterella expects to be as big as $1.5 million this year, more than double last year\u2019s $600,000.",
      "\u201cThe issue is if you overstaff and then you underperform, it\u2019s too late,\" Casterella said. \u201dI think everyone\u2019s more mindful now than ever. \u201d",
      "Job placement firm Challenger, Gray & Christmas forecasts hiring for the last three months of the year will likely fall under 500,000 positions. That's fewer than last year\u2019s 543,000 level and also marks the smallest seasonal gain in 16 years when retailers hired 495,800 temporary workers, the firm said. The average seasonal gain since 2005 has been 653,363 workers, the firm said.",
      "Among other companies cutting holiday payrolls: Radial, which powers deliveries for roughly 120 brands like Lands\u2019 End and Cole Haan and operates 20 fulfillment sites. It plans to hire 6,500 workers, fewer than last year\u2019s 7,000, and is waiting to the last minute to ramp up hiring for some of its clients, chief human resources officer Sabrina Wnorowski, said.",
      "Bath & Body Works, based in Reynoldsburg, Ohio, said it plans to hire 32,000 workers, lower than the 32,700 a year ago.",
      "Among the bright spots: Online behemoth Amazon Inc. said Monday it intends to hire 250,000 full-, part-time and seasonal workers for the crucial shopping period, the same level as a year ago.",
      "\u201cWe saw real strong signals that there\u2019s been a cooling in the labor market, even beyond what our expectations were in the first nine months of the year,\u201d Challenger's senior vice president Andy Challenger said. \u201cWe are having lots of regular conversations with companies about pending layoffs and changes they\u2019re making to their workforce.\u201d",
      "In addition to overall economic uncertainty, Challenger noted companies are using artificial intelligence bots to replace some workers, particularly those working in call centers. And he's also seeing companies hiring workers closer to when they need them.",
      "Meanwhile, the list of companies staying mum about their specific holiday hiring goals keeps growing. Target Corp., UPS and Macy\u2019s are declining to offer figures, a departure from the past. UPS had hired 125,000 seasonal hires last year, while Target announced last year it planned to hire 100,000 workers. Macy's last year said it would hire 31,500 seasonal workers.",
      "Retailers' hiring plans mark the first clues to what\u2019s in store for the U.S. holiday shopping season and come as the U.S. job market has lost momentum this year, partly because Trump\u2019s trade wars have created uncertainty that's paralyzing managers trying to make hiring decisions.",
      "The Labor Department reported in early September that U.S. employers \u2014 companies, government agencies and nonprofits \u2014 added just 22,000 jobs in August, down from 79,000 in July and well below the 80,000 that economists had expected.",
      "The government shutdown, which started Oct. 1 and has delayed the release of economic reports, could worsen the job picture.",
      "In an attempt to exert more pressure on Democratic lawmakers as the government shutdown continues, the White House budget office said Friday that mass firings of federal workers have started.",
      "The firings are happening as hundreds of thousands are already furloughed and still others are being required to report to duty without pay.",

      "Given an economic slowdown, holiday spending growth is expected to be smaller than a year ago, according to several forecasts.",

      "Given the uncertainty, companies increasingly want to hire workers closer to when they need them, experts said.",
      "\u201cIn today's environment, brands are really looking for us to be agile,\u201d Radial's Wnorowski said. \u201cRadial is meeting that need of the customer and the consumer with a more flexible and disciplined approach to hiring.\u201d",
      "So for some of its clients, Radial will now be hiring two weeks before Thanksgiving weekend, the traditional start for the holiday shopping season, instead of four weeks before the kickoff, she said. Radial is also speeding up training of holiday hires due to new technology that's simplifying their tasks. It used to take a couple of days to train a worker, but now it only takes a couple of hours, she said.",
      "Meanwhile, Target said it's again embracing a three-prong approach. It starts first by offering current workers additional hours and then taps into a separate pool of workers\u2014 43,000\u2014 who pick up shifts that work for their schedules. The Minneapolis-based company also hires seasonal workers across its nearly 2,000 stores and more than 60 distribution facilities to meet demand, it said.",
      "For the past few years, Walmart, the nation's largest retailer and the largest private employer, has been offering the extra hours available during the holidays to its workers, a Walmart spokesperson said, noting it's worked well and the feedback from customers and workers has been \u201coverwhelmingly positive.\u201d",
      "The Bentonville, Arkansas-based retailer said there may be some seasonal hiring on a store-by-store basis, but the majority of stores will dole out those hours to current workers.",
      "Waiting until the last minute to hire workers could mean a mad scramble to find talent, but companies say that due to the slowing economy, they don't anticipate having a hard time finding the needed pool.",
      "Meanwhile, the temporary halting of the release of economic reports leaves retailers in the dark about forecasting sales and the workers they need to meet the demand.",
      "\u201cCertainly, for our customers not having access to data will put more of a challenge on their ability to forecast,\u201d Wnorowski of Radial said. \u201cBut we\u2019ll stay very close to them as we go into peak and we\u2019ll adjust as soon we see things changing.\u201d",

      "ANTANANARIVO, Madagascar -- ANTANANARIVO, Madagascar (AP) \u2014 Madagascar President Andry Rajoelina said he has fled the country in fear for his life following a military rebellion but did not announce his resignation in a speech broadcast on social media late Monday from an undisclosed location.",
      "Rajoelina has faced weeks of Gen Z-led anti-government protests, which reached a pivotal point on Saturday when an elite military unit joined the protests and called for the president and other government ministers to step down. That prompted Rajoelina to say that an illegal attempt to seize power was underway in the Indian Ocean island and leave the country.",
      "\"I was forced to find a safe place to protect my life,\" Rajoelina said in his late-night speech, which was also meant to be shown on Madagascar television but was delayed for hours after soldiers attempted to take control of the state broadcaster buildings, according to the president's office.",
      "The speech was ultimately broadcast on the presidency's official Facebook page but not on national TV.",
      "They were Rajoelina's first public comments since the CAPSAT military unit turned against his government in an apparent coup and joined thousands of protesters rallying in a main square in the capital, Antananarivo, over the weekend.",
      "Rajoelina called for dialogue \u201cto find a way out of this situation\u201d and said the constitution should be respected. He did not say how he left Madagascar or where he was, but a report claimed he was flown out of the country on a French military plane.",
      "A French Foreign Ministry spokesperson declined to comment on that report.",
      "Madagascar is a former French colony and Rajoelina reportedly has French citizenship, which has been a source of discontent for some Madagascans for years.",
      "The anti-government protests began on Sept. 25 over chronic water and electricity outages but have snowballed into wider discontent with Rajoelina and his government.",
      "It is the most significant unrest in the island nation of 31 million people off the east coast of Africa since Rajoelina himself first came to power as the leader of a transitional government following a 2009 military-backed coup.",
      "The same elite CAPSAT military unit that rebelled against Rajoelina was prominent in him first coming to power in 2009.",
      "Rajoelina hasn't identified who was behind this attempted coup, but the CAPSAT unit has said it now controls all the armed forces in Madagascar and has appointed a new officer in charge of the military, which was accepted by the defense minister in Rajoelina's absence.",
      "CAPSAT appears to be in a position of authority and also has the backing of other military units, including the gendarmerie security forces.",
      "A commander of CAPSAT, Col. Michael Randrianirina, said the army had \u201cresponded to the people\u2019s calls\u201d but denied there was a coup. Speaking at the country\u2019s military headquarters on Sunday, he told reporters that it was up to the Madagascan people to decide what happens next, and if Rajoelina leaves power and a new election is held.",
      "Randrianirina said his soldiers had decided to stand with protesters and had exchanged gunfire with security forces who were attempting to quell weekend protests, and one of his soldiers was killed. But there was no major fighting on the streets, and soldiers riding on armored vehicles and waving Madagascar flags were cheered by people in Antananarivo.",
      "The U.S. Embassy in Madagascar still advised American citizens to shelter in place because of a \u201chighly volatile and unpredictable\u201d situation. The African Union urged all parties, \u201cboth civilian and military, to exercise calm and restraint.\u201d",

      "STOCKHOLM -- STOCKHOLM (AP) \u2014 Joel Mokyr, Philippe Aghion and Peter Howitt won the Nobel memorial prize in economics Monday for their research into the impact of innovation on economic growth and how new technologies replace older ones, a key economic concept known as \u201ccreative destruction.\u201d",
      "The winners represent contrasting but complementary approaches to economics. Mokyr is an economic historian who delved into long-term trends using historical sources, while Howitt and Aghion relied on mathematics to explain how creative destruction works.",
      "Dutch-born Mokyr, 79, is from Northwestern University; Aghion, 69, from the Coll\u00e8ge de France and the London School of Economics; and Canadian-born Howitt, 79, from Brown University.",
      "Mokyr was still trying to get his morning coffee when he was reached on the phone by an AP reporter, and said he was shocked to win the prize.",
      "\u201cPeople always say this, but in this case I am being truthful \u2014 I had no clue that anything like this was going to happen,\u201d he said.",
      "His students had asked him about the possibility he would win the Nobel, he said. \u201cI told them that I was more likely to be elected Pope than to win the Noel Prize in economics \u2014 and I am Jewish by the way.\u201d",
      "Mokyr will turn 80 next summer but said he has no plans to retire. \u201cThis is the type of job that I dreamed about my entire life,\u201d he said.",
      "Aghion said he was shocked by the honor. \u201cI can\u2019t find the words to express what I feel,\" he said by phone to the press conference in Stockholm. He said he would invest his prize money in his research laboratory.",
      "Asked about current trade wars and protectionism in the world, Aghion said that: \u201cI am not welcoming the protectionist way in the US. That is not good for ... world growth and innovation.\u201d",
      "The winners were credited with better explaining and quantifying \u201ccreative destruction,\u201d a key concept in economics that refers to the process in which beneficial new innovations replace \u2014 and thus destroy \u2014 older technologies and businesses. The concept is usually associated with economist Joseph Schumpeter, who outlined it in his 1942 book \u201cCapitalism, Socialism and Democracy.\u201d",
      "The Nobel committee said Mokyr \u201cdemonstrated that if innovations are to succeed one another in a self-generating process, we not only need to know that something works, but we also need to have scientific explanations for why.\u201d",

      "The play, in real time to the naked eye, might have looked very close to a violation. LeBron James leaped, got his right hand on the ball with a few tenths of the game\u2019s final second remaining and tapped it through the basket to give the Los Angeles Lakers a buzzer-beating win last season.",
      "Referees on the floor called it correctly. Video replay backed up their call, and the Lakers got a victory over the Indiana Pacers.",
      "Turns out, it wasn\u2019t close at all.",
      "The NBA has a relatively new tool called \u201cautomated officiating,\u201d and the robotic eyes that are now tracking just about everything on basketball courts showed that James was nowhere near committing offensive basket interference on that play. It wasn\u2019t needed to decide matters in that case \u2014 again, the humans got it right \u2014 but the NBA is tapping into technology more and more to ensure that plays like those get adjudicated correctly.",
      "\u201cTurns out, computers are really good at this,\u201d said Evan Wasch, an NBA executive vice president overseeing basketball strategy and analytics. \u201cSo, if we can invest in this technology to get more calls right on the objective ones, we do two things.",
      "\u201cOne, the accuracy on those calls, by definition, goes up. But we also free up the human referees to not have to focus on those calls and in turn allow them to focus more closely on the really difficult judgment plays that they\u2019re so adept at and actually increase accuracy there, too. We think there\u2019s what we call double bottom-line benefit to doing this from an accuracy perspective.\u201d",
      "Basketball, of course, is not alone in veering toward higher-tech officiating.",
      "Robot umpires are getting called up to Major League Baseball next season; humans will still make the calls, but teams can challenge ball or strike calls and an automated system will determine if those challenges were successful. Many major tennis tournaments, even Wimbledon, have replaced line judges with electronic line-calling. Soccer has technology to tell referees if a ball fully crossed a goal line or if someone was offsides, calls that in real time might just be guesswork.",
      "It\u2019s important to note that NBA referees are not being replaced. Technology is just helping; instead of six human eyes on a court, it\u2019s now six human eyes and a whole lot of camera lenses that are there to collect as much data as the league can think of.",
      "\u201cLet\u2019s get it right,\u201d Milwaukee coach Doc Rivers said. \u201cAnd let\u2019s get right quicker.\u201d",
      "Those are the goals, the NBA insists. Using technology helps with game flow thanks to shorter review times, helps with the accuracy and also provides transparency in the ability to show fans and players computer-generated images to explain how calls were made.",

And there\u2019s an element of machine learning and artificial intelligence to build those algorithms on top of that to then know what in fact happened from a basketball perspective based on the movement of all those things.\u201d",
      "The technology isn\u2019t limited to calls or non-calls.",
      "Some referees have been wearing earpieces during this preseason as the league tinkers with ways for better communication methods. There\u2019s been talk at the league of sending alerts to smartwatches about decisions on calls. And at summer league this year, there was even a sensor placed inside the ball to help collect data. The sensor weighs about the same as a raisin does. Hundreds of players used the ball, which typically weighs somewhere around 600 grams; nobody noticed that it was about a gram heavier than usual.",
      "In the end, it\u2019s all about making the product better.",

      "The Digital Athlete tool takes video and data from players on all 32 teams from training, practice and games, giving every team information on how hard its players have worked, whether they are at risk for more injuries, as well as helping them track leaguewide trends and benchmarks.",
      "This is the third season all teams have had access to the Digital Athlete portal and medical staff say it has been extremely beneficial, calling it a \u201cone-stop shop\u201d for information that previously was never available at one source.",
      "\u201cBasically, it\u2019s giving you more information to ask yourself better questions to then make better interventions to make your process more efficient,\u201d said Tyler Williams, the vice president of health and performance for the Minnesota Vikings. \u201cAt the end of the day, if you sum sports science into one sentence: How can we measure and assess to make ourselves more effective and efficient.\u201d",
      "Digital Athlete uses sensors in the shoulder pads, cameras and optical tracking to gather information from practice and games for every player on all 32 teams, similar to what NextGen stats does to determine who\u2019s the fastest ball carrier or how much separation a receiver generates on his pass routes.",
      "But the amount of data is far different.",
      "While NetGen Stats generates about 500 million data points in an entire season, Digital Athlete does that on a weekly basis, meaning the only way to parse through all that to glean anything meaningful is through the use of machine learning and AI technology.",
      "\"The sheer volume of data means somebody can\u2019t be sitting there with a clipboard or Excel figuring that out,\u201d Souza said. \u201cThis is absolutely a job for high-performance computers, machine learning, artificial intelligence, all of those things.\u201d",
      "One of the strengths of Digital Athlete is its ability to aggregate the data from all 32 teams and more than 1,500 players to give training staffs and coaches better insights into which players might be more susceptible to getting hurt at a given time and what steps have helped reduce the impact of injuries.",
      "Teams have used it to help determine practice schedules for training camp, how hard they work the players in a given week of a season and what players or position groups have been pushed so hard that dialing back their work might prevent nagging soft-tissue injuries.",

      "\u201cYou want to find a sweet spot that\u2019s not overworked or underprepared for football,\u201d Williams said. \u201cThe more football you play, the better at football you are, but the more fatigued you are. It\u2019s this seesaw balance of tactical and performance. How do we put the players out there to be the best versions of themselves, in the safest manner to have the longevity in the game?\u201d",
      "Williams said much of the data reinforces his prior beliefs but there are times it helps him catch something he might have missed. Having empirical evidence also can help him persuade a player who might need a day off or a coach that he has to lighten the load at practice or sometimes can push his team harder.",
      "The model can tell the training staff how much a player has worked by tracking decelerations, accelerations, total workload on field, change of direction.",
      "While the NFL said overall injuries have been reduced since the introduction of Digital Athlete, Williams said there are many factors involved and he can\u2019t be sure there\u2019s a direct causation.",
      "\u201cEverybody is always going to want the smoking gun that if we do A and pair it with B, we will get C,\u201d Williams said. \u201cIt doesn\u2019t ever work like that. Everyone wants to talk about well, this team\u2019s really good at preventing injuries. Nobody\u2019s preventing injuries. It\u2019s what type of recipe can you put together that mitigates the risk the best. With the more we measure, the more risk we\u2019ll be able to mitigate.\"",
      "The NFL has also used the data gathered from these systems to model the impact of rule changes like the new kickoff that was put in place last season or the crackdown on hip-drop tackles. Digital Athlete was able to simulate 10,000 seasons to help model how the new kickoff rule would impact injuries.",
      "It also has helped inform the league on things like which helmets are best at protecting players from concussions. NFL executive Dawn Aponte said the data helped the league make changes to the helmets for quarterbacks by putting more padding in the back of the helmet.",
      "\u201cLast year we saw the lowest number of concussions in the NFL since we started tracking them,\u201d Aponte said. \u201cThat really is something that we attribute to the fact of being able to look at all of this data and come up with better equipment, better-performing helmets, ways in which we make the helmets and manufacture them based on the types of hits and impacts these players are having.\u201d",
      "Aponte said the initial reaction from some old-timers was to wonder if this was \u201cjunk science.\u201d But now she sees much more acceptance from everyone involved, from coaches to medical staff to players.",
      "\u201cI think this has now been presented as an additive tool,\u201d she said. \u201cIt doesn\u2019t take away from decisions of coaches that are going to do what they feel is best for that specific athlete, or the team at large. But when you\u2019re actually able to point them to certain things and say, hey, this is what we\u2019re seeing. This is causing X times more likely for this player to sustain an injury. When they start losing players, particularly in training camp, they pay more attention.\u201d",

      "That gave Chicago the ball with a little more than three minutes left, and Williams then led the nine-play, 36-yard closing drive that finished with Moody\u2019s fourth field goal of a rainy night. His teammates mobbed him, then raised up off the ground in a mass celebration on the field.",

      "DALLAS -- DALLAS (AP) \u2014 Stars coach Glen Gulutzan has repeatedly said that he wants them to compete more in every aspect. That message was prominent even after Dallas won its first two games on the road against division opponents it also beat in the playoffs last season.",
      "The Stars finished practice Monday, the day before their home opener, with players going through a 1-on-1 drill battling for pucks. Pairs of players were spread out over the ice at the same time, with even the two goaltenders going head-to-head, as one teammate tried to keep the other from the puck.",

      "Dallas' home opener Tuesday night against Minnesota will be Gulutzan's first behind the Stars bench at American Airlines Center since the 2012-13 season finale. That was a couple of weeks before he was fired by then-new general manager Jim Nill, the same GM that brought him back as head coach in July after the Stars finished all three of their seasons under Pete DeBoer with losses in the Western Conference Final.",

      "The Jets were down 5-1 when they scored two short-handed goals on the same Dallas power play in the third period. Two nights later in Colorado, the Stars were outshot 39-22 and bailed out by goalie Jake Oettinger's 35 saves before Mikko Rantanen had the deciding tally in a shootout against his former team.",
      "\u201cIt definitely feels probably feels more like we\u2019re 1-1 than 2-0, but we\u2019re 2-0,\u201d Duchene said. \u201cSo we've got to make sure that we take that mulligan and run with it, and not give it back at some point.\u201d",

      "NEW YORK -- NEW YORK (AP) \u2014 Jonathan Toews reached another milestone in his NHL comeback on Monday, recording his first point in nearly 2 1/2 years.",
      "\u201cI guess when you put it that way it\u2019s nice to get the monkey off your back,\u201d Toews said after he and the Winnipeg Jets beat the New York Islanders 5-2.",
      "Toews helped set up Nino Niederreiter's power-play goal in the Jets' third game of the season and picked up a secondary assist. Toews last got on the scoresheet April 14, 2023, in his final game with Chicago before stepping away from hockey because of health issues.",
      "\u201cFelt like I had a few chances to score, too,\u201d Toews said. \"Hopefully find a way to get that first goal here, too. I think ultimately you just concentrate on making plays, getting around the net, being more confident when the puck comes to you in those dangerous areas. It\u2019s a numbers game. Just got to keep creating and find ways to find the back of the net.\u201d",
      "Toews, now 37, chose his hometown team to make his return after missing the past two seasons because of the effects of chronic immune response syndrome and long COVID. He said he's feeling good physically while getting up to speed.",
      "\u201cStill finding my way a little bit,\" Toews said. \u201cIt takes time to become second-nature. And then you have to find your game. You\u2019ve got to go out there and relax a little bit. The first couple games I felt like I was getting tired late in shifts, because you\u2019re just over-skating everything and over-working yourself. You\u2019d rather be safe than sorry, and sometimes less is more.\u201d",
      "Toews captained Chicago to the Stanley Cup three times, in 2010, \u201813 and \u201915. He won the Conn Smythe Trophy as playoff MVP during the franchise's first championship run since 1961 and in 2016 was chosen as one of the top 100 players in the league's 100-year history.",
      "\u201cHe\u2019s worked hard to come back and feel good, and I think that\u2019s the most important thing is he\u2019s feeling good,\u201d longtime Blackhawks teammate and current Detroit Red Wings winger Patrick Kane said last month. \u201cI\u2019m really happy that he\u2019s back.\u201d",
      "Toews also helped Canada win two Olympic gold medals. Those tournaments and world championships are the only times he and Kane have faced off against each other since breaking in together with the Blackhawks in '07.",
      "Assuming they're healthy, that is set to change on Dec. 31 when Winnipeg visits Detroit. Kane already asked coach Todd McLellan to put him out for the opening faceoff against the former teammate with whom he'll forever be linked.",
      "Asked before camp opened if he thought Toews \u2014 nicknamed \u201cCaptain Serious\u201d for his low-key demeanor \u2014 has mellowed over the years, Kane shook his head.",

      "Toews is proving he still has it, averaging over 17 minutes of ice time as the Jets' second-line center. Coach Scott Arniel used Toews on the penalty kill against the Islanders after forward Cole Koepke got injured blocking a shot, but the staff is trying not to overplay him.",
      "\u201cHe\u2019s getting better every day,\" Arniel said. \"That\u2019s what we talked about, him and I, that it wasn\u2019t going to come in one fell swoop. Every day, he\u2019s gotten better and better and I think he\u2019s recognizing just how to kind of play the game with his hockey smarts.",
      "\u201cHe does veteran things. He does elite things, whether it\u2019s using his body or his stick or his positioning and you\u2019re just seeing him getting more and more comfortable: getting comfortable with our team and how we play but also his linemates and different people, as well.\u201d",
      "The next task is a long shot bid to make Canada's Olympic team one more time in NHL players' return to the Games in Milan in February. He'd also like to help the Jets win the Cup for the first time, and his teammates love having Toews around.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s the leadership he has, the things he\u2019s done in this league, and there\u2019s nothing that he hasn\u2019t done,\u201d Tanner Pearson said. \u201cIt goes a long way. (He) helps us along. He\u2019s very vocal in the room, says the right things.\u201d",

      "Artificial intelligence has been embraced as a productivity booster in fields such as software engineering or medicine. Voice-cloning technology has been used to help speech-impaired people communicate. Humanitarian groups are testing its ability to translate important documents for refugees.",
      "But others question whether its deployment is actually improving their quality of life. Some point out that real harms exist for children turning to AI chatbots for companionship.

      "WASHINGTON -- WASHINGTON (AP) \u2014 For many years, American and Chinese scholars worked shoulder to shoulder on cutting-edge technologies through open research, where findings are freely shared and accessible to all. But that openness, a long-standing practice celebrated for advancing knowledge, is raising alarms among some U.S. lawmakers.",
      "They are worried that China \u2014 now considered the most formidable challenger to American military dominance \u2014 is taking advantage of open research to catch up with the U.S. on military technology and even gain an edge. And they are calling for action.",
      "\u201cFor far too long, our adversaries have exploited American colleges and universities to advance their interests, while risking our national security and innovation,\u201d said Sen. Tom Cotton, an Arkansas Republican and chair of the Senate Intelligence Committee. He has introduced legislation to put new restrictions on federally funded research collaboration with academics at several Chinese institutions that work with the Chinese military, as well as institutions in other countries deemed adversarial to U.S. interests.",
      "The House Select Committee on the Chinese Communist Party makes it a priority to protect American research, having accused Beijing of weaponizing open research by converting it into a \u201cpipeline of foreign talent and military modernization.\u201d",
      "The rising concerns on Capitol Hill threaten to unravel deep, two-generations-old academic ties between the countries even as the world's two largest economies are moving away from each other through tariffs and trade barriers. The relationship has shifted from engagement to competition, if not outright enmity.",
      "\"Foreign adversaries are increasingly exploiting the open and collaborative environment of U.S. academic institutions for their own gain,\u201d said James Cangialosi, director of the National Counterintelligence and Security Center, which in August issued a bulletin urging universities to do more to protect research from foreign meddling.",
      "The House committee released three reports in September alone. They targeted, respectively, Pentagon-funded research involving military-linked Chinese scholars; joint U.S.-China institutes that train STEM talent for China; and visa policies that have brought military-linked Chinese students to Ph.D. programs at American universities. The reports recommend more legislation to protect U.S. research, tighter visa policies to vet Chinese students and scholars and an end to academic partnerships that could be exploited to boost China\u2019s military powers.",
      "More than 500 U.S. universities and institutes have collaborated with Chinese military researchers in recent years, helping Beijing develop advanced technologies with military applications, such as anti-jamming communications and hypersonic vehicles, according to a report by the private U.S. intelligence group Strider Technologies.",
      "Despite efforts in recent years by the U.S. government to set up guardrails to prevent such collaboration from boosting China\u2019s military capabilities, the practice is still prevalent, according to Strider, based in Salt Lake City, Utah.",
      "The report identified nearly 2,500 publications produced in collaboration between U.S. entities and Chinese military-affiliated research institutes in 2024 on STEM research, which includes physics, engineering, material science, computer science, biology, medicine and geology. While the number peaked at more than 3,500 in 2019, before some new restrictive measures came into effect, the level of collaboration remains high, the report said.",
      "This collaboration not only facilitates \u201cpotential illicit knowledge transfer,\u201d but supports China's \u201cstate-directed efforts to recruit top international talent, often to the detriment of U.S. national interests,\u201d the report said.",

      "SACRAMENTO, Calif. -- SACRAMENTO, Calif. (AP) \u2014 California Gov. Gavin Newsom on Monday vetoed landmark legislation that would have restricted children's access to AI chatbots.",
      "The bill would have banned companies from making AI chatbots available to anyone under 18 years old unless the businesses could ensure the technology couldn't engage in sexual conversations or encourage self-harm.",
      "\u201cWhile I strongly support the author's goal of establishing necessary safeguards for the safe use of AI by minors, (the bill) imposes such broad restrictions on the use of conversational AI tools that it may unintentionally lead to a total ban on the use of these products by minors,\u201d Newsom said.",
      "The veto came hours after he signed a law requiring platforms to remind users they are interacting with a chatbot and not a human. The notification would pop up every three hours for users who are minors. Companies will also have to maintain a protocol to prevent self-harm content and refer users to crisis service providers if they expressed suicidal ideation.",
      "Newsom, who has four children under 18, said California has a responsibility to protect kids and teens who are increasingly turning to AI chatbots for everything from help with homework to emotional support and personal advice.",
      "California is among several states that tried this year to address concerns surrounding chatbots used by kids for companionship. Safety concerns around the technology exploded following reports and lawsuits saying chatbots made by Meta, OpenAI and others engaged with young users in highly sexualized conversations and, in some cases, coached them to take their own lives.",
      "The two measures were among a slew of AI bills introduced by California lawmakers this year to rein in the homegrown industry that is rapidly evolving with little oversight. Tech companies and their coalitions, in response, spent at least $2.5 million in the first six months of the session lobbying against the measures, according to advocacy group Tech Oversight California. Tech companies and leaders in recent months also announced they are launching pro-AI super PACs to fight state and federal oversight.",
      "The youth AI chatbot ban would have applied to generative AI systems that simulate \u201chumanlike relationship\u201d with users by retaining their personal information and asking unprompted emotional questions. It would have allowed the state attorney general to seek a civil penalty of $25,000 per violation.",

      "Arctic seals are being pushed closer to extinction by climate change and more than half of bird species around the world are declining under pressure from deforestation and agricultural expansion, according to an annual assessment from the International Union for Conservation of Nature.",
      "One bright spot is green sea turtles, which have recovered substantially thanks to decades of conservation efforts, the IUCN said Friday as it released its latest Red List of Threatened Species.",
      "While many animals are increasingly at risk of disappearing forever, the updated list shows how species can come back from the brink with dedicated effort, Rima Jabado, deputy chair of the IUCN Species Survival Commission, told The Associated Press.",
      "\u201cHope and concern go hand in hand in this work,\u201d Jabado wrote by email. \u201cThe same persistence that brought back the green sea turtle can be mirrored in small, everyday actions \u2014 supporting sustainable choices, backing conservation initiatives, and urging leaders to follow through on their environmental promises.\u201d",
      "The list is updated every year by teams of scientists assessing data on creatures around the world. The scope of the work is enormous and important for science, said Andrew Farnsworth, a visiting scientist at the Cornell Lab of Ornithology who studies bird migration and wasn't involved with the IUCN report.",
      "\u201cEvery time one is done and every time there\u2019s revision, there\u2019s more information, and there\u2019s more ability to answer questions\u201d on species, some of which are still largely a mystery to researchers, Farnsworth said.",
      "Because all the marine mammals native to the Arctic \u2014 seals, whales and polar bears \u2014 rely on the habitat provided by sea ice, they're all at risk as it diminishes because of human-caused climate change, said Kit Kovacs, co-chair of IUCN\u2019s Species Survival Commission Pinniped Specialist Group, which focuses on seals.",
      "The three species highlighted in the latest IUCN report \u2014 harp, hooded and bearded seals \u2014 have been moved up to a designation of greater concern in the latest update, indicating they are increasingly threatened by extinction, Kovacs said.",
      "The same melting of glaciers and sea ice destroying seal habitats also \u201cgenerally will bring escalation in extreme weather events, which are already impacting people around the globe,\u201d wrote Kovacs.",
      "\u201cActing to help seals is acting to help humanity when it comes to climate change,\u201d Kovacs said.",
      "The update also highlighted Madagascar, West Africa and Central America, where Schlegel\u2019s asity, the black-casqued hornbill and the tail-bobbing northern nightingale-wren were all moved to near-threatened status. Those are three specific birds in trouble, but numbers are dropping for around three-fifths of birds globally.",
      "Deforestation of tropical forests is one of a \u201cdepressing litany of threats\u201d to birds, a list that includes agricultural expansion and intensification, competition from invasive species and climate change, said Stuart Butchart, chief scientist at BirdLife International.",
      "\u201cThe fact that 61% of the world\u2019s birds are declining is an alarm bell that we can\u2019t afford to ignore,\u201d Butchart said.",

      "KNOWiNK, a St. Louis-based provider of electronic poll books that allow election officials to confirm voter information, announced the deal and the name change. In a possible nod to a groundless conspiracy theory that linked Dominion to the late Venezuelan dictator Hugo Chavez, the release highlighted that the company would become \u201c100% American-owned.\u201d",
      "The announcement also quotes KNOWiNK's owner, former St. Louis elections director Scott Leiendecker, as vowing to provide \u201celection technology that prioritizes paper-based transparency,\u201d one of the longtime demands of election conspiracy theorists.

      "The release from the new company vows to reintroduce \u201chand-marked paper ballots\u201d and adjust company policies to follow Trump's executive order on voting procedures, which is not in effect because judges have ruled that Trump doesn't have the power to mandate them. Part of the president's order sought to prohibit voting equipment that produces a paper record with \u201ca barcode or quick-response code\u201d \u2014 equipment that is currently in use in hundreds of counties across 19 states.",
      "Denver-based Dominion was at the heart of some of the most fevered conspiracy theories about Trump's loss to Democrat Joe Biden in the 2020 election., Those false allegations sparked a number of defamation lawsuits against conservative-leaning media and the president's allies, including a settlement in 2023 in which Fox News agreed to pay Dominion $787 million and one this year that Newsmax settled for $67 million.",

      "WASHINGTON -- WASHINGTON (AP) \u2014 Federal auto safety regulators have opened yet another investigation into Tesla's so-called full-self driving technology after dozens of incidents in which its vehicles ran red lights or drove on the wrong side of the road, sometimes crashing into other vehicles and injuring people.",
      "The National Highway Traffic Safety Administration said in a filing dated Tuesday that it has 58 incident reports of Tesla vehicles violating traffic safety laws while operating in full self-driving mode. In reports to regulators, many of the Tesla drivers said the cars gave them no warning about the unexpected behavior.",
      "The probe covers 2,882,566 vehicles, essentially all Teslas equipped with full self-driving technology, or FSD, of which there are two types. Level 2 driver-assistance software, or \u201cFull Self-Driving (Supervised),\u201d requires drivers to pay full attention to the road. The company is still testing a version that does not require driver intervention, something that the automaker's owner and CEO Elon Musk has been promising to roll out for years.",
      "The new investigation follows a host of other probes into the FSD feature on Teslas, which has been blamed for several injuries and deaths. Tesla has repeatedly said the system cannot drive itself and human drivers must be ready to intervene at all times.",
      "Tesla is also under investigation by NHTSA for a \u201csummon\u201d technology that allows drivers to tell their cars to drive to their location to pick them up, a feature that has reportedly led to some fender benders in parking lots. A probe into driver-assistance features in 2.4 million Teslas was opened last year after several crashes in fog and other low-visibility conditions, including one in which a pedestrian was killed.",

      "Meteorologists say La Nina has arrived, bringing cooler weather patterns worldwide",
      "WASHINGTON -- WASHINGTON (AP) \u2014 La Nina, the cooler and at times costlier flip side of El Nino, has arrived to warp weather worldwide, meteorologists said Thursday. This natural weather phenomenon often turbocharges the Atlantic hurricane season, but this La Nina may be too weak and fleeting to cause much trouble.",
      "In the United States, La Nina often means more precipitation \u2014 including possible snowstorms \u2014 in northern areas and winter dryness in the South. It can bring heavier rains in Indonesia, the Philippines, parts of Australia, Central America, northern South America and southeastern Africa. It also can mean drought in the Middle East, eastern Argentina, eastern China, Korea and southern Japan, meteorologists said.",
      "A La Nina occurs when certain parts of the Central Pacific Ocean cool by half a degree Celsius (0.9 degrees Fahrenheit) compared to normal. The world had been flirting with one this year and the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration declared Thursday that La Nina conditions have formed. But it's likely to be not very strong and may disappear in the next few months, based on multi-factor computer model forecasts by NOAA and Columbia University, said Michelle L'Heureux, lead scientist on the NOAA team that studies both La Nina and El Nino.",
      "\"There is a three out of four chance it will remain a weak event,\" L'Heureux said in an email. \u201cA weaker event tends to exert less of an influence on the global circulation, so it's possible there will be surprises ahead.\u201d",
      "Surprising already describes the 2025 Atlantic hurricane season, which was forecast to be stronger than normal, but so far is a tad below average in activity. Traditionally, during a La Nina, there's a weakening of the wind shear that hampers hurricane formation and strengthening, allowing more and bigger storms, especially later in the year, such as late October and into early November and in the Caribbean, said University of Albany hurricane expert Brian Tang.",
      "But Brian McNoldy, who studies tropical cyclones, sea level rise and extreme heat at the University of Miami, said he thinks this La Nina is too late and too little to do much.",
      "The conditions, especially wind shear, favor more hurricane activity, yet it's not happening and long-range computer models don't show much forming for the next couple weeks, said Colorado State University hurricane expert Phil Klotzbach.",

      "When Associated Press photographer Lindsey Wasson knocked on the door of Mary E. Brunkow's Seattle home around 4 a.m. local time Monday, it was the scientist's dog who woke up first. Zelda's barking roused Brunkow's husband, Ross Colquhoun.",

      "\"Don\u2019t be ridiculous,\" she told her husband.",
      "But it was true. The trio had, in research dating back two decades, uncovered a key pathway the body uses to keep the immune system in check, called peripheral immune tolerance. Experts called the findings critical to understanding autoimmune diseases such as Type 1 diabetes, rheumatoid arthritis and lupus.",
      "The following day, AP photographers Mark J. Terrill and Damian Dovarganes headed to Santa Barbara, California, to find physicist John Martinis before the sun rose. His wife, Jean, answered the door and told them to come back later: Martinis needed to sleep.",
      "\u201cFor many years, we would stay up on the night the physics award was announced,\u201d she told the photographers. \u201cAt some point we just decided, that's nuts. We'll figure it out if it's happening, but let's just get our sleep.\u201d",
      "She added, laughing: \u201cI was trying to think how I can introduce this. Like, 'Do you think you should plan a trip to Sweden?\"",

(AP) \u2014 The day his young wife and mother died, Theodore Roosevelt wrote in his diary that \u201cthe light has gone out of my life,\u201d and it was only through extended trips to the isolated Dakota Territory in the 1880s that he regained \u201cthe romance\" of living.",
      "A library examining the country\u2019s 26th president will open next summer in the North Dakota landscape remarkably similar to what Roosevelt would have experienced: far from any city and surrounded by rugged hills beneath a vast sky.",
      "The isolation that was so appealing to Roosevelt remains today, and it raises a question.",
      "How many people will visit a museum so distant from the rest of America?",
      "\u201cI think that\u2019s a calculated risk that is being taken, and I actually think it\u2019s a good one,\u201d said Clay Jenkinson, a public humanities scholar and Roosevelt author who believes the area's beauty will help draw visitors.",

      "Library boosters have a $450 million fundraising goal, with $344 million in cash and pledges so far, including from oil executive Harold Hamm and Walmart heir Rob Walton and his wife, Melani. Construction, design and related costs alone are pegged at $276 million. Other costs include millions for developing exhibits and digitizing archives.",
      "The library rises from the flat, grassy top of a butte across a highway from Theodore Roosevelt National Park, which had more than 732,000 visits last year. A path leads onto the library's sloping roof planted with grasses and flowers. Inside, enormous rammed-earth walls of layered colors represent the dramatic Badlands.",

All these big things in the world don't matter if Americans don't have good character to use them and to use them well and correctly,\u201d Hansard said.",
      "Roosevelt's time in Dakota largely ended after cattle losses in the terrible winter of 1886-87. He later said he never would have been president were it not for his time in North Dakota.",
      "Roosevelt is a favorite president of people across the political spectrum, and his use of executive power \u2014 such as conserving public lands and building the Panama Canal \u2014 has shaped the modern presidency.",

      "\u201cWe North Dakotans who justly feel that we created Theodore Roosevelt, that he became the Theodore Roosevelt of American greatness and memory during his time here in North Dakota, we feel that it would be very appropriate to have a presidential library in the heart of the Badlands,\u201d Jenkinson said.",

But he discharged \u201cwithout honor\u201d an entire regiment of 167 Black soldiers without due process, in connection with a shooting in a Texas town. Roosevelt encouraged photographer Edward S.

      "\u201cI really do think Theodore Roosevelt is important for us now because of his ability to appeal to people across the political spectrum and, in our polarized times, maybe bring people together and give them a sense of what it means to be American,\u201d he said.",

      "But opponents say the district was unconstitutionally gerrymandered based on race. If the court eventually rules in favor of the plaintiffs, the decision could have a ripple effect far beyond this one district in Louisiana. It potentially will kick out the last major pillar of the 60-year-old Voting Rights Act and prevent Black voters from challenging political maps that dilute their influence.",
      "Louisiana\u2019s new 6th Congressional District, which roughly traces the Red River, runs across the state in a narrow, diagonal path. It stretches from the state capital, Baton Rouge, in southern Louisiana to Shreveport, in the state's northwest corner.",

      "Fields is aware of criticism about the district's snakelike shape that helped make it majority Black, but he argues that it's contiguous and said all the state's congressional districts are geographically large, representing both urban and rural areas.

      "In 2022, Louisiana\u2019s GOP-dominated Legislature drew congressional boundaries that maintained one Black majority district and five mostly white districts, in a state with a population that is about one-third Black.

      "LOS ANGELES -- LOS ANGELES (AP) \u2014 Some homes were ordered evacuated in wildfire-scarred Los Angeles neighborhoods as Southern California was hit by a rare October storm that was expected to pummel the region with heavy rain, high winds and possible mudslides.",
      "\u201cWe\u2019re very concerned about the weather,\u201d Los Angeles Mayor Karen Bass said during a news conference Monday night, explaining that strike teams, rescue teams and helicopters were all ready to respond.",
      "The evacuations covered about 115 homes mostly in Pacific Palisades and Mandeville Canyon, both struck by a massive inferno in January that killed more than 30 people in all and destroyed over 17,000 homes and buildings in Los Angeles County. Wildfires can leave hillsides without vegetation to hold soil in place, making it easier for the terrain to loosen during storms.",
      "Bass and other officials warned residents across the region to remain alert and stay indoors. The worst was expected to begin early Tuesday and carry through the afternoon, and more than 16,000 had already lost power as of Monday night, according to PowerOutage.us.",
      "The storm could result in up to 4 inches (10.2 centimeters) of rain in some areas, according to the National Weather Service\u2019s Los Angeles office, which described it as a \u201crare and very potent storm system.\u201d",
      "Ariel Cohen, meteorologist in charge of the National Weather Service in Los Angeles, said the storm could even bring a couple of tornadoes, and one major challenge is its unpredictability.",
      "\u201cThe nature of this system is such that we cannot be certain about exactly when and where these impacts will strike, the exact details until right before they occur at the earliest,\u201d he said.",
      "Teams from the Los Angeles Fire Department had started patrolling the area Monday night and a section of state Route 27, beginning at the Pacific Coast Highway, was closed in preparation for the storm, the California Department of Transportation, known as Caltrans, said on social media.",
      "The weather service also warned of high winds that could knock down trees and power lines.",
      "To the north, up to 3 feet (1 meter) of mountain snow was predicted for parts of the Sierra Nevadas.",
      "Heavy rain had already started falling Monday evening across much of Northern California, bringing some urban flooding around the San Francisco Bay Area.",

In the community of Sierra Madre, near the site of the Eaton Fire, water, debris and boulders rushed down the mountain, trapping cars in the mud and damaging several home garages. A portion of the Pacific Coast Highway by Pacific Palisades was submerged in at least 3 feet of sludge, and a swift debris flow swept a Los Angeles Fire Department vehicle into the ocean.",
      "Concerns about post-fire debris flows have been especially high since 2018, when the town of Montecito, up the coast from Los Angeles, was ravaged by mudslides after a downpour hit mountain slopes burned bare by a huge blaze. Hundreds of homes were damaged and 23 people died.",

      "New tariffs on imported kitchen cabinets, bathroom vanities, and upholstered furniture in the U.S. are expected to impact the home improvement industry",
      "NEW YORK -- NEW YORK (AP) \u2014 Cabinet dealers, interior designers and remodeling contractors in the U.S. hope new tariffs on imported kitchen cabinets, bathroom vanities and upholstered wooden furniture that kicked in Tuesday will create more business for them and eventually boost domestic production of those products.",
      "But several small business owners in the home improvement industry say they expect some short-term pains from the import taxes: Clients with projects already on the books might balk at having to pay more for the budget-priced cabinets they selected. Potential customers may postpone kitchen and bathroom renovations until costs \u2014 and the economy \u2014 seem more stable.",
      "\u201cI think the volatility around pricing is damaging to the remodeling industry,\u201d said Allison Harlow, an interior designer in Michigan whose company, Curio Design Studio, creates and builds custom bathrooms and kitchens. \u201cMost people will hear the headline of \u2018Kitchen cabinets will go up 50%\u2019 and might just opt out of even reaching out to our company.\u201d",
      "Despite high mortgage rates having depressed sales of existing homes in recent years, a forecast of remodeling activity by Harvard University's Joint Center for Housing Studies predicts that homeowner spending on improvements and maintenance will remain steady into the middle of 2026.",
      "A proclamation that President Donald Trump signed on Sept. 29 cited national security and foreign trade practices as grounds for imposing the tariffs on certain finished wood products and product components.",
      "Of them, imported vanities and kitchen cabinets incurred the steepest tax rates: 25% until the end of the year and 50% starting on New Year\u2019s Day.",
      "Upholstered chairs, seats and sofas also are subject to a 25% worldwide tariff effective Tuesday, with the rate scheduled to increase to 30% on Jan. 1. In addition, the presidential proclamation put a 10% import tax on softwood timber and lumber, which comes from evergreen trees like pine and cedars.",
      "Softwoods often are used to make furniture and in wood frame construction. Canada is the source of about 85% of the softwood lumber the U.S. imports, or nearly one-quarter of the national supply, according to the National Association of Homebuilders.",
      "Some U.S. trading partners are receiving more favorable treatment when it comes to the furniture and cabinetry tariffs. The tax on U.K. exports was capped at 10%, while the rate for wood products from the European Union and Japan was capped at 15%.",
      "The American Kitchen Cabinet Alliance and other trade and advocacy groups lobbied for tariffs to help offset what they described as a flood of cheap cabinets from countries such as Vietnam, Malaysia, China and elsewhere in the decades since more U.S. furniture manufacturing moved offshore.",
      "U.S.-made products tend to cost more but often are of better quality.",
      "John Lovallo, an analyst at UBS bank, estimates the tariffs on imported cabinets and vanities could add roughly $280 to the average cost of building a single-family home, not enough to sink a project that often carries an overall price tag more than 1,000 times larger than that.",
      "Some business owners say they plan to cover any tariff-related costs for now instead of raising customer prices.",
      "John Dean, founder of Dean Cabinetry in Connecticut, sells cabinets that run the gamut from lower-priced imports to custom models made in his shop. Imported products account for about a third of his sales, but Dean said he does not expect much fallout from the tariffs.",

      "\u201cMy personal perspective is most small- and medium-sized businesses are trying to absorb those costs,\" he said.",
      "The wood product tariffs are likely to have a bigger effect on selection than on prices as importers scale back their orders to focus on bestsellers and products with the highest profit margins, according to Jason Miller, a supply chain management professor at Michigan State University.",
      "\u201cIt will make importers more selective in the varieties they bring in,\u201d Miller said: \u201cSo I think the bigger impact is going to be on the product variety side: Consumers should expect less variety.\u201d",
      "Although the White House said the tariffs were intended to boost domestic production and protect U.S. businesses from predatory trade practices, some cabinet makers say that will be difficult because their supply chains are multinational.",
      "Linq Kitchen, a Los Angeles-area company that designs, builds and installs modern-style kitchen cabinets, uses plywood and melamine panels from Asia and Europe in its projects, co-founder Josh Qian said. A suitable domestic alternative does not exist, he said.",
      "\u201cThe kitchen cabinet industry is highly globalized, and even U.S.-based manufacturers depend on imported materials, hardware, and finishes,\u201d Qian said. \u201cThese tariffs may sound protective, but in reality, they often raise costs across the entire supply chain.\"",
      "At the same time, cabinet companies that don't sell foreign products or rely on imported components look forward to capturing more business.

      "But dry weather in summer and fall can change all that because the lack of water causes leaves to brown and fall more quickly. And that's happening this year, as more than 40% of the country was considered to be in a drought in early October, according to the U.S. Drought Monitor.",
      "That's more than twice the average, said Brad Rippey, a U.S. Department of Agriculture meteorologist and an author of the drought monitor, which is a partnership between the federal government and University of Nebraska-Lincoln. Drought has hit the Northeast and western U.S. especially hard, he said.",
      "It all adds up to fewer leaves to peep.",
      "\u201cI think it might be a little bit of a short and less colorful season, for the most part,\u201d Rippey said. \u201cThe color is just not going to be there this year for some hillsides.\u201d",
      "Despite the gloomy forecast, autumn enthusiasts said it's still a great year to get out and enjoy nature's fireworks display. There is still a lot of color in New England's trees, said Andy Finton, senior conservation ecologist with The Nature Conservancy in Massachusetts.",
      "Climate change is stressing forests with severe weather and heat waves, but autumn in New England remains a beautiful time of year to experience the wonderment of forest ecosystems firsthand, he said.",
      "\u201cOur trees and our forests have an inherent resilience,\u201d Finton said. \u201cThey are still very resilient, and I am constantly surprised at how wonderful the fall season is despite these stresses.\u201d",
      "The tourism business built around leaf peeping has also proven resilient. At the Mills Falls Resort Collection at the Lake in Meredith, New Hampshire, general manager Barbara Beckwith said business is good at the four inns that have 170 rooms. The number of Canadian tourists is down, Beckwith acknowledged, but she said that has been made up with domestic leaf peepers, mostly from New England.",
      "Beckwith said her properties were booked solid on weekends through mid-October and had been for weeks.",
      "\u201cThis year is actually going to be better than last year,\u201d Beckwith said. \u201cLast year was an election and that put a lot of trepidation in people. Now, they are traveling. The uncertainty of the election is over. We all know whose president now and we are traveling.\u201d",

      "Samuel Lee Smithers, 72, is set to receive a lethal injection starting at 6 p.m. at Florida State Prison near Starke under a death warrant signed by Republican Gov. Ron DeSantis. It would be Florida's 14th death sentence carried out in 2025, further extending the state record for executions in a single year.",
      "Since the U.S. Supreme Court restored the death penalty in 1976, the highest previous annual total of Florida executions was eight in 2014. Florida has executed more people than any other state this year, followed by Texas with five.",
      "Smithers was convicted of two counts of first-degree murder and sentenced to death in 1999.",
      "His is one of two executions scheduled for Tuesday evening in the U.S. Lance Shockley, 48, is set to be executed in Missouri for fatally shooting a state trooper more than 20 years ago.",
      "According to court records, Smithers met Christy Cowan and Denise Roach on different dates in May 1996 at a Tampa motel to pay them for sex. At the time, he was doing landscape maintenance on a 27-acre (11-hectare) property that included three ponds in rural Plant City, Florida.",
      "On May 28, 1996, the property owner \u2014 who had met Smithers in church where he was a Baptist deacon \u2014 stopped by to find Smithers cleaning an ax in the carport, which he claimed to be using to trim tree limbs. The property owner noticed a pool of blood in the carport, and Smithers told her that someone must have come by and killed a small animal, according to court records.",
      "The woman contacted law enforcement, and a sheriff\u2019s deputy met her later that day at the property. The blood had been cleaned up, but the deputy noticed drag marks leading to one of the ponds, according to court records. That\u2019s where authorities found the bodies of Cowan and Roach. Both women had been severely beaten, strangled and left in the pond to die.",
      "The Florida Supreme Court denied an appeal from Smithers last week. His attorneys had argued that his age should make him ineligible for execution under the U.S. Constitution's prohibition against cruel and unusual punishment. Although Smithers would be one of the oldest people ever executed in Florida, the justices ruled that the elderly are not categorically exempt from the death penalty.",

      "U.S. lawmakers and national security officials are increasingly alarmed that long-standing research ties between the U.S. and China could give China an advantage when it comes to developing new military technology",
      "WASHINGTON -- WASHINGTON (AP) \u2014 For many years, American and Chinese scholars worked shoulder to shoulder on cutting-edge technologies through open research, where findings are freely shared and accessible to all. But that openness, a long-standing practice celebrated for advancing knowledge, is raising alarms among some U.S. lawmakers.",
      "They are worried that China \u2014 now considered the most formidable challenger to American military dominance \u2014 is taking advantage of open research to catch up with the U.S. on military technology and even gain an edge. And they are calling for action.",
      "\u201cFor far too long, our adversaries have exploited American colleges and universities to advance their interests, while risking our national security and innovation,\u201d said Sen. Tom Cotton, an Arkansas Republican and chair of the Senate Intelligence Committee. He has introduced legislation to put new restrictions on federally funded research collaboration with academics at several Chinese institutions that work with the Chinese military, as well as institutions in other countries deemed adversarial to U.S. interests.",
      "The House Select Committee on the Chinese Communist Party makes it a priority to protect American research, having accused Beijing of weaponizing open research by converting it into a \u201cpipeline of foreign talent and military modernization.\u201d",
      "The rising concerns on Capitol Hill threaten to unravel deep, two-generations-old academic ties between the countries even as the world's two largest economies are moving away from each other through tariffs and trade barriers. The relationship has shifted from engagement to competition, if not outright enmity.",
      "\"Foreign adversaries are increasingly exploiting the open and collaborative environment of U.S. academic institutions for their own gain,\u201d said James Cangialosi, director of the National Counterintelligence and Security Center, which in August issued a bulletin urging universities to do more to protect research from foreign meddling.",
      "The House committee released three reports in September alone. They targeted, respectively, Pentagon-funded research involving military-linked Chinese scholars; joint U.S.-China institutes that train STEM talent for China; and visa policies that have brought military-linked Chinese students to Ph.D. programs at American universities. The reports recommend more legislation to protect U.S. research, tighter visa policies to vet Chinese students and scholars and an end to academic partnerships that could be exploited to boost China\u2019s military powers.",
      "More than 500 U.S. universities and institutes have collaborated with Chinese military researchers in recent years, helping Beijing develop advanced technologies with military applications, such as anti-jamming communications and hypersonic vehicles, according to a report by the private U.S. intelligence group Strider Technologies.",
      "Despite efforts in recent years by the U.S. government to set up guardrails to prevent such collaboration from boosting China\u2019s military capabilities, the practice is still prevalent, according to Strider, based in Salt Lake City, Utah.",
      "The report identified nearly 2,500 publications produced in collaboration between U.S. entities and Chinese military-affiliated research institutes in 2024 on STEM research, which includes physics, engineering, material science, computer science, biology, medicine and geology. While the number peaked at more than 3,500 in 2019, before some new restrictive measures came into effect, the level of collaboration remains high, the report said.",

He had previously taken classes at a Texas community college on and off for years, before driving across the country to answer an online advertisement for a seasonal job harvesting marijuana at a legal cannabis farm in Washington. Jahn appeared directionless and slept in his car for months, the farm's owner Ryan Sanderson previously told the AP.",
      "After returning from Washington because he could not retain a job, Jahn's parents told the FBI he believed he was \u201callergic to plastic\u201d and sought to avoid direct skin contact with the material. The county where he worked in Washington state was one of the sites for the secret Manhattan Project to develop atomic bombs. And they said their son became convinced that while in Washington, he had been \u201cexposed to radiation from a nearby facility and was suffering from radiation sickness.\"",
      "Photographs from the scene of the shooting show a car affixed with a map depicting radioactive fallout in the U.S.",
      "Records suggest his family life was far from harmonious. Jahn\u2019s father had put pressure on his older brother to find a job or join the military after high school, and his mother called the police when the brother failed to show up to a meeting with an Army recruiter to sign enlistment papers in 2014, police records show.",

      "Officials say a North Carolina government initiative is eliminating over $6.5 billion in medical debt for more than 2.5 million residents",
      "RALEIGH, N.C. -- RALEIGH, N.C. (AP) \u2014 More than 2.5 million North Carolina residents are getting over $6.5 billion in medical debt eliminated through a state government effort that offered hospitals extra Medicaid funds from Washington if they gave patients the financial relief and implemented policies to discourage future liabilities.",
      "Democratic Gov. Josh Stein, the state health department secretary and other officials announced Monday results so far from what then-Gov. Roy Cooper unveiled 15 months ago as a first-of-its-kind initiative.",
      "While helping almost one-quarter of North Carolina residents, Stein said the effort has exceeded expectations in giving individuals and families a second chance to succeed financially after medical crises. Officials previously estimated it could help about 2 million people get rid of $4 billion in debt. The debt that had been held by hospitals, and are usually difficult to recover, will be pulled from credit reports, the governor said.",
      "\u201cThis is life-changing news for so many families,\u201d Stein said, adding that recipients on average will have $2,600 erased. \u201cNo one chooses to have a heart attack or get diagnosed with a chronic condition \u2014 you just have to deal with it. Today\u2019s announcement will free people from the financial stress so that they can focus on getting healthy.\u201d Another news conference speaker described patients who avoided services or threatened to halt treatments to prevent debt from accumulating on themselves or their family.",
      "Hospitals that agreed to participate have already alerted many patients to tell them their debt is essentially canceled, state health officials said Monday. And Undue Medical Debt, a national group working on the effort and taking over some hospital liabilities, plans to send 255,000 notices this week to other recipients.",
      "The effort germinated from what's called the Healthcare Access and Stabilization Program, which state legislators approved in 2023 at the same time as expanded Medicaid coverage to working adults who couldn\u2019t otherwise qualify for conventional Medicaid. Hospitals pay assessments to draw down billions of dollars in federal money.",
      "The state Department of Health and Human Services last year proposed that ertain hospitals could receive higher program reimbursement levels to treat Medicaid enrollees if they agreed to medical debt initiatives. The federal Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services signed off on the plan details, and by August 2024 each of the roughly 100 acute-care, rural or university-connected hospitals that qualified decided to participate.",

      "Under rules previously announced, the hospitals had to eliminate medical debt going back to early 2014 for patients who are Medicaid enrollees. They also would later have to eliminate other debt for non-enrollees based on income levels. And the hospitals were directed to discourage debt by doing things like automatically enrolling people in charity care programs or curbing certain debt collection practices. The $6.5 billion figure includes debt relieved directly through the initiative and through hospital policy changes to implement it, Stein's office said.",
      "Other state and local governments have tapped into federal American Rescue Plan funds to help purchase and cancel residents\u2019 debt. Arizona Gov. Katie Hobbs announced in July that $429 million in medical debt had been erased for more than 352,000 state residents.",
      "\u201cNorth Carolina\u2019s approach is completely unique,\" said Jose Penabad, the Undue Medical Debt vice chair. Several states are following North Carolina\u2019s use of Medicaid incentives closely, he added.",
      "North Carolina debt eradication exceeded initial estimates in part because patients outside the population being targeted also had their debt eliminated, Stein said. Hospitals, for example, sometimes have eliminated debt for patients incurred at associated physician practices, said Jonathan Kappler, a state deputy health secretary. More debt will be eliminated in the future, he added.",
      "State health secretary Dr. Dev Sangvai, told reporters the law approved by Congress in July that made cuts and policy changes to Medicaid won\u2019t immediately affect the debt elimination initiative.",
      "Some hospitals were initially hesitant about the debt relief efforts because of strings placed upon higher reimbursements, Cooper said last year. The North Carolina Healthcare Association, which lobbies for nonprofit and for-profit hospitals, said Monday in a statement that it\u2019s concerned \u201crecent and proposed government policies could add financial pressures\u201d that prevent hospitals from expanding programs to help low-income patients.",

OpenAI has also made big deals with Oracle, CoreWeave and other companies developing the data centers where those chips are housed.",
      "Many of the deals rely on circular financing, in which the companies are both investing in OpenAI and supplying the world's most valuable startup with technology, fueling concerns about an AI bubble. OpenAI doesn't yet turn a profit but says its products now have more than 800 million weekly users.",
      "\u201cWhat\u2019s real about this announcement is OpenAI\u2019s intention of having its own custom chips,\u201d said analyst Gil Luria, head of technology research at D.A. Davidson. \u201cThe rest is fantastical. OpenAI has made, at this point, approaching $1 trillion of commitments, and it\u2019s a company that only has $15 billion of revenue.\u201d",
      "OpenAI CEO Sam Altman said the work with Broadcom to develop a custom chip began about 18 months ago. Broadcom also works with other leading AI developers, including tech giants Amazon and Google.",

    "summary": "After 14 years playing NYPD detective Danny Reagan on \"Blue Bloods,\" Donnie Wahlberg now stars in the spinoff series \"Boston Blue,\" patrolling the streets of his own hometown.",
    "story": [
      "For 14 years, Donnie Wahlberg starred as Detective Danny Reagan on the CBS police procedural \"Blue Bloods.\" The hit drama about the Reagans, the fictional first family of the New York Police Department, had a loyal following. \"I was stopped on airplanes, on trains, on the street, at basketball \u2013 you name it. Wherever I was, somebody would tell me they love 'Blue Bloods,'\" said Wahlberg.",
      "Now 56, Wahlberg is sitting at a new family's dinner table, in \"Boston Blue,\" a \"Blue Bloods\" spinoff set in a city the actor knows well.",
      "Wahlberg grew up the eighth of nine kids in the working-class Boston neighborhood of Dorchester. \"We were poor,\" he said. \"There were nine kids, a dog, a cat, and a grandma in the basement, and my mom and dad for a while. There were kids coming and going, running away, being arrested. There were arguments, fights, alcohol. I definitely learned from some of my older siblings that, here's a clear path of what not to do.\"",
      "Wahlberg says he was the family peacemaker. \"I don't like to use the term ('cause I don't wanna insult my other siblings), but one of the adults. My role was to get everyone together and be happy by any means necessary.\"",
      "The discord wasn't just inside the house; 1970s Boston was a cauldron of racial tension. A controversial court-ordered desegregation program bussed students to schools outside their neighborhoods. As a first grader, Wahlberg was sent from Irish-Catholic Dorchester to predominantly Black Roxbury.",
      "He describes it as \"probably the most important thing that ever happened in my life.\"",
      "Because? \"Because I don't know what I would've not been exposed to, had I not been on those buses. In my neighborhood, if I woulda said, 'Yeah, I wanna be a singer one day,' I could think of five kids in the neighborhood who would punch me in the face. And two of them lived in my house!\"",
      "It was after hearing hip hop in the fourth grade that Wahlberg caught the performing bug. \"I would listen to 'Rapper's Delight,' I just would start writing my own raps and making up my own songs,\" he said.",
      "That helped Wahlberg earn an audition, at just 14 years old, with Maurice Starr, the local impresario who'd founded New Edition and was starting a new band. \"Maurice was looking for the equivalent of the Osmonds to the Jacksons,\" he said.",
      "What did his parents think? \"My mom was super supportive,\" he recalled. \"And I said, 'Dad, I'm gonna start this music band.' And he said, 'Well, I tell ya' what: If you ever do make it big, and you come home, and you've changed, I'm gonna kick your ass.'\"",
      "In 1984, Donnie and his younger brother Mark became the first two members of New Kids on the Block. But the family affair was short-lived, as Mark quit. \"He didn't like singing,\" said Donnie. \"He couldn't sing.\u00a0 There's a scene of him as Dirk Diggler in 'Boogie Nights' singing horribly. That's actually better than he sang as a member of New Kids!\"",
      "With four other members in place (including some of Wahlberg's schoolmates), the group struggled at first to find its footing. But by the late 1980s, they appeared to have the right stuff:",
      "While the band was popular, it was far from critics' choice. \"I really struggled with the criticism of the band \u2013 we couldn't sing, we were puppets, we were fake,\" said Wahlberg.",
      "To feel better about himself, Wahlberg focused on writing and producing, not just for the New Kids, but also for his brother Mark. Soon enough they had a #1 hit, \"Good Vibrations.\"",
      "Donnie said, \"Marky Mark and my brother's career and his music was really when I started to get my head screwed on right of how I could really prove myself.\"",
      "Prove himself \u2026 and protect his kid brother. \"My brother was getting in trouble and my mom was like, 'You gotta help your brother and get him out of the streets,'\" said Wahlberg. \"I don't like to wear the Marky Mark and my brother's career as some kind of badge of honor. He worked very hard for his career. But I really did, you know, help him in a big way, and helped myself in a big way in doing that.\"",
      "After the New Kids broke up in 1994, Wahlberg turned to acting, breaking through in \"The Sixth Sense.\" Other roles followed, including \"Band of Brothers\" and \"Boomtown,\" along with reunions for New Kids on the Block, which still keep him busy.",
      "Wahlberg now lives outside Chicago, in a home he shares with his second wife, TV personality Jenny McCarthy.",
      "\"We have very similar upbringings, which really helps,\" said McCarthy. \"I think we're both people-pleasers, which could also be bad if you're not in therapy about it!\"",
      "\"Lotta therapy we've each had, and together,\" said Wahlberg.",
      "\"But we're caretakers, you know, of our family, which I think is something to be proud of,\" McCarthy added.",
      "They may now live in McCarthy's hometown, but Boston is never far from Wahlberg's heart, as evident in his home office, which features mementoes from Bill Belichick, Bill Russell and Larry Bird.",
      "And then there's his new show which he wasn't sure he wanted to do after \"Blue Bloods\"' cancellation. \"I love 'Blue Bloods,'\" he said. \"I fought tooth-and-nail to keep it on the air. And here's an opportunity to keep this character alive. And suddenly, when I started to look at it through that lens, it was like, how do I not do this? If all those millions of 'Blue Bloods' fans don't show up and love it, then I know we put our best foot forward.\"",
      "Between his TV work and concerts, it's a busy life for Donnie Wahlberg. \"People say to me, 'Oh, gosh, when do you sleep?' You want me to complain? Everything I ever wanted, I'm doing it. I wanna work harder, I want to be worthy of it. I want to be worthy of \u2026 the gift that so many people give me of their time. How can I not work my ass off to repay that?\"",
      "But he says he's just doing what he's always done: \"My childhood was spent trying to bring joy and love to a large group of people amidst chaos and confusion and pain. And it's what I do for a living right now.\u00a0 It's what I've grown up to do.\"",

    "story": [
      "Asbury Park is a Jersey beach town with heart, history and harmony, not to mention a voice. Bruce Springsteen's presence can still be felt in his old haunts \u2013 the Stone Pony, the Wonder Bar, Madam Marie's. The town's welcome mat is its storied boardwalk, where we met Jeremy Allen White. \"There's a lot of romance here still, I feel like,\" said White, who was thinking about his own hometown.",
      "\"Do you feel that way a little bit about Brooklyn?\" I asked.",
      "\"I do, yeah. I always feel at home there.\"",
      "Had that Brooklyn boy come out here, say, three years ago, he might have been just another tourist. But not anymore. His turn as the talented but tormented chef on the award-winning FX series \"The Bear\" has made the 34-year-old one of the hottest commodities in Hollywood.",
      "I said, \"Early on, it strikes me that if you were just to read the script, it was kind of just a story about a sandwich shop.\"",
      "\"It was a hard thing to explain,\" said White, \"and it sounded something like that, you know? Yes, this, like, kid, he comes back, he's a chef, and he's, like, opening a sandwich shop. And I saw my friends trying to be nice and say, Oh, that sounds great, you know?\"",
      "He ended up sweeping nearly all of the awards: Emmys, Golden Globes, Screen Actors Guild, Critics Choice. His two young daughters call them his \"trophy winners cups.\" \"They like them, they get a kick out of it, but they also are very honest and there's just like, Why do you get all these things?\" White said.",
      "Back out at the Jersey shore, it's not those past awards that matter. It's the ones that might be coming down the Jersey Turnpike for White's performance as Springsteen himself.",
      "And yes, that really is White's voice. He said, \"If you're gonna do one thing to get it right, you have to perform to the point of exhaustion. 'Cause he continues until he cannot go any longer.",
      "\"Everybody's got their own idea of Bruce Springsteen. And I think at the beginning, I was approaching it like, how am I going to make everybody happy? That's a fool's errand. It's an impossibility.\"",
      "\"Was there a moment that you thought to yourself, Yeah, I got this. I can do this?\" I asked.",
      "\"No, I don't think so,\" White replied. \"There were moments where I found confidence, but I always wanted more, I wanted more time, I wanted to go deeper.\"",
      "Springsteen was aware of White before the film. He had seen and admired the emotional complexity in his work, and that's a well Springsteen knew whoever played him needed to have. White said, \"Bruce has gone on record and said, you know, I have no problem performing for three hours on stage. That's easy for me. I know exactly who I am on stage. You know, it's the other 21 hours that I have trouble with.\"",
      "\"Did you know any of that before you really took a deep dive?\" I asked.",
      "\"I mean, I was familiar enough with his music that, you know, I understood his depth, and I understood, you know, we're dealing with a man who's looked over the edge before, absolutely,\" said White. \"But, no.\"",
      "The film, \"Springsteen: Deliver Me From Nowhere,\" based on the book of the same name, follows the making of the 1982 album \"Nebraska.\" Some say it's Springsteen as his best, but he himself may have actually been at his worst.",
      "In his 2016 autobiography, \"Born to Run,\" he describes an emotional breakdown while at a Texas county fair, not long after \"Nebraska\" was finished:",
      "\"I've just pulled a perfect swan dive into my abyss; my stomach is on rinse cycle, and I'm going down, down, down. I just feel a need to get rooted somewhere, before I drift into ether.\"",
      "White said, \"I asked him, what's that panic about? You know, what is that fear inside of you? And he said, 'I had this moment where I felt like an outsider and observer in my own life.'\"",
      "I asked, \"Have you ever struggled with mental illness yourself?\"",
      "\"Yeah, of course,\" said White. \"When he told me about that, that feeling of being an observer of your own life, that was very familiar to me. I remember when I found acting, there was a lot of like, I think like, chaos and confusion, just a lot going on. I couldn't focus on myself. And I found acting, and I found some peace and I found some focus.\"",
      "White has drawn from that emotional trough as early as he can remember, even during his days of doing crime dramas on TV, when he was looking for certain things \u2013 not just a job. \"Yeah, you know, I was very lucky, I was a kid, so my first agents were kind of confused and upset with me for kind of, like, having a standard for what I would go audition for,\" he said. \"I'd never done anything before when I was 13, and they were like, Just go on the audition, you know?\"",
      "One of those auditions landed him on \"Shameless.\" For 11 seasons he played bad boy, big brother, and brainiac Lip Gallagher.",
      "His unruly hair and blue eyes got him counted among the so-called \"rodent men\" - a term used to describe a few of the most physically desirable things a man can be these days. His Calvin Klein underwear ad certainly helped.",
      "Before we left the shore, we stopped by the Stone Pony, where White tried to re-create on film Springsteen's early glory days.",
      "\"Bruce was there, like he was a lot of days, and he came out, and he kind of introduced me to the audience, so he gave them to me all warmed up,\" White recalled. \"They made me feel like a star for three-and-a-half minutes. And then the first A.D. would say 'Cut,' and they would go silent. And I remembered, I am not Bruce Springsteen, I am just an actor!\"",
      "A guy from Brooklyn playing a guy from Jersey \u2013 they both seem to understand one another, and neither would change a thing.",
      "White said, \"The ride is fun, but I'm, you know, I'm filled up. I just want to work with people I admire and be able to keep doing what I love to do. That's what's important to me.\"",
      "I asked, \"So, if all the fame and success ended after this film, you'd feel like ...?\"",
      "\"Can I still work?\"",
      "\"Yeah.\"",
      "\"Then, yeah, I'm okay. Yeah, yeah, yeah. Absolutely.\"",

    "published": "Sun, 12 Oct 2025 10:00:14 -0400",
    "summary": "The latest white-knuckle thriller by director Kathryn Bigelow imagines the responses within the government and the military when a single ICBM is launched toward the United States.",
    "story": [
      "It's a nightmare we've been living with all our lives. \"I grew up in an era when we had to hide under our desks in the case of an atomic bomb,\" said director Kathryn Bigelow, \"so I suppose I was sort of imprinted early on with the prospect of nuclear war.\"",
      "In Bigelow's new film, \"A House of Dynamite,\" the prospect of nuclear war suddenly becomes an insane reality. It tells of a single missile launched from an unknown location in the Pacific. At first it looks like a test, but it keeps on coming \u2013 with a trajectory estimated to be the continental United States.",
      "With 19 minutes to impact, the president (played by Idris Elba) has to make an impossible decision.",
      "Noah Oppenheim, a former president of NBC News, wrote the script, which dramatizes what he calls \"the insanity that we would expect a single human being with limited preparation to decide in a matter of minutes the fate of all mankind.\"",
      "Bigelow, whose previous movies include \"The Hurt Locker\" (an all-too-real look at the war in Iraq) and \"Zero Dark Thirty\" (about the hunt for Osama Bin Laden) applied her trademark authenticity to the unthinkable. \"It's my responsibility as a filmmaker, if I'm presenting an environment that really exists, to be as authentic as possible,\" she said.",
      "Bigelow says she did not seek cooperation from the Pentagon for the film: \"I felt that we needed to be more independent. But that being said, we had multiple tech advisors who have worked in the Pentagon. They were with me every day we shot.\"",
      "One military consultant was retired Lt. Gen. Dan Karbler. \"Never in a million years would I have thought that I would have been in this position,\" he said.",
      "Karbler nailed his audition when he opened his first Zoom call with Bigelow like this: \"'This is the DDO from the Pentagon convening a strategic conference. This conference is Top Secret. Please bring the President into the conference.' And I stopped there and clicked on my camera and I said, 'Ladies and gentlemen, that's how the worst day of America's history will begin.'\"",
      "I noted, \"That doesn't sound like something you were ad-libbing?\"",
      "\"I was not ad-libbing at all,\" said Karbler. \"That comes from a lot of practice.\"",
      "He was on a movie set, but Karbler took command of the actors just as he once did with the real soldiers at Fort Greeley, Alaska, the front line of defense against an incoming missile. He described those scenes as \"super-realistic.\"",
      "He said. \"I have a son and daughter, and they're both missile defenders. And all I can think about is my own kids and how those actors totally nailed it.\"",
      "In \"A House of Dynamite,\" the missile is tracked as it arcs toward the United States. [In such a scenario, the U.S. would have less than 10 minutes to make the decisions and get interceptors airborne.]",
      "Two interceptors are launched \u2013 the classic \"bullet hitting a bullet.\"",
      "\"That kill vehicle will go and basically run itself into the incoming missile,\" said Karbler. \"That closing velocity can be in excess of 30,000 miles an hour. I think the movie has it pretty accurate when they talk about 61% chance of killing it.\"",
      "The watch officer in the White House Situation Room is played by Rebecca Ferguson. Larry Pfeiffer, who once ran the real White House Situation Room, said, \"This movie is going to give the American moviegoer a chance to feel what it's really like to work in a space like that.",
      "\"There are going to be things that happen in the world that require the immediate attention and action by the President of the United States, and you need to be as perfect as possible,\" he said.",
      "The president is in a motorcade when he's hit with the one crisis he thought he would never face: a missile inbound for Chicago. \"I had one briefing when I was sworn in,\" he says. \"One! And they told me that's the protocol!\"",
      "According to Dan Karbler, a real-world president is likely to be just as unprepared.",
      "Asked whether he had ever done a drill when the real president was involved, he replied, \"No, no, sir.\"",
      "\"So, if it were the real thing, he wouldn't have a lot of practice?\" I asked.",
      "\"I believe the last president to have participated in one of the exercises was President Reagan,\" Karbler said.",
      "So, what does screenwriter Noah Oppenheim want audiences to be thinking, once they've caught their breath? \"I want people to be reminded that, even though the Cold War is long over, the nuclear era is not, and that we live, as the title says, in a house full of dynamite,\" he said.",
      "To which director Kathryn Bigelow added, \"My question is how do we take the dynamite out of the walls \u2026 without tearing down the house?\"",

      "Additional information was not immediately available. Keaton's family, which has not responded to CBS News' inquiries, has not released a statement, and is not planning to today, according to Rath.",

      "Born in 1946 in Los Angeles, Keaton appeared on the stage in the musical \"Hair\" at 22 years old and then in Woody Allen's \"Play It Again, Sam\" in 1968, for which she would receive a Tony nomination.",
      "Keaton said her voice wasn't good enough, and she moved on to acting, making her first film appearance in \"Lovers and Other Strangers\" in 1970, while her many early TV credits include appearances on \"Mannix,\" \"The F.B.I.,\" \"Night Gallery,\" and \"Love, American Style.\"",
      "She starred as Al Pacino's girlfriend Kay in \"The Godfather\" in 1972 and repeated the role in the crime saga's two sequels. The couple became romantically involved after the filming of The Godfather Part II, Keaton said.",
      "Keaton then became well-known for a string of movies she did with famed director Woody Allen \u2014 starting one of the 70s most enduring screen partnerships. She starred in \"Manhattan,\" \"Annie Hall,\" and \"Love and Death, among others.",

      "Keaton never married and didn't start a family until she was 50, saying she was \"a late developer.\"\u00a0 Keaton said if she got married, she would've had to \"compromise too much.\"",
      "She said she wanted to try more adventurous things for herself and also said she was \"afraid of men.\" She said she was always being turned down and overlooked. \"I wasn't marriage material.\"",
      "She adopted two children when she was in her 50s: a daughter, Dexter, and a son, Duke.\u00a0 Keaton said she really enjoyed being a daughter and didn't embrace parenthood until after her father died.",

      "\"[Keaton] was hilarious, a complete original, and completely without guile, or any of the competitiveness one would have expected from such a star,\" Midler, who starred alongside Keaton in \"The First Wives Club,\" wrote on Instagram. \"What you saw was who she was...oh, la, lala!\"",
      "Kimberly Williams-Paisley, who played Keaton's daughter in \"Father of the Bride,\" said working with the legendary actress will always be one of the highlights of her life.",

      "Audiences have been enjoying films at movie theaters for decades, but streaming and expensive\u00a0ticket prices\u00a0have impacted\u00a0moviegoing habits. For the owners and operators of independent theaters, survival means getting creative.",
      "Kevin Smith, the man behind cult classics like \"Clerks\" and \"Mallrats,\" bought a theater in Atlantic Highlands, New Jersey, in 2022. It was the cinema he'd gone to growing up. He renamed it Smodcastle Cinemas, and hoped that even as it reeled from COVID-19 shutdowns, he could rekindle the magic he'd loved as a child.",
      "\"I learned more about myself sitting in this (theater) than I ever did sitting in a classroom or sitting in church or something like that, and it led me to the rest of my life,\" Smith said.",
      "But the reality of operating the movie theater was difficult, even for a celebrity like Smith. They operate as a non-profit, Smith said, because if they functioned as a for-profit business, they \"would die.\" Smith can bring in celebrity guests for Q&A sessions and other events. The theater also hosts an annual film festival.",
      "\"Saving my childhood theater with my friends? Dream come true, worst financial investment I ever made in my life,\" Smith said.",
      "On the opposite coast, film store Vidiots has been bringing new movies to audiences for 40 years. When it opened in Santa Monica, Los Angeles, in 1985, it operated as a traditional video store with an extensive and rare collection of films. In 2023, Vidiots moved to Eagle Rock and expanded into an exhibition space, reviving the historic Eagle Theater.",
      "\"We opened to uncertainty,\" said executive director Maggie MacKay. \"We had no idea if people would come, and they did. And they've been coming ever since.\"",
      "MacKay said Vidiots has become a touchstone for local kids.",
      "\"One of the biggest surprises and the happiest surprises for us and the thing that I think I most wanted to happen here is that young people come here,\" she said. \"Teens, tweens are getting dropped off by their parents. And because this place is affordable and welcoming and nonjudgmental and safe, they are coming here all the time. We've got kids growing up here who call the video store their video store. We have a kid who calls it 'my video store.' That kid has no idea that that is a very unique thing to say in the 2020s.\"",
      "Like Smodcastle, Vidiots operates as a non-profit. That isn't the only path to success for these kinds of theaters, though, as New York City's Metrograph proves. The two-screen theater in Manhattan's Lower East Side shows international and arthouse fare and operates as a for-profit. Business is booming, CEO Christian Grass said, with the theater recently enjoying its best summer on record.",
      "\"People love going to the movies and people love the experience,\" Grass said. The theater also has a bookstore, a magazine, a streaming service, an extravagant concession stand and a swanky bar and restaurant. The establishment has focused on building a sense of community, said Metrograph director of programming Inge de Leeuw, which ensures people keep coming back. MacKay said she's also found people are looking for connection, community and a place they can go.",
      "\"Everybody wants movies in their lives, whether they know it or realize it or not,\" MacKay said. \"To save this thing, you have to make available every point of access for it. You have to make a return to a social experience.\"",
      "While independent theaters are taking different paths to success, they have one thing in common: They want to keep introducing new and classic films to audiences.",
      "\"You want to learn something about somebody, sit in the darkness and watch movies with them,\" Smith said. \"You will learn a lot about a person. You'll find out if they're empathetic. You'll find out what makes them laugh. You'll find out if there's a real human being there, if there's a heart underneath that all, man.\""

    "story": [
      "The shortage of air traffic controllers at some airports during the U.S. government shutdown may have travelers wondering if they have anything to worry about as they board their flight.",
      "Flight delays\u00a0in some parts of the U.S. have ticked up since federal funding lapsed on Oct. 1, even as controllers, Transportation Security Administration officers and other air safety personnel are required to work without pay. Previous shutdowns have resulted in a spike in TSA officers and air traffic controllers calling out sick from work, contributing to delays and flight cancellations.",
      "Despite such inconveniences, aviation experts are confident that air travel remains safe. \"There is no slacking. FAA safety standards don't go on hiatus just because the government is shut down,\" Henry Harteveldt, founder and president of Atmosphere Research Group, a travel advisory firm, told CBS News.",
      "Flight delays due FAA staffing issues are rising because the agency is taking steps to ensure air travel remains as safe as before the shutdown, said Katy Nastro, an air travel expert at trip booking site Going.com.",
      "\"People should feel comfort that traffic is slowing, and ground delays are being put into place as an extra layer of safety, as a precautionary measure,\" she said. \"It shouldn't raise a red flag in any way.\"",
      "The bigger question for travelers, Nastro added, is \"What is your tolerance in terms of facing delays and such?\"",
      "Despite several aircraft collisions and some close calls this year, research shows that airline travel has become safer in recent years. The risk of a fatality from commercial air travel was 1 in every 13.7 million passenger boardings globally from 2018 to 2022, according to a 2024 MIT\u00a0study. That compares with 1 fatality for every in 7.9 million worldwide boardings from 2008 to 2017.",
      "\"We slow it down\"",
      "On Monday, U.S. Transportation Secretary Sean Duffy addressed potential safety concerns during the shutdown on Fox Business News. \"We want to make sure that when you travel you travel safely, and so if we don't have controllers necessary to keep you safe, we slow it down,\" he told the network.",
      "He also alluded to the air traffic control staffing issues and highlighted the wider impact of just a few people not showing up for work. \"If you have a few controllers that call in sick, it will ricochet through the airspace, and we have delays because we are not overstaffed,\" he said, adding that controllers are \"incredibly frustrated\" by the shutdown.",
      "Sheldon Jacobson, an aviation security expert and professor of computer science at the University of Illinois Urbana-Champaign, said flight delays stemming from controller shortages are inconvenient, but do not point to a safety risk for travelers.",
      "\"I don't think safety is being compromised, but service is definitely being compromised,\" Jacobson told CBS News.",
      "Still, Laura Einsetler, a captain for a U.S. airline, worries that a prolonged government shutdown could eventually affect the performance of air traffic controllers as they work without pay.",
      "\"How long can they go until they are distracted with stress about how they're going to pay for rent, their mortgage or put food on table for their families?\" she told CBS News. \"The more they don't get paid, the more distractions there are, and that raises the safety threat from a performance point of view.\"",
      "Trusting pilots",
      "Scott Keyes, founder of Going.com, said some anxiety around hopping on a plane during the government shutdown is understandable. \"A lot of us have an innate fear of being 30,000 feet above the ground, so any justification we can find for why flying might be more risky now is understandable,\" he said.",
      "But he emphasized that pilots have final say on whether it is unsafe to fly for whatever reason, including poor weather, mechanical problems or staffing shortages.",
      "\"They are entrusted to give that last line of authority and say things are safe to fly, and they are in constant communication with air traffic control, monitoring weather systems, and what the entire flying environment looks like,\" Keyes said.",
      "\"The risk of delays and cancellations is higher today than it was before, but I don't think that translates into a higher risk of safety accidents,\" he added.",
      "Harteveldt agreed that airline pilots \u2014 who aren't federal employees \u2014 wouldn't take off given any safety concerns.",
      "\"When a plane departs the gate, it's the airline pilot inspecting the plane and saying, 'Yes, this plane is clear to go.' FAA inspectors, or the shutdown, have nothing to do with that,\" he said.",

    "published": "Tue, 14 Oct 2025 15:59:56 -0400",
    "summary": "Citing the shutdown, the Social Security Administration postponed its announcement of the annual payment bump beneficiaries will receive in 2026.",
    "story": [
      "The Social Security Administration's annual announcement setting next year's cost-of-living adjustment, or COLA, will be delayed because of the\u00a0government shutdown, the agency said.",
      "Each year, the Social Security Administration adjusts benefits for its 75 million recipients based on recent inflation data, which ensures that seniors, disabled Americans and other beneficiaries don't lose purchasing power as prices rise.",
      "Social Security had planned to announce the new COLA on Oct. 15, the same day the Labor Department was scheduled to release September Consumer Price Index data, a key measure of inflation. The COLA is determined by inflation figures for the third quarter, which covers July through September.",
      "With much of the government's economic data on hold until Congress approves federal funding, the Bureau of Labor Statistics now plans to release its latest CPI figures on Oct. 24, about nine days later than planned. The Social Security Administration told CBS News it plans to issue its COLA announcement that same day.",
      "\"The Bureau of Labor Statistics has announced they will issue the September 2025 Consumer Price Index on October 24,\" the Social Security Administration said in an Oct. 14 email. \"The Social Security Administration will use this release to generate and announce the 2026 cost-of-living adjustment on October 24 as well.\"",
      "The new COLA will take effect starting Jan. 1, 2026, without any delays due to the ongoing shutdown, the agency added.",
      "How much of a living adjustment?",
      "According to an estimate published last month by the Senior Citizens League, the annual COLA for 2026 could be around 2.7%, slightly higher than the 2.5% increase beneficiaries\u00a0received\u00a0in 2025.",
      "The League, an advocacy group for older Americans, based its most recent projection on\u00a0August inflation data\u00a0from the Bureau of Labor Statistics. Because the SSA will also include September inflation data in its COLA rate, that number could change when it's announced later this month.",
      "AARP, another advocacy group for older people, expects the 2026 COLA to range from 2.6% to 2.9%. A 2.7% boost in benefits would lift the average monthly payment for retired workers by $54, from $2,008 to $2,062.",
      "Where is inflation now?",
      "The September CPI is forecast to rise to an annual rate of 3.1% up from 2.9% in August, according to economists polled by FactSet.",
      "According to economists, inflation is edging higher due partly to the impact of the Trump administration's tariffs, which have hit imports from across the globe, such as clothing, food, steel and toys. While some businesses stockpiled imported goods earlier this year to avoid raising rising prices, some are now passing the import taxes\u00a0on to their customers.",
      "\"Core goods pressures have started to heat up, marking the beginning of a delayed tariff passthrough,\" RBC economists Michael Reid and Carrie Freestone said in an Oct. 14 report. \"Concerningly, the breadth of inflationary pressures has widened \u2014 45% of CPI basket items are now reporting price growth at or above 3%, compared to roughly two-thirds pre-pandemic.\"",
      "Some retirees could face a financial pinch if prices continues to climb and their 2026 Social Security adjustment fails to keep pace with inflation. The Federal Reserve\u00a0forecasts\u00a0that the Personal Consumption Expenditures price index, its favored measure of inflation, will rise to 3.1% this year before receding to 2.6% in 2026."

    "summary": "Powell said the labor market's outlook hasn't changed much since the central bank's September meeting, when it penciled in two more rate cuts this year.",
    "story": [
      "Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell on Tuesday emphasized that a sharp slowdown in hiring poses a growing risk to the U.S. economy, a sign that the central bank will likely cut its key interest rate twice more this year.",
      "Powell, who spoke today before the National Association of Business Economics in Philadelphia, said that despite the federal government shutdown cutting off official economic data, \"the outlook for employment and inflation does not appear to have changed much since our September meeting,\" when the Fed reduced its key rate for the first time this year.",
      "Fed officials at the September meeting also forecast that the central bank would reduce its rate twice more this year and once in 2026. Lower rates from the Fed could\u00a0reduce borrowing costs for consumer and business loans, making it cheaper for businesses to expand operations and hire new workers, and for Americans to buy houses, autos and other items.",
      "\"Holding rates higher presents risks to the job market. Job creation is below trend given the pace of economic growth,\" noted Scott Helfstein, head of investment strategy at investment firm Global X, in an emailed response to Powell's comments. \"The Fed is still likely to cut rates in October and December, but investors should be prepared for a range of outcomes as Powell is trying to leave all options open.\"",
      "The Fed's next rate decision will be made at its Oct. 29 meeting. Following that, the central bank has one more rate decision meeting scheduled in 2025, set for Dec. 10.",
      "Powell reiterated a message he first delivered after the September meeting, when he signaled that the Fed is slightly more worried about the job market than its other congressional mandate, which is to keep prices stable. Tariffs have lifted the Fed's preferred measure of inflation to 2.9%, he said, but outside the duties there aren't \"broader inflationary pressures\" that will keep prices high.",
      "\"Rising downside risks to employment have shifted our assessment of the balance of risks,\" he said.",
      "Powell also said that the central bank may soon stop shrinking its roughly $6.6 trillion balance sheet. The Fed has been allowing roughly $40 billion of Treasuries and mortgage-backed securities to mature each month without replacing them. The shift could weigh on longer-term Treasury interest rates.",
      "Separately, Powell spent most of his speech defending the Fed's practice of buying longer-term Treasury bonds and mortgage-backed securities in 2020 and 2021, which were intended to lower longer-term interest rates and support the economy during the pandemic.",
      "Yet those purchases have come under a torrent of criticism from Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent, as well as some of the\u00a0candidates\u00a0floated by the Trump administration to replace Powell when his term as Chair ends next May.",
      "Bessent said in an extended critique\u00a0published earlier this year\u00a0that the huge purchases of bonds during the pandemic worsened inequality by boosting the stock market, without providing noticeable benefits to the economy.",
      "Other critics have long argued that the Fed kept implementing the purchases for too long, keeping interest rates low even as inflation began to spike in late 2021. The Fed beginning in 2021 stopped the purchases and then sharply boosted borrowing costs to combat inflation.",
      "\"With the clarity of hindsight, we could have\u2014and perhaps should have\u2014stopped asset purchases sooner,\" Powell said. \"Our real-time decisions were intended to serve as insurance against downside risk.\"",
      "Powell also said the purchases were intended to avoid a breakdown in the market for Treasury securities, which could have sent interest rates much higher."

      "Smucker's alleges that Trader Joe's packaging closely mimics that of the Uncrustables, by prominently featuring the same color blue Smucker's uses in its own branding. On Smucker's packaging, the word \"Uncrustables\" appears in a blue font, the lawsuit notes.",

The COLA is intended to ensure that people's benefits keep up with inflation and that the value of their Social Security income doesn't erode over time.",
      "The SSA announces the annual COLA each October when the Labor Department releases its Consumer Price Index data that month, which this year is scheduled for Oct. 15. But there could be a hitch this year if federal agencies shut down, according to the Labor Department.",
      "\"A delay of the CPI release during October of each year might have an impact on the Cost of Living Adjustment announcement by the Social Security Administration,\" the Labor Department said in issuing a\u00a0contingency plan that covers the impact of a possible shutdown on its operations.",
      "When is the next Social Security payment?",
      "Social Security payments would continue to go out as usual during a shutdown, with recipients of Supplemental Security Income \u2014 a program for low-income and disabled people \u2014 scheduled to receive their next checks on Oct. 1.",
      "Social Security recipients will receive their checks on their usual schedule, which is based on their birth date. Those born between the 1st to 10th of their birth month will receive payment on Oct. 8, while those born between the 11th to 20th days will receive their payment on Oct. 15. People born between the 21st and the last day of their birth month will get their check on Oct. 22.",
      "\"If you're a Social Security recipient, you're going to get your check, and that's obviously a good thing,\" Wayne Winegarden, a senior fellow in business and economics at the Pacific Research Institute, a think tank focused on free trade, told CBS News."

    "link": "https://www.cbsnews.com/news/government-shutdown-mortgage-loans-flood-insurance/",
    "published": "Tue, 14 Oct 2025 10:52:39 -0400",
    "summary": "Some people taking out a home loan and purchasing flood insurance could face delays during the U.S. government shutdown.",
    "story": [
      "Americans worried that the U.S. government shutdown could derail their plans to take out a mortgage or refinance their home loan can breathe easy \u2014 mostly. Housing experts says lenders will continue processing mortgages as usual even if federal agencies close shop, while noting that a shutdown could lead to hitches for borrowers applying for government-backed loans.",
      "\"If you're expecting to close in a week or a month, there could be some slight delay,\" said Jeff Ostrowski, a housing analyst at Bankrate. \"But I think for most people, it's probably going to be a blip more than a real deal killer.\"",
      "The bulk of the mortgage market consists of loans originated by private lenders. But some government agencies have a hand in the process, such as the Federal Housing Administration (FHA) insuring private loans or Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) managing flood insurance policies.",
      "Impact on government-backed loans",
      "Borrowers applying for a conventional mortgage issued by a bank, credit union or other private lender are unlikely to encounter problems if the government closes shop. However, those applying for government-backed loans from agencies like the FHA, Department of Veteran Affairs an Department of Agriculture (USDA) could face minor delays lining up their mortgages, Holden Lewis, a senior writer at NerdWallet, told CBS MoneyWatch in an email.",
      "The National Association of Realtors (NAR) notes in an online\u00a0explainer\u00a0that the FHA will continue to approve most single-family mortgage loans in the event of a shutdown. The VA will also continue to guarantee home loans, but worker furloughs at the agency could lead to processing delays, the group said.",
      "\"It creates a little bit of extra stress and uncertainty, but I haven't seen a shutdown in either of those programs\" when politics led the government to shut it doors in the past, Ostrowski said.",
      "The VA and FHA account for up to a quarter of all mortgage applications, according to\u00a0Redfin. NAR\u00a0advises\u00a0U.S. veterans applying for or refinancing a government-backed loan to check with their lender on how long it will take to complete the process if the government shuts down.",
      "Another segment of the housing market that could feel the impact of the shutdown are people applying for mortgages through the USDA, which issues loans to buyers in eligible towns and rural areas. NAR\u00a0said the USDA will halt issuance of new direct and guaranteed home loans during a shutdown. Pre-scheduled direct\u2011loan closings will also be postponed.",
      "The USDA did not respond to a request for comment. The VA referred CBS News to its shutdown contingency plan, which says the agency will continue issuing \"housing benefits.\"",
      "Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac, the government-sponsored entities that support roughly 70% of the mortgage market, don't rely on federal funding and have continued to operate during past shutdowns. However, they could face bottlenecks if federal agencies close down this week, said Anthony Smith, an applied economist at Realtor.com.",
      "\"They rely on other federal processes like the IRS for tax transcript verifications,\" he said. \"So if the IRS shuts down or significantly cuts back on its transcript services, then Fannie and Freddie might be able to approve a loan, but they can't get the final verification piece.\"",
      "Possible flood insurance delays",
      "People purchasing a house in a flood zone could also face delays during a government shutdown, experts told CBS News. That's because homebuyers applying for a federally backed mortgage in high-risk flood areas are required to get flood insurance. A shutdown could hamper the FEMA-administered National Flood Insurance Program, which underwrites more than 4 million flood insurance policies in the U.S.",
      "\"The government shutdown could complicate your closing because it might be harder to just secure flood insurance,\" Ostrowski told CBS News.",
      "FEMA did not respond to a request for comment.",
      "According to the White House, the flood insurance program cannot sell new or renewal insurance policies during a government shutdown.\"A potential lapse of the NFIP authorization would negatively impact many thousands of Americans who would be left unable to renew/transfer their coverage or to buy the required coverage for their homes,\" a White House official said in an email."

    "story": [
      "Portland, Maine \u2014 Leaf-peeping season has arrived in the Northeast and beyond, but weeks of drought have dulled this year's autumn colors and sent leaves fluttering to the ground earlier than usual.",
      "Soaking in the fall foliage is an annual tradition in the New England states as well as areas such as the Rocky Mountains of Colorado, Great Smoky Mountains of Tennessee and North Carolina and Upper Peninsula of Michigan. As the days shorten and temperatures drop, chlorophyll in leaves breaks down, and they turn to the autumn tones of yellow, orange and red.",
      "But dry weather in summer and fall can change all that because the lack of water causes leaves to brown and fall more quickly. And that's happening this year, as more than 40% of the country was considered to be in a drought in early October, according to the U.S. Drought Monitor.",
      "That's more than twice the average, said Brad Rippey, a U.S. Department of Agriculture meteorologist and an author of the drought monitor, which is a partnership between the federal government and University of Nebraska-Lincoln. Drought has hit the Northeast and western U.S. especially hard, he said.",
      "It all adds up to fewer leaves to peep.",
      "\"I think it might be a little bit of a short and less colorful season, for the most part,\" Rippey said. \"The color is just not going to be there this year for some hillsides.\"",
      "Despite the gloomy forecast, autumn enthusiasts said it's still a great year to get out and enjoy nature's fireworks display. There is still a lot of color in New England's trees, said Andy Finton, senior conservation ecologist with The Nature Conservancy in Massachusetts.",
      "Climate change is stressing forests with severe weather and heat waves, but autumn in New England remains a beautiful time of year to experience the wonderment of forest ecosystems firsthand, he said.",
      "\"Our trees and our forests have an inherent resilience,\" Finton said. \"They are still very resilient, and I am constantly surprised at how wonderful the fall season is despite these stresses.\"",
      "Leaf-peepers undeterred for most part",
      "The tourism business built around leaf peeping has also proven resilient. At the Mills Falls Resort Collection at the Lake in Meredith, New Hampshire, general manager Barbara Beckwith said business is good at the four inns that have 170 rooms. The number of Canadian tourists is down, Beckwith acknowledged, but she said that's been made up with domestic leaf peepers, mostly from New England.",
      "Beckwith said her properties were booked solid on weekends through mid-October and had been for weeks.",
      "\"This year is actually going to be better than last year,\" Beckwith said. \"Last year was an election and that put a lot of trepidation in people. Now, they are traveling. The uncertainty of the election is over. We all know whose president now and we are traveling.\"",
      "Chris Proulx, executive director of the Mount Washington (New Hampshire) Valley Chamber of Commerce, said the decline in Canadian tourists by as much as 80% seen this summer has continued into the fall. But the region is faring better, he said, thanks to an uptick in travelers from other countries and its reputation for having one of the country's best leaf peeping seasons.",
      "\"This is the one season where people make plans in advance to come in addition to travelers from all of the country and all over the world,\" Proulx said.",
      "Leaf peeping was so popular in Colorado's Rocky Mountains this year that one town temporarily closed its highway offramp to alleviate gridlock. The area put on a display of yellow aspen trees dotting the mountains between evergreens, their delicate leaves vibrating in the wind.",
      "But there were signs of a dry spring in the central part of the state, one that is more severe the farther west you travel, said Colorado State Forest Service entomologist Dan West, who spends many fall days in a plane looking at how insect infestations are affecting tree health.",
      "Crispy edges, muted colors, and dropping leaves before they can take on a red or purple hue are all signs of drought stress, West said.",
      "\"The tree is shutting down processes early and we basically just see this muted kind of a show for the fall,\" he said.",
      "In Denver, arborist Michael Sundberg also said he's seeing less vibrant color than usual, and autumn feels like it arrived earlier than usual this year. It's still a beautiful time of year, but there might be less of it to enjoy, he said.",
      "\"It's weird to have color peaking this early in the mountains and then for Denver to be peaking at the same time,\" he said. \"Usually we're later in October before we really go off.\""

      "The U.S. economy could be on the upswing even if tariffs and stubborn inflation continue to weigh on growth, according to a new analysis.",
      "The National Association for Business Economics (NABE) said Monday it expects the nation's gross domestic product \u2014 a measure of the total value of goods and services \u2014 to rise 1.8% in 2025, up from the group's previous estimate in June of 1.3%.",

NABE also expects the economy to expand at a faster pace in 2026, at 1.7%, higher than its June forecast of 1.4%.",
      "The report is the latest signal that economic growth continues to hold up despite rising inflation and a recent slowdown in the labor market. After\u00a0economic activity shrank in the first three months of 2025, growth has accelerated over the rest of the year, EY-Parthenon chief economist Gregory Daco, vice president of NABE, told CBS News. The outlook for business investment in particular has improved, he noted.",
      "The economy could get a further boost this year from the Federal Reserve. NABE expects Fed officials, who trimmed their benchmark rate in September for the first time since 2024, to lower borrowing costs by another quarter of a percentage point by year-end and by a total of three-quarters of percentage point in 2026.",
      "Pain points remain",
      "While the economy has performed better than many experts predicted earlier this year, there are still signs of weakness. Government data indicates that job growth has deteriorated since the first half of the year.",

      "Layoffs are also climbing. Through September, employers this year have cut nearly 950,000 jobs, the largest number of layoffs since 2020, according to outplacement firm Challenger, Gray & Christmas.",
      "Looking ahead, NABE expects the job market to remain fragile. Economists predict average monthly payroll gains of 60,000 for the rest the year, down from the 87,000 the group forecasted in June. From January to August, employers added an average of around 75,000 jobs per month, according to government data.",
      "NABE projects that the nation's unemployment rate,\u00a04.3 % as of August, will rise to 4.5% in 2026.",
      "Another lingering pain point for the economy is inflation, which remains above the Fed's 2% annual target. NABE expects inflation as measured by the Personal Consumption Expenditure index \u2014 the Fed's preferred measure of inflation \u2014 to rise at an annualized rate of 3% over the rest of 2025.",
      "Nearly all of those surveyed \u2014 95% \u2014 expect U.S. tariffs to drive up consumer prices over the rest of the year, according to NABE, although the group now expects stepped-up duties on imports to have less of an inflationary impact than it previously predicted. As a result, inflation is projected to cool to 2.5% by the end of 2026, according to the panel of economists.",
      "A recession is unlikely, according to NABE. Most of the economists polled by the group put the odds of a slump in the next 12 months at between 20% and less than 40%."

    "story": [
      "After nearly a decade spent studying the most famous stock market crash in history, financial journalist Andrew Ross Sorkin warns that the Wall Street of today echoes the market of 1929, when highs preceded a massive slump, leading to the Great Depression.",
      "Artificial intelligence and technology have contributed to a remarkable boom in recent years. But, Sorkin said, today's economy is being propped up by the AI boom, and it's too soon to tell if this is a sugar rush, a short-term and unsustainable boost to the markets. But, Sorkin is positive there's a crash coming.",
      "\"I just can't tell you when, and I can't tell you how deep,\" he said. \"But I can assure you, unfortunately, I wish I wasn't saying this, we will have a crash.\"",
      "The Roaring '20s",
      "Despite a tumble this Friday, stocks on Wall Street have shot up in recent months. Still, some investors are getting weak in the knees, fearing stocks are overheated. Sorkin, author of \"1929: Inside the Greatest Crash in Wall Street History \u2013 and How It Shattered a Nation,\" out Oct. 14, says the U.S. is in a new roaring 20s, the 2020s, with stocks pushing to record highs, just as they were in the 1920s.",
      "Market highs today have him feeling anxious.",
      "\"I'm anxious that we are at prices that may not feel sustainable. And what I don't know is we are either living through some kind of remarkable boom and part of that's artificial intelligence and technology, and all of that, or everything's overpriced,\" he said.",
      "The market of 1929 was fueled by rampant speculation, including by ordinary investors unaware of the mounting risks, and of heavy borrowing. People of modest means were lured by Wall Street bankers and other stock market touts to invest using what was then a newfangled concept: credit. It was called buying on a margin. You only had to put down 10% of the stock price, borrowing the rest from your banker.",
      "Before 1919, most people did not take on credit or debt, influenced by religious views and moral norms against borrowing money, Sorkin said. That changed when General Motors, in 1919, started lending people money so they could afford to buy the company's cars. It changed out Americans shopped.",
      "\"And then the bankers realize what's happening, and they realize that they can lend out money so that more folks can buy stocks. It was all sort of wrapped in the flag of democratizing access,\" Sorkin said. \"And in good times, when the stock is going up, it's like free money. In bad times, you're on the hook, and you're on the hook in a very bad way.\"",
      "Today, it's hundreds of billions being invested in AI, with some investment pros warning of a possible bubble as stocks soar to stratospheric heights even amid significant economic uncertainty, such as Friday's slide after President Trump\u00a0 threatened more China tariffs.",
      "\"I think it's hard to say we're not in a bubble of some sort,\" Sorkin said. \"The question is always when is the bubble going to pop?\"",
      "Protecting consumers in the market",
      "When things got out of control in 1929, frightened traders dumped stocks as investors lost their businesses and homes. In the years since, laws, regulations and agencies have been put in place to protect investors.",
      "Some of those barriers to prevent exploitation are now coming down, Sorkin said. U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission rules have become less stringent and \"the Consumer Protection Bureau practically doesn't exist anymore.\"",
      "\"That's what concerns me,\" Sorkin said. \"It's not that we're going off a cliff tomorrow. It's that there's speculation in the market today, there's an increasing amount of debt in the market today, and all of that's happening against the backdrop of the guardrails coming off.\"",
      "Those guardrails include ones that allow only the wealthy to invest directly in private companies that have fewer regulations, like AI startups before they go public.",
      "In recent decades, people who could invest in private equity and venture capital outperformed investors who did not. Those kinds of assets, generally restricted to wealthy investors, are potentially more rewarding, but also riskier.",
      "\"Public companies, after the SEC was created, were required to have all sorts of disclosure rules so that the public could understand what's going on inside them. Private companies don't have that,\" Sorkin said. \"But historically, the average ordinary American wasn't really allowed to invest in the private companies. But in this flag of democratizing finance, there's a lot of people who want access to that.\"",
      "Some people feel elite investors have better access, while others are unable to get in early on opportunities, Sorkin said. There's been a push by both the Trump administration and the financial sector to open up the market to more people.",
      "But that would also require moving the guardrails designed to protect people.",
      "\"They have protected a lot of people, but some people would say they protected people from getting rich,\" Sorkin said.",
      "Push today for democratizing investing",
      "In his latest annual letter to investors, BlackRock CEO Larry Fink suggested opening retirement 401(k)s to riskier private investments in the name of democratizing investing. He said there were opportunities for investing in AI or data centers.",
      "Right now money managers are precluded from investing in those types of assets in many retirement products, but the Trump administration is in the process of changing that, Fink explained.",
      "The new investment opportunity comes with risk.",
      "\"But everything is risky other than keeping your money in a bank account overnight,\" Fink said.",
      "Fink, who once called bitcoin the domain of money launderers and thieves, also wants to add crypto to investment portfolios.",
      "\"The markets teach you, you have to always relook at your assumptions,\" he said. \"There is a role for crypto in the same way there is a role for gold \u2014 that is, it's an alternative.\"",
      "He sees it, as he does AI, as an opportunity to add diversity to a portfolio.",
      "But Sorkin says some crypto products, like meme coins, can be abused in ways similar to 1929, with speculators sending the value of cryptocurrencies soaring before they come crashing down. Sorkin has his own personal example involving a television appearance with Fink.",
      "\"He makes a joke, I think, about how there should be a Sorkin coin. Well, two hours later, somebody makes a Sorkin coin. And all of a sudden, this Sorkin coin is now worth millions of dollars. And I'm watching it,\" Sorkin said.",
      "The Sorkin coin peaked at $170 million worth of trading in a day.",
      "\"And I think today it does something like $20 or $21 a day,\" Sorkin said."

    "story": [
      "President Trump said Friday he will impose an additional 100% tariff on imports from China starting next month, citing new Chinese export controls \u2014 marking a significant escalation in the U.S.-China trade war.",
      "The new 100% tariffs will add on to any existing import taxes on Chinese goods, the president wrote in a Truth Social post. Tariffs on Chinese imports currently stand at 30%. Mr. Trump said the U.S. will also impose export controls on \"any and all critical software\" starting next month.",
      "The tariffs could be imposed on Nov. 1 or sooner, \"depending on any further actions or changes taken by China,\" Mr. Trump said.",
      "On Sunday, China signaled that it would not back down in the face of the tariff threat and urged the U.S. to resolve differences through negotiations instead of threats.",
      "\"China's stance is consistent,\" the Commerce Ministry said in a statement posted online Sunday. \"We do not want a tariff war but we are not afraid of one.\"",
      "It was China's first official comment on Mr. Trump's threat to jack up the tax on imports from China by Nov. 1 in response to new Chinese restrictions on the export of rare earths, which are vital to a wide range of consumer and military products.",
      "The president's announcement came hours after he threatened steeper duties on China. He pointed to new Chinese rules that require companies to get special approval to export products containing even trace amounts of rare earths from China, even if they were manufactured outside of the country. China mines and processes most of the world's rare earth metals, which are\u00a0critical minerals used to manufacture products including semiconductors, electric car batteries, jet engines and defense weapons.",
      "\"It is impossible to believe that China would have taken such an action, but they have, and the rest is History,\" the president wrote in his Friday message announcing the tariffs, calling China's export controls \"extraordinarily aggressive\" and a \"moral disgrace.\"",
      "Separately on Friday, China\u00a0imposed port fees on U.S.-owned ships that dock in the country, retaliating against what Beijing called a \"discriminatory\" U.S. port fee on Chinese ships.",
      "Major stock indexes fell sharply on Friday after Mr. Trump's initial tariff threat. The S&P 500 dropped 2.7%, the Dow Jones Industrial Average 1.8% and the tech-heavy Nasdaq Composite 3.6%.",
      "The new tariffs and export restrictions could inflame trade talks between China and the Trump administration. Mr. Trump is set to meet with Chinese President Xi Jinping later this month, but the U.S. president said earlier Friday, \"there seems to be no reason\" for the meeting to take place.",
      "China is the United States' third-largest trading partner after Mexico and Canada, with the U.S. importing $438.9 billion worth of Chinese goods and China buying $143.5 billion in U.S. goods last year, according to federal statistics.",
      "But China and the U.S. have had a rocky relationship on trade in recent months. Over the spring, American tariffs on Chinese goods spiked to 145% and Chinese tariffs on U.S. imports soared to 125%, following a set of tit-for-tat hikes that began with import duties unveiled by the Trump administration. In May, the U.S. and China agreed to slash their tariffs to 30% and 10%, respectively, while the two sides pursued a broader trade deal.",
      "The U.S.-China economic relationship has other complexities, too. The Trump administration needs Beijing's permission to close a deal to transfer ownership of TikTok's U.S. operations away from China-based parent company ByteDance. China has also chafed at some of the administration's restrictions on international students."

    "published": "Fri, 10 Oct 2025 19:49:13 -0400",
    "summary": "French President Emmanuel Macron on Friday reappointed Sebastien Lecornu as prime minister, just days after his resignation, to try again to form a government in a bid to end the country's political deadlock.",
    "story": [
      "French President Emmanuel Macron on Friday reappointed S\u00e9bastien Lecornu as prime minister, just days after his resignation, asking him to try again to form a government and produce a budget in a bid to end the country's political deadlock.",
      "Lecornu's reappointment followed days of intense negotiations and came less than a week after he resigned amid infighting in his freshly named government. France is struggling with mounting economic challenges and ballooning debt, and the political crisis is aggravating its troubles and raising alarm across the European Union.",
      "The appointment is widely seen as Macron's last chance to reinvigorate his second term, which runs until 2027. Lacking a majority in the National Assembly to push through his agenda, Macron faces mounting criticism \u2014 including from within his own ranks \u2014 and has little room to maneuver.",
      "Macron's office released a one-sentence statement late Friday night announcing the appointment, one month after the statement issued a month ago when Lecornu was initially named and four days after he resigned.",
      "Lecornu said in a statement on social networks that he accepted the new job offer out of \"duty.\" He said he was given a mission \"to do everything to give France a budget by the end of the year and respond to the daily problems of our compatriots.\"",
      "All those who join his new government will have to renounce ambitions to run for president in 2027, Lecornu said, adding that the new Cabinet will \"incarnate renewal and a diversity of skills.\"",
      "\"We must put an end to this political crisis that exasperates the French, and to this bad instability for France's image and its interests,\" he wrote.",
      "Lecornu abruptly resigned on Monday, only hours after unveiling a new Cabinet that drew opposition from a key coalition partner. The shock resignation prompted calls for Macron to step down or dissolve parliament again, as he did in June 2024. But they remained unanswered, with the president instead announcing on Wednesday that he would name a successor to Lecornu within 48 hours.",
      "Political party leaders met for more than two hours on Friday with Macron, at his request. Some cautioned that another prime minister picked from the ranks of Macron's fragile centrist camp would risk being disavowed by Parliament's powerful lower house, prolonging the crisis.",
      "\"How can one expect that all this will end well?\" said Marine Tondelier, leader of The Ecologists party. \"The impression we get is that the more alone he is, the more rigid he becomes.\"",
      "Over the past year, Macron's successive minority governments have collapsed in quick succession, leaving the European Union's second-largest economy mired in political paralysis as France is faced with a debt crisis. At the end of the first quarter of 2025, France's public debt stood at 3.346 trillion euros ($3.9 trillion), or 114% of gross domestic product.",
      "France's poverty rate also reached 15.4% in 2023, its highest level since records began in 1996, according to the latest data available from the national statistics institute.",
      "The economic and political struggles are worrying financial markets, ratings agencies and the European Commission, which has been pushing France to comply with EU rules limiting debt.",
      "The two biggest opposition parties in the National Assembly \u2014 the far-right National Rally and the far-left France Unbowed party \u2014 weren't invited to the discussions on Friday. The National Rally wants Macron to hold fresh legislative elections, and France Unbowed wants him to resign.",
      "Lecornu argued earlier this week that Macron's centrist bloc, its allies and parts of the opposition could still clump together into a working government. \"There's a majority that can govern,\" he said. \"I feel that a path is still possible. It is difficult.\"",
      "Lecornu will now have to seek compromises to avoid an immediate vote of no confidence and may even be forced to abandon an extremely unpopular pension reform that was one of Macron's signature policies in his second presidential term. Rammed through parliament without a vote in 2023 despite mass protests, it gradually raises the retirement age from 62 to 64. Opposition parties want it to be scrapped.",
      "The political deadlock stems from Macron's shock decision in June 2024 to dissolve the National Assembly. The snap elections produced a hung parliament, with no bloc able to command a majority in the 577-seat chamber. The gridlock has unnerved investors, infuriated voters, and stalled efforts to curb France's spiraling deficit and public debt.",
      "Without stable support, Macron's governments have stumbled from one crisis to the next, collapsing as they sought backing for unpopular spending cuts. Lecornu's resignation, just 14 hours after announcing his Cabinet, underscored the fragility of the president's coalition amid deep political and personal rivalries."

      "The selloff affected a wide range of stocks, from Big Tech companies like Nvidia and Apple to stocks of smaller companies looking to get past uncertainty about tariffs and trade.",
      "\"Investors still think the tit-for-tat between the U.S. and China these last few days is mostly posturing (the consensus view is that tariffs won't go up, and that Trump and Xi will still meet in South Korea), but trade-related risks have certainly risen after being dormant for the last several weeks,\" Wall Street analyst Adam Crisafulli, head of Vital Knowledge, said in a report.",
      "Stocks had been heading for a slight gain in the morning, until Mr. Trump said on his social media platform said he's considering \"a massive increase of tariffs\" on Chinese imports. He's upset at restrictions China has placed on exports of its rare earths, which are materials that are critical for the manufacturing of everything from consumer electronics to jet engines.",
      "\"We have been contacted by other Countries who are extremely angry at this great Trade hostility, which came out of nowhere,\" Trump wrote on Truth Social. \"Our relationship with China over the past six months has been a very good one, thereby making this move on Trade an even more surprising one. I have always felt that they've been lying in wait, and now, as usual, I have been proven right!\"",
      "Mr. Trump also threatened to call off a planned meeting with Chinese President Xi Jinping at the Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation summit in South Korea later this month.",
      "\"Threatening significantly increased tariffs on China is a hallmark of Trump's negotiating tactics, and all it took was a headline to entice investors to take some chips off the table,\" Charlie Ripley, senior investment strategist for Allianz Investment Management, said in an email.",
      "Primed for a slide?",
      "The market may have been primed for a slide. U.S. stocks were already facing criticism that their prices had shot too high following a nearly relentless 35% run for the S&P 500 from a low in April to record heights.",
      "Critics say the market looks overpriced after prices rose much faster than corporate profits. Worries are particularly high about companies in the artificial-intelligence industry, where pessimists are making comparisons to to the 2000 dot-com bubble that ultimately imploded. For stocks to look less expensive, either their prices need to fall, or profits need to rise.",
      "Other factors also weighed on investor sentiment Friday, including the ongoing U.S. government shutdown and fresh data showing that consumers are anxious about the economy.",
      "The University of Michigan's preliminary October sentiment index,\u00a0released\u00a0Friday, shows consumer sentiment fell 0.1% on a monthly basis, from 55.1 points in September to 55. While the drop was nominal, it represents the third consecutive month the confidence measure, which is closely watched by investors, has declined.",
      "\"Pocketbook issues like high prices and weakening job prospects remain at the forefront of consumers' minds,\" Joanne Hsu, director of the Surveys of Consumers at the University of Michigan, said in a statement.",
      "The job market has slowed so much that the Federal Reserve cut its main interest rate last month for the first time this year. Fed officials have penciled in more cuts through next year to give the economy more breathing room. But Chair Jerome Powell has also said they may have to change course if inflation stays high. That's because lower interest rates can push inflation even higher."

      "Vessels owned or operated by American companies or individuals, and ships built in the U.S. or flying the American flag, would be subjected to a 400 yuan ($56) per net ton fee per voyage if they dock in China, China's Ministry of Transport said on Friday.",
      "The fees would be applied on the same ship for a maximum of five voyages each year, and would rise every year until 2028, when it would hike to 1,120 yuan ($157) per net ton, the ministry said. They would take effect on Oct. 14, the same day when the United States is due to start imposing port fees on Chinese vessels.",
      "China's Ministry of Transport said on Friday in a statement that its special fees on American vessels are \"countermeasures\" in response to \"wrongful\" U.S. practices, referring to the planned U.S. port fees on Chinese vessels.",
      "The ministry also slammed the United States' port fees as \"discriminatory\" that would \"severely damage the legitimate interests of China's shipping industry\" and \"seriously undermine\" international economic and trade order.",
      "China has announced a string of trade measures and restrictions before an expected meeting between Trump and Xi on the sidelines of the Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation forum in South Korea that begins at the end of October. On Thursday, Beijing unveiled new curbs on exports of rare earths and related technologies, as well as new restrictions on the export of some lithium battery and related production equipment.",
      "The port fees announced by Beijing on Friday mirrors many aspects of the U.S. port fees on Chinese ships docking in American ports. Under Washington's plans, Chinese-owned or -operated ships will be charged $50 per net ton for each voyage to the U.S., which would then rise by $30 per net ton each year until 2028. Each vessel would be charged no more than five times per year.",
      "China's new port fee is \"not just a symbolic move,\" said Kun Cao, deputy chief executive at consulting firm Reddal. \"It explicitly targets any ship with meaningful U.S. links \u2014 ownership, operation, flag, or build \u2014 and scales steeply with ship size.\"",
      "The \"real bite is on U.S.-owned and operated vessels,\" he said, adding that North America accounts for roughly 5% of the world fleet by beneficial ownership, which is still a meaningful figure although not as huge as compared to Greek, Chinese and Japanese ship owners.",
      "However, the United States has only about 0.1% of global commercial shipbuilding market share in recent years and built fewer than 10 commercial ships last year, Reddal added.",
      "While shipping analysts have said that the U.S. port fees on Chinese vessels would likely have limited impact on trade and freight rates as some shipping companies have been redeploying their fleets to avoid the extra charge, shipping data provider Alphaliner warned last month in a report that the U.S. port fees could still cost up to $3.2 billion next year for the world's top 10 carriers.",

      "In another example, the lawsuit mentions an 8-inch Android tablet for kids listed as \"40% off,\" based on a strikethrough list price of $119.99. However, in the 90 days leading up to the sale, the tablet was being offered for between $50 and $85, with a median price of $72, according to the suit.",
      "That means the supposedly time-limited Prime Day Deal of $72.18 was actually higher than the tablet's $50 price Amazon was selling the item for in April, and about the same price the item usually goes for on Amazon, the lawsuit alleges.",
      "\"But for Amazon's false and misleading representations, Plaintiffs would also have shopped around for better prices in the marketplace or waited to purchase the items at a better price,\" according to the complaint.",
      "The lawyers who brought the suit on behalf of the plaintiffs declined to comment, citing the pending litigation. They filed the proposed class action after Popular Information, a Substack newsletter focused on corporate and political accountability, published a\u00a0story\u00a0calling out some of the allegedly deceptive tactics Amazon used during its Prime Day event.",

      "On its corporate website, the company\u00a0calls the recent four-day sale\u00a0its biggest Prime event to date and states that customers \"saved billions on deals.\" The retailer\u00a0held a separate Prime Day event this week from Oct. 7-8.",
      "Amazon in September\u00a0agreed to pay $2.5 billion to settle federal claims it misled customers into signing up for Prime and made it difficult for them to cancel their membership. As part of the settlement, Amazon must pay a $1 billion civil penalty \u2014 the largest ever in an FTC rule violation case."

      "Travelers planning to fly into or out of U.S. airports could feel the impact of staffing issues, which continue to build as the government shutdown\u00a0reached its 10th day Friday.",
      "The \"national picture today looks a little messy,\" CBS News senior transportation correspondent Kris Van Cleave said from Los Angeles International Airport on Friday.",
      "Across the U.S., roughly 52,000 flights are scheduled ahead of the\u00a0Columbus Day\u00a0weekend, according to the Federal Aviation Administration.",
      "Tasked with keeping travelers safe on the ground and in the air, TSA officers and air traffic controllers are\u00a0deemed essential\u00a0by the government, requiring them\u00a0to keep working\u00a0during the shutdown without immediate pay.",
      "However, an uptick in workers calling out sick has led to sporadic flight delays and cancellations, raising concerns over staffing shortages. The scheduling irregularities come as\u00a0potential weather disruptions\u00a0are expected across the East Coast and in Phoenix.",
      "\"On top of that you have uncertainty that's been injected into basically everyone's travels because of the staffing situation that we're seeing pop up sporadically throughout the air traffic control system,\" Van Cleave said.",
      "Typically, air traffic controller shortages drive about 5% of all flight delays. That figure is currently 53%, Transportation Secretary Sean Duffy told Fox Business.",
      "\"It doesn't look like its a coordinated or targeted sick out per se, but you're seeing more sick calls than you would normally see, and so, everyday, particularly as we get into the afternoon and evening hours, multiple FAA facilities have what are called staffing triggers, where they are short-staffed basically,\" Van Cleave said.",
      "\"And some of those don't result in a whole lot of disruption, and then we've seen others that have been pretty disruptive,\" he added.",
      "For example, at Nashville International Airport in Tennessee on Thursday, roughly 40,000 flyers were inconvenienced by an air traffic controller shortage. \"So it's not nothing, even if the vast majority off air traffic controllers are working,\" Van Cleave said.",
      "Air traffic controllers who violate agency sick leave policies will face repercussions, Secretary Duffy said this week.",
      "The National Air Traffic Controllers Association, the union representing such workers, said in a statement on its\u00a0website\u00a0that it does not condone their members taking actions that would compromise the safety of the nation's airspace. The union also urged workers to keep showing up on the job, despite not being paid on schedule.",
      "\"At this critical juncture, it is more important than ever that we rise to the occasion and continue delivering the consistent, high-level of public service we provide every day,\" tNATCA stated.",
      "Still, the impact of staffing shortages on flights so far has been minimal, reported Van Cleave, but delays could worsen as staffing shortages continue.",
      "\"While delays and cancellations have been within historic norms this week, and the vast majority of fights are leaving on time, the amount of delays because of air traffic controllers staffing is up,\" he said."

      "The probe by the agency's Office of Defects Investigation involves Tesla vehicles equipped with \"FSD (Supervised)\" and \"FSD (Beta)\" versions of the the company's self-driving systems.

      "U.S. regulators have  been investigating Tesla's automated driving systems for more than three years because of dozens of crashes that raised safety concerns, such as\u00a0a Seattle-area Tesla crash\u00a0in 2024 involving Full Self-Driving that killed a motorcyclist.",
      "\"The ultimate question is, 'Does the software work?'\" asked Seth Goldstein, a Morningstar analyst with a \"sell\" rating on Tesla shares stock.",

A new law in California that would hold driverless car companies accountable for traffic violations is set to\u00a0take effect next year.",
      "Tesla is also under investigation by NHTSA for a \"summon\" technology that allows drivers to tell their cars to drive to their location to pick them up, a feature that has reportedly led to some fender benders in parking lots. A probe into driver-assistance features in 2.4 million Teslas was opened last year after several crashes in fog and other low-visibility conditions, including one in which a pedestrian was killed.",

    "summary": "Citing the shutdown, the Social Security Administration postponed its announcement of the annual payment bump beneficiaries will receive in 2026.",
    "story": [
      "The Social Security Administration's annual announcement setting next year's cost-of-living adjustment, or COLA, will be delayed because of the\u00a0government shutdown, the agency said.",
      "Each year, the Social Security Administration adjusts benefits for its 75 million recipients based on recent inflation data, which ensures that seniors, disabled Americans and other beneficiaries don't lose purchasing power as prices rise.",
      "Social Security had planned to announce the new COLA on Oct. 15, the same day the Labor Department was scheduled to release September Consumer Price Index data, a key measure of inflation. The COLA is determined by inflation figures for the third quarter, which covers July through September.",
      "With much of the government's economic data on hold until Congress approves federal funding, the Bureau of Labor Statistics now plans to release its latest CPI figures on Oct. 24, about nine days later than planned. The Social Security Administration told CBS News it plans to issue its COLA announcement that same day.",
      "\"The Bureau of Labor Statistics has announced they will issue the September 2025 Consumer Price Index on October 24,\" the Social Security Administration said in an Oct. 14 email. \"The Social Security Administration will use this release to generate and announce the 2026 cost-of-living adjustment on October 24 as well.\"",
      "The new COLA will take effect starting Jan. 1, 2026, without any delays due to the ongoing shutdown, the agency added.",
      "How much of a living adjustment?",
      "According to an estimate published last month by the Senior Citizens League, the annual COLA for 2026 could be around 2.7%, slightly higher than the 2.5% increase beneficiaries\u00a0received\u00a0in 2025.",
      "The League, an advocacy group for older Americans, based its most recent projection on\u00a0August inflation data\u00a0from the Bureau of Labor Statistics. Because the SSA will also include September inflation data in its COLA rate, that number could change when it's announced later this month.",
      "AARP, another advocacy group for older people, expects the 2026 COLA to range from 2.6% to 2.9%. A 2.7% boost in benefits would lift the average monthly payment for retired workers by $54, from $2,008 to $2,062.",
      "Where is inflation now?",
      "The September CPI is forecast to rise to an annual rate of 3.1% up from 2.9% in August, according to economists polled by FactSet.",
      "According to economists, inflation is edging higher due partly to the impact of the Trump administration's tariffs, which have hit imports from across the globe, such as clothing, food, steel and toys. While some businesses stockpiled imported goods earlier this year to avoid raising rising prices, some are now passing the import taxes\u00a0on to their customers.",
      "\"Core goods pressures have started to heat up, marking the beginning of a delayed tariff passthrough,\" RBC economists Michael Reid and Carrie Freestone said in an Oct. 14 report. \"Concerningly, the breadth of inflationary pressures has widened \u2014 45% of CPI basket items are now reporting price growth at or above 3%, compared to roughly two-thirds pre-pandemic.\"",
      "Some retirees could face a financial pinch if prices continues to climb and their 2026 Social Security adjustment fails to keep pace with inflation. The Federal Reserve\u00a0forecasts\u00a0that the Personal Consumption Expenditures price index, its favored measure of inflation, will rise to 3.1% this year before receding to 2.6% in 2026."

    "story": [
      "Washington \u2014 More than a decade after the Supreme Court gutted a key provision of the Voting Rights Act, and just two years after it declined to unravel another piece of the law, the Supreme Court will convene on Wednesday to hear a legal battle over Louisiana's congressional map that could reverberate throughout the nation.",
      "The consolidated cases, known as Louisiana v. Callais and Robinson v. Callais, could weaken Section 2 of the Voting Rights Act, which has been used to ensure minority voters have the opportunity to elect their preferred candidates.",
      "The legal fight has been before the justices before. In its last term, the Supreme Court weighed whether to leave in place Louisiana's House map that was redrawn in 2024 to include a second majority-Black district. But the high court declined to issue a ruling then and instead set it for reargument in its new term, which started last week.",
      "The Supreme Court then said in August that it would be considering whether state lawmakers' intentional drawing of a second majority-minority district \u2014 done to address a violation of the Voting Rights Act \u2014 runs afoul of the 14th and 15th Amendments of the Constitution.",
      "That new question raises the stakes of the case, as Republicans in Louisiana are urging the high court to prohibit the consideration of race in the drawing of voting lines. A decision in the state's favor could upend Section 2 and deliver another blow to the landmark civil rights law.",
      "\"Section 2 has had a major impact, definitely in the South, but really nationwide on improving political representation opportunities for voters in a lot of different communities of color and all around the country,\" said Kareem Crayton, vice president of the Brennan Center for Justice's office in Washington, D.C. \"A decision that leaves the current understanding of Section 2 in grave doubt opens up unfortunately a lot of chaos throughout the country in a lot of different jurisdictions.\"",
      "Arguments before the high court will play out as GOP lawmakers in several states have engaged in politically motivated efforts to recraft their district lines to help Republicans hold onto their majority in the House. The dispute involving Louisiana's map centers on the use of race in the map-making process, though if the state prevails, it would likely lead to challenges of existing maps that govern voting boundaries for not just Congress, but also local school boards, city councils and state legislatures.",
      "\"This is a gut check for the court: Does it want to sign off on another era where we just retreat from the commitment that was made that we're going to assure we don't live in a country where we subjugate people based on race, particularly in the political space?\" Crayton said.",
      "The fight over Louisiana's map",
      "The protracted dispute over Louisiana's congressional map dates back to 2022, when Republican state lawmakers crafted new House district boundaries to adjust for population changes after the 2020 Census. The original map comprised five majority-White districts and one majority-Black district. Nearly one third of Louisiana's population is Black, according to Census data.",
      "A group of African-American voters challenged those lines as a violation of Section 2 because, they argued, the map diluted Black voting strength. A judge in Baton Rouge agreed and ordered the state to put in place a remedial map with two majority-Black congressional districts.",
      "The new plan adopted by the Louisiana legislature in 2024 reconfigured the state's 6th Congressional District, which state lawmakers said was an effort to bring it into compliance with the Voting Rights Act. The new District 6 has a Black voting-age population of roughly 51% and stretches across the state from Shreveport, in Louisiana's northwest corner, to Baton Rouge, in the southeast. Rep. Cleo Fields, a Democrat who is Black, was elected to represent the district last November.",
      "But after the new map was adopted, a group of 12 self-described \"non-African-American\" voters filed a lawsuit challenging the lines. They alleged that the retooled District 6 was a racial gerrymander that violated the 14th Amendment's Equal Protection Clause.",
      "A divided panel of three judges in Shreveport sided with the voters and found that the state legislature relied too much on race when it crafted the new map.",
      "The case landed before the Supreme Court in its last term, with Louisiana Republicans joining with Black voters and voting rights groups in urging the justices to leave the new congressional map intact. But after the Supreme Court said it would consider the legal fight for a second time \u2014 a rare move \u2014 state GOP lawmakers abandoned their defense of the map.",
      "Instead, state officials are arguing that Louisiana's intentional creation of a second majority-minority district violates the Constitution's 14th and 15th Amendments.",
      "\"Our oath is to the Constitution,\" Louisiana Attorney General Elizabeth Murrill, a Republican, and Solicitor General Benjamin Aguinaga wrote in a filing. \"Our Constitution sees neither black voters nor white voters; it sees only American voters.\"",
      "The Voting Rights Act",
      "The 14th and 15th Amendments were adopted after the Civil War to guarantee Black people equal protection under the law and the right to vote. The amendments gave Congress the power to enact legislation enforcing their protections, and lawmakers exercised that authority when it passed the Voting Rights Act in 1965, which is known as the crown jewel of civil rights legislation.",
      "With bipartisan support, Congress amended Section 2 in 1982 and reauthorized the Voting Rights Act in 2006, when President George W. Bush signed it into law.",
      "\"Section 2 of the Voting Rights Act, which protects against the denial or abridgement of the right to vote on account of race or color, has been a durable centerpiece of the bipartisan legislation passed to make real our shared, national commitment,\" a group of former Republican lawmakers who backed the law and its amendments wrote in a brief. \"It stands as a monument to Congress's ability to act as the Constitution's Framers intended: to identify a national problem, to amass an extensive factual record, and to forge a lasting legislative solution.\"",
      "The Supreme Court will rehear the Louisiana case just over two years after it upheld Section 2 and reaffirmed the framework for proving vote dilution under the Voting Rights Act, which was set out in a 1986 ruling. The high court split 5-4 in that 2023 case, which involved a challenge to Alabama's congressional map, with Chief Justice John Roberts and Justice Brett Kavanaugh joining the three liberal justices in the majority.",
      "While the high court rejected the chance to weaken Section 2, Kavanaugh suggested that there must be an end-point for the use of race-based remedies.",
      "\"[T]he authority to conduct race-based redistricting cannot extend indefinitely into the future,\" Kavanaugh wrote in a concurring opinion. \"But Alabama did not raise that temporal argument in this Court, and I therefore would not consider it at this time.\"",
      "Both Kavanaugh and Roberts will be key as the Supreme Court weighs the constitutionality of race-based map-making. The two justices were also in the majority when the high court outlawed the use of race as a factor in college admissions, a decision that came down in the same term as the Alabama voting rights dispute.",
      "\"If in college admissions, if the quest for diversity \u2014 and by diversity, we really mean racial diversity, how someone looks, what their race is, the color of their skin, the shape of their eyes, the texture of their hair. It's how they look, it's who they are \u2014 that's not a compelling governmental interest to treat people differently, it must follow that treating people differently in order to create election districts that are geographically based will not stand,\" said Edward Blum, the president of Students for Fair Admissions, which successfully challenged affirmative action in higher education. Blum is also the director of Project on Fair Representation, a nonprofit organization that opposes racial and ethnic classifications.",
      "Roberts has long denounced racial classifications. In 2006, shortly after he joined the court, the chief justice wrote in a concurring opinion that \"it is a sordid business, this divvying us up by race.\" He also authored the majority opinion 12 years ago that dismantled Section 5 of the Voting Rights Act, writing, \"our country has changed, and while any racial discrimination in voting is too much, Congress must ensure that the legislation it passes to remedy that problem speaks to current conditions.\"",
      "\"America is no longer in the 1960s,\" Blum said. \"We have moved on, and to base election districts with the primary predicate being to create a racial district, a district in which a racial minority has the opportunity to elect a candidate of choice, that has now been the energy behind creating districts that no longer keep neighborhoods and civic associations and towns and communities together for the purposes of representation.\"",
      "It's unclear how far the Supreme Court will go in a decision, though several conservative justices have endorsed the vision of a \"colorblind Constitution.\" Louisiana officials and the voters who challenged the redrawn map have argued that any consideration of race when drawing voting lines is unconstitutional.",
      "The Trump administration is backing Louisiana in the case and has urged the Supreme Court to tighten the standards for proving unlawful vote dilution. The framework in place since 1986 requires plaintiffs to show racial polarization in voting, in addition to other preconditions.",
      "\"Too often, Section 2 is deployed as a form of electoral race-based affirmative action to undo a State's constitutional pursuit of political ends. That misuse of Section 2 is unconstitutional,\" Solicitor General D. John Sauer wrote in a filing.",
      "But voting rights groups fear that changing the longstanding framework for how courts evaluate potential violations of Section 2 would undercut its aim of ensuring equal opportunities for minority voters.",
      "\"Because it's so difficult to prove and is one of the only avenues that minority voters have to challenge these districts, it could have potential reverberations to make it incredibly difficult for minority voters to achieve equal representation through district lines,\" Sara Rohani, a lawyer with the NAACP Legal Defense Fund, told CBS News.",
      "A decision from the Supreme Court is expected by the end of June or early July."

      "Naomi Pyle isn't sure if her husband's next paycheck from the U.S. Navy will arrive on Wednesday.",
      "The couple, who are raising two children in San Diego, California, were already struggling to make ends meet before the government shut down on October 1, Pyle, 30, told CBS News, adding that the family won't be able to cover all of their expenses if he doesn't get paid on time.",
      "President Trump last week sought to allay such concerns, writing on social media that his administration had\u00a0\"identified funds\"\u00a0to pay military service members and directing Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth to ensure paychecks go out on Oct. 15 as scheduled. While the president did not offer additional details, the White House Office of Management and Budget told the Associated Press it would use Pentagon research and development funds to pay troops \"in the event the funding lapse continues past October 15th.\"",
      "Still, for some service member families, even the possibility of missing a single paycheck is fueling concerns about money.",
      "\"We were already living paycheck to paycheck, so this doesn't help at all,\" Pyle told CBS News. \"We have to pick and choose which bills to pay now.\"",
      "The family's income comes to around $1,200 a week, Pyle said. Between the cost of rent, utilities, her 10-year-old daughter's braces and therapy for her 5-year-old autistic son, paring the family's budget is difficult, she noted. Even her own dental care is on hold for now.",
      "\"It shouldn't take everything out of us just to survive,\" Pyle said. \"We sacrifice so much \u2014 and having to deal with being a special needs parent alone \u2014 it's all piling up, and this was one more thing that didn't need to happen.\"",
      "The White House referred a request for comment to the Office of Management and Budget. The agency did not respond to CBS News' inquiry.",
      "\"Extremely stressful\"",
      "One in 6 active-duty military families was already experiencing food insecurity before the shutdown, according to a 2023\u00a0survey\u00a0from Blue Star Families. The advocacy group also\u00a0found\u00a0that roughly a third of service member households have less than $3,000 in savings, leaving them vulnerable to financial emergencies.",
      "As a result, missing a paycheck can have \"a devastating impact,\" said Kathy Roth-Douquet, CEO of Blue Star Families.",
      "\"There is a financial impact first and foremost, but there is a big psychological impact, too, that is in some ways equally damaging,\" she added.",
      "Roth-Douquet noted that many military families depend on a single income because frequent relocations make it difficult for spouses to find steady work. \"That means families depend on one paycheck, and if they don't get it, it can tip them into disaster,\" she said.",
      "Misty Gilbert, whose husband is a member of the U.S. Coast Guard, earns a second income as a sixth-grade special education teacher in San Diego. Her salary isn't substantial enough to support her family even for a short period of time, she told CBS News.",
      "\"My check alone would barely cover the rent,\" she said.",
      "She added that the uncertainty caused by the government shutdown has been \"extremely stressful\" for her family.",
      "\"The holidays are coming up \u2014 a lot of times we like to travel to see family. I don't know if that would be an option if this continues, if we can justify those types of expenses of seeing family and holiday expenses in general,\" she said."

      "In rejecting Jones' case, the Supreme Court leaves in place the record-breaking sum he was ordered to pay after he was\u00a0found liable\u00a0in 2021 for damages in lawsuits brought by the families of children who were killed in the massacre. Jones had separately asked the high court last week for emergency relief while it considered whether to take up his case. Justice Sonia Sotomayor denied Jones' bid to halt the judgment later Monday, likely because the Supreme Court denied his appeal.",
      "A six-person Connecticut jury\u00a0had agreed\u00a0in 2022 that Jones should pay $965 million to the families as compensation for defamation, infliction of emotional distress and violations of a Connecticut law. A state court judge\u00a0added on another $474 million in punitive damages one month later.",
      "Jones' lawyers told the Supreme Court in a filing that the more than $1.4 billion \"can never be paid.\"",
      "Jones, the founder of InfoWars, had repeatedly claimed that the 2012 shooting that killed 20 students and six teachers was staged by \"crisis actors\" as part of a plan to enact more restrictive gun laws. Relatives of the victims and an FBI agent testified during the defamation trial that they were threatened and harassed by Jones' listeners who believed his lies about the massacre.",
      "In a different lawsuit brought in Texas, Jones testified that the shooting was \"100% real.\" Still, he had slammed the Connecticut trial as a \"kangaroo court\" and argued it violated his free speech rights.",
      "Jones and Free Speech Systems, his company, filed for bankruptcy protection after he was ordered to pay the families, and the satirical publication The Onion tried to\u00a0purchase InfoWars\u00a0at a bankruptcy auction for an undisclosed price last year. But a bankruptcy judge\u00a0rejected the sale\u00a0of InfoWars to The Onion last December. Jones' lawyers said there is still an effort underway for InfoWars to be sold."

      "The Federal Aviation Administration and Transportation Security Administration define most of their employees as essential, requiring them to work even if the government closes and workers at other federal agencies are furloughed. That means airport screeners, air traffic controllers, federal air marshals, safety inspectors and other workers with the two agencies are expected to continue showing up on the job \u2014 without pay \u2014 even as lawmakers failed this week to strike a deal on federal funding.",
      "But things could get messy if a shutdown dragged on and government employees suddenly deprived of a paycheck come under financial pressure, Caleb Harmon-Marshall, a former TSA officer, told CBS News.",
      "\"TSA officers are expected to continue to report to work. But in the past, if a shutdown exceeds two weeks, officers start to get frantic, and they stop going to work,\" he said, adding that agency personnel may call in sick and even seek other job opportunities if a shutdown persists.",
      "Any ensuing labor shortages can lead to snarled lines at airport security. For example, roughly 10% of TSA workers called in sick during the 34-day government shutdown that started in December 2018 and extended into 2019, driving up screening times at major airports across the country.",
      "\"So if officers decide not to come to work, there is less personnel manning checkpoints, and wait times can potentially get longer,\" Harmon-Marshall said.",

      "Social Security benefits are covered by mandatory spending, which means that the funding for the program has already been approved by Congress without an expiration date. As a result, Social Security recipients, including retirees, disabled Americans and the dependents of deceased workers, wouldn't see an interruption in their monthly payments if the government shuts down.",
      "However, other Social Security services could be impacted by a shutdown, according to the National Committee to Preserve Social Security & Medicare. The Social Security Administration's working budget requires approval from Congress. The Senate on Tuesday voted down two competing Democratic and Republican proposals to keep the government funded past Sept. 30.",

      "Washington \u2014\u00a0The U.S. government shut down Wednesday, October 1, after President Trump and congressional Republicans at odds with Democrats over the path forward were unable to\u00a0avert a lapse in federal funding.",
      "Mr. Trump had said Sunday that a shutdown was likely, rejecting Democrats' push for Congress to permanently extend enhanced tax credits for Americans enrolled in health insurance through the Affordable Care Act, which expire at the end of the year. The president met with Senate Majority Leader John Thune, Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer, House Speaker Mike Johnson and House Minority Leader Hakeem Jeffries at the White House on Monday, but the meeting ended without a breakthrough.",
      "The president canceled an earlier meeting with Republican and Democratic congressional leaders set for last week, calling their demands \"unserious and ridiculous,\" and House Republicans left Washington, D.C., earlier this month after approving a stopgap measure that kept the government funded until Nov. 21. But the proposal failed to garner the necessary support in the Senate. A Democrat-backed counter-plan to extend funding through Oct. 31, which included other party priorities, also failed in the upper chamber.",
      "In an effort to ramp up the pressure on Democrats to go along with Republicans' funding measure, the White House budget office sent a memo to federal agencies last week telling them to consider reduction-in-force plans for mass layoffs of certain federal workers during a shutdown.",
      "A government shutdown occurs when Congress fails to approve funding for federal agencies. Before 1980, agencies largely continued operating during a lapse in funding with the assumption that Congress would act quickly. But in 1980 and 1981, then-Attorney General Benjamin Civiletti authored a series of legal opinions that found government agencies didn't have the authority to continue running during a gap in funding.",
      "President Ronald Reagan oversaw eight shutdowns during his time in office, the longest of which lasted three days. There were three funding gaps between 1990 and 1995, then none until 2013.",
      "The threat of a government shutdown has become more frequent over the past decade, as Congress has found itself engaged in funding fights that are ultimately resolved with massive, yearlong spending packages. The most recent lapse in government funding, in late 2018, caused $3 billion in permanent losses, according to the Congressional Budget Office. Hundreds of thousands of federal workers are expected to feel the impacts of a shutdown if a deal isn't reached this time around.",

The bill differed from a version passed in the House and funding technically lapsed at midnight, but since Nov. 21 fell on a Saturday, the effects weren't felt immediately. House and Senate negotiators worked over the weekend to reconcile their differences and passed identical bills on Sunday.",
      "On Monday, Reagan vetoed the plan and ordered the government to shut down, placing 250,000 federal employees on furlough. Later in the day, lawmakers passed a stopgap bill to keep the government funded and allow more time for talks on a deal. Workers returned the next day.",

    "summary": "The shutdown raises questions about what it would mean for lawmakers themselves \u2014 and their paychecks.",
    "story": [
      "Washington \u2014 Hundreds of thousands of federal employees could soon go without pay or face potential layoffs, since a government shutdown went into effect on Wednesday, Oct. 1.",
      "The GOP-controlled House passed a bill earlier this month to extend government funding until Nov. 21, but the bill stalled in the Senate, where Democratic votes were needed to advance it. Democrats wanted an extension of health care subsidies under the Affordable Care Act, which Republicans opposed. With hours left before the midnight deadline Wednesday, the Senate voted down two competing Democratic and Republican proposals to keep the government funded.",
      "Under the shutdown, federal employees in critical positions are required to stay on the job. Many others will be forced to stay home. Both groups will have their paychecks delayed until Congress approves more spending. Most federal contractors might not get paid at all.",
      "Here's what the shutdown means for lawmakers themselves \u2014 and their paychecks.",
      "Will members of Congress get paid during a government shutdown?",
      "The short answer is yes. Lawmakers will continue to draw a paycheck.",
      "The reason is because of how their pay is treated under the Constitution and federal law. Article I, Section 6 of the Constitution states: \"The Senators and Representatives shall receive a Compensation for their Services, to be ascertained by Law, and paid out of the Treasury of the United States.\" Lawmakers' pay has been funded by a permanent appropriation since 1983, according to a recent Congressional Research Service\u00a0report, meaning funding for their pay doesn't need to be renewed annually.",
      "Members' pay rate is set by a process established by federal law, and the 27th Amendment says any law to change their pay can't take effect until after the next congressional election.",
      "Most members earn a salary of $174,000 per year, a rate that has not changed since 2009. The speaker of the House earns $223,500, while the president pro tempore of the Senate and the party leaders in both chambers make $193,400.",
      "When it comes to other federal entities, the law that governs how they must act during a lapse in funding is known as the Antideficiency Act. In short, it says that federal agencies generally can't spend more money than Congress has approved. This means many agencies must furlough employees \u2014 that is, tell them to stay home \u2014 if they haven't received funding.",
      "There are some exceptions. Some programs, like Social Security and Medicare, have permanent funding, and benefits continue to be paid out as normal. Employees whose jobs are necessary to protect life and property must also stay on the job. Those whose roles are authorized by other laws can keep working, as can officials with constitutional responsibilities.",
      "When it comes to congressional staffers, each office determines which employees are deemed essential and thus allowed to keep working during a shutdown. Most are expected to keep all or nearly all of their employees on board, though the staffers won't be paid until more funding is approved.",
      "Does the president get paid during a shutdown?",
      "Yes. The Constitution prohibits reducing the president's salary while in office, \"thus effectively guaranteeing the president of compensation regardless of any shutdown action,\" according to a Congressional Research Service report from 2018.",
      "The president earns $400,000 annually, an amount set by Congress in 2001.",
      "His aides and staffers, however, are subject to the furlough requirements under the Antideficiency Act, meaning those in nonessential positions could be told to stay home until Congress authorizes more funding. In past shutdowns, presidents have furloughed many executive branch employees to increase pressure on Congress to take action.",
      "Do other federal employees get paid during a shutdown?",
      "Federal employees, whether they remain on the job or are furloughed, won't get paid while the government is shut down.",
      "They also face the risk of being permanently laid off if there's a shutdown, according to a memo from the Office of Budget and Management. The reduction-in-force notices would be in addition to any furlough notices, according to a memo sent to the agencies.",
      "\"Programs that did not benefit from an infusion of mandatory appropriations will bear the brunt of a shutdown, and we must continue our planning efforts in the event Democrats decide to shut down the government,\" the memo said.",
      "Those who still have jobs will receive back pay once funding is restored to their agency. In prior shutdowns, Congress had to approve back pay for employees, but a 2019 law made it mandatory. Contractors \u2014 who were responsible for carrying out about $755 billion worth of government work in the last fiscal year \u2014 are not guaranteed back pay.",
      "Each agency determines which positions are considered essential and which are not. The Office of Management and Budget has directed agencies to notify employees no later than two business days before a lapse in funding about their work and pay status.",
      "Some members of Congress have previously pointed out the apparent hypocrisy of lawmakers continuing to be paid while other federal employees miss out on their checks. In 2023, members of both parties offered different proposals that would prevent Congress from getting paid during shutdowns, but none attracted widespread support, and the 27th Amendment forbids any immediate change."

    "story": [
      "Washington \u2014 Much of the federal government shut down Wednesday, October 1, after Congress failed to reach a deal to approve new funding.",
      "Republicans had proposed extending government funding at current levels until Nov. 21 to allow for members to continue working on full-year appropriations bills. Democrats made a counteroffer to keep the government open through October, but attached health care provisions and restrictions on President Trump's ability to withhold funding, both of which are nonstarters with most Republicans.",
      "The two sides were dug in on their positions, increasing the chances of a shutdown beginning Wednesday. Congressional leaders met with President Trump at the White House on Monday to search for a path forward, but walked away in the same position.",
      "A government shutdown occurs when Congress fails to pass funding for some or all agencies, which can't spend money that hasn't been approved by lawmakers. There have been 14 shutdowns since 1980, with the most recent coming in 2018. That shutdown lasted 34 days.",
      "Here's what to know about what happens during the government shutdown:",
      "What is a government shutdown?",
      "Most federal government agencies are funded annually by a dozen appropriations bills that need to be passed by Congress and signed by the president before the start of the new fiscal year on Oct. 1. These are often grouped together into one large piece of legislation known as an \"omnibus\" bill to speed up the process when Congress inevitably needs to pass a number of them at the last minute.",
      "If the funding deadline passes without Congress authorizing more spending, the government must fully or partially shut down, depending on which agencies are already funded. Ahead of this year's deadline, none of the 12 appropriations bills have been enacted. Some agencies got an infusion of money in the Republican-passed \"one big, beautiful bill\" earlier this year, meaning certain programs and functions in some departments will remain funded in the event of a shutdown, chiefly the Defense Department and Department of Homeland Security.",
      "Lawmakers regularly buy themselves more time to finish spending bills by passing what's known as a continuing resolution, which temporarily extends current funding levels to keep agencies functioning while they work to reach an agreement on new spending.",
      "The Constitution says the Treasury Department cannot spend money without a law authorizing it. Under a statute known as the Antideficiency Act, agencies are required to cease operations \u2014 with certain exceptions \u2014 in the absence of funding authorized by Congress. The act, a version of which first passed in 1870, with several significant updates since, also prohibits the government from entering into financial obligations without congressional sign-off.",
      "\"Treasury cannot pay out any money if there's not a law providing for who gets the money,\" said Matt Glassman, a senior fellow at the Government Affairs Institute at Georgetown University. \"If those annual bills expire, then there is no law appropriating money for certain functions.\"",
      "What happens during a government shutdown, and who is affected?",
      "In a shutdown, the federal government must stop all non-essential functions until funding is approved by Congress and signed into law, except for programs that are funded by other means, like fees or other legislation. Each agency determines what work is essential and what is not. Members of Congress make that determination for their own staff, as well.",
      "\"No money can come out of Treasury whether you're essential or not essential. But who can keep working and incur obligations, even when there are no appropriations \u2014 there are three exceptions,\" Glassman said.",
      "Those exceptions are defined by the Antideficiency Act. They allow the government to fund operations to protect life and property, and keep officials involved in the constitutional process on the job, like the president, his staff and members of Congress.",
      "All active-duty military members, many federal law enforcement officers and employees at federally funded hospitals are considered essential, along with air traffic controllers and Transportation Security Administration officers. Each agency determines which of its employees can stay on the job.",
      "In a step that differs from previous shutdowns, the Office of Budget and Management last week told federal agencies to consider permanent mass layoffs for programs or projects that have discretionary funding that runs out on Oct. 1 or that don't have any alternative sources of funding. The reduction-in-force notices would be in addition to any furlough notices issued during a shutdown, according to a memo sent to the agencies.",
      "\"Programs that did not benefit from an infusion of mandatory appropriations will bear the brunt of a shutdown, and we must continue our planning efforts in the event Democrats decide to shut down the government,\" the memo said.",
      "Whether employees are essential or not, if their pay is dependent on annual appropriations, they won't get paid during a shutdown.",
      "Essential employees continue to work during the shutdown, but don't get paid until funding is restored to their agency. Employees in nonessential positions are typically furloughed until the government is funded again, although that could look different this time if there are widespread layoffs. Under a 2019 law, furloughed employees are guaranteed to receive back pay once the shutdown is over.",
      "A Senate report published in 2019 found that government shutdowns in 2013, 2018 and 2019 cost taxpayers nearly $4 billion, including at least $3.7 billion in back pay to furloughed workers who were not permitted to work.",
      "What is open and closed during a shutdown?",
      "Entitlement programs like Social Security, Medicare and Medicaid continue to function during a shutdown because benefit payments are funded through permanent appropriations that don't require renewal. Entitlement payments keep going out, but the working budgets of the agencies that oversee the programs require approval by Congress. That means staff could be furloughed, causing delays in enrolling new beneficiaries or other service interruptions.",
      "\"Any type of interaction you're having at a customer service level with the federal government could definitely be affected,\" Glassman said.",
      "For example, travel plans could be disrupted if air traffic control and airport security, who are essential workers, do not show up to work in protest for not being paid immediately. Many national parks stayed open during the last shutdown in 2018 and 2019, but understaffing led to vandalism and cuts in visitor services. The parks largely closed during the 2013 shutdown. The U.S. Postal Service continues to operate, since it is self-funded.",
      "Maya MacGuineas, the president of the Committee for a Responsible Federal Budget, said the public may not notice the effects if the shutdown is short-lived.",
      "\"The truth is, most people won't really feel much of a difference,\" MacGuineas said. \"If you've got a vacation planned to a National Park, you're going to be [upset] and disappointed. But most people will go on with their everyday lives and interact with the government the same way they do and not feel a big difference. That could get worse, the longer it lasts.\"",
      "The Senate report found the 2018-2019 shutdown had widespread impacts across a variety of government functions that ceased or were curtailed during the lapse in funding. It noted that furloughs in many agencies like the SEC, Federal Trade Commission and Consumer Product Safety Commission hampered enforcement and investigations. The report said the Justice Department canceled 60,000 immigration hearings.",
      "The effects could be even more pronounced this time around, given the possibility that the administration could use the shutdown to implement mass layoffs, furthering the president's aim of permanently reducing the federal workforce.",
      "When was the last government shutdown?",
      "The last government shutdown stretched from December 2018 until January 2019, when congressional funding for nine executive branch departments with roughly 800,000 employees lapsed.",
      "The five-week partial shutdown cost the economy $11 billion, according to a Congressional Budget Office report. The CBO said most of that would be recovered once the shutdown ended, but estimated a permanent loss of about $3 billion.",
      "Businesses across the country that relied on government customers reported a slowdown in business and some said they had to lay off employees. Tens of thousands of immigration court hearings were canceled. Government contractors struggled to feed their families and pay their bills.",
      "The shutdown stemmed from a standoff over Mr. Trump's demand for $5.7 billion to fund a wall along the border with Mexico. Mr. Trump had vowed to close the government if the funding wasn't included in spending legislation, but Democrats refused to give in.",
      "Mr. Trump conceded after insisting for weeks that he would not reopen the government without money for the wall, signing a bill to reopen the government for three weeks while Congress negotiated a spending deal.",
      "Three weeks later, Mr. Trump signed a compromise spending bill to avert another government shutdown, ultimately accepting a bill that did not meet his $5.7 billion demand for his long-promised border wall.",
      "When was the longest government shutdown?",
      "Before the early 1980s, the government would typically continue operating as usual even when funding bills hadn't been passed, but that changed after the attorney general issued opinions stating that it was illegal for the government to spend money without congressional approval.",
      "Since 1980, there have been 14 shutdowns, most of which lasted just a few days.",
      "The longest shutdown in U.S. history was the 2018-2019 lapse, which lasted 34 full days. Before that, the record was 21 days in 1995 and 1996, when President Bill Clinton held out against steep spending and tax cuts favored by Republican House Speaker Newt Gingrich."

    "summary": "Two families from Colorado urged the Supreme Court to reaffirm that parents have a constitutional right to make decisions about their children's care and upbringing.",
    "story": [
      "Washington \u2014 The Supreme Court on Monday rejected a bid to revive a lawsuit brought by two Colorado families who alleged their parental rights were violated when their children attended school-sponsored club meetings that included discussions of gender identity and sexuality and were allegedly discouraged from telling their parents about it.",
      "Though the high court turned away the case, Justices Samuel Alito, joined by Justices Clarence Thomas and Neil Gorsuch, wrote separately to express concern with what Alito said was an unwillingness by courts to confront whether a school district violates parents' rights when it encourages a student's gender transition without the parents' knowledge or consent.",
      "\"Petitioners tell us that nearly 6,000 public schools have policies \u2014 as respondent allegedly does \u2014 that purposefully interfere with parents' access to critical information about their children's gender-identity choices and school personnel's involvement in and influence on those choices,\" Alito wrote. \"The troubling \u2014 and tragic \u2014 allegations in this case underscore the 'great and growing national importance\" of the question that these parent petitioners present.'\"",
      "The legal fight was brought by two sets of parents \u2014 Jonathan and Erin Lee, and Nicolas and Linnaea Jurich \u2014 who asked the Supreme Court to reaffirm that parents have a constitutional right to make decisions about their children's care and upbringing. The families claimed that parents' legal authority is being undercut by school districts nationwide.",
      "The families challenged policies implemented by the Poudre School District R-1 in Wellington, Colorado, which they say urge district employees not to disclose information about a students' gender identity, including to parents.",
      "In one instance, the Lees' daughter, identified in court papers as C.L., was urged to attend a meeting of the Gender and Sexualities Alliance at her middle school. During the meeting, a substitute teacher in the school district spoke about gender identity and sexual orientation, and warned students that it may not be safe to tell their parents about the discussion, according to court papers.",
      "C.L. announced during the meeting that she was transgender, and told her parents when she went home, the family said in a Supreme Court filing. She also recounted the events of the meeting, after which C.L.'s parents removed her from the school district and enrolled their daughter in a private school, according to court filings.",
      "The Lees contacted the school's principal to discuss what occurred at the GSA meeting, and he told the parents that the meetings were expected to be confidential to ensure a safe space for open conversation, according to court papers.",
      "A second student, the Jurichs' daughter, who is identified in court papers as H.J., had a similar experience at after-school GSA meetings, which included discussions of gender identity and the warning about sharing the discussions with her parents.",
      "H.J. was later disenrolled from the middle school after starting eighth grade, when she told her parents she felt unsafe about being in the same building as a teacher who encouraged her to attend the GSA meetings, according to court filings.",
      "Both sets of parents sued the Poudre School District, alleging that their 14th Amendment rights were violated by interfering with their decision-making as parents. They sought monetary damages to reimburse the cost of private school, medical expenses, counseling fees and other costs.",
      "But a federal district court dismissed the lawsuit, and later denied their attempt to amend their suit. The U.S. Court of Appeals for the 10th Circuit upheld that decision on procedural grounds.",
      "In urging the Supreme Court to take up the case, lawyers for the parents warned that the lower court rulings invite the school district to \"continue surreptitiously wresting decision-making authority from fit parents unawares and instead vesting that authority in school officials.\"",
      "\"America's long history of protecting parents' legal authority in raising their children is being deliberately dismantled by school districts across the country that have enacted policies to replace parental authority with governmental authority,\" they wrote in a filing. \"These policies actively deprive parents of the very information they need to exercise their legal rights and moral obligations to act in their children's best interests.\"",
      "But the school district said the Supreme Court should turn the case away and argued that the parents were effectively seeking an \"advisory opinion\" that is outside the jurisdiction of federal courts.",
      "\"[T]he parents seek an advisory opinion that would fail to afford them any relief from the rulings below, and this is the wrong case to consider whether a public school employee's alleged discouraged disclosure regarding gender identity and expression implicates a fundamental right,\" they wrote in a filing."

    "story": [
      "Washington \u2014 The Supreme Court on Monday said it will not consider whether the online dating platform Grindr can be sued for sex trafficking and other offenses by a young user who was sexually assaulted by men he matched with on the app.",
      "In turning away the case, the high court passed up a chance to examine the scope of Section 230, a powerful tool for online companies that immunizes them from civil lawsuits stemming from content posted by third parties. The Supreme Court has in the past been confronted with cases asking it to decide the parameters of immunity under Section 230, but it has skirted rulings that could have limited the legal shield.",
      "Defenders of Section 230, which was enacted in 1996, have said that the law paved the way for online innovation and has allowed internet platforms both big and small to flourish. But critics have warned that courts have interpreted Section 230 too broadly, allowing social media platforms and other internet companies to escape accountability.",
      "Among those calling for the Supreme Court to examine the bounds of Section 230 are Justices Neil Gorsuch and Clarence Thomas, who warned last year that social media companies have used the legal shield as a \"get-out-of-jail-free card.\"",
      "The Grindr lawsuit",
      "The case dates back to 2019, when a 15-year-old boy living in Canada, identified in court filings as John Doe, downloaded Grindr and created a profile. Grindr did not verify his age, he said, and the app matched the boy with four adult men living in his area. Doe met the men in person, and was sexually assaulted and raped, according to court filings. Three of the four men were convicted for their crimes against Doe.",
      "Doe filed a lawsuit against Grindr in 2023 for sex trafficking and other violations, including alleging that the app is defective because it recommends adults and children for in-person sexual encounters, which are illegal. He claimed that Grindr intentionally markets its app to children and allows them to create profiles without parental permission or supervision, despite knowing that the platform puts young people at risk.",
      "Grindr sought to dismiss the case, arguing in part that Section 230 shielded it from liability because Doe's claims stemmed from the publication of content created by third parties.",
      "A federal judge found Grindr was entitled to immunity under Section 230 and agreed to toss out the case, determining that the app's match function relies on third-party content generated by its users, namely their profile and geolocation data that is extracted from their phones.",
      "The U.S. Court of Appeals for the 9th Circuit upheld the lower court's dismissal of Doe's case. The appeals court said Doe faulted Grindr for \"facilitating communication among users for illegal activity\" and failing to suppress matches and conversations between adults and children. Those actions, it said, would involve the platform's role as a publisher of third-party content.",
      "Doe appealed to the Supreme Court and argued the federal courts of appeals are divided on how to interpret the scope of Section 230, particularly when it involves treating platforms as publishers, or whether the content is a third party's.",
      "They said that for nearly three decades, courts have begun to expand the scope of Section 230 to provide sweeping immunity to online platforms.",
      "\"Section 230 was passed in 1995 to make the Internet safer,\" Doe's lawyers wrote in a filing. \"Instead, it created a hunting ground for predators, and a goldmine for amoral companies who need not invest in providing safe products. Delay will guarantee more victims.\"",
      "But lawyers for Grindr said Doe misrepresented his age in order to gain access to the platform, dooming his attempts to claim that Grindr knowingly engaged in sex trafficking since the app forbids minors from using it.",
      "\"At its core, this case involves user-to-user communications on an online platform, where Grindr's role was confined to providing the digital infrastructure for those interactions,\" they wrote in a filing to the Supreme Court.",
      "Grindr's lawyers said that Section 230 protects it from liability for its decisions about user content, namely what to screen, block, publish or take down.",
      "In 2023, the Supreme Court considered the scope of Section 230 for the first time, and specifically whether its protections extended to targeted recommendations of information. But the high court declined to address Section 230 directly in its decision and instead ruled on technical grounds.",
      "The Supreme Court turned away another case involving Section 230 and the photo and video-sharing app Snapchat last year, which was brought by an unnamed teenager who alleged his science teacher used the platform to groom him and send him sexually explicit content."

    "link": "https://www.cbsnews.com/news/maine-janet-mills-senate-susan-collins-2026-run-announces/",
    "published": "Tue, 14 Oct 2025 09:21:48 -0400",
    "summary": "The seat, held by Republican Sen. Susan Collins, could be one of only a few realistic Senate pickup opportunities for Democrats next year \u2014 but Janet Mills will need to contend with a primary battle first.",
    "story": [
      "The first woman to be elected governor of Maine is set to try and accomplish what no candidate in her state has managed in more than 30 years: to defeat Republican Susan Collins.",
      "But to even have the chance to do so, Democrat Janet Mills will first have to make it through what is already primed to be a contentious Senate primary between establishment voices and progressives at a crucial time in her party.",
      "Mills announced on Tuesday she will run in Maine's 2026 Senate contest, offering Democrats one route to try to unseat the longtime GOP incumbent Collins and thin out the Republican Senate majority in Washington.",
      "\"I won't sit idly by while Maine people suffer and politicians like Susan Collins bend the knee as if this were normal,\" Mills said in an announcement video posted early Tuesday. \"My life's work has prepared me for this fight, and I'm ready to win. This election will be a simple choice: Is Maine going to bow down or stand up? I know my answer.\"",
      "CBS News reported last week\u00a0that Mills was expected to launch her campaign on Tuesday.",
      "The 77-year-old governor has been viewed as a key recruiting target for national Democrats, who face long odds of flipping control of the Senate back next year given a difficult map of races. Mills was first elected governor after winning by more than seven points in 2018, and she won reelection by a 13-point margin four years later.",
      "But recent political history, both locally and across the country, may upend expectations about how Mills will fare in what could become one of the tensest contests of the 2026 midterms.",
      "Collins has served as one of Maine's senators since 1997, establishing herself as a key moderate Republican voice, albeit one who tends to frustrate members of both major parties at times. During the 2020 presidential election, defeating Collins was a major, and well-funded, priority for Democrats. But Collins still managed to win re-election by more than eight points, even as Democrat Joe Biden's statewide margin over President Trump in Maine was nine points.",
      "The 72-year-old Collins has never lost a Senate race in Maine, her last defeat coming in a run for governor back in 1994.",
      "Mills' expected entry into the Senate race is already being met with some dismissiveness on the progressive side. Vermont Sen. Bernie Sanders, who is an independent but caucuses with Democrats, is rallying around Graham Platner, a younger first-time statewide candidate who is already in the Senate race and, according to his online campaign bio, is a military veteran and oyster farmer.",
      "\"Graham Platner is a great working class candidate for Senate in Maine who will defeat Susan Collins,\" Sanders said recently on social media. \"It's disappointing that some Democratic leaders are urging Governor Mills to run. We need to focus on winning that seat & not waste millions on an unnecessary & divisive primary.\"",
      "In the fallout from a difficult 2024 election cycle where Democrats lost the presidency and Senate, and failed to retake control of the House, there have been persistent questions about how the party can recover. One tension rippling through the party is the subject of generational change, and whether to eschew the older candidates closer in age to Biden, 82, and instead nominate people who can try to revive a Democratic brand that has suffered in recent years.",
      "With Mills' entry into the race on Tuesday, Democrats in Maine may be on a collision course over those national concerns already rippling through other contests where the party's future direction could be at stake."

    "story": [
      "Former federal ethics officials who served in Republican and Democratic administrations are asking the Justice Department's inspector general to investigate the prosecutions of former FBI Director James Comey and New York Attorney General Letitia James.",
      "In a letter obtained by CBS News, ethics officials who worked in the Obama and George W. Bush administrations urged a formal review of interim U.S. Attorney for the Eastern District of Virginia Lindsey Halligan's decision to prosecute Comey and James.",
      "They sent their request Tuesday to Acting Justice Department Inspector General William Blier, writing, \"Ms. Halligan pursued these indictments to fulfill President Donald J. Trump's longstanding personal vendetta against Mr. Comey and Ms. James, we are facing a turning point in our democracy and some of the most egregious examples of vindictive and meritless prosecution that our nation has ever seen.\"",
      "The letter was written by leaders of the Democracy Defenders Fund, a Washington-based nonpartisan group that has frequently been critical of the Trump administration.",
      "The group is led by Norm Eisen, former ethics official for President Barack Obama; Richard Painter, a former associate counsel to President George W. Bush; and Virginia Canter, a former White House associate counsel to Presidents Bill Clinton and Obama.",
      "Their letter also said, \"A president should never order prosecutions of his enemies. That happens in Putin's Russia, and it has happened in other dictatorships, but not here\u2013until now.\"",
      "Comey and Mr. Trump have had a contentious relationship for years. Comey, who was FBI director when Mr. Trump took office in 2017, was fired later that year by the president. Initially, the White House indicated he had been ousted over his handling of the investigation of Hillary Clinton's email server, but the president later told NBC News' Lester Holt that he had the FBI's Russia investigation on his mind and had terminated Comey because of \"this Russia thing with Trump and Russia.\"",
      "That firing ultimately set into motion special counsel Robert Mueller's investigation into allegations that Russia interfered in the 2016 presidential election and that the Trump campaign coordinated with the Kremlin. Mr. Trump has repeatedly denounced those allegations as a \"hoax.\" Mueller's probe found that Russia interfered in the election and several Trump campaign officials had contacts with Russians, but did not establish that campaign staff illegally conspired with the Russian government.",
      "For his part, Comey has been a vocal critic of Mr. Trump since his firing, calling him \"morally unfit\" to be president in a 2018 interview.",
      "The Democracy Defenders Fund also contended that \"prosecutors should never be fired for refusing to bring charges they conclude are unfounded, even if the president orders them to do so. Yet that appears to be just what President Trump has done in order to charge Mr. Comey and Ms. James.\"",
      "The criminal cases were filed against Comey and James less than three weeks after President Trump called for their prosecution in a post on social media.",
      "The acting U.S. attorney for the Eastern District of Virginia, who had been appointed to the position by Mr. Trump, resigned after he did not bring prosecutions of Comey and James, and the president announced he had been fired. A Trump White House aide, Lindsey Halligan, was then installed as acting U.S. attorney and within days secured grand jury indictments against Comey and James \u2014 with prosecutors charging Comey less than a week before the statute of limitations ran out.",
      "Halligan has defended both of the prosecutions. In the hours after James's indictment last week, Halligan said in a statement, \"No one is above the law. The charges as alleged in this case represent intentional, criminal acts and tremendous breaches of the public's trust.\"",
      "After charging Comey, Halligan said, \"The charges as alleged in this case represent a breach of the public trust at an extraordinary level,\"",
      "Comey is charged with making a false statement and obstruction of Congress, for allegedly lying to the Senate Judiciary Committee in 2020 when he denied that he had authorized someone at the FBI to be an anonymous source in news reports. Comey has denied any wrongdoing.",
      "During an arraignment proceeding last week, Comey's defense attorney told a judge that Comey would seek a dismissal of the case next week, arguing the case is an unlawful vindictive prosecution against one of the president's critics.",
      "The Democracy Defenders Fund's request for a federal review of Halligan's cases also argued, \"The same pattern has now been repeated a second time in as many weeks with respect to another victim of President Trump's wrath. Ms. Halligan's prosecution of Letitia James on two counts of 'bank fraud' and a 'false statement' appears to be a further attempt to fulfill President Trump's personal vendetta against his political enemies.\"",
      "\"Trump's animus against Ms. James stems from having successfully brought a years-long civil fraud case against the Trump Organization, which included judgments against President Trump and two of his sons and imposed a court monitor with limits on their ability to conduct business in New York,\" the fund's letter continued.",
      "James is scheduled to appear in court on Oct. 24, to answer to charges of mortgage fraud and false statement in connection with a Norfolk, Virginia, home in 2020. James has also denied wrongdoing.",
      "The Office of the Justice Department Inspector General is on furlough because of the shutdown and did not immediately respond to requests for comment. The Justice Department declined to comment."

    "story": [
      "Glocks are among the most popular handguns sold in California. Even former Vice President Kamala Harris owns one. But Californians will no longer be able to buy a new Glock gun in the state.",
      "Democrat Gov. Gavin Newsom signed a bill into law that bans the sale of new Glock guns in California.",
      "At issue, the new Glock design allows the gun to be easily modified with a Lego-sized piece of plastic known as a \"Glock Switch\" that can be 3-D printed to turn it into a fully automatic weapon.",
      "Glock \"switches\" are already illegal, but Democratic lawmakers in California went one step further by passing a bill along party lines that outlaws the sale of any new gun with a Glock-like design. The new law does not ban possession of Glocks, nor does it ban reselling used Glocks in California.",
      "Southern California Assemblymember Jesse Gabriel, who introduced Assembly Bill 1127, said he hopes this legislation forces Glock to change its design so \"switches\" no longer work.",
      "\"They (Glock) have known about this design flaw for a long time,\" Gabriel said to CBS News California. \"They could help save lives.\"",
      "California is the third-largest U.S. market for gun sales. Gun store owner Eddie Ford explained that, unlike some other handguns, Glocks are designed to be customizable. He noted that the design of the Glock has remained the same due to \"its ultra-reliability.\"",
      "Newer models of Glocks do have an added piece that is intended to block the Glock switch. But California's attorney general hasn't approved that model for sale here.",
      "Ford acknowledged, realistically, someone could easily file that added piece off in about a minute.",
      "Despite the new law, Ford said that California gun stores like his will keep selling used Glocks, and he doesn't expect this bill to reduce the number of incidents where Glock switches are used.",
      "\"Because there are still millions of Glocks on the streets,\" he said. \"If criminals want them, they're going to get them.\"",
      "Deborah Grimes lost her only son, Greg \"Najee' Grimes, when he was shot seven times with a modified Glock. Najee\u00a0was shot and killed\u00a0in a downtown Sacramento nightclub in 2022. The gunman fired 11 rapid shots into a crowd, with seven hitting Najee.",
      "\"Had he been shot maybe once, even twice, I feel that he would have been able to survive that,\" Grimes said.",
      "Najee was a star football player, a coach, and a mentor to special needs kids. He is now the reason for Deborah Grimes' mission with the advocacy group Moms Demand Action.",
      "It was the\u00a0second mass shooting\u00a0in the shadow of the California State Capitol in just three months and one of 55 statewide that year.",
      "The shooter\u00a0used a Glock handgun, modified with a Glock Switch.",
      "\"There was just too much damage because that Glock 'switch' was a killing machine,\" Grimes said of her son's shooting.",
      "Najee's murder garnered national attention, even being featured on \"America's Most Wanted\" while law enforcement officials were still searching for a suspect. Now, his mom hopes her advocacy will have a national impact.",
      "\"I hope that Glock moves forward to make the (design) change,\" Grimes said.",
      "If Glock were to redesign the gun, it could be sold in California again. However, the current design was grandfathered in before California passed\u00a0its stringent gun certification laws in 2001.\u00a0\u00a0A new design would have to go through a lengthy certification process.",
      "AB 1127 was passed by the California legislature on a party-line vote, with all Republican assemblymembers in opposition.",
      "\"By specifically targeting the potential for modification, this bill disproportionately affects potential Glock purchasers and restricts access to one of the most popular handguns available,\" Republican lawmakers outlined in their analysis of the bill.",
      "Glock did not respond to a request for comment."

      "The president received repeated standing ovations from the Israeli parliament during his more than hour-long speech Monday, as he declared the start of a new era in the Middle East and peace for Israel. The hostages were released to the Red Cross in Gaza early Monday, before being taken to be reunited with their families in Israel, more than two years after Hamas launched its deadly assault on Oct. 7, 2023.",
      "\"After two harrowing years in darkness and captivity, 20 courageous hostages are returning to the glorious embrace of their families, and it is glorious,\" Mr. Trump said. \"Twenty-eight more precious loved ones are coming home at last to rest in this sacred soil for all of time. And after so many years of unceasing war and endless danger, today, the skies are calm, the guns are silent, the sirens are still, and the sun rises on a holy land that is finally at peace, a land and a region that will live, God willing, in peace for all eternity.\"",
      "He called it \"a brilliant point in time\" and told the Knesset, \"Generations from now, this will be remembered as the moment that everything began to change, and change very much for the better, like the USA right now, it will be the golden age of Israel, and the golden age of the Middle East.\"",
      "Mr. Trump singled out for praise special Middle East envoy Steve Witkoff, who was at the forefront of negotiations and critical in reaching a deal all parties could sign. Mr. Trump lauded Witkoff, who was a real estate developer before he joined the Trump administration, for his negotiating skills but said he thinks his likeability is what makes him so successful. The Knesset chamber erupted in applause for Witkoff.",
      "\"Steve started this all by himself,\" Mr. Trump said of the peace deal. \"I call him Henry Kissinger who doesn't leak, okay? Henry was a big leaker. He leaked. Steve doesn't leak. Steve just wants to get the job done, he wants to do what's right.\"",
      "Two Israeli lawmakers who held up signs saying \"Recognize Palestine\" and interrupted Mr. Trump's remarks at the Knesset were ejected from the parliament.",
      "The president also made light of the critics he said had predicted that he'd \"drag\" the U.S. into more wars.",
      "\"But when you settle eight wars in eight months, that means you don't like war,\" he said.",
      "\"Everyone thought I was going to be brutal. In fact, l remember Hillary Clinton during a debate, she said, 'Look at him, look at him, he's going to go to war with everybody.' And actually, she said, 'He's got a personality that's all about war.' No, my personality actually is all about stopping wars, and it seems to work. Seems to work.\"",
      "But on Friday, Clinton, who was secretary of state during the Obama administration and lost the 2016 presidential election to Mr. Trump and has long had an acrimonious relationship with him, had words of praise for Mr. Trump and the Israel-Hamas deal he brokered. In an interview with CBS News senior correspondent Norah O'Donnell, Clinton called it \"a significant step\" and added, \"I really commend President Trump and his administration\" and Arab leaders in the region for committing to the 20-point peace plan.",
      "In one of the more awkward moments of the president's lengthy remarks, he called for Israeli President Isaac Herzog to pardon Netanyahu, apparently in reference to corruption charges Netanyahu has been fighting for years.",
      "\"I have an idea. Mr President, why don't you give him a pardon? Give him a pardon,\" Mr. Trump said, turning to Herzog.",
      "\"By the way, that was not in the speech, as you probably know! But I happen to like this gentleman right\u00a0 over here, and it just seems to make so much sense.\"",
      "The president also told Netanyahu the timing of the agreement to end the war is \"brilliant,\" and he suggested continuing the war could have been politically perilous for the prime minister. Netanyahu's offensive in Gaza was condemned by a number of countries over severe restrictions on the distribution of food to Palestinians and the killing of civilians. He has also been harshly criticized by his own people and was booed in Hostage Square Saturday night when Witkoff mentioned his name.",
      "\"The world wanted peace and Israel wanted peace, everybody did,\" Mr. Trump said. \"What a victory it's been. If you'd kept going on for three, four years fighting, fighting, fighting, it was getting bad, it was getting heated. The timing of this is brilliant and I said, 'Bibi you're going to be remembered for this for far more than if you kept this going, going, going, kill, kill, kill.' It would not be the same. And I just want to congratulate you for having the courage \u2014 that's it.\"",
      "He urged Israelis to focus now on peace and reconstruction: \"We've won, and now let's rebuild our lives and make it stronger and bigger and better than ever before.\"",
      "The president met with some of the Israeli hostages' families at the Knesset before delivering his remarks, according to the Hostage and Missing Families Forum. Afterward, the president traveled to Egypt for a peace signing ceremony."

      "Washington \u2014 Vice President JD Vance on Sunday accused Democrats of \"hostage-taking\" with their posture in the government shutdown, as Democratic leaders in Congress have pushed for serious negotiations with Republican leaders and the White House to end the stalemate.",
      "\"We don't negotiate with a person who has taken the entire federal government hostage over a health care policy dispute,\" Vance said on \"Face the Nation with Margaret Brennan.\"",
      "Twelve days into the government shutdown, Democrats and Republicans continued to trade blame over the impasse, without a clear resolution in sight. As Senate Republican leadership has held repeat votes on a House-passed measure to fund the government, looking to peel off support from across the aisle, Democrats have demanded an extension of expiring health insurance tax credits as a condition for their support to reopen the government. And as Democrats call for negotiations in the funding fight, Republican leaders say there's nothing to negotiate.",
      "When asked Sunday about Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer's insistence that the stalemate would only be solved by negotiations between congressional leaders and the White House, Vance said \"this isn't a deal-making, this isn't a negotiation, this is hostage-taking.\"",
      "\"If Chuck Schumer wants to come into the Oval Office or come to my house, he is welcome to talk about how to fix health care policy for Americans,\" Vance said. \"But you don't come into the Oval Office and say, 'unless you the President of the United States give us everything that I want, I'm going to shut down the government.'\"",
      "Vance added, \"we'll negotiate over health care policy, but only once you do your job and open up people's government.\"",
      "On the question of the health insurance tax credits, Vance said \"we think the tax credits actually go to a lot of waste and fraud within the insurance industry, so we want to make sure that the tax credits go to the people who need them.\"",
      "\"There's a lot of willingness to negotiate, a lot of willingness to compromise from both the moderate Democrats and certainly from the White House,\" Vance said. \"But if the far-left Democrats, led by Chuck Schumer, are going to shut down the government and refuse to open up the government unless they get everything they want, that's not a negotiation, that's a hostage-taking. And we're not going to reward that kind of behavior from Washington, D.C.\"",
      "Meanwhile on Friday, the White House announced that layoffs previewed earlier in the shutdown had begun, and the administration said in a court filing that seven agencies began issuing reduction-in-force notices to more than 4,000 workers.",
      "Vance said the government is focused on \"ensuring essential services remain open\" when asked how the administration is deciding who gets laid off. And he urged that \"this is not a situation that we're excited about,\" saying \"we want the government to reopen, but Chuck Schumer and the Democrats decided to shut down the government, and we have to deal with the consequences in the administration, so that's what we're doing.\"",
      "Pressed about the layoffs, some of which were rescinded, Vance said \"the government shutdown inevitably leads to some chaos.\"",
      "\"We are figuring out how to take money from some areas and give it to other areas,\" Vance said. \"That chaos is because Schumer and the far-left Democrats shut down the government.\"",
      "On whether the layoffs can hold up to legal scrutiny after two unions sued to block the mass layoffs during the shutdown, Vance said, \"we think that we have the authority to do what we need to do.\"",
      "\"All these conversations about whether it's a temporary layoff or a permanent layoff, we are dealing with a terrible, chaotic situation because Chuck Schumer and a few far left Democrats decided to shut down the government,\" Vance said. \"If they just join with the moderate Democrats and the vast majority of Republicans, we can open up the government, and all these conversations will no longer be necessary.\"",
      "Democratic Sen. Chris Murphy of Connecticut also appeared on \"Face the Nation\" on Sunday and said Vance is \"just not living in reality.\"",
      "\"There's no negotiations happening right now, because Republicans are boycotting those negotiations,\" Murphy said, arguing they are doing so \"because they are desperate to raise premiums on people in this country by 75% in order to finance their tax cut for the wealthy.\"",
      "Murphy said \"this is an emergency.\"",
      "\"We have a responsibility in this upcoming budget to prevent disaster for families whose premiums are about to go up, and to address the destruction of our democracy and the rule of law that's happening all over this country,\" Murphy said. \"Those are urgent matters.\""

      "Just before an Israel-Hamas ceasefire went into effect Friday, which is the first step in implementing phase one of President Trump's peace plan to end the war in Gaza, senior U.S. officials shared a timeline of the monthslong effort to put the deal together.",
      "At this point, Israeli troops have withdrawn from parts of Gaza, initiating a 72-hour countdown for Hamas to release all remaining Israeli hostages. In exchange, Israel will release dozens of Palestinian prisoners and allow aid to flow into Gaza. Palestinians who left northern Gaza during fighting there could be seen returning to the war-ravaged area Friday.",
      "The vast majority of Mr. Trump's 20-point plan remains to be implemented, but as the work of fulfilling it begins, here's what senior U.S. officials have told CBS News about key moments in the negotiations.",
      "August 2025: Hamas accepts new ceasefire proposal",
      "Hamas accepted a new Gaza ceasefire proposal presented by Egypt and Qatar. One U.S. official said this proposal drew upon principles from earlier negotiations and previous hostage releases. It also took into consideration elements of what Israel, Hamas and Mr. Trump wanted to be included. It was this proposal that would evolve into the 20-point plan.",
      "Around Monday, Sept. 22 through Wednesday, Sept. 24: Witkoff, Kushner bring 20-point plan to Qataris to \"tighten it up\"",
      "In New York during the United Nations General Assembly, special Middle East envoy Steve Witkoff and outside Trump adviser and son-in-law Jared Kushner brought the 20-point plan to the Qataris, in particular, to Prime Minister Sheikh Mohammed bin Abdulrahman Al Thani, with whom they worked to \"wordsmith the document, to tailor it, to tighten it up,\" a senior U.S. official said. Afterward, they brought the document to other Arab leaders to get feedback.",
      "The senior official said negotiators met with Turkey and Egypt, in addition to Qatar. On Tuesday, Sept. 23, during his day at the United Nations General Assembly, President Trump presented the 20-point plan to a roundtable of Arab leaders, which elicited \"a lot of feedback.\"",
      "Wednesday, Sept. 24 through Sunday, Sept. 28: Witkoff, Kushner draft plan that includes Netanyahu apology to Qatar for airstrike in Doha",
      "Witkoff and Kushner stayed in New York City after the U.N. General Assembly, working through the weekend to put together a plan to present to Mr. Trump in the Oval Office on Monday, Sept. 29.",
      "Their plan included an apology from Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu to Mohammed, the Qatari prime minister, for an Israeli strike that killed Hamas officials in Doha in September. \"It all went well,\" a senior U.S. official said.",
      "Monday, Sept. 29: Netanyahu's apology to Qatar",
      "Mr. Trump announced the 20-point proposal during a meeting with Netanyahu at the White House. That day, the president, Netanyahu and the Qatari prime minister spoke on a phone call, and Netanyahu apologized for Israel's strikes on Doha, expressing \"his deep regret that Israel's missile strike against Hamas targets in Qatar unintentionally killed a Qatari serviceman,\" according to a White House readout of the call.",
      "The Israeli strike had caused \"a lot of angst within the Arab world\" and there was \"deep mistrust between the parties,\" a senior U.S. official said, adding that Netanyahu's apology to Qatar was well received, \"as something really, really strong and the sort of thing that mature people do.\"",
      "\"That got us some leverage,\" the official added.",
      "Around this time, an official said the U.S. began to detect Hamas \"had had enough.\"",
      "\"Every family in Gaza has been affected by this,\" the official said. \"You read some of the public opinion of polls \u2014 the Gazans do not just blame Israel for this conflict. They, in large part, were blaming Hamas for it. We began to sense that turn in leverage.\"",
      "Within days, there would be a meeting in Sharm El Sheikh, Egypt, with the Turkish and Egyptian intelligence chiefs and the Qatari prime minister.",
      "Friday, Oct. 3: in Miami, Kushner, Witkoff work on hostage releases",
      "In Florida, when Kushner heard Hamas had agreed to start talks on hostage releases, he drove 20 minutes to Witkoff's home in Miami, where they worked and fielded calls about the peace proposal, two administration officials said.",
      "Sunday, Oct. 5 - Monday, Oct. 6: Meetings in Sharm El Sheikh bring Hamas and Israel to the table",
      "Officials from Turkey, Qatar and Egypt sat down with Hamas and Israel at the table in Sharm El Sheikh on Oct. 5. Witkoff and Kushner set off for Sharm El Sheikh once they felt the tactical teams \"had done quite a bit.\"",
      "Wednesday morning, Sharm El Sheikh, Oct. 8: Refining the peace plan",
      "Kushner and Witkoff arrived in Sharm El Sheikh at 6:30 a.m. local time and \"immediately went to work,\" according to one senior U.S. official. They spent \"a lot of time\" going over proposals and issues that had arisen over the previous days, such as the redeployment of the Israel Defense Forces and when the hostage releases would take place.",
      "During these talks, they also separated the peace deal into two phases. Phase one would be a hostage release, including the release of Palestinian prisoners in Israel.",
      "Then, phase two would begin. This was what one senior U.S. official called an \"almost permanent ceasefire\" that would be in place until other issues were negotiated: the decommissioning of arms, how a technocratic government would enter and run Gaza, how the Israeli army would redeploy and what the gating mechanisms for these steps would be.",
      "Before they left, Mr. Trump relayed multiple messages to Kushner and Witkoff.",
      "\"His message was, 'First, get it done,'\" a U.S. official said. He also reiterated that he stood behind every aspect of his 20-point plan.",
      "\"POTUS wanted people on both sides to understand that he was going to enforce good conduct here, and that was a critical and overarching message that we were there to talk about,\" this official said.",
      "\"We were going for, you know, 20 straight hours,\" one official said of the talks in Egypt.",
      "Sharm El Sheikh, Oct. 8, Wednesday evening: \"Serious breakthroughs\"",
      "\"We began to have some very, very serious breakthroughs with regard to all of these issues,\" the U.S. official said, prompting another meeting Wednesday night with Kushner, Witkoff and Middle East officials.",
      "After settling what both sides saw as consequential issues that were discussed by both sides, and clearing up some \"misconceptions and miscommunications,\" Kushner and Witkoff made a call to the president and received some directions from him. Mr. Trump called into the talks at least three times on either Witkoff's or Kushner's iPhone, and spoke on speaker with multiple stakeholders.",
      "One of the key breakthroughs that evening was reaching consensus on the release of the 20 living Israeli hostages and the swap for the Palestinian prisoners.",
      "\"People became more malleable. You could see it as we were trust-building. Food was coming in. We were exchanging ideas,\" one U.S. official said. \"I can't stress enough how important this physical interaction was. We had multiple Arab leaders there who, I think, became very, bought into the fact that we really wanted to see a deal. We were committed to it, and we were going to stand behind it.\"",
      "At this time, Hamas began to realize \"they didn't need the hostages necessarily to enforce a view of theirs, that it was better for them to concede that a release was a positive thing, that better things would happen as a result of that decision on their part,\" a U.S. official said.",
      "\"It was so comprehensive, the engagement, so interactive. We just got ourselves to that place, and then everybody could see the line, and they wanted to cross it. Everybody. It really became a unanimous thing,\" this official added.",
      "5:30 p.m., Washington, Wednesday, Oct. 8 (2:30 a.m., Sharm El Sheikh, Thursday, Oct. 9): Announcing the deal",
      "Witkoff and Kushner felt they had dealt with all the issues and were ready to announce the deal. President Trump announced it in the U.S. on Truth Social.",
      "\"This is a GREAT Day for the Arab and Muslim World, Israel, all surrounding Nations, and the United States of America,\" the president wrote on Truth Social. \"BLESSED ARE THE PEACEMAKERS!\"",
      "Witkoff and Kushner then traveled to Cairo, and met with Egyptian President Abdel Fattah El-Sisi to tell him he was needed for the implementation phase. After the El-Sisi meeting, Witkoff and Kushner flew to Tel Aviv.",
      "6:30p, Tel Aviv, Thursday, Oct. 9: Witkoff, Kushner met with applause in Cabinet room",
      "Witkoff and Kushner arrive in Tel Aviv, though they never made it to their hotel. They immediately went to see President Isaac Herzog, to walk him through the plan, and then met with Netanyahu. They also spoke to the Israeli Cabinet, receiving a warm welcome.",
      "In the Cabinet room, \"everybody started clapping,\" a U.S. official said. \"There were plenty of differences of opinion that we heard there. There were hardliners, there were people who wanted to see the 20 hostages come home above all else, but we talked, and we explored different pathways to get to good compromises.\"",
      "Their reason for going to Israel was to ensure \"implementation occurs.\" Another senior U.S. official acknowledged, \"There's still just a lot of ways that this can go wrong.\"",
      "\"So, we're staying on top of the details to make sure everyone fulfills their obligations and that any misunderstandings are quickly discussed and adjudicated,\" the official said.",
      "A U.S. official suggested Mr. Trump may have succeeded in reaching a deal where other leaders failed because \"he's not trying to be a middle-of-the-roader.\"",
      "\"He's basically stood shoulder to shoulder with Israel 100%,\" the official said. This has meant Israel \"has a lot of trust in him that he's not going to ask them to do anything that would compromise their security. And because they know that if they agree together on what the end state should be, President Trump and his team were able to have much more frank and creative conversations with Israel on how to get there.\""

    "published": "Tue, 14 Oct 2025 07:14:52 -0400",
    "summary": "Leaf-peeping season has arrived in the Northeast and beyond, but weeks of drought have dulled this year's autumn colors and sent leaves fluttering to the ground earlier than usual.",
    "story": [
      "Portland, Maine \u2014 Leaf-peeping season has arrived in the Northeast and beyond, but weeks of drought have dulled this year's autumn colors and sent leaves fluttering to the ground earlier than usual.",
      "Soaking in the fall foliage is an annual tradition in the New England states as well as areas such as the Rocky Mountains of Colorado, Great Smoky Mountains of Tennessee and North Carolina and Upper Peninsula of Michigan. As the days shorten and temperatures drop, chlorophyll in leaves breaks down, and they turn to the autumn tones of yellow, orange and red.",
      "But dry weather in summer and fall can change all that because the lack of water causes leaves to brown and fall more quickly. And that's happening this year, as more than 40% of the country was considered to be in a drought in early October, according to the U.S. Drought Monitor.",
      "That's more than twice the average, said Brad Rippey, a U.S. Department of Agriculture meteorologist and an author of the drought monitor, which is a partnership between the federal government and University of Nebraska-Lincoln. Drought has hit the Northeast and western U.S. especially hard, he said.",
      "It all adds up to fewer leaves to peep.",
      "\"I think it might be a little bit of a short and less colorful season, for the most part,\" Rippey said. \"The color is just not going to be there this year for some hillsides.\"",
      "Despite the gloomy forecast, autumn enthusiasts said it's still a great year to get out and enjoy nature's fireworks display. There is still a lot of color in New England's trees, said Andy Finton, senior conservation ecologist with The Nature Conservancy in Massachusetts.",
      "Climate change is stressing forests with severe weather and heat waves, but autumn in New England remains a beautiful time of year to experience the wonderment of forest ecosystems firsthand, he said.",
      "\"Our trees and our forests have an inherent resilience,\" Finton said. \"They are still very resilient, and I am constantly surprised at how wonderful the fall season is despite these stresses.\"",
      "Leaf-peepers undeterred for most part",
      "The tourism business built around leaf peeping has also proven resilient. At the Mills Falls Resort Collection at the Lake in Meredith, New Hampshire, general manager Barbara Beckwith said business is good at the four inns that have 170 rooms. The number of Canadian tourists is down, Beckwith acknowledged, but she said that's been made up with domestic leaf peepers, mostly from New England.",
      "Beckwith said her properties were booked solid on weekends through mid-October and had been for weeks.",
      "\"This year is actually going to be better than last year,\" Beckwith said. \"Last year was an election and that put a lot of trepidation in people. Now, they are traveling. The uncertainty of the election is over. We all know whose president now and we are traveling.\"",
      "Chris Proulx, executive director of the Mount Washington (New Hampshire) Valley Chamber of Commerce, said the decline in Canadian tourists by as much as 80% seen this summer has continued into the fall. But the region is faring better, he said, thanks to an uptick in travelers from other countries and its reputation for having one of the country's best leaf peeping seasons.",
      "\"This is the one season where people make plans in advance to come in addition to travelers from all of the country and all over the world,\" Proulx said.",
      "Leaf peeping was so popular in Colorado's Rocky Mountains this year that one town temporarily closed its highway offramp to alleviate gridlock. The area put on a display of yellow aspen trees dotting the mountains between evergreens, their delicate leaves vibrating in the wind.",
      "But there were signs of a dry spring in the central part of the state, one that is more severe the farther west you travel, said Colorado State Forest Service entomologist Dan West, who spends many fall days in a plane looking at how insect infestations are affecting tree health.",
      "Crispy edges, muted colors, and dropping leaves before they can take on a red or purple hue are all signs of drought stress, West said.",
      "\"The tree is shutting down processes early and we basically just see this muted kind of a show for the fall,\" he said.",
      "In Denver, arborist Michael Sundberg also said he's seeing less vibrant color than usual, and autumn feels like it arrived earlier than usual this year. It's still a beautiful time of year, but there might be less of it to enjoy, he said.",
      "\"It's weird to have color peaking this early in the mountains and then for Denver to be peaking at the same time,\" he said. \"Usually we're later in October before we really go off.\""

    "story": [
      "Arctic seals are being pushed closer to extinction by climate change and more than half of bird species around the world are declining under pressure from deforestation and agricultural expansion, according to an annual assessment from the International Union for Conservation of Nature.",
      "One bright spot is green sea turtles, which have recovered substantially thanks to decades of conservation efforts, the IUCN said Friday as it released its latest Red List of Threatened Species.",
      "While many animals are increasingly at risk of disappearing forever, the updated list shows how species can come back from the brink with dedicated effort, Rima Jabado, deputy chair of the IUCN Species Survival Commission, told The Associated Press.",
      "\"Hope and concern go hand in hand in this work,\" Jabado wrote by email. \"The same persistence that brought back the green sea turtle can be mirrored in small, everyday actions \u2014 supporting sustainable choices, backing conservation initiatives, and urging leaders to follow through on their environmental promises.\"",
      "The list is updated every year by teams of scientists assessing data on creatures around the world. The scope of the work is enormous and important for science, said Andrew Farnsworth, a visiting scientist at the Cornell Lab of Ornithology who studies bird migration and wasn't involved with the IUCN report.",
      "\"Every time one is done and every time there's revision, there's more information, and there's more ability to answer questions\" on species, some of which are still largely a mystery to researchers, Farnsworth said.",
      "Sea ice loss",
      "Because all the marine mammals native to the Arctic \u2014 seals, whales and polar bears \u2014 rely on the habitat provided by sea ice, they're all at risk as it diminishes because of human-caused climate change, said Kit Kovacs, co-chair of IUCN's Species Survival Commission Pinniped Specialist Group, which focuses on seals.",
      "The three species highlighted in the latest IUCN report \u2014 harp, hooded and bearded seals \u2014 have been moved up to a designation of greater concern in the latest update, indicating they are increasingly threatened by extinction, Kovacs said.",
      "The same melting of glaciers and sea ice destroying seal habitats also \"generally will bring escalation in extreme weather events, which are already impacting people around the globe,\" wrote Kovacs.",
      "\"Acting to help seals is acting to help humanity when it comes to climate change,\" Kovacs said.",
      "Global bird decline",
      "The update also highlighted Madagascar, West Africa and Central America, where Schlegel's asity, the black-casqued hornbill and the tail-bobbing northern nightingale-wren were all moved to near-threatened status. Those are three specific birds in trouble, but numbers are dropping for around three-fifths of birds globally.",
      "\"That three in five of the world's bird species have declining populations shows how deep the biodiversity crisis has become and how urgent it is that governments take the actions they have committed to under multiple conventions and agreements,\" said Ian Burfield, global science coordinator at BirdLife International.",
      "Deforestation of tropical forests is one of a \"depressing litany of threats\" to birds, a list that includes agricultural expansion and intensification, competition from invasive species and climate change, said Stuart Butchart, chief scientist at BirdLife International.",
      "\"The fact that 61% of the world's birds are declining is an alarm bell that we can't afford to ignore,\" Butchart said.",
      "The annual U.N. climate summit will be held in November in Belem, Brazil, with much attention on the Amazon and the value of tropical forests to humans and animals. But Farnsworth, of Cornell, said he was \"not so confident\" that world's leaders would take decisive action to protect imperiled bird species.",
      "\"I would like to think things like birds are nonpartisan, and you can find common ground,\" he said. \"But it's not easy.\"",
      "Green sea turtles",
      "One success story is the rebound of green sea turtles in many parts of the world's oceans. Experts see that as a bright spot because it shows how effective human interventions, like legal protections and conservation programs, can be.",
      "Still, \"it's important to note that conservation efforts of sea turtles can take decades before you realize the fruits of that labor,\" said Justin Perrault, vice president of research at Loggerhead Marinelife Center in Juno Beach, Florida, who wasn't involved with the IUCN report.",
      "The overall success with green sea turtles should be celebrated and used as an example with other species, some of which, like hawksbills and leatherbacks, aren't doing nearly as well, said Nicolas Pilcher, executive director of the Marine Research Foundation.",
      "And even for green sea turtles, areas still remain where climate change and other factors like erosion are damaging habitats, Pilcher said, and some of those are poorer communities that receive less conservation funding.",
      "But in the places where they have recovered, it's \"a great story of, actually, we can do something about this,\" Pilcher said. \"We can. We can make a difference.\"",
      "Extinct species",
      "The latest Red List notes that six species have moved to the extinct category. The IUCN says those species include the Christmas Island shrew and the slender-billed curlew, a migratory shorebird.",

      "A man was found dead on a mountain Wednesday in the northern Iwate region after a suspected bear attack, according to public broadcaster NHK, citing police.",
      "Separately, the 4.5-foot adult bear that entered the grocery store Tuesday evening in Numata, Gunma, north of Tokyo, lightly injured a man in his 70s and another in his 60s, regional police and fire officials said.",
      "The store is close to mountainous areas, but has never had bears come near before, Hiroshi Horikawa, a management planning official at the grocery store chain, told AFP.",
      "\"It entered from the main entrance and stayed inside for roughly four minutes,\" he said. \"It almost climbed onto the fish case and damaged glass. In the fruits section, it knocked over a pile of avocados and stamped on them.\"",
      "The store's manager told local media that around 30 to 40 customers were inside at the time, and that the bear became agitated as it struggled to find the exit.",

      "Between April and September, 108 people nationwide suffered injuries caused by bears, including five deaths, according to the environment ministry. There were a record number of human encounters with bears in Japan last year, with 219 attacks including six deaths in the 12 months to April 2024.",
      "The impacts of climate change on the bears' food sources and hibernation cycles has been cited by experts as a key factor, but there are also implications as Japan's aging population shrinks and humans abandon more rural areas.",
      "That depopulation has left bears \"a chance to expand their range,\" biologist Koji Yamazaki, from Tokyo University of Agriculture,\u00a0told CBS News' Elizabeth Palmer in 2023.",
      "Japan is one of the few places in the world where a large mammal species has been reclaiming habitat \u2014 which is good news for the bears, but if, as biologists suspect, the bear population is growing, the country will have to figure out new ways to protect people and vital infrastructure from the animals."

The speed of the area's weakening has increased since 2020, the ESA said, with different parts of the anomaly changing at different rates.",
      "\"The South Atlantic Anomaly is not just a single block,\" says lead author Chris Finlay, Professor of Geomagnetism at the Technical University of Denmark, in the ESA's news release. \"It's changing differently towards Africa than it is near South America. There's something special happening in this region that is causing the field to weaken in a more intense way.\"",
      "Finlay said that magnetic field lines emitting from the core are bouncing back into it. It's not clear why this is happening, but it is contributing to the anomaly's weakening in those areas, the ESA said.",
      "The ESA satellites found other changes in the Earth's magnetic field. In the southern hemisphere, there is another area where the magnetic field is particularly strong. Two other anomalies exist in the northern hemisphere: One near Canada and one over Siberia. Both are stronger than the rest of the field. However, the one near Canada has shrunk by an area the size of India, while the one over Siberia has grown by an area the size of Greenland, the ESA said.",
      "The satellites will continue to study the planet's magnetic field in the coming years, the ESA said.",
      "\"It's really wonderful to see the big picture of our dynamic Earth thanks to Swarm's extended timeseries,\" Swarm Mission manager Anja Stromme said in a statement. \"The satellites are all healthy and providing excellent data, so we can hopefully extend that record beyond 2030, when the solar minimum will allow more unprecedented insights into our planet.\""

    "story": [
      "If you plot the origins of the greatest inventions in history, you start to notice a pattern: The light bulb, the phonograph, the airplane, air conditioning, the zipper, the microwave, lasers, transistors, the personal computer, the internet, GPS, the smartphone \u2026 No country on Earth has as rich a history of modern invention as this one.",
      "But my question is, why is that? Well, the answer may start with a guy from Ohio: Thomas Edison, who we know as the inventor of the light bulb.",
      "\"Kind of,\" notes Hal Wallace, a curator at the Smithsonian's National Museum of American History. \"What we like to say is, Thomas Edison invented a commercially practical light bulb.\"",
      "Wallace says the light bulb was just one component of Edison's achievement: \"He was inventing new dynamoes, cables, switches, sockets, meters. If you're gonna sell electricity, you gotta have a meter. So, it's a systems approach.\"",
      "On New Year's Eve 1879, Edison gave an unforgettable demo in Menlo Park, New Jersey. Wallace said, \"He lit up the grounds, he lit up the laboratory, he lit up an office building with about a hundred of these light bulbs, and invited the press: 'Come out to Menlo Park and see what we've done.' He especially invited his investors!",
      "\"When the lights come on, it's almost a mystical experience, because these are not candles, they're not gas lights, they don't hiss, they don't smoke, they don't create noxious odors. You turn it on, it just sits and it glows.\"",
      "Edison's portfolio also included motion pictures, Portland cement, and even a talking doll, \"which is one of his famous flops,\" said Wallace.",
      "Steven Johnson, who has written 14 books about innovation and also co-founded a new Google AI tool for research called NotebookLM, says there are two archetypes many people use that are almost always wrong: \"They are the kind of lone genius coming up with a brilliant idea, and having that idea in a moment of sudden inspiration,\" he said. \"That is almost never the case.",
      "\"Edison gave a lot of credit to the crew,\" Johnson said. \"He has a famous line where he's like, 'I'm not so much a generator of ideas as I am a sponge.'\"",
      "Edison called Menlo Park \"the invention factory.\" He employed engineers, chemists, glassblowers, and mathematicians. Johnson said, \"He came up with this idea that if you got these interesting people together and put them in the same room together, that you could create a kind of a factory for new ideas. And that's what Menlo Park became.\"",
      "The pioneering spirit",
      "Today, Americans come up with more inventions than ever. Over the years, hundreds of entrepreneurs have appeared on ABC's \"Shark Tank,\" where they pitch a panel of potential investors, including real estate mogul Barbara Corcoran, Kind Bar founder Daniel Lubetzky, fashion pioneer Daymond John, and venture capitalist Rashaun Williams.",
      "\"They think their idea is always terrific,\" said Corcoran. \"It very often isn't. Anybody could come up with an idea, and everybody has at least a dozen. Really, everybody's got an idea, But building a business? Not many people can do it.\"",
      "She says most people coming into \"Shark Tank\" appreciate that the hard part is still ahead. But Lubetzky responded, \"It's not necessarily bad that entrepreneurs don't know how hard it will be.\"",
      "\"I would've never done what I've done, never,\" said John.",
      "Asked what it is about America that fosters such ingenuity, John replied, \"I think the people that founded the country went against all odds to come here. So, we got the cream of the crop of the world.\"",
      "Lubetzky added, \"You see also the pioneering spirit of all the immigrants and all the people that tried things out, and bring that spirit of risk-taking.\"",
      "\"And they bring that spirit on,\" said John. \"And then you have the top people around the world who left for either famine, atrocities, whatever, they made it over here, and they had a goal to make it over here. So they, first if all, are 1% of where they're from.\"",
      "Williams said, \"I think we have to give this government a lot of credit, too. A lot of the original venture capital funds were funded by government entities.\"",
      "Lubetzky said America's financial ecosystem \"allows ideas to be financed. Venture capital is much, much less developed in most other countries.\"",
      "And, Williams said, \"We also glamorize the successful entrepreneur in this country, just like we glamorize the professional athlete or entertainer. If you start a company and you sell it for $1 billion and you scale it, you're on the cover of every magazine. You're a superstar in this country.\"",
      "And, as for failure, Lubetzky said, \"In most of the world, if you fail, it's a negative mark on your family. And you are, you know -- it's horrible. You're an outcast. In the United States, you shrug it off and you try again.\"",
      "Corcoran said, \"The real question is, what do the successful entrepreneurs have in common? And I say what they have in common is the ability to get back up, take rejection.\"",
      "\"A pretty powerful combination\"",
      "According to Google's Steven Johnson, history is periodically upended by huge, foundational, technological breakthroughs.",
      "\"Edison realized that for the light bulb to work, he had to build an electrical grid,\" he said. \"But it was the grid that really changed everything, because once you had power to your homes, yeah, you could turn on a light, but you could also build a dishwasher, and you could have a television, and you could have a radio.\"",
      "The personal computer launched another huge round of innovation, and then the internet, and now artificial intelligence. All of it \u2026 invented in America.",
      "Johnson said, \"Openness to new ideas, willingness for consumers to experiment, that mix of a capitalist model with venture capital, [plus] government support and academic support, you put all those things together, and it's a pretty powerful combination.\"",

      "Flight delays\u00a0in some parts of the U.S. have ticked up since federal funding lapsed on Oct. 1, even as controllers, Transportation Security Administration officers and other air safety personnel are required to work without pay. Previous shutdowns have resulted in a spike in TSA officers and air traffic controllers calling out sick from work, contributing to delays and flight cancellations.",
      "Despite such inconveniences, aviation experts are confident that air travel remains safe. \"There is no slacking. FAA safety standards don't go on hiatus just because the government is shut down,\" Henry Harteveldt, founder and president of Atmosphere Research Group, a travel advisory firm, told CBS News.",
      "Flight delays due FAA staffing issues are rising because the agency is taking steps to ensure air travel remains as safe as before the shutdown, said Katy Nastro, an air travel expert at trip booking site Going.com.",
      "\"People should feel comfort that traffic is slowing, and ground delays are being put into place as an extra layer of safety, as a precautionary measure,\" she said. \"It shouldn't raise a red flag in any way.\"",
      "The bigger question for travelers, Nastro added, is \"What is your tolerance in terms of facing delays and such?\"",
      "Despite several aircraft collisions and some close calls this year, research shows that airline travel has become safer in recent years. The risk of a fatality from commercial air travel was 1 in every 13.7 million passenger boardings globally from 2018 to 2022, according to a 2024 MIT\u00a0study. That compares with 1 fatality for every in 7.9 million worldwide boardings from 2008 to 2017.",

      "He also alluded to the air traffic control staffing issues and highlighted the wider impact of just a few people not showing up for work. \"If you have a few controllers that call in sick, it will ricochet through the airspace, and we have delays because we are not overstaffed,\" he said, adding that controllers are \"incredibly frustrated\" by the shutdown.",
      "Sheldon Jacobson, an aviation security expert and professor of computer science at the University of Illinois Urbana-Champaign, said flight delays stemming from controller shortages are inconvenient, but do not point to a safety risk for travelers.",

      "Scott Keyes, founder of Going.com, said some anxiety around hopping on a plane during the government shutdown is understandable. \"A lot of us have an innate fear of being 30,000 feet above the ground, so any justification we can find for why flying might be more risky now is understandable,\" he said.",
      "But he emphasized that pilots have final say on whether it is unsafe to fly for whatever reason, including poor weather, mechanical problems or staffing shortages.",
      "\"They are entrusted to give that last line of authority and say things are safe to fly, and they are in constant communication with air traffic control, monitoring weather systems, and what the entire flying environment looks like,\" Keyes said.",
      "\"The risk of delays and cancellations is higher today than it was before, but I don't think that translates into a higher risk of safety accidents,\" he added.",
      "Harteveldt agreed that airline pilots \u2014 who aren't federal employees \u2014 wouldn't take off given any safety concerns.",
      "\"When a plane departs the gate, it's the airline pilot inspecting the plane and saying, 'Yes, this plane is clear to go.' FAA inspectors, or the shutdown, have nothing to do with that,\" he said.",
      "Airlines for America, a lobbying group representing major airlines, last week sought to reassure the public that flying during the shutdown is safe, while acknowledging that control tower staffing shortages could lead to delays.",
      "\"It is safe to fly, but ATC staffing shortages strain the system and cause flights to be spaced out, slowing down everything. In some cases, flights may be delayed or even cancelled,\" the group said in a statement. \"The bottom line is that anyone heading to the airport right now is encouraged to pack their patience.\""

    "summary": "Citing the shutdown, the Social Security Administration postponed its announcement of the annual payment bump beneficiaries will receive in 2026.",
    "story": [
      "The Social Security Administration's annual announcement setting next year's cost-of-living adjustment, or COLA, will be delayed because of the\u00a0government shutdown, the agency said.",
      "Each year, the Social Security Administration adjusts benefits for its 75 million recipients based on recent inflation data, which ensures that seniors, disabled Americans and other beneficiaries don't lose purchasing power as prices rise.",
      "Social Security had planned to announce the new COLA on Oct. 15, the same day the Labor Department was scheduled to release September Consumer Price Index data, a key measure of inflation. The COLA is determined by inflation figures for the third quarter, which covers July through September.",
      "With much of the government's economic data on hold until Congress approves federal funding, the Bureau of Labor Statistics now plans to release its latest CPI figures on Oct. 24, about nine days later than planned. The Social Security Administration told CBS News it plans to issue its COLA announcement that same day.",
      "\"The Bureau of Labor Statistics has announced they will issue the September 2025 Consumer Price Index on October 24,\" the Social Security Administration said in an Oct. 14 email. \"The Social Security Administration will use this release to generate and announce the 2026 cost-of-living adjustment on October 24 as well.\"",
      "The new COLA will take effect starting Jan. 1, 2026, without any delays due to the ongoing shutdown, the agency added.",
      "How much of a living adjustment?",
      "According to an estimate published last month by the Senior Citizens League, the annual COLA for 2026 could be around 2.7%, slightly higher than the 2.5% increase beneficiaries\u00a0received\u00a0in 2025.",
      "The League, an advocacy group for older Americans, based its most recent projection on\u00a0August inflation data\u00a0from the Bureau of Labor Statistics. Because the SSA will also include September inflation data in its COLA rate, that number could change when it's announced later this month.",
      "AARP, another advocacy group for older people, expects the 2026 COLA to range from 2.6% to 2.9%. A 2.7% boost in benefits would lift the average monthly payment for retired workers by $54, from $2,008 to $2,062.",
      "Where is inflation now?",
      "The September CPI is forecast to rise to an annual rate of 3.1% up from 2.9% in August, according to economists polled by FactSet.",
      "According to economists, inflation is edging higher due partly to the impact of the Trump administration's tariffs, which have hit imports from across the globe, such as clothing, food, steel and toys. While some businesses stockpiled imported goods earlier this year to avoid raising rising prices, some are now passing the import taxes\u00a0on to their customers.",
      "\"Core goods pressures have started to heat up, marking the beginning of a delayed tariff passthrough,\" RBC economists Michael Reid and Carrie Freestone said in an Oct. 14 report. \"Concerningly, the breadth of inflationary pressures has widened \u2014 45% of CPI basket items are now reporting price growth at or above 3%, compared to roughly two-thirds pre-pandemic.\"",
      "Some retirees could face a financial pinch if prices continues to climb and their 2026 Social Security adjustment fails to keep pace with inflation. The Federal Reserve\u00a0forecasts\u00a0that the Personal Consumption Expenditures price index, its favored measure of inflation, will rise to 3.1% this year before receding to 2.6% in 2026."

    "story": [
      "Washington \u2014 More than a decade after the Supreme Court gutted a key provision of the Voting Rights Act, and just two years after it declined to unravel another piece of the law, the Supreme Court will convene on Wednesday to hear a legal battle over Louisiana's congressional map that could reverberate throughout the nation.",
      "The consolidated cases, known as Louisiana v. Callais and Robinson v. Callais, could weaken Section 2 of the Voting Rights Act, which has been used to ensure minority voters have the opportunity to elect their preferred candidates.",
      "The legal fight has been before the justices before. In its last term, the Supreme Court weighed whether to leave in place Louisiana's House map that was redrawn in 2024 to include a second majority-Black district. But the high court declined to issue a ruling then and instead set it for reargument in its new term, which started last week.",
      "The Supreme Court then said in August that it would be considering whether state lawmakers' intentional drawing of a second majority-minority district \u2014 done to address a violation of the Voting Rights Act \u2014 runs afoul of the 14th and 15th Amendments of the Constitution.",
      "That new question raises the stakes of the case, as Republicans in Louisiana are urging the high court to prohibit the consideration of race in the drawing of voting lines. A decision in the state's favor could upend Section 2 and deliver another blow to the landmark civil rights law.",
      "\"Section 2 has had a major impact, definitely in the South, but really nationwide on improving political representation opportunities for voters in a lot of different communities of color and all around the country,\" said Kareem Crayton, vice president of the Brennan Center for Justice's office in Washington, D.C. \"A decision that leaves the current understanding of Section 2 in grave doubt opens up unfortunately a lot of chaos throughout the country in a lot of different jurisdictions.\"",
      "Arguments before the high court will play out as GOP lawmakers in several states have engaged in politically motivated efforts to recraft their district lines to help Republicans hold onto their majority in the House. The dispute involving Louisiana's map centers on the use of race in the map-making process, though if the state prevails, it would likely lead to challenges of existing maps that govern voting boundaries for not just Congress, but also local school boards, city councils and state legislatures.",
      "\"This is a gut check for the court: Does it want to sign off on another era where we just retreat from the commitment that was made that we're going to assure we don't live in a country where we subjugate people based on race, particularly in the political space?\" Crayton said.",
      "The fight over Louisiana's map",
      "The protracted dispute over Louisiana's congressional map dates back to 2022, when Republican state lawmakers crafted new House district boundaries to adjust for population changes after the 2020 Census. The original map comprised five majority-White districts and one majority-Black district. Nearly one third of Louisiana's population is Black, according to Census data.",
      "A group of African-American voters challenged those lines as a violation of Section 2 because, they argued, the map diluted Black voting strength. A judge in Baton Rouge agreed and ordered the state to put in place a remedial map with two majority-Black congressional districts.",
      "The new plan adopted by the Louisiana legislature in 2024 reconfigured the state's 6th Congressional District, which state lawmakers said was an effort to bring it into compliance with the Voting Rights Act. The new District 6 has a Black voting-age population of roughly 51% and stretches across the state from Shreveport, in Louisiana's northwest corner, to Baton Rouge, in the southeast. Rep. Cleo Fields, a Democrat who is Black, was elected to represent the district last November.",
      "But after the new map was adopted, a group of 12 self-described \"non-African-American\" voters filed a lawsuit challenging the lines. They alleged that the retooled District 6 was a racial gerrymander that violated the 14th Amendment's Equal Protection Clause.",
      "A divided panel of three judges in Shreveport sided with the voters and found that the state legislature relied too much on race when it crafted the new map.",
      "The case landed before the Supreme Court in its last term, with Louisiana Republicans joining with Black voters and voting rights groups in urging the justices to leave the new congressional map intact. But after the Supreme Court said it would consider the legal fight for a second time \u2014 a rare move \u2014 state GOP lawmakers abandoned their defense of the map.",
      "Instead, state officials are arguing that Louisiana's intentional creation of a second majority-minority district violates the Constitution's 14th and 15th Amendments.",
      "\"Our oath is to the Constitution,\" Louisiana Attorney General Elizabeth Murrill, a Republican, and Solicitor General Benjamin Aguinaga wrote in a filing. \"Our Constitution sees neither black voters nor white voters; it sees only American voters.\"",
      "The Voting Rights Act",
      "The 14th and 15th Amendments were adopted after the Civil War to guarantee Black people equal protection under the law and the right to vote. The amendments gave Congress the power to enact legislation enforcing their protections, and lawmakers exercised that authority when it passed the Voting Rights Act in 1965, which is known as the crown jewel of civil rights legislation.",
      "With bipartisan support, Congress amended Section 2 in 1982 and reauthorized the Voting Rights Act in 2006, when President George W. Bush signed it into law.",
      "\"Section 2 of the Voting Rights Act, which protects against the denial or abridgement of the right to vote on account of race or color, has been a durable centerpiece of the bipartisan legislation passed to make real our shared, national commitment,\" a group of former Republican lawmakers who backed the law and its amendments wrote in a brief. \"It stands as a monument to Congress's ability to act as the Constitution's Framers intended: to identify a national problem, to amass an extensive factual record, and to forge a lasting legislative solution.\"",
      "The Supreme Court will rehear the Louisiana case just over two years after it upheld Section 2 and reaffirmed the framework for proving vote dilution under the Voting Rights Act, which was set out in a 1986 ruling. The high court split 5-4 in that 2023 case, which involved a challenge to Alabama's congressional map, with Chief Justice John Roberts and Justice Brett Kavanaugh joining the three liberal justices in the majority.",
      "While the high court rejected the chance to weaken Section 2, Kavanaugh suggested that there must be an end-point for the use of race-based remedies.",
      "\"[T]he authority to conduct race-based redistricting cannot extend indefinitely into the future,\" Kavanaugh wrote in a concurring opinion. \"But Alabama did not raise that temporal argument in this Court, and I therefore would not consider it at this time.\"",
      "Both Kavanaugh and Roberts will be key as the Supreme Court weighs the constitutionality of race-based map-making. The two justices were also in the majority when the high court outlawed the use of race as a factor in college admissions, a decision that came down in the same term as the Alabama voting rights dispute.",
      "\"If in college admissions, if the quest for diversity \u2014 and by diversity, we really mean racial diversity, how someone looks, what their race is, the color of their skin, the shape of their eyes, the texture of their hair. It's how they look, it's who they are \u2014 that's not a compelling governmental interest to treat people differently, it must follow that treating people differently in order to create election districts that are geographically based will not stand,\" said Edward Blum, the president of Students for Fair Admissions, which successfully challenged affirmative action in higher education. Blum is also the director of Project on Fair Representation, a nonprofit organization that opposes racial and ethnic classifications.",
      "Roberts has long denounced racial classifications. In 2006, shortly after he joined the court, the chief justice wrote in a concurring opinion that \"it is a sordid business, this divvying us up by race.\" He also authored the majority opinion 12 years ago that dismantled Section 5 of the Voting Rights Act, writing, \"our country has changed, and while any racial discrimination in voting is too much, Congress must ensure that the legislation it passes to remedy that problem speaks to current conditions.\"",
      "\"America is no longer in the 1960s,\" Blum said. \"We have moved on, and to base election districts with the primary predicate being to create a racial district, a district in which a racial minority has the opportunity to elect a candidate of choice, that has now been the energy behind creating districts that no longer keep neighborhoods and civic associations and towns and communities together for the purposes of representation.\"",
      "It's unclear how far the Supreme Court will go in a decision, though several conservative justices have endorsed the vision of a \"colorblind Constitution.\" Louisiana officials and the voters who challenged the redrawn map have argued that any consideration of race when drawing voting lines is unconstitutional.",
      "The Trump administration is backing Louisiana in the case and has urged the Supreme Court to tighten the standards for proving unlawful vote dilution. The framework in place since 1986 requires plaintiffs to show racial polarization in voting, in addition to other preconditions.",
      "\"Too often, Section 2 is deployed as a form of electoral race-based affirmative action to undo a State's constitutional pursuit of political ends. That misuse of Section 2 is unconstitutional,\" Solicitor General D. John Sauer wrote in a filing.",
      "But voting rights groups fear that changing the longstanding framework for how courts evaluate potential violations of Section 2 would undercut its aim of ensuring equal opportunities for minority voters.",
      "\"Because it's so difficult to prove and is one of the only avenues that minority voters have to challenge these districts, it could have potential reverberations to make it incredibly difficult for minority voters to achieve equal representation through district lines,\" Sara Rohani, a lawyer with the NAACP Legal Defense Fund, told CBS News.",
      "A decision from the Supreme Court is expected by the end of June or early July."

    "link": "https://www.cbsnews.com/news/jerome-powell-speech-today-federal-reserve-labor-market-rate-cuts/",
    "published": "Tue, 14 Oct 2025 15:12:19 -0400",
    "summary": "Powell said the labor market's outlook hasn't changed much since the central bank's September meeting, when it penciled in two more rate cuts this year.",
    "story": [
      "Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell on Tuesday emphasized that a sharp slowdown in hiring poses a growing risk to the U.S. economy, a sign that the central bank will likely cut its key interest rate twice more this year.",
      "Powell, who spoke today before the National Association of Business Economics in Philadelphia, said that despite the federal government shutdown cutting off official economic data, \"the outlook for employment and inflation does not appear to have changed much since our September meeting,\" when the Fed reduced its key rate for the first time this year.",
      "Fed officials at the September meeting also forecast that the central bank would reduce its rate twice more this year and once in 2026. Lower rates from the Fed could\u00a0reduce borrowing costs for consumer and business loans, making it cheaper for businesses to expand operations and hire new workers, and for Americans to buy houses, autos and other items.",
      "\"Holding rates higher presents risks to the job market. Job creation is below trend given the pace of economic growth,\" noted Scott Helfstein, head of investment strategy at investment firm Global X, in an emailed response to Powell's comments. \"The Fed is still likely to cut rates in October and December, but investors should be prepared for a range of outcomes as Powell is trying to leave all options open.\"",
      "The Fed's next rate decision will be made at its Oct. 29 meeting. Following that, the central bank has one more rate decision meeting scheduled in 2025, set for Dec. 10.",
      "Powell reiterated a message he first delivered after the September meeting, when he signaled that the Fed is slightly more worried about the job market than its other congressional mandate, which is to keep prices stable. Tariffs have lifted the Fed's preferred measure of inflation to 2.9%, he said, but outside the duties there aren't \"broader inflationary pressures\" that will keep prices high.",
      "\"Rising downside risks to employment have shifted our assessment of the balance of risks,\" he said.",
      "Powell also said that the central bank may soon stop shrinking its roughly $6.6 trillion balance sheet. The Fed has been allowing roughly $40 billion of Treasuries and mortgage-backed securities to mature each month without replacing them. The shift could weigh on longer-term Treasury interest rates.",
      "Separately, Powell spent most of his speech defending the Fed's practice of buying longer-term Treasury bonds and mortgage-backed securities in 2020 and 2021, which were intended to lower longer-term interest rates and support the economy during the pandemic.",
      "Yet those purchases have come under a torrent of criticism from Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent, as well as some of the\u00a0candidates\u00a0floated by the Trump administration to replace Powell when his term as Chair ends next May.",
      "Bessent said in an extended critique\u00a0published earlier this year\u00a0that the huge purchases of bonds during the pandemic worsened inequality by boosting the stock market, without providing noticeable benefits to the economy.",
      "Other critics have long argued that the Fed kept implementing the purchases for too long, keeping interest rates low even as inflation began to spike in late 2021. The Fed beginning in 2021 stopped the purchases and then sharply boosted borrowing costs to combat inflation.",
      "\"With the clarity of hindsight, we could have\u2014and perhaps should have\u2014stopped asset purchases sooner,\" Powell said. \"Our real-time decisions were intended to serve as insurance against downside risk.\"",
      "Powell also said the purchases were intended to avoid a breakdown in the market for Treasury securities, which could have sent interest rates much higher."

    "summary": "Missouri is set to execute a death row inmate for fatally shooting a state trooper in 2005. The inmate, Lance Shockley, says he did not commit the crime.",
    "story": [
      "A death row inmate in Missouri is set to be executed Tuesday after the state's governor denied his clemency petition.",
      "Lance Shockley, 48, was convicted of first-degree murder for fatally shooting a Missouri state trooper in 2005, court records show. Shockley has maintained his innocence for the last 20 years, as his lawyers argued in multiple rounds of appeals that their client did not receive a fair trial or sentencing, claims that the state repeatedly refuted.",
      "Missouri Gov. Mike Kehoe on Monday announced his decision to reject Shockley's plea to stay the execution, allowing the corrections department to proceed as planned with his lethal injection at the state prison in Bonne Terre.",
      "\"Mr. Shockley has received every legal protection afforded to him under the Missouri and United States Constitutions, and his conviction and sentence will remain for his brutal and deliberate crime,\" said Kehoe in the announcement. \"The State of Missouri has\u2014and will continue to\u2014pursue justice to the fullest extent of the law. Carrying out Lance Shockley's sentence is evidence of our commitment to the pursuit of justice.\"",
      "A jury unanimously convicted Shockley in the death of Missouri State Highway Patrol Sgt. Carl Graham, who was killed at his home on March 20, 2005, according to court records. Prosecutors had said during Shockley's trial that before Graham's murder, the patrolman was investigating Shockley for manslaughter, in connection with a car accident that took place in November 2004 and resulted in the death of a passenger, who was Shockley's friend, the records said.",
      "Prosecutors said Shockley murdered Graham in an effort to stop his investigation into the wreck. Prosecutors alleged he drove to the patrolman's house, waited for Graham to return home, and, as he was exiting his vehicle, shot the state trooper multiple times before leaving the scene.",
      "The prosecution said Shockley had borrowed a red Pontiac Grand Am from his grandmother on the day of the murder, and witnesses reported seeing a red car parked near Graham's home around the time it happened, according to court records. They also said bullet fragments found at the property of Shockley's uncle matched those recovered at the scene of the shooting.",
      "But Shockley's attorneys have argued the state's case against him relied predominantly on circumstantial evidence. They also say the state failed to conduct DNA testing on \"numerous pieces of critical evidence\" found at the site of Graham's murder.",
      "\"From the beginning, this case has suffered from a failure of due diligence,\" said Jeremy Weis, one of Shockley's attorneys, in a July statement released through a website advocating for his client's clemency.",
      "\"There are significant issues with the prosecution's timeline. Several other viable suspects were overlooked and to this day, numerous pieces of critical evidence, up to 16 items, have never been tested for DNA,\" Weis' statement continued. \"These items could hold the key to the truth to what really happened on March 20, 2005. Despite these facts, the court denied our motion to conduct DNA testing.\"",
      "Although jurors convicted Shockley in Graham's murder, they could not agree on whether to sentence him to life in prison or impose capital punishment, court records show. Because of the deadlock, a trial court judge presiding over Shockley's case decided the sentence, and sentenced him to death.",
      "Missouri and Indiana are the only two states in the U.S. where a judge can impose a death sentence in situations where the jury deadlocks on sentencing, according to the Death Penalty Information Center, a nonprofit organization that shares data and other resources about capital punishment but does not take a position on the issue."

      "That's because new content settings for Instagram users under 18 will adhere to the same regulations. The new automatic protections are being rolled by the company starting Tuesday and will be fully implemented by the end of the year, according to Meta.",
      "\"We hope this update reassures parents that we're working to show teens safe, age-appropriate content on Instagram by default, while also giving them more ways to shape their teen's experience,\" the company said in the announcement.",
      "PG-13, a rating used in the media industry, indicates that parental guidance is suggested when watching content, particularly for children under 13.",
      "What are the new restrictions?",
      "The accounts of Instagram users under 18 will now be automatically be placed under a 13+ setting. Opting out of the setting will require parental permission.",
      "Teens with the setting will be blocked from seeing search results for terms like \"alcohol\" or \"gore.\" This adds to list of search topics from which Meta said it already shields teens, such as suicide, self-harm and eating disorders.",
      "Teens will also be prevented from following accounts that regularly posts content deemed age-inappropriate. Instagram users under 18 who already follow such accounts, will no longer be able to see or interact with their content, send them DMs, or see their comments under anyone's posts.",
      "Meta is also applying the new regulations to its artificial intelligence technology which is integrated into Instagram to help answer users' questions. \"A.I.s should not give age-inappropriate responses that would feel out of place in a PG-13 movie,\" Meta said Tuesday.",
      "The social media company is also unveiling a separate setting for parents who prefer a \"more restrictive experience for their teen.\" That setting, called \"Limited Content,\" filters more content out from teens' feeds while also restricting their ability to see, leave or receive comments on posts.",
      "Meta introduced \"Teen Accounts\" last year, billing the move as a way to protect the safety of its younger user base. The company's new teen restrictions follow similar announcements by\u00a0YouTube\u00a0and\u00a0OpenAI."

      "During a government shutdown, all active-duty personnel, as well as National Guard who are currently deployed, must carry out their assigned duties with their pay delayed until the shutdown is over. Civilian personnel whose work the Defense Department considers essential, or \"excepted,\" will also continue to work, while other civilians are furloughed for the duration of the shutdown.",
      "\"After the government shutdown, all government employees will automatically receive back pay, based on the terms of the Government Employee Fair Treatment Act of 2019,\" said Seamus Daniels, a fellow for Defense Budget Analysis at the Center for Strategic and International Studies.",
      "Active-duty service members won't get paid on time unless Congress passes a separate piece of legislation, as it did in 2013 with the \"Pay Our Military Act,\" which ensured military pay and allowances continued during a government shutdown.",
      "Republican Rep. Jen Kiggans of Virginia introduced a bill earlier this month with bipartisan support, the \"Pay Our Troops Act of 2026,\" which would keep members of the military and Coast Guard paid during a shutdown, but it did not pass in time because the House is out of session until Oct 7.",
      "During the last shutdown in 2019, the Navy Federal Credit Union and USAA offered special loans to members of the military, and they plan to do so again if there's a shutdown in October. The Navy Federal Credit Union said in a\u00a0press release\u00a0it would \"offer 0% APR loans to eligible members whose pay may be affected, continuing a tradition of assistance seen during previous shutdowns in 2011, 2013 and 2018-2019, when nearly 20,000 members received support.\" USAA plans to offer eligible members who have accounts with the bank a \"no-interest loan equal to the amount of one net paycheck.\"",

      "During the shutdown, medical care and dental care will be excepted, according to the contingency guidance, but elective surgeries and other elective procedures would be delayed unless they're necessary for military readiness. Private health care using the Defense Department's TRICARE medical insurance would continue uninterrupted."

    "story": [
      "Although a short U.S. government shutdown would be unlikely to have much impact on air travel, a prolonged impasse could lead to disruptions for passengers and financial losses for businesses, according to travel experts and industry groups.",
      "The Federal Aviation Administration and Transportation Security Administration define most of their employees as essential, requiring them to work even if the government closes and workers at other federal agencies are furloughed. That means airport screeners, air traffic controllers, federal air marshals, safety inspectors and other workers with the two agencies are expected to continue showing up on the job \u2014 without pay \u2014 even as lawmakers failed this week to strike a deal on federal funding.",
      "But things could get messy if a shutdown dragged on and government employees suddenly deprived of a paycheck come under financial pressure, Caleb Harmon-Marshall, a former TSA officer, told CBS News.",
      "\"TSA officers are expected to continue to report to work. But in the past, if a shutdown exceeds two weeks, officers start to get frantic, and they stop going to work,\" he said, adding that agency personnel may call in sick and even seek other job opportunities if a shutdown persists.",
      "Any ensuing labor shortages can lead to snarled lines at airport security. For example, roughly 10% of TSA workers called in sick during the 34-day government shutdown that started in December 2018 and extended into 2019, driving up screening times at major airports across the country.",
      "\"So if officers decide not to come to work, there is less personnel manning checkpoints, and wait times can potentially get longer,\" Harmon-Marshall said.",
      "A shutdown began at 12:01 a.m. on Wednesday, Oct. 1, after the Senate on Tuesday voted down two competing Democratic and Republican proposals to keep the government funded. If lawmakers passed a spending bill, TSA and FAA workers would be entitled to back pay for any time worked during a shutdown.",
      "$1 billion hit",
      "The U.S. Travel Association, a trade group, warned that a government shutdown could cost the economy $1 billion a week, while also inconveniencing passengers and hurting travel industry businesses.",
      "\"A shutdown exacerbates staffing shortages among Transportation Security Administration officers and air traffic controllers, threatening longer airport security lines, flight delays and cancellations,\" the group said in a Sept. 25 letter. \"It halts hiring and training of new air traffic controllers when we are already short more than 2,800 controllers nationwide, and restarting the process adds further delays even after funding is restored.\"",
      "The U.S. is already experiencing a shortage of air traffic controllers, and has launched an effort to hire more than 2,000 additional controllers by the end of the fiscal year.",
      "Neither the White House nor the Transportation Department responded to requests for comment about the impact of a potential government shutdown on travel in the U.S.",
      "By contrast, train travel is unlikely to be disrupted if the government closes this week, according to the Rail Passengers Association, which represents the nation's rail travelers. Although Amtrak receives some federal funding and could eventually be impacted if a shutdown dragged on, the rail service is financially healthy enough to pay workers in the near term and keep trains in operation, the group\u00a0said in a statement last week.",

      "Even with a U.S. government shutdown beginning on Wednesday, Oct. 1, the 74 million Americans who collect Social Security will continue receiving their monthly checks, although some services could be disrupted due to a potential halt in federal activities, according to experts.",
      "Social Security benefits are covered by mandatory spending, which means that the funding for the program has already been approved by Congress without an expiration date. As a result, Social Security recipients, including retirees, disabled Americans and the dependents of deceased workers, wouldn't see an interruption in their monthly payments if the government shuts down.",
      "However, other Social Security services could be impacted by a shutdown, according to the National Committee to Preserve Social Security & Medicare. The Social Security Administration's working budget requires approval from Congress. The Senate on Tuesday voted down two competing Democratic and Republican proposals to keep the government funded past Sept. 30.",
      "With no agreement having been reached, some Social Security services could be temporarily halted until the issue is resolved, according to both the Social Security Administration and experts on the retirement program.",
      "\"The system hasn't missed a payment in its entire 90-year history and won't start now,\" Max Richtman, CEO of the National Committee to Preserve Social Security & Medicare, said in an email. \"But customer service at the Social Security Administration (SSA) may be disrupted, including benefit verifications, earnings record corrections and updates, overpayments processing, and replacing Medicare cards.\"",
      "In preparation for past shutdowns, each federal agency has created a contingency plan for its operations, with some employees expected to work without pay because they're considered to be providing essential services. In an email to CBS News, the SSA said beneficiaries would continue to receive payments even if the government closes.",
      "\"In the event of a lapse in appropriation, SSA will follow the contingency plan for continued activities, and Social Security beneficiaries would continue receiving their Social Security, Social Security Disability Insurance, and SSI payments,\" an agency spokesperson said.",
      "Which Social Security services could be impacted?",
      "That would depend on how many SSA employees are deemed to be essential, according to the National Committee to Preserve Social Security & Medicare.",
      "In a Sept. 24 contingency plan\u00a0published\u00a0by the SSA, the agency said about 45,000 employees \u2014 almost 90% of its workforce \u2014 would stay on the job in case of a shutdown. Another roughly 6,200 workers would be furloughed, according to the planning document.",
      "\"We will continue activities critical to our direct-service operations and those needed to ensure accurate and timely payment of benefits,\" the plan states. \"We will cease activities not directly related to the accurate and timely payment of benefits or not critical to our direct-service operations.\"",

      "Another aspect of Social Security could be delayed due to a shutdown: the Social Security Administration's annual announcement of the cost-of-living adjustment, or COLA, to beneficiaries' monthly payments. The COLA is intended to ensure that people's benefits keep up with inflation and that the value of their Social Security income doesn't erode over time.",
      "The SSA announces the annual COLA each October when the Labor Department releases its Consumer Price Index data that month, which this year is scheduled for Oct. 15. But there could be a hitch this year if federal agencies shut down, according to the Labor Department.",
      "\"A delay of the CPI release during October of each year might have an impact on the Cost of Living Adjustment announcement by the Social Security Administration,\" the Labor Department said in issuing a\u00a0contingency plan that covers the impact of a possible shutdown on its operations.",
      "When is the next Social Security payment?",
      "Social Security payments would continue to go out as usual during a shutdown, with recipients of Supplemental Security Income \u2014 a program for low-income and disabled people \u2014 scheduled to receive their next checks on Oct. 1.",
      "Social Security recipients will receive their checks on their usual schedule, which is based on their birth date. Those born between the 1st to 10th of their birth month will receive payment on Oct. 8, while those born between the 11th to 20th days will receive their payment on Oct. 15.

    "summary": "Some people taking out a home loan and purchasing flood insurance could face delays during the U.S. government shutdown.",
    "story": [
      "Americans worried that the U.S. government shutdown could derail their plans to take out a mortgage or refinance their home loan can breathe easy \u2014 mostly. Housing experts says lenders will continue processing mortgages as usual even if federal agencies close shop, while noting that a shutdown could lead to hitches for borrowers applying for government-backed loans.",
      "\"If you're expecting to close in a week or a month, there could be some slight delay,\" said Jeff Ostrowski, a housing analyst at Bankrate. \"But I think for most people, it's probably going to be a blip more than a real deal killer.\"",
      "The bulk of the mortgage market consists of loans originated by private lenders. But some government agencies have a hand in the process, such as the Federal Housing Administration (FHA) insuring private loans or Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) managing flood insurance policies.",
      "Impact on government-backed loans",
      "Borrowers applying for a conventional mortgage issued by a bank, credit union or other private lender are unlikely to encounter problems if the government closes shop. However, those applying for government-backed loans from agencies like the FHA, Department of Veteran Affairs an Department of Agriculture (USDA) could face minor delays lining up their mortgages, Holden Lewis, a senior writer at NerdWallet, told CBS MoneyWatch in an email.",
      "The National Association of Realtors (NAR) notes in an online\u00a0explainer\u00a0that the FHA will continue to approve most single-family mortgage loans in the event of a shutdown. The VA will also continue to guarantee home loans, but worker furloughs at the agency could lead to processing delays, the group said.",
      "\"It creates a little bit of extra stress and uncertainty, but I haven't seen a shutdown in either of those programs\" when politics led the government to shut it doors in the past, Ostrowski said.",
      "The VA and FHA account for up to a quarter of all mortgage applications, according to\u00a0Redfin. NAR\u00a0advises\u00a0U.S. veterans applying for or refinancing a government-backed loan to check with their lender on how long it will take to complete the process if the government shuts down.",
      "Another segment of the housing market that could feel the impact of the shutdown are people applying for mortgages through the USDA, which issues loans to buyers in eligible towns and rural areas. NAR\u00a0said the USDA will halt issuance of new direct and guaranteed home loans during a shutdown. Pre-scheduled direct\u2011loan closings will also be postponed.",
      "The USDA did not respond to a request for comment. The VA referred CBS News to its shutdown contingency plan, which says the agency will continue issuing \"housing benefits.\"",
      "Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac, the government-sponsored entities that support roughly 70% of the mortgage market, don't rely on federal funding and have continued to operate during past shutdowns. However, they could face bottlenecks if federal agencies close down this week, said Anthony Smith, an applied economist at Realtor.com.",
      "\"They rely on other federal processes like the IRS for tax transcript verifications,\" he said. \"So if the IRS shuts down or significantly cuts back on its transcript services, then Fannie and Freddie might be able to approve a loan, but they can't get the final verification piece.\"",
      "Possible flood insurance delays",
      "People purchasing a house in a flood zone could also face delays during a government shutdown, experts told CBS News. That's because homebuyers applying for a federally backed mortgage in high-risk flood areas are required to get flood insurance. A shutdown could hamper the FEMA-administered National Flood Insurance Program, which underwrites more than 4 million flood insurance policies in the U.S.",
      "\"The government shutdown could complicate your closing because it might be harder to just secure flood insurance,\" Ostrowski told CBS News.",
      "FEMA did not respond to a request for comment.",
      "According to the White House, the flood insurance program cannot sell new or renewal insurance policies during a government shutdown.\"A potential lapse of the NFIP authorization would negatively impact many thousands of Americans who would be left unable to renew/transfer their coverage or to buy the required coverage for their homes,\" a White House official said in an email."

    "story": [
      "Washington \u2014 The Supreme Court on Monday rejected a bid to revive a lawsuit brought by two Colorado families who alleged their parental rights were violated when their children attended school-sponsored club meetings that included discussions of gender identity and sexuality and were allegedly discouraged from telling their parents about it.",
      "Though the high court turned away the case, Justices Samuel Alito, joined by Justices Clarence Thomas and Neil Gorsuch, wrote separately to express concern with what Alito said was an unwillingness by courts to confront whether a school district violates parents' rights when it encourages a student's gender transition without the parents' knowledge or consent.",
      "\"Petitioners tell us that nearly 6,000 public schools have policies \u2014 as respondent allegedly does \u2014 that purposefully interfere with parents' access to critical information about their children's gender-identity choices and school personnel's involvement in and influence on those choices,\" Alito wrote. \"The troubling \u2014 and tragic \u2014 allegations in this case underscore the 'great and growing national importance\" of the question that these parent petitioners present.'\"",
      "The legal fight was brought by two sets of parents \u2014 Jonathan and Erin Lee, and Nicolas and Linnaea Jurich \u2014 who asked the Supreme Court to reaffirm that parents have a constitutional right to make decisions about their children's care and upbringing. The families claimed that parents' legal authority is being undercut by school districts nationwide.",
      "The families challenged policies implemented by the Poudre School District R-1 in Wellington, Colorado, which they say urge district employees not to disclose information about a students' gender identity, including to parents.",
      "In one instance, the Lees' daughter, identified in court papers as C.L., was urged to attend a meeting of the Gender and Sexualities Alliance at her middle school. During the meeting, a substitute teacher in the school district spoke about gender identity and sexual orientation, and warned students that it may not be safe to tell their parents about the discussion, according to court papers.",
      "C.L. announced during the meeting that she was transgender, and told her parents when she went home, the family said in a Supreme Court filing. She also recounted the events of the meeting, after which C.L.'s parents removed her from the school district and enrolled their daughter in a private school, according to court filings.",
      "The Lees contacted the school's principal to discuss what occurred at the GSA meeting, and he told the parents that the meetings were expected to be confidential to ensure a safe space for open conversation, according to court papers.",
      "A second student, the Jurichs' daughter, who is identified in court papers as H.J., had a similar experience at after-school GSA meetings, which included discussions of gender identity and the warning about sharing the discussions with her parents.",
      "H.J. was later disenrolled from the middle school after starting eighth grade, when she told her parents she felt unsafe about being in the same building as a teacher who encouraged her to attend the GSA meetings, according to court filings.",
      "Both sets of parents sued the Poudre School District, alleging that their 14th Amendment rights were violated by interfering with their decision-making as parents. They sought monetary damages to reimburse the cost of private school, medical expenses, counseling fees and other costs.",
      "But a federal district court dismissed the lawsuit, and later denied their attempt to amend their suit. The U.S. Court of Appeals for the 10th Circuit upheld that decision on procedural grounds.",
      "In urging the Supreme Court to take up the case, lawyers for the parents warned that the lower court rulings invite the school district to \"continue surreptitiously wresting decision-making authority from fit parents unawares and instead vesting that authority in school officials.\"",
      "\"America's long history of protecting parents' legal authority in raising their children is being deliberately dismantled by school districts across the country that have enacted policies to replace parental authority with governmental authority,\" they wrote in a filing. \"These policies actively deprive parents of the very information they need to exercise their legal rights and moral obligations to act in their children's best interests.\"",
      "But the school district said the Supreme Court should turn the case away and argued that the parents were effectively seeking an \"advisory opinion\" that is outside the jurisdiction of federal courts.",
      "\"[T]he parents seek an advisory opinion that would fail to afford them any relief from the rulings below, and this is the wrong case to consider whether a public school employee's alleged discouraged disclosure regarding gender identity and expression implicates a fundamental right,\" they wrote in a filing."

      "Washington \u2014 The Supreme Court on Monday said it will not consider whether the online dating platform Grindr can be sued for sex trafficking and other offenses by a young user who was sexually assaulted by men he matched with on the app.",
      "In turning away the case, the high court passed up a chance to examine the scope of Section 230, a powerful tool for online companies that immunizes them from civil lawsuits stemming from content posted by third parties. The Supreme Court has in the past been confronted with cases asking it to decide the parameters of immunity under Section 230, but it has skirted rulings that could have limited the legal shield.",
      "Defenders of Section 230, which was enacted in 1996, have said that the law paved the way for online innovation and has allowed internet platforms both big and small to flourish. But critics have warned that courts have interpreted Section 230 too broadly, allowing social media platforms and other internet companies to escape accountability.",
      "Among those calling for the Supreme Court to examine the bounds of Section 230 are Justices Neil Gorsuch and Clarence Thomas, who warned last year that social media companies have used the legal shield as a \"get-out-of-jail-free card.\"",
      "The Grindr lawsuit",
      "The case dates back to 2019, when a 15-year-old boy living in Canada, identified in court filings as John Doe, downloaded Grindr and created a profile. Grindr did not verify his age, he said, and the app matched the boy with four adult men living in his area. Doe met the men in person, and was sexually assaulted and raped, according to court filings. Three of the four men were convicted for their crimes against Doe.",
      "Doe filed a lawsuit against Grindr in 2023 for sex trafficking and other violations, including alleging that the app is defective because it recommends adults and children for in-person sexual encounters, which are illegal. He claimed that Grindr intentionally markets its app to children and allows them to create profiles without parental permission or supervision, despite knowing that the platform puts young people at risk.",
      "Grindr sought to dismiss the case, arguing in part that Section 230 shielded it from liability because Doe's claims stemmed from the publication of content created by third parties.",
      "A federal judge found Grindr was entitled to immunity under Section 230 and agreed to toss out the case, determining that the app's match function relies on third-party content generated by its users, namely their profile and geolocation data that is extracted from their phones.",
      "The U.S. Court of Appeals for the 9th Circuit upheld the lower court's dismissal of Doe's case. The appeals court said Doe faulted Grindr for \"facilitating communication among users for illegal activity\" and failing to suppress matches and conversations between adults and children. Those actions, it said, would involve the platform's role as a publisher of third-party content.",
      "Doe appealed to the Supreme Court and argued the federal courts of appeals are divided on how to interpret the scope of Section 230, particularly when it involves treating platforms as publishers, or whether the content is a third party's.",
      "They said that for nearly three decades, courts have begun to expand the scope of Section 230 to provide sweeping immunity to online platforms.",
      "\"Section 230 was passed in 1995 to make the Internet safer,\" Doe's lawyers wrote in a filing. \"Instead, it created a hunting ground for predators, and a goldmine for amoral companies who need not invest in providing safe products. Delay will guarantee more victims.\"",
      "But lawyers for Grindr said Doe misrepresented his age in order to gain access to the platform, dooming his attempts to claim that Grindr knowingly engaged in sex trafficking since the app forbids minors from using it.",
      "\"At its core, this case involves user-to-user communications on an online platform, where Grindr's role was confined to providing the digital infrastructure for those interactions,\" they wrote in a filing to the Supreme Court.",
      "Grindr's lawyers said that Section 230 protects it from liability for its decisions about user content, namely what to screen, block, publish or take down.",
      "In 2023, the Supreme Court considered the scope of Section 230 for the first time, and specifically whether its protections extended to targeted recommendations of information. But the high court declined to address Section 230 directly in its decision and instead ruled on technical grounds.",
      "The Supreme Court turned away another case involving Section 230 and the photo and video-sharing app Snapchat last year, which was brought by an unnamed teenager who alleged his science teacher used the platform to groom him and send him sexually explicit content."

More than 50 people had been rescued \u2014 some plucked from rooftops.",
      "Officials warned of a long road to recovery and a need for continued support for the hardest-hit communities with winter just around the corner. A U.S. Coast Guard official, Capt. Christopher Culpepper, described the situation in the villages of Kipnuk and Kwigillingok as \"absolute devastation.\"",
      "Alaska State Troopers said at least 51 people and two dogs were rescued in Kipnuk and Kwigillingok after the storm system walloped the communities. Both areas saw significant storm surge, according to the National Weather Service.",
      "A woman was found dead and two people remained unaccounted for in Kwigillingok, troopers said. The agency earlier said it was working to confirm secondhand reports of people who were unaccounted for in Kipnuk but it said late Monday that troopers had determined no one there was missing.",
      "Troopers said it and several other agencies were searching by boat and from the air for the missing people. Troopers said they also sent a helicopter from Fairbanks to aid in the search and deliver generators and fuel to the communities.",
      "Coping as storm was hitting",
      "According to the nonprofit Coastal Villages Region Fund, most of the residents in both communities had taken shelter in local schools.",
      "In addition to housing concerns, residents impacted by the system across the region reported power outages, a lack of running water, subsistence foods stocked in freezers ruined and damage to home-heating stoves. That damage could make the winter difficult in remote communities where people store food from hunting and fishing to help make it through the season.",
      "Jamie Jenkins, 42, who lives in another hard-hit community, Napakiak, said the storm was \"the worst I've ever seen.\" She described howling winds and fast-rising waters Sunday morning.",
      "Her mother \u2014 whose nearby home shifted on its foundation \u2014 and a neighbor whose home flooded came over to Jenkins' place. They tried to wait out the storm, she said, but when the waters reached their top stairs, they got in a boat and evacuated to the school.",
      "Jenkins said \"practically the whole community\" was there. The men in town gathered their boats and went house to house to pick up anyone else who was still in their homes, she said.",
      "Adaline Pete, who lives in another community, Kotlik, said she had never experienced winds so strong. An unoccupied house next door flipped over but she said her family felt safe in their home.",
      "Climate funds in doubt",
      "During a news conference organized by Gov. Mike Dunleavy, Alaska's two U.S. senators, Lisa Murkowski and Dan Sullivan, said they would continue to focus on climate resilience and infrastructure funds for Alaska. Sullivan said it was the congressional delegation's job to ensure the Trump administration and their colleagues understood the importance of such funds.",
      "Earlier this year, the Federal Emergency Management Agency said it would end a program aimed at mitigating disaster risks. The decision is being challenged in court.",
      "Murkowski said erosion mitigation projects take time to complete. \"But our reality is, we are seeing these storms coming ... certainly on a more frequent basis, and the intensity that we're seeing seems to be accumulating as well, and so the time to act on it is now because it's going to take us some time to get these in place,\" she said of such projects.",
      "About 380 people live in Kwigillingok, a predominately Alaska Native community on the western shore of Kuskokwim Bay and near the mouth of the Kuskokwim River. A report prepared for the local tribe in 2022 by the Alaska Institute for Justice said the frequency and severity of flooding in the low-lying region had increased in recent years. The report listed relocation of the community as an urgent need.",
      "Erosion and melting permafrost pose threats to infrastructure and in some cases entire communities in Alaska, which is experiencing the impacts of climate change."

    "story": [
      "Travelers planning to fly into or out of U.S. airports could feel the impact of staffing issues, which continue to build as the government shutdown\u00a0reached its 10th day Friday.",
      "The \"national picture today looks a little messy,\" CBS News senior transportation correspondent Kris Van Cleave said from Los Angeles International Airport on Friday.",
      "Across the U.S., roughly 52,000 flights are scheduled ahead of the\u00a0Columbus Day\u00a0weekend, according to the Federal Aviation Administration.",
      "Tasked with keeping travelers safe on the ground and in the air, TSA officers and air traffic controllers are\u00a0deemed essential\u00a0by the government, requiring them\u00a0to keep working\u00a0during the shutdown without immediate pay.",
      "However, an uptick in workers calling out sick has led to sporadic flight delays and cancellations, raising concerns over staffing shortages. The scheduling irregularities come as\u00a0potential weather disruptions\u00a0are expected across the East Coast and in Phoenix.",
      "\"On top of that you have uncertainty that's been injected into basically everyone's travels because of the staffing situation that we're seeing pop up sporadically throughout the air traffic control system,\" Van Cleave said.",
      "Typically, air traffic controller shortages drive about 5% of all flight delays. That figure is currently 53%, Transportation Secretary Sean Duffy told Fox Business.",
      "\"It doesn't look like its a coordinated or targeted sick out per se, but you're seeing more sick calls than you would normally see, and so, everyday, particularly as we get into the afternoon and evening hours, multiple FAA facilities have what are called staffing triggers, where they are short-staffed basically,\" Van Cleave said.",
      "\"And some of those don't result in a whole lot of disruption, and then we've seen others that have been pretty disruptive,\" he added.",
      "For example, at Nashville International Airport in Tennessee on Thursday, roughly 40,000 flyers were inconvenienced by an air traffic controller shortage. \"So it's not nothing, even if the vast majority off air traffic controllers are working,\" Van Cleave said.",
      "Air traffic controllers who violate agency sick leave policies will face repercussions, Secretary Duffy said this week.",
      "The National Air Traffic Controllers Association, the union representing such workers, said in a statement on its\u00a0website\u00a0that it does not condone their members taking actions that would compromise the safety of the nation's airspace. The union also urged workers to keep showing up on the job, despite not being paid on schedule.",
      "\"At this critical juncture, it is more important than ever that we rise to the occasion and continue delivering the consistent, high-level of public service we provide every day,\" tNATCA stated.",
      "Still, the impact of staffing shortages on flights so far has been minimal, reported Van Cleave, but delays could worsen as staffing shortages continue.",
      "\"While delays and cancellations have been within historic norms this week, and the vast majority of fights are leaving on time, the amount of delays because of air traffic controllers staffing is up,\" he said."

    "summary": "Officials in Italy say a house explosion that killed 3 police was a deliberate attack by residents who had previously resisted eviction.",
    "story": [
      "Rome \u2014 Three Italian police officers were killed early Tuesday and more than a dozen others injured when an explosion ripped through a farmhouse near the northern city of Verona, as officers tried to serve an eviction order, officials said.",
      "The blast leveled the two-story home in the town of Castel d'Azzano, about six miles southwest of Verona. Authorities say it was triggered deliberately by residents who had been refusing to leave the property.",
      "Officers \"were struck by an intentional explosion of a gas tank,\" said Col. Claudio Pagano, the commander of the Verona Carabinieri police force. \"It was an absolutely senseless act.\"",
      "The farmhouse blew up shortly after dawn as a team of Carabinieri and other law enforcement officers entered the property, which had been illegally occupied for more than a year. According to Italy's state broadcaster RAI and Sky TG24, investigators believe the building was deliberately filled with gas, which ignited when officers opened the front door.",
      "Firefighters said the blast could be heard for several miles and caused the structure to collapse almost instantly. Rescue crews pulled some victims from the rubble as flames engulfed the site.",
      "Authorities arrested a brother and sister in their 60s, identified by local media as Dino and Maria Luisa Ramponi, who had been living illegally in the home. A third sibling initially fled the scene but was later taken into custody, according to Sky TG24",
      "Prosecutors say the siblings had resisted earlier eviction attempts, including one last year when they allegedly threatened to blow up the property if police entered. Investigators discovered multiple gas canisters inside the home and are treating the case as suspected premeditated murder.",
      "\"The act appears to have been planned in advance,\" said Verona prosecutor Raffaele Tito. \"When officers opened the door, the house exploded.\"",
      "Italian Prime Minister Giorgia Meloni called the deaths \"a tragedy that strikes the entire nation\" and expressed condolences to the victims' families.",
      "Defense Minister Guido Crosetto called it \"a barbaric act against those who serve the state with courage.\"",

    "story": [
      "The next phase of the Gaza peace plan brokered by President Trump moved forward significantly on Monday as Hamas released all of the 20 living Israeli hostages in exchange for hundreds of Palestinian prisoners and detainees, and as more aid started to flow into the Palestinian territory after two years of war.",
      "The steps are crucial parts of President Trump's 20-point peace plan, and they came three days after a ceasefire took effect in Gaza and Israeli troops pulled back to a pre-determined line.",
      "World leaders, including Mr. Trump, met in Egypt on Monday for a summit on the future of Gaza and the broader Middle East.",
      "But the situation remains fragile, with major questions over what comes next still to be answered.",
      "Negotiations over next steps",
      "Israel and Hamas have little trust in each other, and it took a number of failed, indirect negotiations in Doha, Qatar's capital, to get to the truce, with Egypt and Qatar acting as meditators.",
      "The initial phases of the agreement called for: the release of the final hostages held by Hamas, living and dead; the release of hundreds of Palestinian prisoners held by Israel; a surge of humanitarian aid to Gaza; and a partial pullback by Israeli forces from Gaza's main cities.",
      "Egypt's foreign minister said on Monday that it was crucial that Israel and Hamas fully implement the first phase of the deal so that the parties can start negotiations on the second phase. As of Monday evening, all living hostages were back in Israel, but the remains of many of the slain captives remained in Gaza.",
      "\"We're very committed to [the peace deal],\" Israel Defense Forces spokesperson Lt. Col. Nadav Shoshani told CBS News on Monday. \"The agreement specifically says 72 hours for when IDF redeploys on the new line ... That is past already, and not all hostages have returned yet, so we understand what we're dealing with.\"",
      "Later phases of the plan will have to address thornier issues such as Gaza's postwar governance, Israel's demand that Hamas disarm, which the group has rejected, and Palestinian demands for a state, which the current Israeli government has rejected.",
      "Negotiations over those issues could break down, and Israel has hinted it may resume military operations if its demands are not met.",
      "President Trump's plan to end the war also stipulates that regional and international partners will work to develop the core of a new Palestinian security force.",
      "Reconstruction will be another major challenge. The World Bank, and a postwar plan proposed by Egypt, estimates that at least $53 billion will be needed to rebuild the shattered Palestinian territory. Egypt plans to host a future reconstruction conference.",
      "Will Hamas disarm?",
      "Among the most difficult issues is Israel's insistence that a weakened Hamas completely disarm. Hamas refuses to do that and wants to ensure Israel pulls its troops completely out of Gaza.",
      "So far, the Israeli military has withdrawn from Gaza City, the southern city of Khan Younis and other areas, but it remains in control of about 53% of the enclave, according to Israeli officials. Troops remain in most of the southern city of Rafah, towns of Gaza's far north, and a wide strip along the length of Gaza's border with Israel.",
      "Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said Friday that Israel was \"tightening the noose around Hamas from all sides,\" and vowed that Gaza would be demilitarized after the Israeli government approved the peace plan, which it did hours later.",
      "\"Hamas will disarm and Gaza will be demilitarized. If this can be achieved the easy way, all the better; if not, it will be achieved the hard way,\" Netanyahu said, addressing reporters.",
      "Who will govern Gaza?",
      "Israel and Hamas have not agreed on Gaza's postwar governance.",
      "Under the U.S. plan, an international body is supposed to govern the Palestinian territory, overseeing Palestinian technocrats running day-to-day affairs. Hamas and other factions would not have any role in Gaza's governance.",
      "The plan envisions an eventual role for Palestinian leader Mahmoud Abbas' Palestinian Authority \u2014 something Netanyahu has long opposed. But it requires the authority, which administers parts of the West Bank, to first undergo a sweeping reform program, and it does not provide any timeline for the process.",
      "Hamas has said Gaza's government should be worked out among Palestinians.",
      "The deal also recognizes an independent Palestinian state as, \"the aspiration of the Palestinian people,\" but it's unclear if or when discussions on statehood could take place, and Israel's Netanyahu has repeatedly said he will not allow the creation of a Palestinian state.",
      "International security force",
      "The plan calls for an Arab-led international security force in Gaza, along with Palestinian police trained by Egypt and Jordan. It says Israeli forces will leave additional areas as those forces deploy.",
      "Under the plan, the force would work with Israel and Egypt to help secure border areas, along with the newly trained Palestinian police forces.",
      "Egyptian Foreign Minister Badr Abdelatty said the international force needs a U.N. Security Council resolution to endorse its deployment and mandate as a peacekeeping force.",
      "About 200 U.S. troops are now in Israel to monitor the ceasefire and the early stages of the peace plan. They were expected to carry out that work in conjunction with partner nations, nongovernmental organizations and private-sector players."

      "The fighting has killed more than 67,000 Palestinians, according to Gaza's Hamas-run Health Ministry, which doesn't differentiate between civilians and combatants but says around half the deaths were women and children, and displaced around 90% of the Gaza population of some 2 million. The United Nations and many independent experts consider the ministry's figures to be the most reliable estimate of wartime casualties in Gaza.",
      "Prior to Monday's release, there were 48 hostages held in Gaza, including the body of one soldier from a previous war. Israel had determined that at least 25 of the hostages were killed on Oct. 7, 2023, or died while in captivity. Just before the release of the first hostages under the ceasefire, Hamas informed Israel that two additional hostages were no longer alive, Tamir Nimrodi and Bipin Joshi.

      "The fraternal twins were taken from their homes in kibbutz Kfar Aza, on the border with Gaza, during the Oct. 7 attack. Seventeen others were also abducted from Kfar Aza, but the Berman twins were the only hostages from the kibbutz who remained in captivity. The family had heard from hostages who returned in a previous deal that, as of February, the brothers were alive but being held separately. Liran Berman, their older brother, said it's the longest the two have ever spent apart. In Kfar Aza, the twins lived in apartments across from each other. Gali is more outgoing, while Ziv is more reserved and shy with a sharp sense of humor, their brother said.",
      "Omri Miran, 48",
      "Omri Miran was kidnapped from the Nahal Oz kibbutz. During the attack, terrorists held his family, including his two daughters, ages 2 and 6 months, hostage in the kitchen of a neighbor's house and then broadcast it on Facebook Live. Miran and the father of the other family, Tsachi Idan, were kidnapped. Idan's body was released\u202fduring the last hostage exchange after he was killed in captivity. Lishay Miran Lavi, Miran's wife, said their younger daughter knew \"daddy Omri\" only through photos and videos, and didn't really understand what a father is. Moshe Lavi, Miran's brother who lives in New York City, told CBS News New York that Miran's sister and two young nieces survived the mental and physical torture on Oct, 7, but watched as Miran was taken away to Gaza.",
      "Matan Angrest, 22",
      "Matan Angrest, an Israeli soldier, was taken from his military tank in southern Israel. He is the oldest of four children from Kiryat Bialik, outside of Haifa. His family has been among the most vocal protesters and very critical of Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu. Last Tuesday, which marked two years since the Oct. 7 attack, his mother, Anat Angrest, addressed her son at a rally. \"I know you're in pain, and I can't hug you. I hear you whisper, 'Come for me, Mom,' and I can't protect you,\" she said.",
      "Eitan Mor, 25",
      "Eitan Mor was working as a security guard at the Nova music festival, where he helped evacuate people injured in the attack. Mor's parents helped found the Tikva Forum, a loosely organized group of hostage families. They advocated for military pressure, not an immediate ceasefire or hostage release deal, as the best chance for bringing the hostages home. That stance has put Mor's father at odds with many of the other families of hostages. The Israeli military released a photo on Monday showing Eitan Mor beaming in an embrace with his parents.",
      "Alon Ohel, 24",
      "Alon Ohel, who also has German and Serbian citizenship, was kidnapped at the Nova music festival from a mobile bomb shelter along with Hersh Goldberg-Polin, an American-Israeli who was killed in captivity in August 2024. A talented pianist, his family has placed pianos across Israel and several sites around the world to raise awareness of his plight. Three other hostages who had been held with Ohel for more than a year were released during the previous ceasefire, including Eli Sharabi, who said Ohel was like his adopted son. Sharabi said they were kept chained for the entire period of their captivity and subsisted on a moldy pita bread per day. Ohel has shrapnel in his eye from the attack on the bomb shelter and his family is worried he may be partially blind. Eli Sharabi, a hostage who was previously freed, told \"CBS Sunday Morning\" last month that he became a father figure to Ohel in their year-plus together, and when Sharabi found out he was going to be freed, Ohel was not on the list. \"You imagine this moment hundreds of times,\" Sharabi said. \"And you believe it's going to be the happiest moment ever. And because of Alon, this moment become very complicated. He had small panic attack. He started to cry and shaking. So, we took water, washed his face, hugging him. It wasn't easy.\"",

In one video, he appears alongside his childhood friend, Evyatar David, with terrorists filming them in a van begging for their freedom and watching their fellow hostages being released nearby to the Red Cross. \"The hardest thing for me is that I really went there to watch over him, watch over my baby brother, and I returned without him,\" Gal Dalal told CBS News in May.",

      "Elkana Bohbot was kidnapped from the Nova music festival. In the past year, Hamas has published multiple videos of Bohbot, filmed under duress, including one where he has a fake telephone conversation with his wife, Rivka; their son, Reem; his mother and his brother \u2014 pleading with them to help him get out of Gaza. His son made binoculars in kindergarten which he often used to go out and \"look for his father,\" according to Bohbot's mother, Ruhama.",

      "Rom Braslavski was working as a security guard at the Nova festival. He attempted to help festivalgoers evacuate and was wounded in both hands before being kidnapped, witnesses said. In August, the Islamic Jihad militant group released a video of a skeletal Braslavski sobbing and pleading for his life, adding that injuries to his foot prevent him from standing. Later videos of Braslavski and fellow hostage Evyatar David digging their own graves horrified Israelis, sparking some of the largest attendance in months at weekly protests. His father, Ofir, said Rom is usually a strong, happy-go-lucky kid, and that video is the first time he's seen his son cry.",
      "Nimrod Cohen, 21",
      "Nimrod Cohen was taken from a tank where he was stationed as a soldier in southern Israel. Cohen is obsessed with Rubik's cubes, his family said, and a burned Rubik's cube was found in the tank he was abducted from. This year, his mother, Viki Cohen, illustrated a Passover haggadah, the text laying out the rituals and story recited during the Passover holiday, in honor of hostages, partly because her family stopped celebrating holidays after the attack. \"We don't gather as a family, because it reminds us how much he is missing,\" Cohen said. The only time the extended family would gather is at protests, she said. \"The best thing about my son is that he's my son,\" his father, Yehuda Cohen, told CBS News last week. \"He's a normal boy like every other boy. For me, he's special like his brother, sister. We are a normal family. We are a warm, normal family, and we want to get back to being a warm, normal family.\"",

Yehoud was released during the ceasefire in January.",
      "David Cunio, 35",
      "David Cunio, brother of Ariel Cunio, was kidnapped with his wife, Sharon, and their 3-year-old twins from the Nir Oz kibbutz. Sharon's sister Danielle and her 5-year-old daughter, who were visiting, also were kidnapped. All were released in November, except for David Cunio. In July, Sharon shared a photo of the twins marking their fifth birthday, their second without their father, writing on Facebook that the girls have changed so much while he's been in captivity that \"they're not the same little girls he knew.\"",
      "Evyatar David, 24",
      "Evyatar David was taken hostage at the Nova music festival along with his childhood friend, Guy Gilboa-Dalal. In August, Hamas released a video of David, gaunt and pale, who said he was digging his own grave. The condition of the hostages in the videos horrified Israelis and led tens of thousands of protesters to take to the streets and demand a ceasefire deal, in one of the largest turnouts for the weekly hostage protests in months.",
      "Maksym Harkin, 37",
      "Maksym Harkin was abducted from Nova, which was the first festival he had ever attended, according to his family. Harkin was born in Ukraine and moved to Israel with his family, where he lived in the city of Tirat HaCarmel in the north. He has a 3-year-old daughter and was the primary provider for his mother and 11-year-old brother. Just before he was taken, his mother said he sent a final text message that said, \"I love you.\" In July, Hamas released a video of him filmed under duress several months prior.",
      "Eitan Horn, 38",
      "Eitan Horn, originally from the city of Kfar Saba, was visiting his brother Iair at the Nir Oz kibbutz on Oct. 7. Both were kidnapped. For most of the war, the two were held with three other hostages in a filthy cell underground. In early February, terrorists filmed the emotional interaction between the brothers as they were told that Iair would be released and Eitan would stay in Gaza. Since his release, Iair Horn has campaigned for his brother and the other hostages, flying frequently to the United States and meeting with politicians.",
      "Segev Kalfon, 27",
      "Segev Kalfon was kidnapped from the Nova music festival, where he was last seen attempting to flee terrorists along the highway. Before the attack, he worked at his family's bakery in Dimona, in southern Israel. The middle child of three, Kalfon had recently been diagnosed with an anxiety disorder, a condition his family has highlighted in urging his release. Kalfon's family received a sign of life from him after the last ceasefire, when some of the hostages said they were held with him for months. Kalfon's family has focused on religious rituals in their fight for his release, including traveling to the grave of prominent rabbis and dedicating a Torah scroll in his honor.",
      "Bar Kupershtein, 23",
      "Bar Kupershtein was working at the Nova festival as a security guard when he was abducted. Witnesses said Kupershtein stayed at the festival to try to provide first aid to people who had been shot and injured. Kupershtein was the main financial support for his family after his father was severely injured in an accident several years ago, his aunt, Ora Rubinstein, told reporters. She said that his father worked with a physical therapist to regain the ability to speak, so he could meet with politicians to advocate for his son's release. He has told the family that he would walk again when his son came home, she said.",
      "Yosef-Chaim Ohana, 25",
      "Yosef-Chaim Ohana was kidnapped from the Nova music festival, where he was working as a bartender. Witnesses saw him attempting to help others escape before he was kidnapped. He is the oldest of three brothers, one of whom died from an illness about 15 years ago.",

      "Avinatan Or was kidnapped from the Nova music festival along with his girlfriend, Noa Argamani, who was rescued by Israeli forces in June 2024. On Oct. 7, Hamas released a video of the pair that has become one of the most well-known videos from that day. It showed Argamani on an all-terrain vehicle crying, \"Don't kill me!\" and reaching out her arms to Or, who is being marched away from her by terrorists. Or worked in tech in Tel Aviv before his abduction.",
      "Matan Zangauker, 25",
      "Matan Zangauker was kidnapped from kibbutz Nir Oz along with his girlfriend, Ilana Gritzewsky. The two met while working on a medical cannabis farm there. Gritzewsky was released after 55 days and has since advocated tirelessly for his release, wearing a hat of Zangauker's she rescued from their burned home. His mother, Einav, has been a constant presence at protests, giving impassioned speeches and even being hoisted in a cage above the crowd to draw attention to the hostages' plight. Zangauker, who said she was previously a Netanyahu supporter, has emerged as one of his harshest critics.",
      "Two hostages determined to be dead on Monday",
      "Bipin Joshi, 24",
      "Bipin Joshi arrived in Israel from his native Nepal a month before the attack. He was the only non-Israeli hostage believed to be alive in Gaza. He came to Israel on a student exchange to work and study agriculture at kibbutz Alumim on the Gaza border. Ten of the 17 Nepali students in the program were killed during the attack. Joshi, who was able to throw a number of live grenades out of the bomb shelter where they were hiding, was injured and kidnapped. Joshi's sister, 17-year-old Pushpa Joshi, regularly travels eight hours one way on buses to Kathmandu from her home in western Nepal to lobby to secure her brother's release. In August, his family traveled to Israel to meet with President Isaac Herzog and join families demonstrating in Tel Aviv's Hostage Square. Last week, Joshi's family released footage of him in captivity filmed under duress from around November 2023.",
      "Tamir Nimrodi, 20",
      "Tamir Nimrodi was taken from Erez, a crossing on the northern border of Gaza that had been the main route for people entering and leaving the territory. He had been serving with the Israeli defense body overseeing humanitarian aid in Gaza. Nimrodi was taken with two other soldiers by terrorists who walked them to the Gaza gate and forced them to cross. Israel confirmed the deaths of the two soldiers who were taken with Nimrodi. There had been no sign of life from Nimrodi in the two years since he was seen in footage walking into Gaza in shorts and a T-shirt without his glasses. Herut Nimrodi, his mother, said she didn't know what was worse: to think he had been killed in captivity, or that he was alive but being held in terrible conditions. \"I'm scared to even imagine,\" she said."

    "published": "Fri, 10 Oct 2025 07:06:00 -0400",
    "summary": "One bright spot is green sea turtles, which have recovered substantially, the IUCN said as it released its latest Red List of Threatened Species.",
    "story": [
      "Arctic seals are being pushed closer to extinction by climate change and more than half of bird species around the world are declining under pressure from deforestation and agricultural expansion, according to an annual assessment from the International Union for Conservation of Nature.",
      "One bright spot is green sea turtles, which have recovered substantially thanks to decades of conservation efforts, the IUCN said Friday as it released its latest Red List of Threatened Species.",
      "While many animals are increasingly at risk of disappearing forever, the updated list shows how species can come back from the brink with dedicated effort, Rima Jabado, deputy chair of the IUCN Species Survival Commission, told The Associated Press.",
      "\"Hope and concern go hand in hand in this work,\" Jabado wrote by email. \"The same persistence that brought back the green sea turtle can be mirrored in small, everyday actions \u2014 supporting sustainable choices, backing conservation initiatives, and urging leaders to follow through on their environmental promises.\"",
      "The list is updated every year by teams of scientists assessing data on creatures around the world. The scope of the work is enormous and important for science, said Andrew Farnsworth, a visiting scientist at the Cornell Lab of Ornithology who studies bird migration and wasn't involved with the IUCN report.",
      "\"Every time one is done and every time there's revision, there's more information, and there's more ability to answer questions\" on species, some of which are still largely a mystery to researchers, Farnsworth said.",
      "Sea ice loss",
      "Because all the marine mammals native to the Arctic \u2014 seals, whales and polar bears \u2014 rely on the habitat provided by sea ice, they're all at risk as it diminishes because of human-caused climate change, said Kit Kovacs, co-chair of IUCN's Species Survival Commission Pinniped Specialist Group, which focuses on seals.",
      "The three species highlighted in the latest IUCN report \u2014 harp, hooded and bearded seals \u2014 have been moved up to a designation of greater concern in the latest update, indicating they are increasingly threatened by extinction, Kovacs said.",
      "The same melting of glaciers and sea ice destroying seal habitats also \"generally will bring escalation in extreme weather events, which are already impacting people around the globe,\" wrote Kovacs.",
      "\"Acting to help seals is acting to help humanity when it comes to climate change,\" Kovacs said.",
      "Global bird decline",
      "The update also highlighted Madagascar, West Africa and Central America, where Schlegel's asity, the black-casqued hornbill and the tail-bobbing northern nightingale-wren were all moved to near-threatened status. Those are three specific birds in trouble, but numbers are dropping for around three-fifths of birds globally.",
      "\"That three in five of the world's bird species have declining populations shows how deep the biodiversity crisis has become and how urgent it is that governments take the actions they have committed to under multiple conventions and agreements,\" said Ian Burfield, global science coordinator at BirdLife International.",
      "Deforestation of tropical forests is one of a \"depressing litany of threats\" to birds, a list that includes agricultural expansion and intensification, competition from invasive species and climate change, said Stuart Butchart, chief scientist at BirdLife International.",
      "\"The fact that 61% of the world's birds are declining is an alarm bell that we can't afford to ignore,\" Butchart said.",
      "The annual U.N. climate summit will be held in November in Belem, Brazil, with much attention on the Amazon and the value of tropical forests to humans and animals. But Farnsworth, of Cornell, said he was \"not so confident\" that world's leaders would take decisive action to protect imperiled bird species.",
      "\"I would like to think things like birds are nonpartisan, and you can find common ground,\" he said. \"But it's not easy.\"",
      "Green sea turtles",
      "One success story is the rebound of green sea turtles in many parts of the world's oceans. Experts see that as a bright spot because it shows how effective human interventions, like legal protections and conservation programs, can be.",
      "Still, \"it's important to note that conservation efforts of sea turtles can take decades before you realize the fruits of that labor,\" said Justin Perrault, vice president of research at Loggerhead Marinelife Center in Juno Beach, Florida, who wasn't involved with the IUCN report.",
      "The overall success with green sea turtles should be celebrated and used as an example with other species, some of which, like hawksbills and leatherbacks, aren't doing nearly as well, said Nicolas Pilcher, executive director of the Marine Research Foundation.",
      "And even for green sea turtles, areas still remain where climate change and other factors like erosion are damaging habitats, Pilcher said, and some of those are poorer communities that receive less conservation funding.",
      "But in the places where they have recovered, it's \"a great story of, actually, we can do something about this,\" Pilcher said. \"We can. We can make a difference.\"",
      "Extinct species",
      "The latest Red List notes that six species have moved to the extinct category. The IUCN says those species include the Christmas Island shrew and the slender-billed curlew, a migratory shorebird.",
      "Three Australian mammals and a plant native to Hawaii were assessed by the IUCN for the first time and put on the list of extinct species."

      "The filing is part of a broader effort by Comey\u2019s legal team to have the criminal case tossed. His lawyers told the judge overseeing the case last week they planned a separate motion to dismiss the case on grounds of vindictive prosecution.",
      "Tuesday's filing is not a formal motion but a notice to the court that they plan to challenge Halligan's appointment as acting U.S. attorney for the Eastern District. Doing so will require an \"out-of-district judge\" to hear the motion, as they noted in the filing.",

      "Comey used his memoir, \"A Higher Loyalty,\" and subsequent public appearances to take umbrage against Trump and publicly criticize the actions he took during his first term. Trump has continued to assail Comey and scrutinize his tenure at the FBI, including by reportedly pressing for the investigation and empaneling of a grand jury.",
      "Halligan ultimately secured the indictment from a grand jury in Alexandria just days before the statute of limitations ran out in bringing the case.",

Ask specific questions that only the real person would know. This can reveal gaps in the scammer's script. The voice, also, at times may sound robotic due to imperfections in voice cloning technology. So the next time, whenever you receive a call that creates a sense of urgency, ask as many questions as you can to verify the identity of the person.

      "Fox News' Madison Scarpino reports on the successful Falcon 9 launch and mission.",
      "A Los Angeles-based aerospace startup called Inversion Space has unveiled Arc, its first flagship spacecraft designed to deliver supplies from orbit back to Earth in record time. The reusable reentry vehicle can transport up to 500 pounds of mission-critical cargo to nearly any point on the planet in less than an hour. Founders Justin Fiaschetti and Austin Briggs launched the company in 2021 with a bold vision: to build a space-based logistics network. During an event at the company's factory, they described Arc as the next evolution of global delivery, one that starts in orbit, not on the ground.",

      "How the Arc spacecraft delivers cargo from orbit to Earth",
      "Standing about 8 feet tall and 4 feet wide, Arc is roughly the size of a large tabletop. It's a lifting-body vehicle, meaning it can steer as it reenters the atmosphere. Instead of needing a runway, Arc lands safely under parachutes, using non-toxic propellants that make it safe to handle immediately after landing. The spacecraft features a cross-range of approximately 621 miles, allowing it to target wide landing zones. It can stay in orbit for up to five years, ready to return to Earth when needed. That flexibility means the spacecraft could one day drop off medical supplies, drones or military equipment at hard-to-reach locations.",

      "Why Arc's hypersonic speed could change aerospace testing",
      "Beyond rapid delivery, Arc doubles as a hypersonic testing platform. It can reach speeds over Mach 20, endure extreme heat and survive massive g-forces. Those capabilities have caught the attention of U.S. defense agencies, which are eager to improve hypersonic flight testing. Inversion's participation in the Kratos-led MACH-TB 2.0 program highlights the growing military interest in Arc's reusable design. \"Fully reusable and capable of precise landings for rapid recovery, Arc makes hypersonic testing faster, repeatable, and more affordable,\" the company said.",
      "Arc could deliver mission-critical cargo anywhere on Earth in under an hour. (Inversion Space)",
      "What Inversion learned from its first spacecraft, Ray",
      "Before Arc, Inversion launched a smaller demo craft called Ray on SpaceX's Transporter-12 mission. Ray weighed about 200 pounds and successfully tested propulsion, avionics and solar power systems in orbit. Though a short circuit prevented reentry, it provided valuable data that led to Arc's development. Ray's success convinced the company to push forward with full-scale testing. Inversion has already completed dozens of drop tests and built a full-scale Arc prototype. The startup also partnered with NASA to refine the vehicle's thermal protection system for reentry.",

      "Inversion sees Arc as a bridge between space logistics and national defense. The spacecraft could deliver mission-critical cargo to remote, damaged or denied environments where traditional transport would take days. As Fiaschetti put it, the goal is simple: make a difference the moment it lands. By combining maneuverability, reusability and speed, Arc could reshape both emergency response and battlefield supply chains. It's not just about moving packages, it's about delivering readiness.",

Imagine doctors receiving vital medical kits from orbit after a natural disaster, or soldiers getting urgent supplies in minutes instead of hours.

      "Sometimes, data breaches result in more than just free credit monitoring. Recently, Facebook began paying out its $725 million settlement, and AT&T is preparing to distribute $177 million. Those payouts caught scammers' attention.",
      "Now, fake settlement claim emails and websites are flooding inboxes. They look convincing, but behind the plain design and official-sounding language is a trap for your Social Security number, banking info and more. So how can you make sure you get your money without losing even more in the process?",

      "TOP 5 OVERPAYMENT SCAMS TO AVOID",
      "Why fake settlement sites are so convincing",
      "Settlement claim websites rarely look polished. Most have generic layouts, long URLs and simple forms asking for a claim ID from your email or postcard. That makes it easy for scammers to mimic them. To test how simple it is, we created a fake settlement site (below) in minutes using AI tools like ChatGPT.",
      "To steal your data, scammers build fake settlement sites that mimic real sites (Kurt \"CyberGuy\" Knutsson)",
      "If we can do it, you can bet criminals are already exploiting the same shortcuts. Facebook has been the target. A fake site once popped up around the Equifax settlement, tricking thousands before it was shut down. The lesson? If the site appears unusual, it doesn't necessarily mean it's fake, but it should prompt you to double-check before entering your details or clicking on any links.",
      "Red flags that expose fake settlement sites",
      "Spotting a scam often comes down to noticing the little details. Watch for these common warning signs before you hand over your information.",
      "If a site asks for your full Social Security number or the names of your children, stop. For example, the official Equifax settlement only requested the last six digits of SSNs. Genuine claim sites may ask for limited info (like the last four digits of your SSN), but they rarely demand complete Social Security or bank details.",
      "Real administrators calculate payments only after the claim period closes.",
      "Settlements are announced by mail or email, not through random DMs or SMS.",
      "Fraud can be found with red flags like odd URLs, urgent countdowns, or fee requests (Kurt \"CyberGuy\" Knutsson)",
      "Even one extra letter in the web address is a sign of a spoof site. Legitimate settlements use official or clearly named administrator domains. Be wary of addresses with unusual add-ons, such as \"secure-pay\" or \"claims-pay.\"",

    "published": "Mon, 13 Oct 2025 14:49:51 -0400",
    "summary": "Comprehensive analysis of Google Maps, Waze and Apple Maps examines usability, routing accuracy, data handling and features across the top navigation platforms.",
    "story": [
      "Kurt \u2018CyberGuy\u2019 Knutsson discusses Instagram\u2019s new maps feature and more on \u2018Fox & Friends Weekend.\u2019",
      "Navigation apps have become an essential part of modern life. Whether you are commuting to work, running errands or exploring a new city, relying on accurate directions and real-time traffic updates can make all the difference. Over the past decade, Google Maps, Waze and Apple Maps have emerged as the dominant players in this space, each offering a distinct approach to navigation.",
      "While millions of people rely on these apps daily, choosing the right one can depend on a variety of factors, from interface design to privacy policies. In this article, we compare these three apps across usability, accuracy, features and data handling to help you determine which one best fits your needs.",

      "What each app does best",
      "Google Maps is widely regarded as the all-rounder. It combines extensive mapping data with points of interest, public transit information, Street View, Live View AR and detailed business listings. Its versatility makes it a top choice for both daily commuters and travelers.",
      "Google Maps is a great way to explore the world with detailed routes, Street View, and real-time traffic insights. (OLIVIER DOULIERY/AFP via Getty Images)",
      "Waze, on the other hand, is designed primarily for drivers. It thrives on community input, offering live updates about traffic jams, road hazards, accidents and even police presence. Since Google owns Waze, many Waze-style real-time alerts have now begun appearing directly inside Google Maps. While Waze still focuses on driving, this integration blurs the lines between the two apps.",
      "Apple Maps\u00a0has made major strides in recent years. Once considered the underdog, it's now a solid choice for iOS users. Its clean interface, privacy-focused design and seamless integration with Siri, CarPlay and Apple Watch make it a convenient pick for those fully in the Apple ecosystem.",
      "INSTAGRAM FRIEND MAP FEATURE SPARKS PRIVACY QUESTIONS",
      "Usability and interface",
      "When it comes to interface, each app approaches design differently.",
      "Google Maps provides a dense but intuitive layout, giving users access to multiple layers of information, including traffic, satellite imagery and public transit routes. Switching between driving, walking, biking and transit is straightforward, and the search functionality is robust, often displaying detailed business profiles, ratings, and hours of operation.",
      "Waze prioritizes active driving support. Its interface is visually bold, with clear alerts for traffic jams, accidents and road hazards submitted by other users. While some may find the screen slightly cluttered, the focus is entirely on driving efficiency, which makes sense given its target audience.",
      "Waze helps to put you on a faster route with live, community-driven alerts that help you dodge traffic jams and road hazards.\u00a0 (Kurt \"CyberGuy\" Knutsson)",
      "Apple Maps offers a minimalist, streamlined interface that emphasizes simplicity. Searching for locations, initiating navigation, and following turn-by-turn instructions is straightforward. The app works seamlessly with iOS features like Siri and CarPlay, providing a smooth and cohesive experience for Apple users.",
      "Navigation accuracy and performance",
      "Accurate routing and timely traffic updates are critical.",
      "Google Maps\u00a0remains the most reliable for precise routing and travel time estimates. It combines AI-enhanced predictive routing with historical and live traffic data to suggest the best route. Its consistency holds strong across urban and rural areas alike.",
      "Waze\u00a0is unmatched for real-time rerouting. Relying heavily on crowd-sourced reports, it often detects slowdowns or hazards before Google Maps does. However, it still struggles when offline or in areas with poor data coverage.",
      "Apple Maps has significantly improved its routing accuracy, especially in cities. Its traffic data is now crowd-sourced from millions of iPhones, processed on-device to protect privacy. In some rural or international regions, though, it can still lag behind Google Maps and Waze.",
      "Apple Maps offers seamless use with your iPhone and CarPlay for smooth and privacy-focused navigation.\u00a0 (Kurt \"CyberGuy\" Knutsson)",
      "Features and ecosystem integration",
      "Beyond basic navigation, each app offers additional tools and integrations.",
      "Google Maps\u00a0offers offline maps, Live View AR navigation, multi-stop routing, EV charger locations and indoor maps for airports and malls. Integration with Gmail, Calendar and Google Assistant creates a seamless travel experience.",
      "Waze\u00a0remains focused on social and driving-specific features. You can report hazards or police sightings and even control Spotify, Audible or podcasts directly from the app without switching screens.",
      "Apple Maps\u00a0leans into privacy and ecosystem benefits. Its \"Look Around\" feature rivals Street View, while EV routing, cycling paths and Siri integration make it ideal for Apple fans. Apple also uses anonymized \"Look Around\" imagery to train its AI models, but with strict privacy safeguards like blurring faces and plates.",
      "YOUR PHONE IS TRACKING YOU EVEN WHEN YOU THINK IT\u2019S NOT",
      "Privacy and data handling",
      "How these apps handle your personal data matters more than ever.",
      "Google Maps\u00a0collects detailed location and usage data to power personalization and advertising. That means better recommendations, but less privacy for users who prefer anonymity.",
      "Waze, also owned by Google, gathers anonymized driving data to enhance community reporting. Its functionality depends on sharing your location in real time, which is necessary for crowd-sourced accuracy.",
      "Apple Maps takes a different approach. It processes most data on-device, uses random identifiers instead of personal accounts and does not associate searches with your Apple ID. That makes it the most privacy-conscious option, though even Apple collects anonymized data for traffic and route improvements.",
      "Take my quiz: How safe is your online security?",
      "Think your devices and data are truly protected? Take this quick quiz to see where your digital habits stand. From passwords to Wi-Fi settings, you\u2019ll get a personalized breakdown of what you\u2019re doing right and what needs improvement. Take my Quiz here:\u00a0CyberGuy.com.",
      "Kurt's key takeaway",
      "There is no single \"best\" navigation app, and the right choice depends on your priorities. Google Maps is ideal if you want a feature-packed, versatile app that works well for a variety of transportation modes and travel scenarios. Its global coverage and rich data make it reliable for everyday use and exploration. Waze is best if your main concern is real-time driving efficiency. Its community-driven traffic alerts and dynamic rerouting help you avoid congestion and save time during daily commutes. Apple Maps suits users deeply embedded in the Apple ecosystem who value simplicity, clean design and privacy protections. It may not have as many features as Google Maps or the same real-time edge as Waze, but its seamless integration with iOS makes it convenient.",

      "We spend so much time online that how we connect to the internet has become almost as important as the devices we use. Most people never give it a second thought. They connect their computer to Wi-Fi, type in a password and get on with their day. But if you have ever wondered whether plugging in an Ethernet cable is safer than sticking to wireless, you are asking the right question. The way you connect can have real consequences for your privacy and security. Recently, Kathleen reached out to me with the same doubt.",
      "\"Is it more secure to use the Ethernet connection at home for my computer, or is it safer to use the Wi-Fi from my cable provider?\"",
      "It's a great question, Kathleen, because both options seem similar on the surface but work very differently under the hood. Those differences can mean the difference between a private, secure connection and one that's more vulnerable to attackers.",

      "Ethernet offers direct, wired security without wireless risks. (Kurt \"CyberGuy\" Knutsson)",
      "How Ethernet and Wi-Fi differ when it comes to security",
      "Ethernet and Wi-Fi both get you online, but they do it in completely different ways.\u00a0Ethernet\u00a0uses a physical cable that connects your computer directly to the router. Since it is a wired connection, data travels straight through that cable, making it much harder for anyone to intercept it. There is no wireless signal to hijack, no airwaves to eavesdrop on.",
      "Wi-Fi, on the other hand, is built on convenience. It sends your data through the air to and from your router, which is what makes it so easy to connect from anywhere in your home. But that convenience comes with more risk. Anyone within range of your signal could potentially try to break into the network. If your Wi-Fi is protected by a weak password or uses outdated encryption, a skilled attacker might gain access without ever stepping inside your house.",
      "At home, that risk is smaller than in a coffee shop or hotel, but it is not zero. Even a poorly secured smart device on your network can give attackers a way in. Ethernet removes many of those risks simply because it is harder to access a connection that requires physical access to a cable. Check out our steps for setting up a home network like a pro\u00a0here.",
      "DON'T USE YOUR HOME WI-FI BEFORE FIXING CERTAIN SECURITY RISKS",
      "Why one connection might be safer than the other",
      "It is easy to think Ethernet is automatically safer, but that is not the whole story. Your real security depends on how your entire network is set up. For example, a Wi-Fi network with a strong password, up-to-date router firmware, and WPA3 encryption is going to be far more secure than a poorly configured Ethernet setup connected to an outdated router.",
      "There is also the question of who else uses your network. If it is just you and a handful of devices, your risk is low. But if you live in a shared space or run smart home gadgets, that changes the equation. Each device connected to Wi-Fi is a potential entry point. Ethernet reduces the number of devices that can connect, which limits the attack surface.",
      "Ultimately, the connection type is one piece of the puzzle. The bigger factors are how your router is configured, how often you update your software, and how careful you are with what devices you connect.",
      "Wi-Fi brings convenience but also potential exposure to hackers.\u00a0 (Kurt \"CyberGuy\" Knutsson)",
      "6 ways to make your internet safer",
      "Whether you stick with Wi-Fi or switch to Ethernet, there are several practical steps you can take to protect your devices and data. Each step adds an extra layer of security to your network.",
      "IS YOUR HOME WI-FI REALLY SAFE? THINK AGAIN",
      "Choose a long and unique password for your Wi-Fi. Avoid obvious choices like your name, address, or simple sequences. A strong password makes it far harder for attackers to guess or crack your network. A password manager helps you create and store strong, unique passwords for every account, reducing the chances of a hacker gaining access through weak or repeated credentials.",
      "Next, see if your email has been exposed in past breaches. Our #1 password manager (see\u00a0Cyberguy.com/Passwords) pick includes a built-in breach scanner that checks whether your email address or passwords have appeared in known leaks. If you discover a match, immediately change any reused passwords and secure those accounts with new, unique credentials.",
      "Check out the best expert-reviewed password managers of 2025 at\u00a0Cyberguy.com/Passwords",
      "Most modern routers support WPA3, which is much more secure than older standards like WPA2. Check your router's settings to enable the latest encryption and ensure your network traffic is harder to intercept.",
      "Router manufacturers regularly release updates that patch security vulnerabilities. Log into your router's admin panel occasionally to check for updates and install them as soon as they are available. This prevents attackers from exploiting known flaws.",
      "10 WAYS TO SECURE YOUR OLDER MAC FROM THREATS AND MALWARE",
      "Regularly check which devices are connected to your network and disconnect anything you no longer use. Each connected device is a potential entry point for attackers, so keeping the list limited reduces your network's exposure.",
      "Even on a secure network, malware can sneak in through downloads, phishing attacks, or compromised websites. A strong antivirus program will detect and block malicious activity, protecting your computer before damage occurs.",
      "The best way to safeguard yourself from malicious links that install malware, potentially accessing your private information, is to have strong antivirus software installed on all your devices. This protection can also alert you to phishing emails and ransomware scams, keeping your personal information and digital assets safe.",

      "Ethernet cables connect to a router as part of a home network setup. (Kurt \"CyberGuy\" Knutsson)",

      "So, which is safer, Ethernet or Wi-Fi? Ethernet wins in raw security because it eliminates many of the risks that come with wireless connections.

    "story": [
      "Skydweller CEO Robert Miller discusses his company's solar-powered drone that can fly for days on 'Fox News Live.'",
      "Shoplifting has long been a challenge for retailers, but a U.S. company now believes that flying drones could help combat the issue. Flock Safety, best known for its law enforcement camera systems, is promoting its new Flock Aerodome Drone as an Automated Security system to the private sector. The idea is simple: if a theft occurs, a drone launches, follows the suspect, and streams live video back to security teams or even police. With theft rates reportedly climbing 93% in 2024, the push for high-tech security has never been stronger.",

      "An example of a Flock Safety drone, ready to follow theft suspects within seconds (Flock Safety)",

      "TEXAS COMPANY CREATES DRONES TO CONFRONT SCHOOL SHOOTERS IN SECONDS",
      "Why retailers may be interested",
      "Organized retail crime is a growing problem. Retailers have been reporting higher losses, tighter budgets, and fewer staff members available. Flock Safety argues its drone system can act as a deterrent simply by being visible, making criminals think twice before targeting a store. Beyond retail, the company is also pitching its drones to operators of hospitals, warehouse sites, and energy facilities that require large-scale surveillance.",
      "Due to the drones' helpful technologies, retailers may soon rely on them as a visible deterrent against organized theft. (Flock Safety)",
      "HEGSETH TEARS UP RED TAPE, ORDERS PENTAGON TO BEGIN DRONE SURGE AT TRUMP'S COMMAND",
      "What this means for you",
      "For shoppers, this could mean visiting stores where drones are part of the security landscape. You might notice them overhead at malls or parking lots, watching for unusual activity. While some may view this as an added safety measure, others may worry about increased surveillance and loss of privacy. For retailers, drones could help protect profits, staff, and customers without the rising costs of hiring additional guards. But whether customers welcome drones buzzing around remains to be seen.",

      "Kurt's key takeaways",
      "Technology is quickly reshaping how companies approach security, and drones may soon play a bigger role in everyday shopping environments.

At the same time, questions about privacy and public acceptance will influence the extent to which this technology is adopted.",

      "Over the past few years, data breaches targeting schools, healthcare providers, and childcare services have been making headlines, exposing sensitive personal information and leaving families vulnerable. Now, a new breach has come to light that targets a nursery chain. Kido, which operates in the U.S., U.K., China and India, has reportedly had sensitive data stolen from thousands of children.

      "What you need to know about nursery breach",
      "According to reports, the hacker group Radiant claims to have stolen data related to around 8,000 children. To prove possession, they posted samples, including pictures and profiles of ten children, on a darknet website. They then issued a ransom demand, threatening to release more sensitive information unless Kido paid. In addition to targeting the nursery chain directly, Radiant reportedly called some of the children's parents, pressuring them to push Kido into paying the ransom.",
      "FBI WARNS ABOUT NEW EXTORTION SCAM TARGETING SENSITIVE DATA",
      "When questioned about their actions, the group defended their tactics as a form of \"penetration testing\" for which they supposedly deserved compensation. This defense is misleading, as such testing requires explicit permission from the organization being targeted or participation in an official bug bounty program. Without that consent, these actions are illegal and deeply unethical.",
      "Hackers exploited children\u2019s data in the Kido breach, exposing families to serious risks. (Kurt \"CyberGuy\" Knutsson)",
      "Why is this attack so disturbing?",
      "The Kido breach is alarming for multiple reasons. First, it involves children's data, which is particularly sensitive and legally protected in most countries. Second, the attackers combined traditional data theft with intimidation tactics, reaching out to parents directly. History suggests that once criminals gain access to such information, the attacks can escalate.",
      "Breaches like this highlight how personal and digital security are intertwined. The potential misuse of data extends beyond simple identity theft. It can impact children's safety, family privacy and long-term well-being. With attackers leveraging both the stolen data and psychological pressure on parents, the threat is particularly potent and long-lasting.",

      "7 steps parents can take to protect their child's data",
      "Even though the investigation into the Kido breach is ongoing, parents and schools can take immediate action to protect children's data and reduce the risk of further exploitation. Here's a detailed guide:",
      "Log in to email, school portals and cloud storage accounts linked to your child. Look for unusual activity such as unrecognized logins, changes to passwords or new connected devices. Set up notifications for account activity whenever possible so you are alerted instantly if something suspicious happens.",
      "Adding\u00a02FA creates an extra layer of security. Even if a hacker has a password, they won't be able to access the account without the second verification step. Most email providers, school portals and messaging platforms support this, and it's a simple step that dramatically improves security.",
      "Data broker sites often collect names, addresses and other personal details that hackers can use. Services that remove your child's information from these databases can make it harder for attackers to find and exploit sensitive data.",

      "A strong antivirus program protects devices from malware, phishing scams, and suspicious scripts. It is particularly important on devices that children use to access school portals or personal accounts. This ensures that if a hacker tries to use malware to get deeper access, it is blocked.",

      "Parents and teachers admit the workaround is clever. One teacher said she respects her students' determination to stay connected and even acknowledged that the phone ban has improved behavior and focus in class. Still, she worries that turning Google Docs into chat rooms could open the door to bullying or cheating. Parents are also weighing in.

But the trend is also stirring debate. Some parents see it as a harmless way for kids to adapt, while others worry it undermines the entire point of the ban. Educators are split too, amused by the ingenuity, yet frustrated that students are still finding ways to drift off task during lessons.

They're chatting through shared Google Docs, buying MacBooks so they can iMessage during class, swapping notes over email, and even sticking to old-school Post-Its to stay in touch. While some of these workarounds seem harmless, they also carry risks, from distractions that take focus away from learning to new opportunities for bullying or even cheating. For teachers, it's a reminder that managing distractions in the classroom goes beyond phone policies. Laptops, messaging apps, and even simple sticky notes can become back doors for the same behaviors schools are trying to limit.",

      "Cybercriminals are getting smarter every day, and one of their most convincing tricks is disguising phishing emails to look like they're coming from people you trust. Work emails are particularly dangerous because they lower your guard. After all, if the sender is your boss or IT department, why would you suspect anything? Unfortunately, scammers know this and use it to their advantage. I recently received an email from Krysti from Rockwall, Texas, who highlighted a similar issue.",

And while it sounds like you took the right first steps by changing your password, scanning for malware and monitoring for identity misuse, there are a few additional precautions worth taking.

      "Phishing emails often look like they come from someone you know, making them harder to spot. (Kurt \"CyberGuy\" Knutsson)",
      "Why work email scams are so dangerous",
      "Phishing attempts that impersonate coworkers or employers are particularly effective because they rely on trust and urgency. You're more likely to open an attachment or click a link if you believe it's tied to your job. Scammers often spoof legitimate email addresses or use addresses that look almost identical to the real ones, hoping you won't notice the subtle difference.",
      "Once you interact with these emails, the risks multiply. Opening a malicious attachment could install spyware or ransomware. Clicking a fake link might lead to a login page designed to harvest your credentials. Even if nothing obvious happens right away, attackers could still be collecting background information to use in a future attack.",
      "These scams are becoming harder to spot, too. Some are powered by artificial intelligence-generated text, making them free of the usual grammar mistakes that used to be obvious red flags. Others use stolen email threads to insert themselves into ongoing conversations. That's why even seasoned professionals fall for them.",

      "What to do immediately after a close call",
      "Changing your password or running a malware scan is often not enough to stop attackers. It's worth going a little further to make sure nothing slipped through. Start by checking your login history to see if there are any unauthorized sign-ins on your email or work accounts.",
      "Most platforms allow you to review recent activity, including device type and location, and if anything looks suspicious, sign out of all sessions immediately and change your password again. Next, enable\u00a0two-factor authentication on your email and any other critical accounts. Even if attackers manage to steal your password, they won't be able to gain access without the second verification step.",
      "It's also important to alert your IT team, especially if the email appears to come from your employer's address. This could mean the company's email system has been compromised, and notifying them will allow them to investigate and secure other accounts if necessary. Finally, make sure all your software is up to date. Malware often exploits vulnerabilities in outdated systems, so regularly updating your operating system, antivirus and productivity tools adds another layer of protection against future attacks.",

      "Some cyber threats don't reveal themselves immediately. Scammers often collect small bits of data over time or wait weeks before trying to use what they've stolen. The following steps are actions anyone can take to make sure their device and personal data remain secure, and to catch any signs of compromise before they turn into serious problems.",
      "1) Consider a personal data removal service",
      "The more personal information about you that's publicly available, the easier it is for scammers to target you. Data removal services can help by scanning hundreds of data broker websites and removing your details from them. Reducing this digital footprint not only makes it harder for attackers to build profiles on you but also limits how easily phishing attempts can be tailored to your life.",
      "While no service can guarantee the complete removal of your data from the internet, a data removal service is really a smart choice.\u00a0They aren\u2019t cheap, and neither is your privacy.\u00a0 These services do all the work for you by actively monitoring and systematically erasing your personal information from hundreds of websites.\u00a0It\u2019s what gives me peace of mind and has proven to be the most effective way to erase your personal data from the internet.\u00a0By limiting the information available, you reduce the risk of scammers cross-referencing data from breaches with information they might find on the dark web, making it harder for them to target you.",

      "Your information could already be circulating in breach dumps and underground markets without you realizing it. Identity protection services monitor known dark-web sources, forums and leak sites for your email, phone, SSN and other sensitive details. If they find a match, they alert you so you can act quickly: change passwords, turn on two-factor authentication, and place fraud alerts or credit freezes with the credit bureaus.",

      "See my tips and best picks on how to protect yourself from identity theft at\u00a0Cyberguy.com.",
      "Even if you never shared payment details, attackers may attempt account takeovers or fraudulent transactions using any information they have. Review your bank, credit card and online account statements frequently for unusual activity. Pairing this habit with identity theft protection tools gives you an added safety net, as they often include financial monitoring and fraud alerts to catch problems quickly.",
      "Email accounts are often the central hub for many other services. If your inbox is compromised, attackers might try to break into linked accounts such as cloud storage, messaging apps or collaboration tools. Check each of these services for unfamiliar logins, permission changes or device activity, and secure them by changing passwords and enabling two-factor authentication.",
      "Weak or reused passwords are one of the easiest ways for attackers to break into accounts after a breach. A password manager solves this by generating and storing strong, unique passwords for every site you use. It also acts as a passive phishing detector. If the tool doesn't autofill a login form, that's a sign the page could be fake. Over time, this significantly reduces your risk of falling victim to credential-based attacks.",
      "Next, see if your email has been exposed in past breaches. Our No. 1 password manager pick includes a built-in breach scanner that checks whether your email address or passwords have appeared in known leaks. If you discover a match, immediately change any reused passwords and secure those accounts with new, unique credentials.",

A strong antivirus solution now acts as a full security layer, blocking phishing websites, detecting malicious scripts and stopping suspicious activity before it can compromise your device. If you've interacted with a suspicious attachment or link, a reputable antivirus tool can catch malware that might still be hiding in the background.",
      "The best way to safeguard yourself from malicious links that install malware, potentially accessing your private information, is to have strong antivirus software installed on all your devices.

    "story": [
      "Paradromics is shifting from research to clinical trials.",
      "When someone stops breathing, the clock starts ticking. First responders often need to get air into the lungs fast, and one of the most reliable ways is to slide a tube into the windpipe. This process, called intubation, keeps the airway open so that oxygen can flow again.",
      "Here's the catch: intubation is incredibly hard. Even trained doctors can struggle, and every extra second puts the patient at greater risk. Now, researchers at UC Santa Barbara have designed a soft robotic device that could change how first responders handle these emergencies. It helps guide the breathing tube into place quickly, safely, and with far less training than traditional methods.",

      "Why breathing tubes are so tough to place",
      "Our bodies are built to keep food and foreign objects out of the lungs. A small flap called the epiglottis blocks the windpipe during swallowing, and the path into the trachea is narrow and curved. To get around these obstacles, current tools are rigid. Medics have to lift the epiglottis with a metal scope and carefully angle the tube forward. If it slips into the esophagus instead, oxygen goes to the stomach instead of the lungs.\u00a0\"Traditional tools must be stiff so you can push them, and they only turn by pressing on sensitive tissue,\" explained Elliot Hawkes, professor of mechanical engineering at UCSB.",

      "Even trained doctors can struggle with intubation. (Universal Images Group/Getty Images)",
      "How the soft robot works",
      "The new system, called the soft robotic intubation system (SRIS), takes a gentler approach. First, a curved guide sits at the back of the throat. Then a soft inflatable tube slowly unrolls from the inside out as it advances. Instead of being forced in, it naturally follows the right path into the windpipe. This reduces friction, lowers the risk of injury and adapts to different body shapes automatically.\u00a0\"This growing paradigm naturally accounts for minor variations in anatomy,\" said lead author David Haggerty, a recent UCSB Ph.D. graduate.",

      "The results are eye-opening:",
      "Experts had a 100% success rate.Paramedics and EMTs reached a 96% success rate with just five minutes of training.Non-experts placed the tube in an average of 21 seconds, less than half the time needed with advanced video laryngoscopes.",

Scammers deliberately strike during this window when defenses are low. A scammer who can reference your personal information, family information or property details doesn't sound like a criminal, they sound like a legitimate professional. Scams often use the weapon of urgency \u2014 you have to purportedly act fast to avoid asset seizures, legal penalties or missed deadlines.

Contact the probate court directly using publicly listed numbers, not information provided by the caller. Ask your estate attorney about any claims before making payments.",

      "The pastor of one of China's biggest underground evangelical churches was arrested Friday in what appears to be a roundup of Christian leaders, and his family and followers fear for his safety.",
      "Pastor Ezra Jin of Zion Church was detained by Chinese authorities, his daughter, Grace Jin, told Fox News Digital. Zion Church was at one point Beijing's largest church. In a document provided to Fox News Digital by Grace, it states that Jin's arrest came as nearly 30 Zion Church pastors and workers were detained or went missing across Beijing, Shenzhen, Shanghai, Chengdu, Beihai, Jiaxing and Huangdao.",
      "The Associated Press reported that dozens of other church leaders in Bejing and at least five other provinces across China were arrested Friday as well.",
      "\"One after another, they were also taken, detained. Like, they were saying that there were people outside their doors, and then one at a time they were taken into custody,\" Grace told Fox News Digital.",

      "Zion Church is one of several underground churches operating in China, meaning it is not registered with authorities, making it unlawful, according to the AP.",
      "\"The charges have been something like online dissemination of religious materials, but they have not given any paperwork out to anyone physically. But they've shown the detention slip, and that's what it says on most people's detention [slips],\" she said.",
      "Grace told Fox News Digital that China has implemented a sweeping crackdown on religious leaders in recent months. In May, Light of Zion Church Pastor Gao Quanfu of Xi'an was detained by authorities on charges of \"using superstitious activities to undermine the implementation of justice.\"",
      "Additionally, in June, multiple church workers from the Golden Lampstand Church in Linfen were sentenced to prison time for \"fraud\" charges. Grace is concerned authorities could also file a fraud charge against her father because financial documents were taken from Zion Church.",
      "Since 2018, Jin has been under surveillance and faced an exit ban, meaning he has been unable to reunite with his children, who are U.S. citizens. He has not seen them in more than six years.",

      "\"When it shut down in 2018, there was no longer anywhere like physical locations that would ever rent out such a big space for Zion,\" Grace said. \"In fact, if you were to rent out even a small space, they would immediately find out, and they would come and take down Zion.\"",
      "This put Zion Church in a difficult position, but it instead turned to the now-familiar hybrid model, holding live praise and worship sessions online while also distributing information so people could pray together in smaller groups.",
      "\"When COVID hit in 2020, Zion Church was one of the only churches with this online model,\" Grace said. \"Zion kind of blew up at this point. ... Christians all across China were attending Zion's services because it was the only church service for a while that was hosting things every Sunday online with music and sermons.\"",
      "She recalled that as other churches tried to adjust to the virtual world, her father offered his resources and methods to others. She said this helped her father connect not only with the other churches, but with congregants as well.",

      "Doctors Without Borders, or M\u00e9decins Sans Fronti\u00e8res (MSF), is an organization that most assume is focused on delivering much needed aid and supplies in harsh environments without bias or favor. However, one of the organization\u2019s former leaders is criticizing how MSF has handled the situation in Gaza, going so far as to say its members have acted as \"accomplices of Hamas.\"",
      "Alain Destexhe, who worked as a doctor with MSF in the 1980s before serving as the group\u2019s secretary-general in the 1990s, told Fox News Digital the organization moved away from its impartial, humanitarian roots.",
      "\"Well, it would have been impossible at the time when I was secretary-general of MSF to be as biased as MSF \u2014 Doctors Without Borders \u2014 is now in Gaza.

      "On Oct. 12, 2023, less than a week after Hamas carried out its brutal massacre and took more than 250 people hostage, MSF condemned the slaughter but also called for an end to Israel\u2019s actions in Gaza, making no mention of the hostages.",
      "\"M\u00e9decins Sans Fronti\u00e8res (MSF) is horrified by the brutal mass killing of civilians perpetrated by Hamas, and by the massive attacks on Gaza, Palestine, now being pursued by Israel,\" the organization wrote. \"MSF calls for an immediate cessation to the indiscriminate bloodshed, and the establishment of safe spaces and safe passage for people to reach them as a matter of urgency.\"",
      "Beyond the organization\u2019s condemnation of both the massacre and Israeli actions, Destexhe uncovered several social media posts on accounts allegedly belonging to MSF staffers appearing to celebrate the Oct. 7 massacre. Destexhe explained to Fox News Digital that much of MSF\u2019s staff in the Gaza Strip are Palestinians, not foreign workers.",

    "summary": "A shield statute allows the state to withhold a telling piece of information: where Texas is finding a hard-to-get execution drug.",
    "story": [
      "Texas, which historically drives the number of executions nationwide, is approaching a grim milestone of 600 people put to death by lethal injection since the early 1980s.",
      "But for the past 10 years, a shield statute meant to protect the safety of those participating in the execution protocol has allowed the state to withhold a telling piece of information: where Texas is finding pentobarbital, the hard-to-get drug it exclusively uses to carry out executions.",
      "The source of pentobarbital remains a closely guarded secret to the public, but records reviewed by NBC News stitch together the state\u2019s cryptic acquisition process, including how much of the drug Texas has procured over the past year and the hundreds of thousands of dollars that have been spent on transactions related to drug costs.",
      "According to those records, in September 2024, Texas acquired 20 1-gram vials of pentobarbital, and in February it obtained eight 2.5-gram vials \u2014 enough, based on its protocol, for as many as eight executions.",
      "The purchases, which are documented on Drug Enforcement Administration forms, redact the supplier\u2019s information; the agency told NBC News it was unable to comment amid the ongoing federal government shutdown.",
      "Exactly how much Texas paid for the injectable pentobarbital remains unclear. The state Department of Criminal Justice did not respond to requests for comment about its execution drug supply and the amount spent.",
      "However, a document produced by the department in response to a request for cost information about drug supplies in lethal injection executions shows multiple transaction amounts dated October 2024 and February and March of this year totaling more than $775,000.",
      "The document is partially redacted, and doesn\u2019t reveal the exact breakdown of expenses.",
      "But if Texas were to have spent upward of three quarters of a million dollars as part of its quest for pentobarbital, it would be in line with several other states, whose officials have revealed in recent months to shelling out large sums \u2014 far exceeding the wholesale value of pentobarbital \u2014 for their execution drugs, anti-death penalty groups and legal experts say.",
      "Under public pressure, some of those states have confirmed purchasing, at a marked-up rate, manufactured drugs, meaning they were produced from a Food and Drug Administration-approved pharmaceutical company as opposed to a compounding pharmacy, which are loosely regulated and have drawn concerns over quality, safety and efficacy.",
      "The pharmaceutical industry widely opposes its drugs being used for capital punishment, which is why it remains a mystery where recent purchases of pentobarbital used for executions in Texas and other states are coming from. The pharmaceutical industry\u2019s opposition has prompted lawsuits and cease-and-desist letters from drug makers and made it increasingly difficult for states to obtain the necessary chemicals.",
      "\u201cExecuting states are going to great lengths to hide these purchases from taxpayers and defense attorneys and the pharmaceutical companies whose controls they\u2019re violating \u2014 and they keep getting caught,\u201d said Matt Wells, the deputy director of Reprieve US, a human rights nonprofit organization.",
      "He added that a lack of transparency means states don\u2019t have to publicly reveal the steps taken to ensure their drugs adhere to companies\u2019 protocols and are safe to be used in executions. Lethal injection has the highest rate of \u201cbotched\u201d executions among all methods, according to the Death Penalty Information Center. While the U.S. Constitution does not guarantee a painless death during execution, it prohibits the infliction of added pain that creates unnecessary suffering.",
      "\u201cWhen state after state is spending hundreds of thousands of dollars on the black market to acquire drugs they cannot legitimately source, we\u2019re talking about a system that is broken beyond repair,\u201d Wells said.",
      "Cost of drugs",
      "Other states with secrecy laws have been able to obtain the drug but at a cost multiple times over what they\u2019re worth on the regular market.",
      "In recent years, Idaho spent about $200,000 in total for three separate purchases of manufactured pentobarbital, NBC News previously reported. One six-vial batch at $50,000 was more than three times the price at wholesale.",
      "In June, Indiana Gov. Mike Braun confirmed that his state had paid more than $1 million for four doses of pentobarbital, some of which expired before they could be used. It\u2019s not clear what quantity each dose amounts to.",
      "Utah spent roughly $200,000 for manufactured pentobarbital used in a 2024 execution, corrections officials said.",
      "And since 2017, Tennessee has purchased nearly $600,000 worth of execution drugs from an undisclosed supplier, The Tennessean reported in March.",
      "Commercially made injectable pentobarbital can run about $2,500 for a 2.5-gram vial, said Jeffrey Pilz, an assistant director of pharmacy at The Ohio State University\u2019s Wexner Medical Center.",
      "In Texas\u2019 case, Pilz said, the eight 2.5-gram vials of pentobarbital it acquired in February should have cost close to $20,000.",
      "But when execution drugs are significantly marked up, particularly for federally approved manufactured drugs, it raises questions about who sold them to a state, how that supplier obtained them and whether regulatory channels were subverted, said Maurie Levin, a Texas death penalty defense attorney.",
      "\u201cTexas\u2019 secrecy law allows the state to hide the unethical practices of some of the pharmacies from whom they get drugs, and how they purchase drugs for executions, including what appears to be the purchase of drugs on the black market, at an enormous cost,\u201d Levin said.",
      "Manufactured vs. compounded drugs",
      "Two pharmaceutical companies manufacturing in the U.S. are known to make injectable pentobarbital, a sedative more commonly used to treat insomnia and seizures.",
      "Both Hikma, a U.K.-based company whose U.S. headquarters are in New Jersey, and Sagent, which is based in Illinois, have asked states to ensure they don\u2019t use their drugs in executions.",
      "Sagent warned Idaho in a letter last year that when its \u201cproducts are diverted from legitimate channels, in violation of our distribution controls, they risk being counterfeit, stolen, contaminated, or otherwise harmful.\u201d",
      "Whether Hikma or Sagent have sent similar warnings to Texas is unclear. Neither company returned requests for comment, although a Hikma spokesperson told NBC News this year that it has sent such letters to states annually for the past eight years \u201cto firmly remind them of our strong objections to the use of our medicines in capital punishment.\u201d",

      "The Texas Department of Criminal Justice also didn\u2019t respond to requests about whether its most recently purchased batch of pentobarbital was manufactured or from a compounding pharmacy.",
      "Texas began solely using pentobarbital, a sedative, for executions in 2012. A potent dose can lead to death from respiratory failure.",
      "In 2015, Texas, along with Arizona and Nebraska, attempted to import thousands of vials of sodium thiopental, an anesthetic, from a supplier in India to use in executions, but Texas\u2019 shipments were seized by the FDA because they were not approved in the U.S.",
      "After that, Texas reportedly moved to acquire the pentobarbital from compounding pharmacies in the state. Compounded drugs have shorter shelf lives than manufactured ones, and are typically labeled with a \u201cbeyond use date,\u201d similar to an expiration date, Pilz said.",
      "Texas has been known to relabel its drugs\u2019 beyond-use dates, a practice that has been criticized in recent years by death row inmates who have alleged in court that the drugs are expired and unsafe.",
      "'Use it or lose it'",
      "Documents indicate that Texas\u2019 pentobarbital stock includes some batches labeled with beyond-use dates, signifying it was compounded, and others with expiration dates, suggesting those were manufactured.",
      "A manufacturer sets the expiration date, which is \u201cderived from the sterility, stability, and analytical chemical studies\u201d performed within a controlled environment, according to an American Society of Health-System Pharmacists guide.",
      "Pilz said compounding pharmacies may also register as an outsourcing facility to produce larger batches of medication, and therefore, could assign expiration dates to drugs.",
      "The documents reviewed by NBC News indicate five vials of pentobarbital purchased by Texas had a \u201cbeyond use date\u201d of September 2024, but that shelf life was recently extended to May 2026, and another three vials had a September 2024 \u201cbeyond use date.\u201d",
      "But the 20 1-gram vials of pentobarbital that were acquired in September 2024 had an April 2025 expiration date, records show. They were used for the executions of Garcia White in October 2024 and Steven Nelson, Richard Tabler and Moises Mendoza in early 2025.",
      "The documents also indicate the eight 2.5-gram vials of pentobarbital acquired in February expire at the end of this month.",
      "Inventory logs reviewed by NBC News show some of those vials were removed for the execution of Matthew Johnson in May, but they did not reflect whether that same supply was used in the execution of Blaine Milam in September.",
      "It\u2019s also unclear whether the expiring drugs would have been used in the Oct. 16 execution of Robert Roberson, who was poised to be the 597th person executed by Texas.",
      "Roberson was convicted in the 2002 death of his 2-year-old daughter, Nikki, and would be the first prisoner in the nation executed in connection with \u201cshaken baby syndrome.\u201d",
      "With just days to spare, an appeals court last week halted the execution based on another case of disputed evidence surrounding the medical diagnosis, meaning Texas would not be able to use that expiring supply of pentobarbital since no other inmate is scheduled to die this month and the next execution isn\u2019t until late January.",
      "\u201cWith the stay of Mr. Roberson\u2019s execution, the manufactured drugs we believe to currently be in their possession, which expire at the end of October, have to be trashed,\u201d said Levin, the death penalty attorney.",
      "She added that Roberson\u2019s case \u2014 now the third time his execution has been put on pause \u2014 underscores the greater challenge for states as they seek manufactured lethal injection drugs.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s a constant game of use it or lose it or extend the \u2018beyond use date\u2019 for the umpteenth time, including the hundreds of thousands of dollars they spent to get it,\u201d she said. \u201cThe expiration date of illegally purchased drugs should hardly be the engine driving Texas executions.\u201d"

    "story": [
      "GALLUP, N.M. \u2014 In 2020, as the Covid pandemic raged, the school district here thought it had found the perfect solution to help provide online schooling to its mostly Native American students when it hired a for-profit education company called Stride Inc.",
      "Stride, a 25-year-old company also known as K12 Inc., is an industry leader in virtual education, serving over 220,000 students in 31 states last school year. It promised Gallup-McKinley County Schools (GMCS) it would provide teachers, laptops and internet hot spots for students who enrolled, in exchange for around $8,000 per pupil. The virtual school, New Mexico Destinations Career Academy, signed up roughly 1,000 students in the 2020-21 school year, a number that would quadruple over time.",
      "Five years later, the district has ended its contract with Stride, a publicly traded corporation, and accused it of prioritizing profits at the expense of students. In interviews, court filings and government complaints, the district alleges Stride reported exaggerated student attendance counts to drive up revenue, neglected special education students and violated state law on student-teacher ratios. Graduation rates and math, reading and science scores among online students all declined, some dramatically, according to district data, while in-person rates improved or stayed the same.",
      "In a complaint filed with the state Public Education Department in May, obtained by NBC News through a public records request, a key Stride employee alleged that top executives knew for at least two years that dozens of teachers were out of compliance with student ratio laws.",
      "Mike Hyatt, the Gallup-McKinley superintendent, has blasted the company. \u201cIt was our students that were taken advantage of,\u201d he said. \u201cThey\u2019re the ones \u2014 whether they know it or not \u2014 that were harmed in this. And that just makes me sick inside that a company did this on our watch.\u201d",
      "Stride, a $6 billion company whose revenue has doubled over the past five years, is fighting back, with five lawsuits this year against the district that are still pending. It alleges that the district violated its contract with the company, along with laws governing open meetings for school boards, and it has refused to pay it for the past academic year.",
      "Its attorney also lodged a conflict-of-interest complaint in April against Hyatt, prompting a state review of his educator\u2019s license. Hyatt had applied for a job with Stride in December and been turned down in February. He said that there is no connection between the allegations and his rejection for the job and that the lawsuits are an attempt to distract from Stride\u2019s problems.",
      "A lawsuit the district filed against Stride in late August quotes the whistleblower, who said that on an April 8 Zoom call about the allegations, Peter Stewart, senior vice president of school development, said Stride should \u201cattack first publicly.\u201d",
      "The state Public Education Department declined to comment on that whistleblower complaint, the allegations against Stride or the ongoing inquiry into Hyatt\u2019s license. Stewart did not respond to a request for comment.",
      "Stride also declined to address the whistleblower complaint. In response to questions, it defended its actions. \u201cThe situation with GMCS is highly unusual, and we believe the district\u2019s actions have left us with no choice but to seek legal resolution to protect our students, staff and contractual obligations,\u201d it said in a statement. \u201cStride is committed to fair and equitable business practices with our partner districts, and we deny the allegations made by GMCS.\u201d"

      "WASHINGTON \u2014 The Supreme Court on Tuesday rejected conservative conspiracy theorist Alex Jones' last-ditch attempt to block an almost $1.5 billion defamation judgment he faces over false claims that the 2012 Sandy Hook school shooting was a hoax.",
      "The court without comment turned away Jones' appeal of a state court ruling.",
      "Last week he urged the court to urgently intervene, saying that if the court did not take action, his website, Infowars, was at risk of being turned over to the satirical news site The Onion.",

    "summary": "The Supreme Court's conservative majority could use the Louisiana redistricting case to further weaken the landmark Voting Rights Act.",
    "story": [
      "WASHINGTON \u2014 The way Louisiana\u2019s Republican leaders put it, the pervasive racial discrimination in elections that led to the passage of the 1965 Voting Rights Act is all in the past.",
      "That is why they are now urging the Supreme Court, in a case being argued on Wednesday, to bar states from using any consideration of race when drawing legislative districts, gutting a key plank of the law that was designed to ensure Black voters would have a chance of electing their preferred candidates.",
      "Louisiana Attorney General Liz Murrill told NBC News that the Voting Rights Act was designed to address blatantly discriminatory policies and practices that prevented Black people and other minorities from voting decades ago.",
      "\u201cI think the question now is, have we gotten to a point where those obstacles really don\u2019t exist anymore?\u201d she said. \u201cI don\u2019t think they exist in Louisiana,\u201d she added.",
      "At issue is a congressional district map that Louisiana grudgingly redrew last year after being sued under the Voting Rights Act to ensure that there were two majority-Black districts. The original map only had one in a state where a third of the population is Black, according to the U.S. census.",
      "The state\u2019s new legal argument, which may appeal to a conservative-majority Supreme Court, is that drawing a map to ensure majority-Black districts violates the Constitution\u2019s 14th and 15th Amendments, which were both enacted after the Civil War to ensure former slaves had equal rights under the law, including the right to vote.",
      "Conservatives say those amendments bar any consideration of race at any time, and the Supreme Court has previously embraced this \u201ccolorblind\u201d interpretation of the Constitution.",
      "Civil rights activists say that approach makes a mockery of both the post-Civil War amendments and the Voting Rights Act, not to mention their experience on the ground in Louisiana.",
      "Press Robinson, who is one of the plaintiffs who challenged Louisiana\u2019s original congressional map, said he had to sue in 1974 just so he could take his place as an elected official on the East Baton Rouge Parish School Board.",
      "\u201cHas Louisiana really changed? I don\u2019t see it,\u201d he told reporters on a recent call.",
      "The issue reaches the court, which has a 6-3 conservative majority, just two years after it surprisingly rejected a similar bid to weaken the Voting Rights Act in another redistricting case.",
      "The court, however, has struck blows against the law in other rulings in 2013 and 2021.",
      "In the 2023 case, the court rejected a Republican-drawn congressional map in Alabama on the grounds that it discriminated against Black voters, leading to a new map being drawn that included two majority-Black districts.",
      "The vote was 5-4, with two conservatives, Chief Justice John Roberts and Justice Brett Kavanaugh, joining the court\u2019s three liberals in the majority. Four other conservatives dissented.",
      "In Wednesday\u2019s oral argument, Kavanaugh will be a focus of attention, in part because of what he said in his separate concurring opinion in the Alabama case.",
      "Although Kavanaugh voted with the majority, he expressed some sympathy for the argument that even if race could at one point be considered as a factor in ensuring compliance with the Voting Rights Act, it no longer can be.",
      "But, he added, \u201cAlabama did not raise that temporal argument in this Court, and I therefore would not consider it at this time.\u201d",
      "Now, piggybacking on Kavanaugh\u2019s opinion, Louisiana\u2019s lawyers eagerly embrace the argument Alabama did not make.",
      "Among other things, Louisiana points to the court\u2019s 2023 ruling that ended the consideration of race in college admissions, which was issued just three weeks after the Alabama voting rights ruling.",
      "Chris Kieser, a lawyer at the right-leaning Pacific Legal Foundation, which supports Louisiana in the case, said in an interview that the upshot of a ruling in the state\u2019s favor is that there could be no obligation to ever intentionally draw majority-Black districts.",
      "\u201cDistricts should not be drawn based on the expected race of the \u2014 whoever is going to be the member of Congress representing it,\u201d he said.",
      "That could lead to a decline in the number of legislators at the national and state level who are Black or Latino.",
      "In that scenario, minority voters would still be able to bring separate racial gerrymandering claims under the Constitution if there is obvious racial discrimination, Kieser argued, although such cases are difficult to win.",
      "Depending on what the court does, the provision of the Voting Rights Act in question, known as Section 2, could survive in limited form.",
      "A ruling that leads to a reduction in majority-Black and other minority districts would have a partisan impact that could favor Republicans, as Black voters historically favor Democrats. If the court rules quickly, there is even a chance that new maps could be drawn ahead of the hotly contested 2026 midterm elections.",
      "The case has a convoluted history, arising from litigation over the earlier map drawn by the state Legislature after the 2020 census that included one Black-majority district out of the state\u2019s six districts.",
      "The state drew the current map in order to comply with that ruling, but was then sued by a group of self-identified \u201cnon-African American\u201d voters who argued that in seeking to comply with the Voting Rights Act, the state had violated the Constitution.",
      "The Supreme Court originally heard the current case earlier this year on a narrower set of legal issues but, in an unusual move, asked in June for the parties to reargue it. Over the summer, the court then raised the stakes by asking the lawyers to focus on the constitutional issue.",
      "As a result of that complicated background, the various briefs filed in the case \u2014 including one submitted by the Trump administration in support of Louisiana \u2014 make a number of different legal arguments.",
      "That makes it difficult to know ahead of Wednesday\u2019s oral argument what the justices will focus on, said Sophia Lin Lakin, a lawyer at the American Civil Liberties Union who is part of the legal team defending the latest Louisiana map.",
      "\u201cIt is so strange. Normally, we would always understand the question we are trying to answer,\u201d she said.",
      "Lin Lakin does not think the case should be used as the vehicle for a \u201cfull-on assault\u201d on the Voting Rights Act.",
      "But, she conceded, \u201cthere is some risk the way that\u2019s being presented that the court may be interested in that bigger question.\u201d"

      "On Oct. 7, Aurora Griffo, who posted food videos under the name \u201cGlamorama\u201d on TikTok, shared a now-deleted review of Arizona bakery JL Patisserie that sparked major backlash and, eventually, an apology.",
      "\u201cI do not mind spending 10 dollars on a pastry if they are really good, but you cannot use fake-ass ingredients,\u201d Griffo said in the controversial review, while holding a pistachio croissant. \u201cThat pistachio color is about as natural as my boobs, ass and waistline.\u201d",
      "She was similarly harsh regarding the shop\u2019s coffee, which she deemed \u201csuper sour and acidic,\u201d and its quiche, which she said had a \u201cpaper-thin\u201d crust and so much egg, she \u201cwould have eaten an omelet\u201d instead.",
      "\u201cFive dollars for a canel\u00e9? I didn\u2019t even pay that in San Tro-f---ing-pez,\u201d she continued. \u201cThat\u2019s the price next to the Phoenix Airport? OK.\u201d",
      "\u201cI absolutely loved the pumpkin pie croissant, but everything was a little on the sweet and rich side, which some people love,\u201d she added. \u201cPersonally, I like my sweets a little less sweet, so I\u2019d rather get treated like s--- and go to Paris again.\u201d",
      "Griffo ended her review with this missive: \u201cWith all of that being said, I think if you stay away from the expensive ingredients, like deez nuts, you can definitely enjoy delicious, rich pastry here.\u201d",
      "The Bakery\u2019s Response Goes Viral",
      "Though the review itself didn\u2019t initially go viral, it caught the attention of the bakery, which is owned by Jenna Leurquin. On Oct. 9, she responded in a now-viral video, disputing most of Griffo\u2019s claims, without naming her directly.",
      "\u201cSo, we recently had an influencer reach out to us and asked to do a collaboration, and we respectfully declined, because it was not in our budget right now,\u201d Leurquin said. \u201cThen, she essentially tried to blackmail us by saying if we offered the food for free, she would then write a good review about us.\u201d",
      "Along with the claim, Leurquin posted a screenshot of a direct message from Griffo in which she said the \u201cmeal will need to be comped including the gratuity\u201d for a collaboration, but that if the bakery accepts, her \u201chonest review\u201d would \u201chighlight/focus on what l enjoyed and be softer/quicker on my words with what I may not like as much.\u201d",
      "Leurquin said she would consider it, but before she\u2019d made up her mind, Griffo came in the next day. The staff recognized her when she came in and were \u201cvery accommodating\u201d and \u201ctotally respected that review,\u201d said Leurquin.",
      "\u201cBut what we don\u2019t like is lying and bullying,\u201d Leurquin said.",
      "For the remainder of the video, she pushes back on the accusation that the bakery\u2019s ingredients are fake: They use PreGel pistachio paste, which is \u201cmade from the finest pistachios,\u201d Panettone flour from Italy, and other imported ingredients. \u201cNot bad for a \u2018close to the airport bakery,\u201d Leurquin said.",
      "Aafter showing some of the bakery\u2019s preparation processes and noting everything is made from scratch, Leurquin ends the video with a message to all influencers.",
      "\u201cThis isn\u2019t just about me. This specific influencer has gone to many different local restaurants and bullied them,\u201d Leurquin said. \u201cThe problem is if the next generation is influenced by her to believe it\u2019s OK to bully and disrespect the food industry.\u201d",
      "Griffo did not immediately respond to TODAY.com\u2019s request for comment.",
      "Leurquin\u2019s response garnered a staggering 60 million views and nearly 50,000 comments.",
      "\u201cI am loving this new trend of restaurants getting publicity for outing these influencers, blackmailing businesses for a pastry,\u201d commented one TikTok user.",
      "Referring to Griffo\u2019s review, someone else said, \u201cThat was straight bullying just because she couldn\u2019t get free food.\u201d",
      "Even mega-popular food reviewer Keith Lee weighed in on the drama.",
      "\u201cWhat you do with a little is what you do with a lot,\u201d he said. \u201cIf you say you\u2019re gonna be honest now, and you not honest, you ain\u2019t gonna be honest when you get 100 million followers, that\u2019s the way I feel.\u201d",
      "Glamorama Responds, Then Apologizes",
      "Griffo posted a response to Leurquin, saying it was a \u201cbit of a stretch\u201d that she was bullying the bakery, since it has more followers than she does, but later deleted the video.",
      "\u201cGoddamn, someone finally stood up to me. You know, I gotta say f---ing kudos for real,\u201d Griffo said. \u201cI never said that I would leave a good review for a free meal.\u201d",
      "That video didn\u2019t go over well, either: After even more backlash, Griffo deleted all of her videos, changed her username and posted an apology.",

    "summary": "Who was Adeline Watkins and what happened to her? This is the true story of Ed Gein's girlfriend and how it compares to what's shown in the series.",
    "story": [
      "The newest season of Netflix's \"Monster\" not only depicts killer Ed Gein and his macabre crimes, it also shows him with a female companion whose role in his life has been disputed.",
      "Charlie Hunnam plays the man who became known as The Butcher of Plainfield for the grisly crimes uncovered at his Wisconsin farm in 1957. Gein admitted to killing two local women and robbing graves at a local cemetery to make ghoulish items like bowls, lampshades and upholstered chairs out of human skin and bone.",
      "In \"Monster: The Ed Gein Story,\" actor Suzanna Son plays a woman named Adeline Watkins, who appears to be Gein\u2019s girlfriend and a woman who shares some of his interest in gruesome murders.",
      "Was she a real person? Here's what to know.",
      "Who Was Adeline Watkins?",
      "Following Gein's arrest in 1957, a local woman from Gein's hometown of Plainfield named Adeline Watkins gave an interview with the Minneapolis Tribune, which was reprinted in the Wisconsin State Journal on Nov. 21, 1957, saying Gein once proposed to her.",
      "Watkins, who was 50 years old at the time, described Gein as \"good and kind and sweet\" in the article.",
      "She claimed the two had a 20-year romance and that Gein \"was so nice about doing things I wanted to do that sometimes I felt I was taking advantage of him.\"",
      "\"I loved him and I still do,\" she added.",
      "She was described by the reporter as \"a plain woman with graying bangs and horn-rimmed glasses.\"",
      "Watkins said her last date with Gein was on Feb. 6, 1955, about two years before he was arrested. She claimed that Gein didn't explicitly propose to her that night, but she \"knew what he meant.\"",
      "\"I turned him down, but not because there was anything wrong with him,\" she continued. \"It was something wrong with me. I guess I was afraid I wouldn't be able to live up to what he expected of me.\"",
      "Watkins' mother was also quoted saying Gein was a \"sweet, polite man\" who always had her daughter home by 10 p.m. from a date.",
      "Watkins added that she and Gein often talked about books, including his favorites about lions, tigers, Africa and India. She said they also loved true crime.",
      "\"I guess we discussed every murder we ever heard about,\" she said. \"Eddie told how the murdered did wrong, what mistakes he had made. I thought it was interesting.\"",
      "What Did Ed Gein Say About His Relationship with Adeline Watkins?",
      "Gein never publicly made any mention of Watkins.",
      "In the book \"Unhinged\" by Robert Keller, Gein was described as a \"lonely old bachelor\" whom local farmers' wives took pity on and delivered meals and cookies to him at his farm.",
      "Watkins said in the Minneapolis Tribune that she and Gein went on dates to the movies or a local tavern. She said she had to \"drag\" Gein into a tavern because he did not drink.",
      "However, one of the women Gein admitted to murdering was a tavern owner, Mary Hogan. He frequently visited her establishment and looked at her as a \"mirror image of his sainted mother,\" according to \"Unhinged.\" It's unclear whether Watkins and Gein ever visited Hogan's tavern or if they were ever truly a couple.",
      "Following his arrest, Gein lived in state psychiatric facilities until his death in 1984.",
      "While growing up under their mother's domineering presence, Gein and his brother were warned constantly by their mother about the immorality of women and told to avoid them. Neither of them ever married, and Ed Gein remained obsessed with his mother until her death and beyond.",
      "Adeline Watkins Retracted Her Statements",
      "Watkins' interview with the Minnesota paper was picked up by The Associated Press and made national headlines for her alleged love affair with a ghoulish murderer and grave robber.",
      "She then spoke to the local Stevens Point Journal in Wisconsin for a story that ran on Dec. 3, 1957, and denied some of her previous statements.",
      "Watkins said there was no 20-year romance between the two, only that she had known him for 20 years. She said she had only spent time with him during a seven-month period in 1954 and went to a few shows at a local theater and spent time with him at her home. She said she never visited his home.",
      "She denied that she or her mother had referred to Gein as \"sweet\" in the interview. She also denied saying she had to \"practically drag\" Gein into a local tavern.",
      "Outside of the two newspaper stories, Watkins did not speak publicly about Gein again. She died at 85 in 1992 and was buried in the Plainfield Cemetery in Wisconsin. It's one of the cemeteries where Gein admitted to digging up corpses in the 1940s and '50s.",
      "How is Adeline Watkins Portrayed in 'Monster'?",
      "Son portrays Watkins as Gein's girlfriend in the Netflix series. It also shows her as complicit in his crimes. There is no evidence of that ever happening.",
      "Son's character shows him photos of Holocaust victims and notorious Nazi war criminal Ilse Koch, and then Gein shows her the hair-raising items he made out of human body parts. She is shown a bowl made of a skull, a belt made out of women's nipples and a chair upholstered with human skin, all of which were real items found by authorities at Gein's home in Plainfield, Wisconsin.",
      "He also introduces Son's character to his \"mother,\" which is really a corpse of his late mother sitting in a chair with her back to Watkins like a scene straight out of \"Psycho,\" which was inspired by Gein's crimes. Adeline then promptly leaves.",
      "Gein denied digging up the body of his mother, Augusta Gein, who died of a stroke in 1945.",
      "In a later episode, the two are seen at a graveyard, where Watkins accepts a wedding proposal from Gein. She is then shown wanting to have sex with him, but he stops her because he's been taught by his mother that sex is only for procreation.",
      "The two are then shown moving in together, and Watkins is depicted as having a morbid fascination when she finds the corpse of one of Gein's victims. Yet another disturbing scene shows Watkins photographing corpses mutilated by Gein and encouraging necrophilia.",
      "None of these events appear to have happened, according to police reports, interviews with Gein and the interviews with Watkins.",
      "In perhaps a nod to the Minneapolis Tribune interview by Watkins, Son's character is later shown seeking media attention to grab the spotlight after Gein's crimes have been made public. In the final episode, she meets with Gein in his psychiatric hospital and confesses to disturbing urges.",
      "Neither Gein nor Watkins ever spoke of any meeting between them while Gein was in the hospital."

      "Instead of going back to sleep, she spent all night outlining \u201cConform,\u201d her debut novel and the first book from Jenna Bush Hager\u2019s Thousand Voices imprint, a joint venture with Random House. Jenna said in a previous interview with TODAY.com that the book is \u201cMargaret Atwood meets Sarah J. Maas.\u201d",
      "\u201cConform\u201d is set in a futuristic authoritarian state where people are sharply divided based on genetic anomalies. Emeline is given the chance to ascend to a higher rank when she\u2019s chosen as a mating partner of one of the society\u2019s elites, but finds a romantic connection with a rebel. (On the topic of the love triangle, Sullivan says she\u2019s firmly Team Emeline.)",
      "Within weeks, Sullivan\u2019s first idea turned into the outline of a trilogy, and then three trilogies, all outlining how this society came to be and where it\u2019s going. Sullivan\u2019s next book is the first of the prequel trilogy, and she predicts debates over the order to read the books in.",
      "Sullivan isn\u2019t quite surprised that she had the capacity to write and outline these books. She says she was always a daydreamer and wrote previously, including some Dramione fanfic.",
      "\u201cThe fact that I wasn\u2019t intimidated by it, and was like, \u2018No, I\u2019m going to do it.\u2019 That\u2019s probably what shocked me most,\u201d she says.",
      "She says writing helped her out of the rut she was in when the idea first arrived.",
      "\u201cBy the time I had finished \u2018Conform,\u2019 I was in such a better place emotionally and mentally,\u201d she says, adding she also went to therapy.",

      "Read an Excerpt From 'Conform'",
      "\u201cThis way, Ms. Emeline. He is waiting.\u201d",
      "My heart began an erratic dance. Not trusting myself to speak, I nodded. As we approached the curtains, they pulled back automati\u00adcally.",
      "A magnificent secret garden unlike anything I had ever seen sprawled before me, stealing my breath. Flowers of all kinds ex\u00adploded everywhere\u2014large white hydrangeas, amethyst wisteria, honeysuckle, buttercups, and orange lilies\u2014spilling onto the tile, climbing the walls, and hanging from the ceiling. Small glowing orbs swayed from the ceiling among the wisteria, almost like stars. In the very center of the room stood a beautiful willow. A tree in the sky. It was art. Did the Elite see it? They destroyed ancient art, yet created their own. Why?",
      "Hesitantly, I followed the attendant into the hidden paradise. I didn\u2019t know where to look first, every step revealing more beauty. Alone, I might have run my hands along the flowers and stopped to smell each one.",
      "Life below, my life, was primitive and barren in comparison. I had been living a bleak existence, waiting in perpetual solitude. We all just accepted it.",
      "Lo didn\u2019t. I understood her constant nagging and dedication to improving her social standing. But the sweet perfume of the flowers turned sour at the truth that Minors were given the bare minimum while the Elite surrounded themselves with luxuries. Maybe a part of me wanted to be beguiled by the beauty surrounding me. Another part\u2014the part that didn\u2019t fit\u2014couldn\u2019t stand the divide.",
      "Bright colors and sparkling jewels adorned the Elites sitting at every table we passed. The glittering observers whispered behind heavily ringed hands or elaborate embroidered fans. My breath be\u00adcame too quick as more leaned in like a swarm of bees, lined eyes watching my every step.",
      "The rules from the Grooming slithered into my mind.",
      "Rule One: Remember your place. Although you are in the clouds, your MIND has deemed you defective. You are until your last breath a Minor Defect.",
      "I looked straight ahead, unable to meet anyone\u2019s eyes, even with the lens. My golden dress was a stark, unsettling difference in a rain\u00adbow sea of colorful flowers and gowns. I was the antithesis of the delicate blooms. It was as if I were the sun shining brightly, and all the flowers and people revolved around my presence. Never had I felt so seen. I wasn\u2019t entirely sure it was a good thing.",
      "The attendant finally stopped at a small table below the willow, its branches swaying gently. The man blocked the person waiting for me at the table. A chair scraped against the ground, and my stomach twisted viciously, heartbeats turned violent, slamming into my chest like it might bolt, and I fought the urge to follow it all the way back to the surface forever below.",
      "\u201cYour guest, sir.\u201d The man in gray stepped to the side, gesturing to me before disappearing in the throng of flowers and people.",
      "My heart stopped. The buzzing of conversation, the blooms, and even the tree fell away. Silence found me as the most beautiful man I had ever seen waited \u2014 for me.",
      "\u201cHello, Emeline.\u201d",

      "Women of Worth is L\u2019Or\u00e9al Paris\u2019 annual signature philanthropic initiative that recognizes and rewards 10 women who are making a difference in their communities through their nonprofit work.",
      "\u201cThe slogan \u2018Because you\u2019re worth it\u2019 has always been more than makeup, lipstick and hair care. It really is about being a mantra for women to understand their value in life, their jobs, their relationships and their families,\u201d Longoria says. \u201cFor the L\u2019Oreal family to extend that to everyday people and to put the spotlight on women doing amazing things in their community, it just felt so on brand, so perfect.\u201d",

      "\"It\u2019s grammatically incorrect to say 'most unique,' but all rules of grammar, and I guess anything else, are suspended when talking about Diane Keaton,\" Allen wrote.",
      "Allen said he first met Keaton during an audition, and that she was later cast in his Broadway play, \"Play It Again, Sam.\"",
      "\"For the first week of rehearsal we never spoke a word to one another. She was shy, I was shy, and with two shy people things can get pretty dull. Finally, by chance we took a break at the same moment and wound up sharing a fast bite at some Eighth Avenue joint,\" he wrote.",
      "\"That was our first moment of personal contact,\" he continued. \"The upshot is that she was so charming, so beautiful, so magical, that I questioned my sanity. I thought: Could I be in love so quickly?\"",
      "Allen said that by the time the show opened, he and Keaton were lovers, and that he started to show her his films.",
      "\"As time went on I made movies for an audience of one, Diane Keaton,\" he wrote. \"I never read a single review of my work and cared only what Keaton had to say about it. If she liked it, I counted the film as an artistic success. If she was less than enthusiastic, I tried to use her criticism to reedit and come away with something she felt better about.\"",
      "Allen said he learned several things from Keaton during their time together before they split.",
      "\"We had a few great personal years together and finally we both moved on, and why we parted only God and Freud might be able to figure out,\" he wrote.",
      "He added: \"I went on to keep trying to make that great masterpiece that I am still struggling with when I last looked. I kidded Keaton that we\u2019d wind up\u2014she like Norma Desmond, me like Erich von Stroheim, once her director, now her chauffeur.\"",
      "Allen reflected on the world without Keaton.",
      "\"But the world is constantly being redefined, and with Keaton\u2019s passing it is redefined once again,\" he said. \"A few days ago the world was a place that included Diane Keaton. Now it\u2019s a world that does not. Hence, it\u2019s a drearier world.\"",
      "He pointed to her lasting legacy in her films, and that \"her great laugh still echoes in my head.\"",
      "Allen went on to have a professional and personal relationship with Mia Farrow, who had several children when they met, including biological children with her former husband Andre Previn, and adopted children.",
      "Allen co-adopted two of Mia Farrow's children, Dylan and Moses Farrow, in 1991, and Mia Farrow gave birth to Allen's child, Ronan Farrow, in 1987.",
      "In 1992, Allen denied accusations made by Mia and Dylan Farrow that he sexually abused Dylan Farrow when she was 7 years old, according to The New York Times.",
      "\u201cThis is an unconscionable and gruesomely damaging manipulation of innocent children for vindictive and self-serving motives,\u201d Allen said, according to the Times.",
      "Allen was never charged with a crime, but the allegations against him resurfaced in the 2010s. Keaton defended Allen in a post on X in 2018 during the #MeToo movement.",
      "\"Woody Allen is my friend and I continue to believe him. It might be of interest to take a look at the 60 Minute interview from 1992 and see what you think,\" Keaton wrote, linking to a clip of the interview.",
      "Keaton never married, and Allen went on to marry one of Mia Farrow's adopted children, Soon-Yi Previn, in 1997, when she was 27 and he was 62."

      "Traditional constipation treatments include increasing fiber intake through foods like prunes and other fruits and vegetables, drinking more water, and using different kinds of laxatives.",
      "While the new guidelines include certain fiber-rich foods and fiber supplements, there\u2019s no guidance on a \u201chigh-fiber diet\u201d overall.",
      "\u201cWhen we were building these guidelines, and looking at the literature, we were expecting a lot more evidence on a high-fiber diet, and there simply isn\u2019t enough in constipation,\u201d Dimidi said.",
      "\u201cThere\u2019s plenty of evidence that a high-fiber diet is very beneficial for our overall health and also for elements of gut health, such as reducing the risk of colorectal cancer,\u201d she added. \u201cBut when it comes to constipation, specifically, we just don\u2019t have enough evidence to say that it improves constipation.\u201d",
      "What are the new recommendations?",
      "Chey, who wasn\u2019t involved with the new guidelines, said the recommendations \u201cprovide a valuable road map to things that [people] can try as they\u2019re waiting to see their primary care physician.\u201d",
      "He added that people with more severe cases of constipation may need to see a gastroenterologist.",
      "The recommendations include:",
      "Fiber supplements: More than 10 grams of fiber supplements, such as psyllium, per day can improve stool frequency and consistency and aid in reducing straining. Fiber supplements should be slowly introduced and dosage gradually increased.Probiotics: Certain strains of probiotics, including, B. lactis and Bacillus coagulans Unique IS2, may help some people with symptoms. If taking one, patients should take a supplement of their choice and follow the manufacturer\u2019s instructions for at least four weeks.Magnesium oxide supplements: 0.5-1.5 grams daily can help with stool frequency and consistency, reduce symptoms such as bloating and abdominal pain and improve overall quality of life. Dosage should start at 0.5 grams per day and be gradually increased weekly.Kiwis: Three daily, with or without the skin, can help improve stool frequency but not consistency.Rye bread: Six to eight slices of rye bread per day can also aid stool frequency, but not consistency. The authors noted that this amount may not be realistic for some people.High mineral-content water: In combination with other treatments, 0.5-1.5 liters per day of high mineral-content water may also help. One of the key minerals in high mineral-content water, magnesium, is a known laxative.",

      "Still, overall, he said, \u201cI think these kinds of recommendations are going to be very helpful.\u201d",
      "Dimidi said she hopes the release of the guidelines can \u201cempower\u201d those with chronic constipation.",
      "\u201cWe\u2019re hoping [the guidance] means that clinicians are very well-informed and can provide personalized advice to their patients that is very effective,\u201d she said. \u201cBut also that people themselves with constipation can access now evidence-based information, feel empowered to take control of the symptoms and improve a condition that has a tremendous impact on quality of life.\u201d"

      "WASHINGTON \u2014 A jubilant Donald Trump celebrated a hard-won ceasefire Monday in the conflict between Israel and Hamas militants, while inviting Middle East leaders to create a lasting peace that unlocks the region\u2019s potential for dramatic economic growth.",
      "As all 20 living hostages rejoined their families in Israel, Trump spoke to the nation's parliament in Jerusalem and marked a momentous breakthrough in a war that began just over two years ago.",
      "The U.S. president who wrung a peace deal from bitter combatants told the Knesset that \u201cthe long and painful nightmare is finally over.\u201d",
      "\u201cThis is not only the end of a war,\u201d said Trump, who had arrived in Israel in the morning. \u201cThis is the end of an age of terror and death and the beginning of the age of faith and hope and of God.",
      "\"It\u2019s the start of a grand concord and lasting harmony for Israel and all the nations of what will soon be a truly magnificent region.\u201d",
      "Making it so won\u2019t be easy. Old antagonisms could resurface at any point, jeopardizing the truce that Trump and his advisers brokered over the past few months.",
      "An accusation of bad faith came right away. Family members said Monday that Hamas had released the remains of only four of 28 deceased hostages, breaking a commitment. They called for an \u201cimmediate suspension\u201d of the ceasefire agreement until all the bodies are returned.",
      "Dueling statements from Trump and Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu also suggested they differed over something as fundamental as whether the fighting was truly over.",
      "Netanyahu, speaking on television Sunday, said, \u201cThe campaign is not over\u201d and that \u201csome of our enemies are trying to recover in order to attack us again.\u201d",
      "Asked about that on Air Force One en route to Israel, Trump told reporters: \u201cThe war is over. The war is over. The war is over, OK? You understand that?\u201d Lest there be any doubt, Trump reinforced the point during his remarks to the Knesset while Netanyahu sat and listened.",
      "\u201cNow you can be a little nicer, Bibi, because you\u2019re not at war anymore, Bibi,\u201d he said, using Netanyahu\u2019s nickname.",
      "After finishing his speech, Trump flew to Egypt to take part in a peace conference with the leaders of 20 nations, posing for pictures in front of a sign proclaiming, \u201cPeace in the Middle East.\u201d",
      "Notably missing from the signing ceremony were the two parties who\u2019d been at war: Hamas and Israel. Trump had invited Netanyahu to the ceremony in Sharm el-Sheikh, but the Israeli leader chose not to attend. His office cited the Jewish holiday of Simchat Torah as the reason. Without Netanyahu and a representative from Hamas, the day lacked what often turns out to be an iconic picture at such Middle East peace ceremonies: the U.S. president and the combatants linking arms.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s an extraordinary moment and demonstration of will by an American president: a bid to end the Israeli-Hamas war in Gaza,\u201d Aaron David Miller, a former State Department Middle East analyst and negotiator in Republican and Democratic administrations, said in an interview. \u201cBut to do that you need to climb several very high mountains.\u201d",
      "Richard Goldberg, who served on the White House National Security Council in Trump\u2019s first term, wrote on X: \u201cToday is a celebration. Trump and Netanyahu delivered the opportunity for peace through strength.\u201d",
      "\u201cTomorrow is harder,\u201d he added. \u201cWords like demilitarizing, disarming and de-radicalizing are just words without action. Every step will be filled with pitfalls. Every step will be contested by forces that do not support the Trump vision for peace. By Iran. By the Muslim Brotherhood. By the U.N. By others.\u201d",
      "As for the future, the Trump administration appears to have less of a blueprint than an aspiration. Last month, Trump released a 20-point peace plan that starts with ending the war in Gaza and ends with forging a broader peace between Israel and the Palestinians.",
      "The first part is specific; the latter, vague. The 19th point says that certain conditions that include reconstruction of Gaza and political reform must be met and then, once that happens, \u201cthe conditions may finally be in place for a credible pathway to Palestinian self-determination and statehood.\u201d The authors set no hard deadlines or timetables for deciding the Palestinians\u2019 fate.",
      "At home, Trump is enmeshed in a government shutdown with no end in sight. But presidents enjoy far more latitude when it comes to foreign policy, and Trump appears to be savoring his achievement overseas.",
      "A senior administration official traveling with Trump on the quick trip to Israel and Egypt said of the president\u2019s mood: \u201cI\u2019m not sure I\u2019ve ever seen him so proud.\u201d",
      "Another official, back in Washington, said: \u201cEveryone is taking great pride in it and wants to be part of it. And it\u2019s an acute reminder that we can do the hard things.\u201d",
      "Trump tapped two confidants to negotiate the deal: his son-in-law Jared Kushner and White House envoy Steve Witkoff, a billionaire real estate developer. Both watched in the Knesset as Trump delivered an hour-long speech, relishing the moment and riffing in ways that made members laugh and applaud in surprise.",
      "\u201cTrump! Trump! Trump,\u201d lawmakers chanted. Some wore his signature piece of campaign memorabilia, a red hat with a twist that read: \u201cTrump, the Peace President.\u201d",
      "Seizing on the good will, Trump made a personal plea to help a friend. Netanyahu is facing trial on corruption charges. Trump went off script to beseech Israeli President Isaac Herzog to pardon the prime minister.",
      "\u201cThis man is a good man right here. I have an idea. Mr. President, why don\u2019t you give him a pardon?\u201d Trump said.",
      "Now that the fighting has stopped and the hostages have been returned, Trump's interest could potentially wane. As the leader with the most leverage in the region, Trump needs to stay involved to make progress on his vision of a transformed Middle East, foreign policy analysts said.",
      "For Trump, there is at least one clear incentive to stay engaged.",
      "He lost out on the 2025 Nobel Peace Prize last week, and his supporters are already lobbying for him to get the award next year.",
      "\"You have to wonder whether he stays with this,\" Miller, the former negotiator, said. \"That will depend primarily on whether there's a pot of gold at the end of the rainbow: the elusive Nobel, which he believes he deserves.\""

      "As Israeli hostages are freed and Palestinian prisoners and detainees released \u2014 and after President Donald Trump's lengthy address to Israel\u2019s parliament on Monday \u2014 focus is shifting to what comes next.",
      "Some of the longest applause for Trump's speech came when he said that virtually the whole region had endorsed a plan for Gaza to be demilitarized and Hamas to disarm \u2014 key elements of his 20-point plan that have yet to actually be agreed upon.",
      "Now that phase one of his plan is being executed, negotiators and neighboring countries will watch whether key points of Trump\u2019s proposal will be accepted by both Israel and Hamas in talks on the next phases.",
      "Last few days",
      "A ceasefire came into effect in Gaza on Friday at noon local time, (5 a.m. ET), after the first phase of Trump's plan was agreed by Israel and Hamas, bringing relative calm to the enclave for the first time in months since the last truce collapsed in March.",
      "Under the first phase of Trump's plan, 20 living hostages were  handed over to Israel on Monday.  The remains of a further 28 hostages held by Hamas were expected to be released within 72 hours, although only four were initially, much to the disappointment of families.",
      "Israel also pledged to release 250 convicted prisoners and 1,700 Palestinians detained since Oct. 7.  Over 150 of the freed prisoners were deported to Egypt.",
      "More aid has begun to flow into the enclave in recent days, although it falls far short of what aid workers say is necessary.",
      "Now what?",
      "Hamas has long asserted that it would not release the last of the hostages until Israeli groups leave Gaza entirely, but having agreed to the first phase of Trump's plan, the militant group is relying on guarantees from Trump that a full withdrawal will eventually happen.",
      "When and if Israel withdraws fully remains unclear.",
      "Meanwhile, it is also unclear whether Hamas, which has ruled Gaza since 2007, will agree to a key stipulation of Trump's overall plan, as well as a crucial demand from Israel \u2014 that it disarm.",
      "Hamas has long refused calls to lay down arms, saying it has a right to armed resistance until Israel ends its occupation of Palestinian territories \u2014 and that has been a key sticking point in talks to negotiate an end to Israel's offensive in Gaza.",
      "In an interview with Al Jazeera on Oct. 9, senior Hamas official Osama Hamdan said that no Palestinian would accept surrendering weapons and that the people of Gaza were in greater need than ever of resistance.",
      "The militant group has agreed to step down from leadership over the territory and relinquish governance to a transitional body of Palestinian technocrats, which would be overseen by an international body, dubbed the \"Board of Peace.\" This body is expected to be headed by Trump, with former British Prime Minister Tony Blair also named as a possible member of the oversight body.",
      "Noting the plan aboard the Air Force One on Monday en route to Israel, Trump said he first wanted to find out whether \"Tony would be popular with all.\"",
      "\"I like Tony, I\u2019ve always liked Tony, but I want to find out that he\u2019s an acceptable choice to everybody,\" he added.",
      "The idea of Blair joining the board has already drawn early criticism, with his reputation in the region shadowed by his decision to back the U.S.-led 2003 invasion of Iraq \u2014 and claims by the U.S. and Britain of Iraq having weapons of mass destruction found to be false.",
      "Trump optimistic",
      "Speaking aboard Air Force One on his way to Israel on Monday, Trump said he believed \"everybody is happy\" with his 20-point peace plan.",
      "Noting that much of Gaza now resembles a \"demolition site\" after more than two years of Israel's offensive in the enclave, Trump said cleanup efforts would begin \"pretty much immediately.\"",
      "During his address to the Knesset, Trump also said Israel has won all it can by force.",
      "\u201cNow, it is time to translate these victories against terrorists on the battlefield into the ultimate prize of peace and prosperity for the entire Middle East,\u201d he said.",
      "In Gaza, Palestinians across the enclave balanced their hopes for peace against fears that the ceasefire won't hold, as many return to the areas where their homes once stood.",
      "\"Everything is gone; no necessities of life remain,\" one man told NBC News.",
      "\"So, why do you live for? Our money, our homes that we worked hard for years \u2014 it\u2019s all gone,\" he said. \"Nothing is left.\""

      "Snubbed by the Nobel selection committee, Trump should be the clear front-runner for the prize next year, given the breakthrough he reached toward ending the war in Gaza, his supporters said.",
      "Rep. Buddy Carter, R-Ga., said Friday he would introduce a resolution in Congress saying Trump deserves the honor.",
      "\u201cHe\u2019ll be a strong candidate next year, and he should have been a slam dunk this year, but unfortunately, the committee got it wrong,\u201d Carter said in an interview. \u201cBut they made their decision. So, next year they\u2019ll have an opportunity to make up for it.\u201d",
      "Jason Miller, a former senior Trump campaign official, told NBC News: \u201cThe legacy of the Nobel Peace Prize will be irreparably damaged if it isn\u2019t awarded to President Trump in 2026. The voices calling for President Trump to win the Nobel Peace Prize in 2026 are only going to get louder.\u201d",
      "Few voices were louder than Trump\u2019s in making the case that he\u2019d earned the award this year. The president mounted a rare public campaign to win it based on seven peace deals he says he reached in global hotspots.",
      "He is inching closer to an eighth. A whirlwind bout of U.S.-led diplomacy has culminated in a ceasefire in Gaza. Hamas militants may release the remaining hostages early next week. And Trump plans to fly to the region this weekend to sign the accord and deliver a speech to the Israeli parliament.",
      "Trump has long said he didn\u2019t expect the five-member Norwegian selection committee to give him the award. The betting markets saw it the same way. Early this week, Polymarket, a prediction betting site, had put his odds of winning at 2%.",
      "The deadline for nominating people for the Nobel Prize was Jan. 31 \u2014 11 days into Trump\u2019s new term. Still, the committee was free to consider accomplishments that came later in the year as it winnowed down the candidates, said Nina Graeger, director of the Peace Research Institute Oslo, who handicaps the top candidates for the prize.",
      "\u201cWill you get the Nobel Prize? Absolutely not,\u201d Trump told an audience of generals and admirals last week. \u201cThey\u2019ll give it to some guy that didn\u2019t do a damn thing.\u201d",
      "But he believed it would be advantageous to strike the Middle East peace deal before the committee revealed the winner, a person who has been in meetings with him said. That way, Trump could make the argument that the committee process was \u201crigged\u201d; a president who ended so many conflicts rightly should have gotten the award that celebrates peace, this person said.",
      "Shortly after the winner was announced, Steven Cheung, the White House communications director, posted on social media that \u201cThe Nobel Committee proved they place politics over peace.\u201d",
      "Much can happen in a year\u2019s time. If the peace deal in Gaza doesn\u2019t hold \u2014 if the fighting resumes and more Gazans die in the crossfire \u2014 Trump isn\u2019t likely to get credit for raising false hopes that peace was at hand, foreign policy analysts say.",
      "The committee will want to see if the peace deal that Trump describes as an historic triumph is real or ephemeral.",
      "\u201cWe don\u2019t know if the peace plan will be sustainable and lasting,\u201d Graeger said. \u201cHe definitely should get credit for his efforts to end the war and really engaging with this process. But there are a lot of hurdles in the implementation of the plan.\u201d",
      "A second issue is whether the \u201cAmerica First\u201d president chooses to work more collaboratively with other nations over the coming year. In creating the prize, Swedish inventor and entrepreneur Alfred Nobel held that the winner should be someone who has \u201cdone the most or the best work for fraternity between nations,\u201d among other criteria.",
      "It doesn\u2019t help Trump\u2019s chances that he threatened to acquire Canada, Greenland and the Panama Canal, analysts said. Nor is the committee likely to reward him for pulling out of such cross-border endeavors as the Paris climate agreement or the World Health Organization, they said.",
      "K\u00e5re Aas, Norway\u2019s former ambassador to the U.S., said that Trump would be a \u201cstrong contender\u201d for the prize if he ends the Russia-Ukraine and the Israel-Hamas wars. Still, the president wouldn\u2019t be a shoo-in, he added.",
      "Trump\u2019s statements about absorbing Greenland and Canada \u201cwould also be considered by the committee,\u201d Aas said. \u201cThe committee doesn\u2019t necessarily give him the Nobel Peace Prize if there\u2019s peace in Gaza and Ukraine next year.\u201d"

      "\"If indeed this deal can hold, it'll bring in an era of peace that we haven't seen now in the Middle East for several years, ever since that terrible attack on Oct. 7,\" Col. Steve Warren, former principal deputy chief of public affairs at the Pentagon, told NBC News on Wednesday.",
      "The plan could come with a political cost for Netanyahu inside Israel. Itamar Ben-Gvir, Israel\u2019s far-right national security minister, said Thursday on X that his party will \u201cbring down the government\u201d unless Hamas is \u201cdismantled.\u201d",
      "Celebrations and cautious optimism",
      "The announcement came after indirect talks involving Israel, Hamas and Steve Witkoff, U.S. ambassador at large, and Trump's son-in-law Jared Kushner.",
      "Trump announced the breakthrough one day after the second  anniversary of the Hamas-led Oct. 7 attack on Israel, in which 1,200 were killed and another 250 were kidnapped, and the start of Israel's war on Gaza in which more than 67,000 people \u2014 mostly women and children \u2014 have been killed, according to local health officials.",
      "While many governments defended Israel's initial right to respond to the attack, the scale of civilian death and suffering wrought by its war have drawn increasing international condemnation and isolation for the Jewish state. Last month, the United Kingdom became the latest Western nation to recognize Palestine as a state, joining a majority of countries that now do so worldwide.",
      "Much of Gaza is now a rubble-strewn wasteland, with most of its buildings damaged or destroyed, according to the U.N. And the world's leading body on hunger, Integrated Food Security Phase Classification, has declared that a famine is now playing out inside the cramped territory.",
      "Israel's military operation has been deemed a genocide by a U.N. commission of inquiry, the world-leading International Association of Genocide Scholars, and human rights groups such as Amnesty International. Israel denies the charge, saying it is only attempting to destroy Hamas, which it blames for putting Palestinians in harm's way.",
      "After news arrived that the first ceasefire phase had been agreed to, some Palestinians on the ground inside Gaza were celebrating \u2014 cheering, dancing and singing, video showed.",
      "The first phase of Trump's deal would see the return of the remaining 48 hostages, around 20 of whom are believed to be alive, while the Israeli military said it was poised to withdraw from Gaza to an agreed-upon line.",
      "Trump told reporters that while the administration knows where most of the hostages believed to be alive are, finding the bodies of deceased hostages could be a \u201cbigger problem.\u201d",
      "An international force tasked with finding missing hostages in the Gaza Strip will be established as part of the ceasefire and hostage release deal, Israeli broadcaster i24 reported, citing Israeli officials.",
      "There were celebrations in \"Hostages Square\" in Tel Aviv early Thursday, the culmination of two years in which families and friends of the remaining captives have angrily campaigned for their government to prioritize their loved ones over the continuation of the conflict.",
      "They could be heard in video chanting \"Nobel prize to Trump\" \u2014 a reference to Trump's long-standing ambition to win the Nobel Peace Prize, which is being announced Friday.",
      "The Hostages and Missing Families Forum, which represents the families of Israeli hostages, said its members were feeling \"a mix of excitement, anticipation, and concern\" at the news. It expressed its \"profound gratitude to President Trump and his team for the leadership and determination that led to this historic breakthrough: an end to the war and a comprehensive agreement to return all the hostages.\"",
      "Ruby Chen, father of hostage Itay Chen, a U.S.-Israeli dual citizen, said on \"Stay Tuned NOW\" that while he shared this cautious hope, the captors had not \u201cprovided any sign of life\" for his son.",
      "Lasting agreement unclear",
      "While Hamas has agreed to participate in the hostage and prisoner exchange, it has not said it will disarm and disband \u2014 a key stipulation of Trump's proposal.",
      "A senior Hamas official, Osama Hamdan, said in an interview with Al Jazeera on Thursday that no Palestinians would surrender their weapons, though he did not explain whether that was the group\u2019s official position.",
      "Prominent Palestinian prisoner Marwan Barghouti, whose supporters dub the \u201cPalestinian Nelson Mandela,\u201d will not be released as part of a ceasefire agreement, Israeli government spokeswoman Shosh Bedrosian told reporters Thursday.",
      "The first phase also does not address Gaza's medium and long-term future. Trump's plan says the enclave should be temporarily governed by a \"technocratic, apolitical Palestinian committee\" overseen by a \"Board of Peace\" led by Trump and former British Prime Minister Tony Blair. That is until the Palestinian Authority, the chief political organ in the region, can be \"reformed.\"",
      "The Israel Defense Forces said it was moving to \"adjusted deployment lines soon\" but warned that parts of Gaza were \"still considered a dangerous combat zone\" and that its troops were \"deployed and operating anywhere in the Strip.\"",
      "Israel shattered the previous ceasefire \u2014 which lasted from Jan. 19 to March 18 \u2014 by launching a barrage of deadly airstrikes that killed hundreds of Palestinians across the Gaza Strip, ending two months of relative calm and plunging Gaza into a renewed humanitarian crisis.",
      "Israel blamed Hamas for the resumption of hostilities, citing the militant group\u2019s refusal to meet Israel\u2019s demand to release more hostages."

    "summary": "President Donald Trump had to maintain the trust of Israel and a series of Arab- and Muslim-majority nations. His ability to walk that tightrope was tested repeatedly.",
    "story": [
      "President Donald Trump\u2019s personal touch \u2014 both as a heavy hand and a gentle guide \u2014 played a pivotal role at key moments in the development of a Middle East peace deal that promises to bring an end to Israel\u2019s two-year war in Gaza, current and former officials in the United States and other nations told NBC News.",
      "Trump announced on Wednesday that the \u201cfirst phase\u201d of the plan to end the conflict in Gaza had been agreed to, with a pause in fighting and the release of Israeli hostages and Palestinian prisoners.",
      "Trump called it \u201ca great deal\u201d in a brief interview with NBC News on Thursday morning. \u201cEverybody is happy,\u201d he said.",
      "The deal accelerated over several crucial moments \u2014 Israel\u2019s strike on Qatar, discussions on the sidelines of the recent United Nations General Assembly in New York City and Jared Kushner\u2019s conversations with his father-in-law, these sources said.",
      "Also helpful, though, was an old-fashioned deadline. In recent weeks, Trump told advisers he wanted to announce a deal by Oct. 7, the second anniversary of the Hamas terrorist attack on Israel that precipitated the war, according to two people familiar with his instructions.",
      "The president, one of the people said, was fixated on the date both for its symbolic significance and because he saw it as a way to herald a new step forward in Israel\u2019s relationship with Saudi Arabia when Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman visits Washington next month.",
      "This account of the Trump administration\u2019s role in the ceasefire deal is based on interviews with a dozen sources in three countries.",
      "As the war in Gaza ground on \u2014 with more than 67,000 dead, according to the Palestinian Health Ministry, declarations of famine and images of wounded children across social media \u2014 it threatened Trump\u2019s vision for a more interconnected Middle East that he began to implement in his first term with the Abraham Accords, which established relationships between Israel and several Arab nations.",
      "The war\u2019s intensity also presented an opportunity for Trump to coalesce regional powers around a peace plan to disarm Hamas, preclude Israel from seizing the West Bank and provide for the redevelopment of Gaza.",
      "Israel and Hamas agreed Wednesday to the first phase of that proposal \u2014 a ceasefire and an Israeli military pullback to a \u201cyellow line\u201d within Gaza that leaves more of the strip under the control of Palestinians. That is to be followed by Hamas\u2019 returning as many as 20 Israeli hostages and the remains of as many as 28 hostages and Israel\u2019s releasing nearly 2,000 Palestinian prisoners and the remains of 15 dead Gazans.",
      "Trump was able to announce the pact just one day after his target.",
      "To do that, Trump had to maintain the trust of Israel and of a series of Arab- and Muslim-majority nations that could influence Hamas and Palestinian civilians. At the same time, he had to apply pressure. His ability to walk that tightrope was tested repeatedly.",
      "And, at times, the darkest hours yielded the biggest breakthroughs.",
      "Qatar strikes",
      "After months of negotiations with no result, a turning point came in September in the form of a surprise attack.",
      "Israeli forces launched airstrikes on the Qatari capital, Doha, in an attempt to kill the leaders of Hamas. Six people were killed, including a member of Qatar\u2019s internal security force.",
      "Over the course of the war, Israel has struck in Iran, Lebanon, Syria and Yemen, in addition to Gaza.",
      "But this was different. Qatar is a U.S. ally that hosts a strategic air base with 10,000 American troops. Trump and his team had come to view the Persian Gulf nation as a trusted partner in the negotiations between Israel and Hamas. The parents of an Israeli hostage had been in Doha that very morning, meeting Qatari Prime Minister Sheikh Mohammed bin Abdulrahman bin Jassim Al-Thani.",
      "The bombing blindsided and angered the White House, as well as the Arab world.",
      "Asked about the strikes at the time, Trump told reporters: \u201cI was very unhappy about it. Very unhappy about every aspect.\u201d",
      "But instead of killing the prospect of a deal, the Israeli attack prompted Trump and his team to ratchet up pressure on Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu to bring the war to an end.",
      "\u201cIt was the moment that Trump said, \u2018Enough,\u2019\u201d said a former Israeli official, adding: \u201cThis deal, almost identical, has been on the table for over a year now. Netanyahu didn\u2019t want to do it, but Trump left him no choice.\u201d",
      "\u201cBoth Netanyahu and Hamas tried to say \u2018yes, but\u2019 to stall, but Trump decided to hear only \u2018yes\u2019 and pushed them into the corner,\u201d the former official said.",
      "Shortly after the strikes, Trump issued a warning to Israel: He would not support the annexation of the West Bank, as some far-right members of Netanyahu\u2019s Cabinet had proposed.",
      "The Americans, the Qataris and other Arab governments saw the surprise strikes as an opportunity to exert leverage, according to an Arab official and former Israeli officials with knowledge of the diplomatic talks.",
      "\u201cIt was a catalyst to bring pressure on the Israeli government, which had been the main obstacle to a deal,\u201d the Arab official said.",
      "U.N. General Assembly sidelines",
      "Weeks after the strikes on Doha, the U.N. General Assembly met along the bank of the East River in New York City.",
      "It was on the sidelines \u2014 where, historically, deals are often solidified with face-to-face interactions and handshakes \u2014 that the discussions \u201creally took a turn,\u201d Secretary of State Marco Rubio said Thursday during a Cabinet meeting at the White House.",
      "Trump convened a meeting at the General Assembly with Arab- and Muslim-majority nations to sell his 20-point peace plan. Rubio said that is where Trump \u201ccreated this coalition\u201d before he presented the proposal to Netanyahu at the White House at the end of last month.",
      "Crucially, during that visit, Trump persuaded Netanyahu to call Al-Thani, the Qatari prime minister, to apologize for the Israeli strikes in Qatar. That allowed Qatar to remain engaged as a key intermediary in peace talks.",
      "\u201cIt is my understanding that the Qatari government viewed the apology as a way to move forward, and it saw its role, that it had invested in for quite a long time, as still vital to achieving a ceasefire and hopefully peace in the future,\u201d Nawaf Al-Thani, a former Qatari defense attach\u00e9 to the United States, told NBC News.",
      "Trump\u2019s handling of that episode was reminiscent for many observers of the way he reacted to Israel\u2019s and Iran\u2019s striking each other during a ceasefire agreement following American bombing raids on Iranian nuclear facilities in June.",
      "\u201cWe basically have two countries that have been fighting so long and so hard that they don\u2019t know what the f--- they\u2019re doing,\u201d Trump, clearly frustrated, said at the time. His rebuke of Israel, along with Iran, reassured Arab countries with ties to Shia-majority Iran. In that way, a former senior White House official said, Trump\u2019s messages to Israel after its strikes in Iran and in Qatar were similar.",
      "\u201cBoth showed the president\u2019s commitment to Israel, but also his commitment to the Arab countries,\u201d the former official said.",
      "Seeing the United States pushing Israel over the strike in Doha helped persuade Qatar, Turkey and other Arab governments to press Hamas, making it clear that the time for delays and foot-dragging was over, the officials said.",
      "As the negotiations advanced, both the U.S. and Arab negotiators chose to convey a united and optimistic front, placing Netanyahu at risk of potentially insulting Trump if he questioned the 20-point proposal Trump put on the table, the former Israeli official said.",
      "\u201cThe Trump people and Arab world just briefed total confidence and optimism before anything was finalized to make it seem like a done deal, which made saying \u2018no\u2019 a public affront to Trump, and Netanyahu can\u2019t do that,\u201d the former official said. \u201cIt was a show of very effective statecraft and use of leverage.\u201d",
      "Kushner\u2019s role",
      "During Trump\u2019s first term, Kushner, the president\u2019s son-in-law, became his chief envoy to the Middle East. There he was delivering a speech at the opening of the U.S. Embassy in Jerusalem. There he was building relationships with Arab leaders, focusing on economic relations.",
      "Years later, Kushner became deeply involved in the negotiations between Israel and Hamas. He emerged, former Israeli officials said, because he carries important influence with regional governments and the president.",
      "\u201cKushner was the architect,\u201d a former Israeli official said.",
      "Kushner was able to convey to Trump that the conflict in Gaza threatened the future of his biggest diplomatic success the last time he was in office \u2014 the Abraham Accords.",
      "That deal produced peace agreements between Israel and the United Arab Emirates, Bahrain and Morocco. Trump has aimed to extend it to normalize relations between Saudi Arabia and Israel.",
      "\u201cThe entire legacy was in jeopardy,\u201d the former Israeli official said.",
      "Kushner and Trump\u2019s special envoy to the Middle East, Steve Witkoff, traveled to Egypt on Tuesday to hammer out details of the deal, according to senior U.S. officials.",
      "They went over various aspects of the proposal, including how Israeli military forces would be redeployed and the order of hostage and prisoner releases, the officials said, with one adding that an important feature of their work was the decision to \u201cseparate the peace deal into two clear phases.\u201d That allowed for an agreement on the exchange of people, while the deal\u2019s other points are negotiated in a second phase.",
      "The U.S. negotiators called Trump on Wednesday evening to get his final guidance before he announced that a deal was in place, the officials said. Israel\u2019s government approved the exchange Thursday evening.",
      "\u201cIt came together quick in a good way,\u201d Witkoff told NBC News in a brief telephone interview Thursday morning as he waited to board a flight to Israel.",
      "Kushner and Witkoff had about \u201cfive hours of sleep in the last three days,\u201d senior U.S. officials said.",
      "American negotiators expect the next phase to be \u201calmost a permanent ceasefire until all the other issues we have to deal with are negotiated and considered,\u201d one of the officials said, pointing to outstanding topics as thorny as how Gaza will be governed.",
      "U.S. officials cautioned Thursday that there is still a lot of work to do to ensure the ceasefire holds and the rest of the plans can be finalized and implemented.",
      "\u201cThis is a very delicate time,\u201d one of them said.",
      "Trump said he plans to travel to Egypt to put his signature on the Middle East agreement in the coming days.",
      "And the U.S. military is preparing options to deploy as many as 200 U.S. troops to Israel to support the International Stabilization Force for the long-term internal security solution for Gaza and to support the flow of humanitarian aid and security assistance into Gaza, according to two U.S. officials familiar with the planning.",
      "\u201cThey will not be in Gaza. No U.S. boots on the ground in Gaza,\u201d one of the officials said.",
      "The effort will be called the Civil-Military Coordination Cell, and U.S. troops could begin arriving in Israel immediately, the officials said.",
      "In addition to supporting moving aid and assistance into Gaza, they are expected to support the deconfliction mechanism between the two sides \u2014 basically making sure that both sides are upholding their part of the security agreements.",
      "\u201cI think right now,\u201d a senior U.S. official said, \u201cwe\u2019re just focused on making sure any gaps are patched up in the agreement.\u201d",
      "Trump allies say the agreement between Israel and Hamas, forged under immense pressure on both sides \u2014 including Trump\u2019s broad support for Israel\u2019s war in Gaza, the limits he placed on Netanyahu and a threat to let Israel destroy Hamas if it did not agree to the pact \u2014 is a testament to the validity of his peace-through-strength approach to foreign policy.",
      "\u201cHe understands that sometimes you have to use force to set the structure for peace,\u201d former House Speaker Newt Gingrich, R-Ga., who is close to Trump, said in an interview last week."
