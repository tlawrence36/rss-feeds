      "VERSAILLES, France -- A long-lost painting by Baroque master Peter Paul Rubens, which was hidden for more than four centuries, sold at 2.3 million euros ($2.7 million) at an auction Sunday in Versailles.",
      "The painting was recently found in a private townhouse in Paris. It depicts the crucifixion of Jesus Christ.",
      "It was part of a French collection and was initially thought to be from one of the many Rubens workshops that existed at the time. The artwork was rarely valued at more than 10,000 euros ($11,500).",
      "\u201cI immediately had a hunch about this painting, and I did everything I could to try to have it authenticated,\u201d auctioneer Jean-Pierre Osenat told The Associated Press. \u201cAnd finally, we managed to have it authenticated by the Rubenianum, which is the Rubens committee in Antwerp.\u201d",
      "Nils B\u00fcttner, an expert known for his research on Rubens, explained before the auction that the master often painted crucifictions but rarely depicted \"the crucified Christ as a dead body on the cross.\"",

      "The Osenat auction house said the painting\u2019s authenticity and provenance were confirmed after scientific analysis. It said microscopic examination of the paint layers revealed not only white, black, and red pigments in the areas representing flesh, but also blue and green pigments, whose use is typical in Rubens\u2019 depictions of human skin.",
      "Art expert Eric Turquin told a packed house the painting had virtually disappeared in the early 1600s. It is known to have belonged to 19th-century French classic painter William Bouguereau before it was passed down in the family.",

      "An AI-generated country song, \u201cWalk My Walk,\u201d recently topped Billboard's country digital song sales chart",
      "LOS ANGELES -- When an AI-generated country song called \u201cWalk My Walk\u201d hit No. 1 on Billboard's country digital song sales chart this month, it was credited to a fictional artist named Breaking Rust \u2014 a white, digitally generated avatar that didn't exist two months ago.",
      "But the song's vocal phrasing, melodic shape and stylistic DNA came from someone who does exist: Grammy-nominated country artist Blanco Brown, a Black music artist who has worked with Britney Spears, Childish Gambino and Rihanna.",
      "And he had no idea.",
      "\u201cI didn't even know about the song until people hit me up about it,\u201d said Brown, whose 2019 country rap hit \u201cThe Git Up\u201d helped usher in a new, hybrid era of country crossover. He didn't learn about the chart-topping AI track until his phone was flooded with messages from friends.",
      "\u201cMy phone just kept blowing up,\u201d he said. \u201cSomebody said: 'Man, somebody done typed your name in the AI and made a white version of you. They just used the Blanco, not the Brown.\u201d",
      "The moment is the latest example of how generative AI is upending the music industry, giving anyone the ability to instantly create seemingly new songs by typing prompts into a chat window, often using models trained on real artists' voices and styles without their knowledge.",
      "The credits for the grit-filled, chant-heavy track \u201cWalk My Walk\u201d list Aubierre Rivaldo Taylor as one of the song's creators, with streaming platforms such as Apple Music and Spotify identifying him as both the songwriter and producer. In recent months, Taylor has also been credited on streaming platforms as the songwriter and producer behind Defbeatsai \u2014 one of several X-rated, AI-generated country artists that exploded across social media last year.",
      "The Defbeatsai ecosystem, however, connects back to another figure in Brown's past: Abraham Abushmais, a collaborator Brown once jokingly called \u201cAbe Einstein\u201d for his sharp studio instincts. Abushmais co-wrote a couple of songs on Brown's 2019 album \u201cHoneysuckle & Lightning Bugs\u201d and is listed as the developer of Echo, an obscure AI-powered music generator app promoted on one of Defbeats.ai's Instagram pages with a link encouraging users to \u201cmake your own hit country song.\u201d",
      "Brown said he wasn't notified about their involvement in the AI hit, and the collaborator he once mentored has since become unreachable.",
      "\u201cAbe\u2019s number changed,\u201d Brown said. \u201cWe used to talk. I ain\u2019t heard from him in a year or two.\u201d",
      "The AP reached out to Abushmais for comment but did not receive a response.",
      "The digital avatar fronting \u201cWalk My Walk,\" a white, AI-generated country singer built with a vocal approach modeled on Brown's sound, is where the moment shifted from eerie to uncomfortable.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s a white AI man with a Black voice,\u201d Brown said. \u201cAnd he\u2019s singing like a Negro spiritual.\u201d",
      "For Brown, the shock quickly gave way to action. He went into the studio and recorded his cover of the song, which was released last week. He's also putting out a reworked derivative of the track on Monday with new lyrics and a new arrangement.",
      "Brown's management said his response to the song is a direct challenge to the legal, ethical and policy void surrounding AI-generated music. He wants to use his own lived experience to force the industry and lawmakers to confront who owns art and what happens when technology outpaces the rights of the human creators it imitates.",
      "\u201cIf someone is going to sing like me, it should be me,\u201d he said.",
      "For musicians and educators, the success of \u201cWalk My Walk\u201d made one thing clear: AI-generated music has leapt from internet experiment to commercial disruptor.",
      "\u201cWe are entering a very strange and unprecedented period of both creation and industry,\u201d said Josh Antonuccio, director of the Ohio University Music Industry Summit. \u201cAI has essentially democratized the act of music creation itself.\u201d",

      "He spent years navigating country music as a Black artist who blends gospel, hip-hop, pop and twang. He's been nominated for a Grammy and embraced by the Recording Academy, but country radio hasn't given him consistent traction.",
      "Meanwhile, an AI song built on his vocal identity and paired with a white avatar went straight to No. 1, a dynamic he says reflects a familiar pattern in Nashville: innovation from Black artists being reattributed.",
      "\u201cHe created something with my tone and gave it a white face,\u201d Brown said. \u201c(Race) is an understatement in Nashville.\u201d",

      "Tollywood, the Telugu-language film industry, is rapidly gaining global attention, challenging Bollywood's dominance",
      "HYDERABAD, India -- A fast-rising parallel film industry in India is competing with Bollywood's musicals and action-packed films and has taken the world by storm: It\u2019s called Tollywood.",
      "As Mumbai is to Hindi films \u2014 or Bollywood \u2014 the southern Indian city of Hyderabad is to movies made in Telugu, one of the country\u2019s most widely spoken languages. Tollywood films like \u201cRRR\u201d and \u201cBaahubali\u201d have achieved international acclaim at the box office and on the awards stage.",
      "The Telugu-language film industry, widely known as Tollywood, is one of India\u2019s many regional movie-producing centers. But it's drawn national and global audiences with its high-adrenaline action movies, mythic storylines and grand visual style. It has carved out its own identity separate from Hindi-language Bollywood by leaning toward star-driven spectacle and large-scale epics.",
      "Tollywood primarily operates out of Hyderabad, which is home to Ramoji Film City. The 1,666-acre (674-hectare) facility, recognized by Guinness World Records as the world\u2019s largest film studio complex, houses massive film studio complexes, dozens of production houses, warehouses, movie sets and post-production facilities. The industry churns out around 300 films every year \u2014 fewer than Bollywood but still enough to make it one of India\u2019s largest regional industries.",
      "Tollywood\u2019s growing exposure was in large part sparked by the coronavirus pandemic, as the rapid expansion of streaming services in India allowed regional films to find wider audiences. That expansion also coincided with Bollywood\u2019s struggle to lure audiences back to theaters amid repetitive storylines and rehashes of hits from other languages.",
      "What has also worked in favor of Tollywood is that it offers a rare balance of high-octane action films and nuanced movies charged with real human drama.",
      "\u201cTelugu people have a lot of interest in movies. The Telugu audience watch and accept all kind of movies. They are cinema lovers,\u201d says filmmaker T.V.

      "Tollywood is known for its high-energy storytelling, big action set pieces and grand spectacle that are heavy on visual effects. It often blends family drama, action and mythology into movies, increasingly marketed as \u201cpan-India\u201d releases and dubbed in multiple regional languages.",
      "The films, like other big Indian productions, have crowd-pleasing visuals and feature viral songs and dances central to the narrative and usually presented as grand performance set pieces.",
      "Many Tollywood films are also remade in Bollywood, which has become a proven formula to expand Telugu cinema across India. Dubbing \u2014 where actors record voice-overs in Hindi or a professional voice artist replaces the track \u2014 is also a standard and tested practice that has made Tollywood more accessible.",
      "The industry does also produce smaller, low-budget films that tend to focus on stories rooted in Telugu culture. Most of them are set in rural landscapes and explore themes such as social issues, regional cultures and class inequality. Some of those films are sent straight to streaming platforms like Netflix and Amazon Prime, where they enjoy a wide reach across India.",
      "Many Tollywood movie stars like Mahesh Babu, Allu Arjun, Prabhas, Ram Charan and N.T. Rama Rao Jr. command a near-godlike following, with devoted fan bases that cut across generations. Their movie releases are often tied to regional religious festivals and are preceded by carefully marketed music launch events and dance performances that are a spectacle in itself. Tens of thousands of fans attend such events, as they did recently with the first look of S.S. Rajamouli's \u201cVaranasi.\u201d",
      "The industry has also led to a massive fan club culture, predominantly centered around male film stars. Some fans are so invested in their favorite stars that they often organize charitable drives and blood donation camps in their names. It is not unusual for fans to perform acts of literal worship, washing male stars' cardboard cutouts or statues with milk \u2014 a ritual usually reserved for Hindu gods.",
      "In theaters across Hyderabad, viewers will commonly dance, whistle and throw confetti in the air during releases of films. Outside, billboards of major stars are a frequent sight in the city.",

      "A new type of lens approved by the FDA promises to slow nearsightedness in children",
      "WASHINGTON -- For many children, the experience of getting their first pair of glasses is an inevitable milestone, the first in a lifetime of visits to the eye doctor.",
      "But what if those lenses could actually help preserve the child\u2019s vision and reduce the chances for more serious eye problems in adulthood?",
      "That\u2019s the promise of a new type of lens approved by the Food and Drug Administration in September. While the technology has previously been available in Europe, Asia and other parts of the world, it\u2019s now rolling out in the U.S.",
      "Here\u2019s what to know about the new approach.",
      "Myopia, commonly called nearsightedness, is when people can clearly see objects at close range but struggle with distant objects, which often appear blurry or indistinct.",
      "Studies conducted around the world have shown rising rates of myopia, which researchers have associated with increased time indoors looking at screens, books and other objects held close to the eyes.",
      "In the U.S., 30% to 40% of children will have myopia by the time they finish high school, according to Dr. Michael Repka, a professor and pediatric ophthalmologist at the Johns Hopkins School of Medicine.",
      "Until now, doctors had few options for treating the condition.",
      "\u201cIt was typically and simply: \u2018Your child needs to wear glasses and they\u2019ll live with it,\u2019\u201d Repka said. \u201c'It will be lifelong and it will likely get worse over the next few years.\u2019\u201d",
      "The specialized glasses, sold under the brand Essilor Stellest, are approved by the FDA to slow nearsightedness in 6- to 12-year-olds.",
      "The FDA said it cleared the lenses based on company data showing children experienced a 70% reduction in the progression of their myopia after two years.",
      "Over time, myopia causes the eye to grow longer, worsening vision and increasing the risk of tears to the retina \u2014 the light-sensitive tissue at the back of the eye that is essential for vision.",
      "The new lenses use 11 concentric rings filled with tiny raised dots to refocus light onto the retina in a way that is believed to slow elongation of the eye.",
      "\u201cWhether this hypothesis is ultimately proven to be true, of course, matters only in part,\u201d Repka said, noting that the lenses appear to work regardless of how the underling science works.",
      "In the company study, children wearing the lens showed a 50% reduction in eye lengthening when measured after two years. Currently, researchers in the U.S. and other countries are conducting their own independent studies to confirm those results.",
      "Ophthalmologists say the potential benefits go beyond preserving vision to heading off some long-term consequences of severe myopia, which can include cataracts, glaucoma and retinal detachment that can lead to blindness.",

      "Major U.S. vision insurance providers are expected to cover the lenses for children who meet the prescribing criteria.",
      "The only other FDA-approved product to slow myopia are contact lenses made by a company called MiSight. The daily disposable lenses, approved in 2019, use a similar approach intended to slow the progression of nearsightedness in children ages 8 to 12.",
      "But Gupta says many parents and physicians are likely to prefer the glasses.",
      "\u201cA lot of people might be hesitant to put a child as young as 8 in contact lenses, so the glasses offer a really nice alternative,\u201d she said.",
      "Some doctors prescribe medicated eye drops intended to slow myopia, but those are not approved by the FDA.",
      "Under the FDA\u2019s approval decision, the lenses can be prescribed to any child with myopia who\u2019s within the recommended age range. There were no serious side effects, according to FDA, although some children reported visual disturbances, such as halos around objects while wearing the lenses.",

      "The White House is circulating a proposal to extend Affordable Care Act subsidies for two more years",
      "WASHINGTON -- WASHINGTON (AP) \u2014 The White House is circulating a proposal that would extend subsidies to help consumers pay for coverage under the Affordable Care Act for two more years, as millions of Americans face spiking health care costs when the current tax credits are set to expire at the end of the year.",
      "The draft plan suggests that President Donald Trump is open to extending a provision of Obamacare as his administration and congressional Republicans search for a broader policy solution to a fight that has long flummoxed the party. The White House stresses that no plan is final until Trump announces it.",
      "The subsidies were at the heart of the Democrats\u2019 demands in the government shutdown fight that ended earlier this month. Most Democratic lawmakers had insisted on a straight extension of the tax credits, which expire at the end of the year as a condition of keeping the government open.",
      "Eligibility for the Obamacare subsidies, which were put in place during the COVID-19 pandemic to help people afford health care coverage, would be capped at 700% of the federal poverty level, according to two people with knowledge of the proposal. The people spoke to The Associated Press on condition of anonymity to discuss a White House proposal that is in draft form.",
      "The baseline tax credits that were originally part of the Affordable Care Act were capped at 400% of the federal poverty level, but that cut-off was suspended because of the temporary COVID-era credits that allowed middle- and higher-income people to benefit from subsidies too.",
      "The White House would also require those on Obamacare, regardless of the type of coverage, to pay some sort of premium for their Obamacare plans. That would effectively end zero-premium plans for those with lower incomes, addressing a concern from Republicans that the program has enabled fraud. One option is a requirement that everyone pay 2% of their income, or at least $5 per month, for lower-tier plans.",
      "Even as the White House\u2019s proposal remains in flux, the notion of extending any part of President Barack Obama\u2019s signature legislative achievement is likely to rankle conservatives who have sought to repeal and replace the law for well over a decade.",
      "\u201cUntil President Trump makes an announcement himself, any reporting about the administration\u2019s health care positions is mere speculation,\u201d White House spokesman Kush Desai said Monday.",
      "White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt told reporters on Monday afternoon that Trump \u201cis very much involved in these talks\u201d and that he is \u201cfocused on unveiling a health care proposal that will fix the system and will bring down costs for consumers.\u201d",
      "But there are signs that parts of the nascent White House plan could get buy-in from Democrats. New Hampshire Sen. Maggie Hassan, one of eight members of the Senate Democratic caucus who voted to reopen the government earlier this month, said it \u201crepresents a starting point for serious negotiations.\u201d",
      "\u201cThe fact that President Trump is putting forward any offer at all to extend the Affordable Care Act\u2019s tax credits shows that there is a broad understanding that inaction in this regard will cause serious harm to the American people,\u201d Hassan said.",

      "\u201cI\u2019ve had constructive conversations with many of my Republican colleagues who I believe want to get this done,\u201d Shaheen said. \u201cThey understand that the vast majority of people who benefit from these tax credits live in states the President won, and that the President\u2019s own pollsters have underscored the enormous political urgency of Republicans acting.\u201d",
      "In 2017, Trump fell short in a push to dismantle the Affordable Care Act, an embarrassing defeat for Republicans who had just seized control of all levers of power in Washington. The GOP has failed to coalesce around a unified health care proposal since, and the expiration of the pandemic-era subsidies gives Trump and his party an opportunity to put their own stamp on the issue.",
      "As the White House worked quietly on its plan, led by the Domestic Policy Council, key lawmakers on Capitol Hill have drafted their own proposals. For instance, Florida Sen. Rick Scott, Louisiana Sen. Bill Cassidy and others have proposed various ideas for redirecting the program\u2019s spending on federal subsidies into health savings accounts that enrollees could use to shop for plans or defray out-of-pocket costs. Scott's plan has been discussed with the White House multiple times since it was released Thursday, according to a person familiar not authorized to discuss the private conversations.",
      "The draft of the White House plan would allow those in lower-tier plans, such as the bronze-level or catastrophic plans, to put money into health savings accounts.",

      "Francis often quoted St. John Paul II, who in 1989 said Lebanon was more than just a country, it was a \u201cmessage\u201d \u2014 a message of fraternity and coexistence.

      "The highlight of Leo's Lebanese visit will come on his last day, Dec. 2, when he spends time in silent prayer at the site of the Aug. 4, 2020 blast and meets with some of its victims.",
      "Lebanese citizens were enraged by the blast, which appeared to be the result of government negligence, coming on top of the economic crisis. But an investigation has repeatedly stalled, and five years on, no official has been convicted.",
      "There are hopes among Lebanese that Leo will demand accountability from Lebanon\u2019s political class, and insist that there can be no peace without truth and justice.",
      "Another important moment will come when Leo meets with young Lebanese. He is expected to give them words of encouragement, amid the decades-long flight of Lebanese abroad, while also acknowledging their disillusionment over the failures of generations before them.",

      "Pope Leo XIV plans to pray at an Armenian Apostolic cathedral in Istanbul in a gesture supporting Christian unity and Christian minorities in Turkey",
      "ANKARA, Turkey -- ANKARA, Turkey (AP) \u2014 Pope Leo XIV is set to pray at the Armenian Apostolic Cathedral in Istanbul on Sunday in a gesture of support for Christian unity and Christian minorities in Turkey.",
      "Beyond its ecumenical symbolism, the visit also may signal quiet support of ongoing efforts to heal century-old wounds between Turkey and Armenia, long scarred by mass killings and decades of mistrust, observers note.",
      "An estimated 1.5 million Armenians died in massacres, deportations and forced marches that began in 1915 in Ottoman Turkey. Historians widely view the event as genocide.",
      "Turkey denies the deaths constituted genocide, saying the toll has been inflated and those killed were victims of civil war and unrest. It has lobbied to prevent countries from officially recognizing the massacres as genocide.",
      "Pope Francis did not visit any Armenian sites during his visit to Turkey in 2014, but on his way to the airport before departing he made an unscripted stop at a hospital where the ailing Armenian Patriach Mesrob II was being treated.",
      "A year later, Francis drew Ankara's ire by referring to the slaughter of Armenians during the Ottoman era as \u201cthe first genocide of the 20th century.\u201d He later visited Armenia where he again used the term genocide.",
      "Leo has steered clear of controversy during his first six months as pope and his trip will be closely watched for echoes of Francis\u2019 description of the killings.",
      "His visit comes as Turkey and Armenia appear to be moving closer toward a normalization of their ties and the pontiff's visit is likely to lend support to those efforts, said Richard Giragosian, the founding director of the Regional Studies Center based in Yerevan, Armenia.",
      "\u201cMore than just the symbolic importance of bringing the Vatican closer to the Armenian Church in terms of the eastern religion outreach, (the visit) is also, in some ways, promoting Armenia-Turkish normalization,\u201d Giragosian said.",
      "Leo arrived in Turkey on Thursday on his first foreign visit to mark the 1,700th anniversary of the Council of Nicaea, now the town of Iznik, where the united Christian Church agreed on a shared creed of faith. He was then scheduled to continue to Lebanon.",
      "Turkey and Armenia have no formal diplomatic ties and their border has remained closed since the 1990s. In 2021, the countries agreed to work toward normalization, appointing special envoys to explore steps toward reconciliation and reopening the frontier.",
      "Those talks have progressed in parallel with efforts to ease tensions between Armenia and Azerbaijan, a close Turkish ally. Turkey supported Azerbaijan during its 2020 conflict with Armenia for control of the Karabakh region, known internationally as Nagorno-Karabakh, a conflict that had lasted nearly four decades.",
      "Armenian Prime Minister Nikol Pashinyan visited Turkey in June for talks with Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan. He later told a group of Turkish journalists in Yerevan that pursuing international recognition of the genocide is not among his government\u2019s priorities, while emphasizing the genocide is an \u201cindisputable fact\u201d for Armenians.",
      "Leo is not expected to press for the formal recognition of genocide.",
      "\u201cThat\u2019s not part of the normalization engagement. So it\u2019s pretty clear that he will avoid either the word or the reference,\u201d Giragosian said.",
      "On Sunday, Leo will arrive at the Armenian Apostolic Cathedral for a service steeped in the church\u2019s traditions, with some 500 Armenian worshipers in attendance, said Garo Vram Babayan, spokesman for the Armenian patriarchate in Istanbul.",
      "The visit will begin with prayers, followed by speeches from the pope and Istanbul-based Patriarch Sahak II. The two will exchange gifts before stepping outside for a brief dedication ceremony, where Leo will unveil a marble stone in his honor.",

      "Leo's visit is one of several encounters in Turkey and Lebanon with the Armenian Christian faithful in a recognition of its deep roots in the region, Vatican spokesman Matteo Bruni said.",
      "\u201cClearly, the Armenian presence in Istanbul is an ancient one, a deeply rooted presence, a presence that is also evident in all the meetings held over the various days,\u201d he told reporters.",
      "Leo spent his formative years in Chicago, where he would have interacted with immigrant communities including Armenian Americans, Giragosian said.",
      "Vercihan Ziflioglu, an Istanbul-based journalist and author of Armenian descent, also said the pope's visit to Turkey was important in terms of highlighting the country's Christian past. Despite Francis' recognition of the genocide, Leo was not expected to repeat the term, she said.",
      "\u201cDuring this trip, especially at such a stage \u2014 when there are developments aimed at \u2018normalization\u2019 between Turkey and Armenia \u2014 I absolutely do not think he will emphasize such a sensitive issue,\u201d Ziflioglu said.",
      "In Armenia, Armen Arshakyan, 65, said he didn't believe the pope\u2019s visit would alter Turkey\u2019s policies, but was nevertheless a positive step that honors Armenians.",
      "\u201cIt honors us and reminds the world about Armenians, who are currently in a rather difficult situation,\u201d he said.",
      "Another Yerevan resident, 31-year-old Maria Petrosyan, said Leo\u2019s visit to the Armenian church \u201ccannot be of great global importance\u201d but stated she values the pontiff maintaining dialogue with different churches.",
      "Archimandrite Barouyr Shernezian, the dean of the Armenian Theological Seminary of the Catholicosate in Lebanon, also welcomed Leo\u2019s visit, saying it would show Turkey is part of the heritage of many ancient Christian denominations, including the Armenian Church.",
      "The visit to the Armenian Cathedral in Istanbul comes during ongoing strain in the Caucasus, including between Pashinyan and the Armenian Apostolic Church. The tensions have simmered since April 2024, when thousands of protesters led by prominent clerics demanded Pashinyan\u2019s ouster for his efforts to normalize ties with Azerbaijan.",
      "In response, Armenian authorities arrested a number of clerics, accusing them of calling for an overthrow of the government and coercing people into taking part in rallies. Archbishop Mikael Ajapahyan, who was arrested in June, was sentenced to two years in prison after being found guilty of calling for a government overthrow.",
      "Earlier this year, the Vatican and Azerbaijan signed a cooperation agreement on interfaith dialogue, which upset some Armenians. Bruni declined to comment on recent Armenian complaints about the Vatican\u2019s increasingly close relations with Azerbaijan.",
      "The agreement followed a conference at a Pontifical university in April co-organized by the Azerbaijani government that outraged Armenian Christian and civic groups, which accused Azerbaijan of rewriting history about the Armenian presence in the region.",
      "The Vatican, meanwhile, is engaged in \u201cbehind the scenes\" diplomacy to help with the release of Armenian prisoners and detainees held in Azerbaijan, Giragosian said. Armenian officials and media have reported 23 Armenian prisoners are being held in Baku.",

      "The government's push for a reconsideration of crimes by the dictatorship has enraged human rights groups, which see it as an effort to legitimize the military's systematic extrajudicial killings of civilians.

      "Italian cultural officials are offering digital copies of Italian masterpieces as part of a new project to help museums raise money",
      "MILAN -- The last person to get their hands on a painting attributed to Leonardo da Vinci shelled out more than $450 million at auction. Now, Italian cultural officials are making it possible to purchase a limited edition, certified digital copy of the Renaissance genius\u2019 \u201cLady with Disheveled Hair\u2019\u2019 for roughly the price of a Lamborghini.",
      "The Italian nonprofit Save the Artistic Heritage with its technical partner Cinello are providing well-heeled collectors the possibility of owning a literal projection of original Italian masterpieces, sized and framed to match the museum experience.",
      "Participating museums sign a certificate of authenticity, and in return receive 50% of the profits.",
      "\u201cWe don't want to sell a piece of technology. We want to sell a piece of artwork,'' said John Blem, the Italian-born Danish entrepreneur who founded the initiative and who serves as chairman of Cinello and vice president of the nonprofit.",
      "The revenue sharing is integral to the project, which aims to help cash-strapped museums access new income streams, and a key part of the sales pitch, Blem said. Over the last two years, Save the Artistic Heritage has contributed 300,000 euros ($347,000) to its Italian museum partners, with prices of the digital masterpieces ranging from 30,000 euros to 300,000 euros.",
      "Contributing to the value, each is sold in a limited series of nine, representing the conventional number of statues that can be cast from a single mold and still be considered original.",
      "The catalog of some 250 Italian artworks comes from about 10 Italian museums and foundations, including the Pinacoteca Ambrosiana in Milan, the Capodimonte in Naples and the Pilotta in Parma, which owns Leonardo's unfinished painting on wood of a woman with windblown hair, which sold for 250,000 euros (nearly $290,000).",
      "Blem and a partner are in the process of setting up a similar nonprofit in the United States that is expected to launch next year.",
      "The digital artworks appear backlit on screens sized to match their originals, the luminescent effect bordering on Technicolor for such brightly colored masterpieces as Raffaelo's \u201cThe Marriage of the Virgin,'' which hangs in Milan's Brera Art Gallery.",
      "Others on display in the non-profit's Milan offices, like Leonardo's wind-swept portrait and Andrea Mantegna's \u201cLamentation over a Dead Christ,\u201d are more subdued. On close inspection, details are visible down to the brush stroke, but without any texture that may belong to the original.",
      "\u201cI must say that the digital copy of \u2018The Marriage of the Virgin' has aroused in me and all those who have seen it a great deal of interest,'' said Angelo Crespi, the Brera Art Gallery's director. \u201cThe perfection, the luminosity, the visibility of the painting is amazing. But at the same time it doesn't deceive. \u2026 When they get close, people can see that it's a digital copy on a screen.\u201d",

      "Leo, Ecumenical Patriarch Bartholomew I and other Christian leaders were meeting on the shores of Lake Iznik, the site of the Council of Nicaea that produced a creed, or statement of faith, that is still recited by millions of Christians today.",

      "The Nicaea gathering happened at a time when the Eastern and Western churches were still united. They split in the Great Schism of 1054, a divide precipitated largely by disagreements over the primacy of the pope. But even today, Catholic, Orthodox and most historic Protestant groups accept the Nicaean Creed, making it a point of agreement and the most widely accepted creed in Christendom.",
      "As a result, celebrating its origins at the site of its creation with the spiritual leaders of the Catholic and Orthodox churches and other Christian representatives marked a historic moment in the centuries-old quest to reunite all Christians.",

      "The stone foundations of the basilica, which were recently uncovered by the receding waters of Lake Iznik, are believed to be on the site of an earlier church that hosted the council 1,700 years ago.",

      "Businesses and households have watched anxiously for financial impacts from U.S. President Donald Trump's tariffs on foreign imports. Workers in both the public and private sectors are also struggling with anxieties over job security amid both corporate layoffs and the after-effects of the 43-day government shutdown.",

      "Buy now, pay later loans are expected to drive $20.2 billion in online spending this holiday season, according to Adobe, up 11% from last year.

      "Missouri has become the latest state to launch sports betting",
      "JEFFERSON CITY, Mo. -- As Missouri launches sports betting Monday, people will be able to wager on how many points a particular athlete will score in a game \u2014 so long as it doesn't involve a Missouri college or university.",
      "The restriction on \" proposition bets,\" though less sweeping than in some states, highlights an area of rising concern as legal sports betting spreads to its 39th state in a steady expansion since the Supreme Court cleared the way for it in 2018.",
      "In the weeks leading up to Missouri's betting debut, one scandal after another has rocked the sports world. Two Cleveland Guardians pitchers were charged with taking bribes to throw certain pitches. An NBA player was arrested over an alleged scheme to provide inside information to gamblers. And the NCAA revoked the eligibility of six men\u2019s college basketball players accused of manipulating their performance in games.",
      "All centered around the outcome of prop bets, a popular type of wager often focused on what individual players will do in a game \u2014 like achieving a certain number of strikeouts in baseball, racking up a certain amount of points and rebounds in basketball, or surpassing a particular passing yardage in football.",
      "For bettors, a lot can ride on one player, putting those athletes at risk of threats or enticements to rig their performance.",
      "Sports betting operators took in over $11 billion through the first three-quarters of this year, up more than 13% from the same span last year, according to the American Gaming Association, which represents the industry.",
      "Though national data is lacking about the prevalence of prop bets, they are \u201can increasingly popular way in which to provide for engagement for any type of fan,\u201d said Joe Maloney, the association's senior vice president of strategic communications.",
      "West Virginia, which was among the first to allow sports betting after the court ruling, now is collecting a trove of data from the industry. During a roughly one-month period this summer, prop bets comprised more than half of all wagers made through one of the largest sports betting platforms, said Brad Humphreys, an economics professor and director of the Center for Gaming Research and Development at West Virginia University.",
      "Additionally, he said, almost all bets involved parlays, where two or more wagers are grouped together under the umbrella of a larger bet. To win, a person must be right on each prong in the bet, making the odds of success longer and the potential payout larger.",
      "Because prop bets \u201cspeed up the ability to make multiple bets,\u201d they carry a higher risk of developing addictive behavior for some bettors, said Rachel Volberg, a research professor of epidemiology at the University of Massachusetts Amherst who has spent decades studying gambling.",
      "Most states provide some money for problem gambling services. Missouri's new sports betting program allots at least $5 million annually for that purpose.",
      "Prop bets on professional athletes are currently allowed in every state that has legalized sports betting, though legislation proposed in New Jersey would ban them. Ohio Gov. Mike DeWine has urged state regulators to end player-specific micro betting and told The Associated Press recently he regrets signing the law that legalized sports gambling in his state.",
      "States have widely differing rules for bets on college athletes. More than a dozen states place no limits on collegiate prop bets while an equal number prohibit all such bets. Other states fall somewhere in between. Missouri is one of over a half-dozen states with a prop bet prohibition pertaining only to games involving college teams from their states.",

      "\u201cWe thought this was a good middle ground that had worked in other states and that would uphold the integrity of the games here,\u201d said Jack Cardetti, a spokesperson for the Sports Betting Alliance, an industry group that supported Missouri\u2019s amendment.",
      "A blanket ban on prop bets likely would drive people to illegal and unregulated sportsbooks, placing bettors at greater risk and making it harder to flag problems, the Sports Betting Alliance said.",
      "Others doubt that Missouri's narrowly tailored prop bet restrictions will have much impact in an Internet-connected society where people can easily bet on athletes playing anywhere in the U.S.",
      "\u201cThat\u2019s going to be a Band-Aid on a dam that\u2019s breaking here,\u201d said Nathan Novemsky, a professor of marketing and psychology at Yale University, \"because folks will just make those bets on other teams.\u201d",
      "The Missouri Gaming Commission has three employees focused on regulating sports betting and is looking to hire a fourth, said commission chair Jan Zimmerman.",
      "But the job of detecting fraudulent bets falls largely to sports betting operators working with sports leagues and law enforcement agencies. After the recent indictment of two Guardians pitchers, Major League Baseball announced an agreement with leading sportsbooks to cap bets on individual pitches at $200 and exclude them from parlays.",

      "Italian cultural officials are offering digital copies of Italian masterpieces as part of a new project to help museums raise money",
      "MILAN -- The last person to get their hands on a painting attributed to Leonardo da Vinci shelled out more than $450 million at auction. Now, Italian cultural officials are making it possible to purchase a limited edition, certified digital copy of the Renaissance genius\u2019 \u201cLady with Disheveled Hair\u2019\u2019 for roughly the price of a Lamborghini.",
      "The Italian nonprofit Save the Artistic Heritage with its technical partner Cinello are providing well-heeled collectors the possibility of owning a literal projection of original Italian masterpieces, sized and framed to match the museum experience.",
      "Participating museums sign a certificate of authenticity, and in return receive 50% of the profits.",
      "\u201cWe don't want to sell a piece of technology. We want to sell a piece of artwork,'' said John Blem, the Italian-born Danish entrepreneur who founded the initiative and who serves as chairman of Cinello and vice president of the nonprofit.",
      "The revenue sharing is integral to the project, which aims to help cash-strapped museums access new income streams, and a key part of the sales pitch, Blem said. Over the last two years, Save the Artistic Heritage has contributed 300,000 euros ($347,000) to its Italian museum partners, with prices of the digital masterpieces ranging from 30,000 euros to 300,000 euros.",
      "Contributing to the value, each is sold in a limited series of nine, representing the conventional number of statues that can be cast from a single mold and still be considered original.",
      "The catalog of some 250 Italian artworks comes from about 10 Italian museums and foundations, including the Pinacoteca Ambrosiana in Milan, the Capodimonte in Naples and the Pilotta in Parma, which owns Leonardo's unfinished painting on wood of a woman with windblown hair, which sold for 250,000 euros (nearly $290,000).",
      "Blem and a partner are in the process of setting up a similar nonprofit in the United States that is expected to launch next year.",
      "The digital artworks appear backlit on screens sized to match their originals, the luminescent effect bordering on Technicolor for such brightly colored masterpieces as Raffaelo's \u201cThe Marriage of the Virgin,'' which hangs in Milan's Brera Art Gallery.",
      "Others on display in the non-profit's Milan offices, like Leonardo's wind-swept portrait and Andrea Mantegna's \u201cLamentation over a Dead Christ,\u201d are more subdued. On close inspection, details are visible down to the brush stroke, but without any texture that may belong to the original.",
      "\u201cI must say that the digital copy of \u2018The Marriage of the Virgin' has aroused in me and all those who have seen it a great deal of interest,'' said Angelo Crespi, the Brera Art Gallery's director. \u201cThe perfection, the luminosity, the visibility of the painting is amazing. But at the same time it doesn't deceive. \u2026 When they get close, people can see that it's a digital copy on a screen.\u201d",

      "HONG KONG -- Hong Kong firefighters searched through a high-rise tower complex apartment-by-apartment Friday for more victims after a massive fire engulfed seven of its eight buildings, killing at least 128 people in one of the city's deadliest blazes.",
      "Crews were prioritizing apartments from which they received more than two dozen calls for assistance during the blaze but were unable to reach, Derek Armstrong Chan, a deputy director of Hong Kong Fire Services told reporters.",
      "The toll rose Friday afternoon to 128 after more bodies were found in the blackened towers, and Secretary for Security Chris Tang told reporters at the scene that the search for victims was continuing and the numbers could still rise.",
      "The fire started midafternoon Wednesday in one of the Wang Fuk Court complex's eight towers, jumping rapidly from one to the next as bamboo scaffolding covered in netting in place for renovations caught ablaze until seven buildings were engulfed.",
      "It took more than 1,000 firefighters some 24 hours to bring the blaze under control, and even nearly two days later, smoke continued to drift out of the charred skeletons of the buildings from the occasional flare-up.",
      "The final search of the buildings was expected to be completed later Friday at which point officials have said they will officially end the rescue phase of their operation at the complex in Tai Po district, a northern suburb near Hong Kong\u2019s border with mainland China.",
      "It was unclear how many people could possibly be inside the buildings, which had almost 2,000 apartments and some 4,800 residents.",
      "\u201cWe will endeavor to force entry into all the units of the seven blocks concerned so as to ensure that there is no other possible casualties,\u201d Chan said.",
      "He said an updated figure on the number of missing people cannot be calculated until the search and rescue operation is complete.",
      "The apartments from which a total of 25 unanswered rescue calls were received, which are being prioritized, were primarily on higher floors, where the fire was last to be extinguished, he said.",
      "More than 70 people were injured in the blaze, including 11 firefighters, and about 900 people were housed in temporary shelters.",
      "Most of the casualties were in the first two buildings to catch fire, Chan said.",

    "story": [
      "THC-infused drinks and snacks have soared in popularity as alcohol sales have declined in recent years",
      "MINNEAPOLIS -- The production lines at Indeed Brewing moved quickly, the cans filling not with beer, but with THC-infused seltzer. The product, which features the compound that gets cannabis users high, has been a lifeline at Indeed and other craft breweries as alcohol sales have fallen in recent years.",
      "But that boom looks set to come to a crashing halt. Buried in the bill that ended the federal government shutdown this month was a provision to ban those drinks, along with other impairing beverages and snacks made from hemp, which have proliferated across the country in recent years. Now the $24 billion hemp industry is scrambling to save itself before the provision takes effect in November 2026.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s a big deal,\" said Ryan Bandy, Indeed's chief business officer. \"It would be a mess for our breweries, for our industry, and obviously for a lot of people who like these things.\u201d",
      "Here's what to know about the looming ban on impairing products derived from hemp.",
      "Marijuana and hemp are the same species. Marijuana is cultivated for high levels of THC in its flowers. Low-THC hemp is grown for its sturdy fibers, food or wellness products. \u201cRope, not dope\u201d was long the motto of farmers who supported legalizing hemp.",
      "After states began legalizing marijuana for adult use over a decade ago, hemp advocates saw an opening at the federal level. As part of the 2018 farm bill, Congress legalized the cultivation of industrial hemp to give farmers, including in Republican Sen. Mitch McConnell's home state of Kentucky, a new cash crop.",
      "But the way that law defined hemp \u2014 as having less than 0.3% of a specific type of THC, called delta-9 \u2014 opened a huge loophole. Beverages or bags of snacks could meet that threshold and still contain more than enough THC to get people high. Businesses could further exploit the law by extracting a non-impairing compound, called CBD, and chemically changing it into other types of impairing THC, such as delta-8 or delta-10.",
      "The result? Vape oil, gummy candies, chips, cookies, sodas and other unregulated, untested products laden with hemp-derived THC spread around the country. In many places, they have been available at gas stations or convenience stores, even to teens. In legal marijuana states, they undercut heavily taxed and regulated products. In others, they evaded the prohibition on recreational use of weed.",
      "Some states, including Indiana, have reported spikes in calls to poison-control centers for pediatric exposure to THC.",
      "Dozens of states have since taken steps to regulate or ban impairing hemp products. In October, Democratic California Gov. Gavin Newsom signed a bill banning the sale of intoxicating hemp products outside the state's legal marijuana system.",
      "Texas, which has a massive hemp market, is moving to regulate sales of impairing hemp, such as by restricting them to those over 21. In Nebraska, lawmakers have instead considered a bill to criminalize the sale and possession of products containing hemp-based THC.",
      "Washington state adopted a program to regulate hemp growing. But the number of licensed growers has cratered since the state banned intoxicating hemp products outside of the regulated cannabis market in 2023. Five years ago, there were 220, said Trecia Ehrlich, cannabis program manager with the state agriculture department. This year, there were 42, and with a federal ban looming, she expects that number to drop by about half next year.",
      "Minnesota made infused beverages and foods legal in 2022 for people 21 and older. The products, which must be derived from legally certified hemp, have become so popular that Target is now offering THC drinks at some of its stores in the state.",
      "They've also been a boon to liquor stores and to small Minneapolis brewers like Indeed, where THC drinks make up close to one-quarter of the business, Bandy said. At Bauhaus Brew Labs, a few blocks away, THC drinks account for 26% of their revenues from distributed products and 11% of revenues at the brewery\u2019s taproom.",
      "None of that was what McConnell intended when he helped craft the 2018 farm bill. He finally closed the loophole by inserting a federal hemp THC ban in the measure to end the 43-day federal government shutdown, approved by the Senate on Nov. 10.",
      "\u201cIt will keep these dangerous products out of the hands of children, while preserving the hemp industry for farmers,\u201d McConnell said. \u201cIndustrial hemp and CBD will remain legal for industrial applications.\u201d",

      "But the ban doesn't take effect for a year. That has given the industry hope that there is still time to pass regulations that will improve the hemp THC industry \u2014 such as by banning synthetically derived THC, requiring age restrictions on sales, and prohibiting marketing to children \u2014 rather than eradicate it.",
      "\"We are very hopeful that cooler heads will prevail,\" said Jonathan Miller, general counsel of the industry group U.S. Hemp Roundtable. \u201cIf they really thought there was a health emergency, there would be no year-long period.\u201d",

      "A number of lawmakers say they will push for regulation of the hemp THC industry. Kentucky's second senator, Republican Rand Paul, introduced an amendment to strip McConnell's hemp language from the crucial government-funding bill, but it failed on a lopsided 76-24 vote.",
      "Minnesota's Democratic U.S. senators, Amy Klobuchar and Tina Smith, are among those strategizing to save the industry. Klobuchar noted at a recent news conference that the ban was inserted into the unrelated shutdown bill without a hearing. She suggested the federal government could allow states to develop their own regulatory frameworks, or that Minnesota's strict regulations could be used as a national model.",

      "NEW YORK -- Despite wider economic uncertainty hovering above this year's holiday season, shoppers turned out in big numbers for Black Friday \u2014 spending billions of dollars both in stores and online.",
      "Adobe Analytics, which tracks e-commerce, said U.S. consumers spent a record $11.8 billion online Friday, marking a 9.1% jump from last year. Traffic particularly piled up between the hours of 10 a.m. and 2 p.m. local time nationwide, when $12.5 million passed through online shopping carts every minute.",
      "Consumers also spent a record $6.4 billion online on Thanksgiving Day, per Adobe. Top categories that saw an uptick in sales across both days included video game consoles, electronics and home appliances. Shopping services powered by artificial intelligence and social media advertising have also particularly influenced what consumers choose to buy, the firm said.",
      "Meanwhile, software company Salesforce estimated that Black Friday online sales totaled $18 billion in the U.S. and $79 billion globally. And e-commerce platform Shopify said its merchants raked in a record $6.2 billion in sales worldwide on Black Friday. At its peak, sales reached $5.1 million per minute \u2014 with top categories including cosmetics and clothing, according to the Canadian company.",
      "Black Friday is far from the sales event that created midnight mall crowds or doorbuster mayhem just decades ago. More and more consumers have instead turned to online deals to make post-Thanksgiving purchases from the comfort of their own homes \u2014 or opt to stretch out spending across longer promotions now offered by retailers.",
      "As a result, in-store traffic has continued to dwindle. Initial data from RetailNext, which measures real-time foot traffic in physical stores, found that U.S. Black Friday traffic fell 3.6% from 2024.",
      "But \u201cthe story isn\u2019t just that shoppers stayed home; it\u2019s that they\u2019re changing how and when they shop,\u201d Joe Shasteen, global manager of advanced analytics at RetailNext said in emailed comments on Saturday.

This indicates that, while shoppers remain cautious and are pulling back on in-store spending overall, \u201cthey\u2019re still willing to show up for the biggest promotional moments,\" he said.",

In terms of e-commerce, Adobe expects U.S. shoppers to spend another $5.5 billion Saturday and $5.9 billion on Sunday \u2014 before reaching an estimated $14.2 billion peak on Cyber Monday, which would mark yet another record.",

U.S. President Donald Trump\u2019s barrage of tariffs on foreign imports have strained businesses and households alike over the last year. And despite spending more overall, Salesforce found U.S. shoppers purchased fewer items at checkout on Black Friday (down 2% from last year). Order volumes also slipped 1%, the firm noted, as average selling prices climbed 7%.",
      "This year\u2019s holiday spending rush arrives amid heightened economic uncertainty for consumers. Beyond tariffs, workers across public and private sectors are also struggling with anxieties over job security \u2014 amid both corporate layoffs and the after-effects of the 43-day government shutdown.",
      "For the November-December holiday season overall, the National Retail Federation estimates U.S. shoppers will spend more than $1 trillion for the first time this year. But the rate of growth is slowing \u2014 with an anticipated increase of 3.7% to 4.2% year over year, compared to 4.3% in 2024\u2019s holiday season.",

    "story": [
      "Valuable eels are in decline all over the world, leading to a new push for restrictions on trade to try to help stave off extinction",
      "SCARBOROUGH, Maine -- Eels are the stuff of nightmares \u2014 slimy, snakelike creatures that lay millions of eggs before dying so their offspring can return home to rivers and streams. They've existed since the time of the dinosaurs, and some species are more poorly understood than those ancient animals.",
      "Yet they're also valuable seafood fish that are declining all over the world, leading to a new push for restrictions on trade to help stave off extinction.",
      "Freshwater eels are critically important for the worldwide sushi industry, and some species have declined by more than 90% since the 1980s. The eels have succumbed to a combination of river dams, hydroelectric turbines, pollution, habitat loss, climate change, illegal poaching and overfishing, according to scientists. Some environmental organizations have called for consumers to boycott eel at sushi restaurants.",
      "The loss of eels motivated the Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species of Wild Fauna and Flora, or CITES, to consider new restrictions to protect the wriggling fish. The members of CITES, an international treaty, met in Uzbekistan this week to determine if the new rules on trade are needed. Member nations voted against the new protections on Thursday.",
      "Conservation groups said the protections were long overdue, but not everyone was on board. Some fishing groups, seafood industry members and regulatory agencies in the U.S., China and Japan \u2014 all countries where eel is economically important \u2014 have spoken out against restricting the trade.",
      "The push for more restrictions is the work of \u201can international body dominated by volunteer scientists and unelected bureaucrats,\" said Mitchell Feigenbaum, one of North America's largest eel dealers and an advocate for the industry. But several conservation groups countered that the protections were needed.",
      "\u201cThis measure is vital to strengthen trade monitoring, aid fisheries management, and ensure the species\u2019 long-term survival,\" said Susan Lieberman, vice president of international policy for Wildlife Conservation Society.",
      "The eels in question are the eels of the anguilla genus, which spend their lives in freshwater but migrate to the ocean to spawn. They are distinct from the familiar, grinning moray eels, which are popular in aquariums and are mostly marine fish, and the electric eels, which live in South America.",
      "Anguilla eels, especially baby eels called elvers, are valuable because they are used as seed stock by Asian aquaculture companies that raise them to maturity for use as food. Freshwater eel is known as unagi in Japan, and it's a key ingredient in numerous sushi dishes. Eel is also culturally significant in Japan, where people have eaten the fish for thousands of years.",
      "The elvers have become more valuable in the U.S. over the last 15 years because of the steep decline of eels elsewhere in the world. While the population of American eels has fallen, the drop has not been as severe as Japanese and European eels. Attempts to list American eels under the Endangered Species Act in the U.S. have failed.",
      "Maine is the only U.S. state with a significant fishery for the elvers, and it is heavily regulated. Maine's baby eels were worth more than $1,200 per pound at the docks in 2024, and they were worth more than $2,000 per pound the year before that.",
      "CITES, which is one of the world's largest multinational wildlife agreements, extended protections to European eels in 2009. The organization considered adding more than a dozen more eel species, including the American and Japanese eels, to its list of protected species.",
      "Adding the eels to the list would mean exporters would need a permit to ship them. Before the permit could be granted, a scientific authority in the home country would have to determine that the export would not be detrimental to the species' survival and that the eels weren\u2019t taken illegally under national wildlife laws. That is significant because poaching of eels is a major threat, and rare species are often illegally passed off as more common ones, CITES documents state.",

      "Japan and China have both told CITES that they don't support listing the eels. And in the U.S., the Atlantic States Marine Fisheries Commission, which regulates the American eel fishery, submitted testimony to CITES opposing the listing.",
      "The U.S.'s own management of eels is sufficient to protect the species, said Toni Kerns, fisheries policy director with the commission.",
      "\u201cWe don't feel that the proposal provides enough information on how the black market would be curbed,\u201d Kerns said. \u201cWe are very concerned about how it would potentially restrict trade in the United States.\"",
      "A coalition of industry groups in China, Japan, South Korea and Taiwan also submitted a request that the protection be rejected, saying CITES' assertion that international trade is causing eel populations to decline is \u201cnot supported by sufficient evidence.\u201d",
      "The strong demand for eels is a reason to protect the trade with new rules, said Nastya Timoshyna, office director for Europe with TRAFFIC, a U.K.-based nonprofit that fights wildlife trafficking.",
      "Illegal shipping is not the only reason the eels are in decline, but working with industry to cut down illegal trade will give the fish a better chance at survival, Timoshyna said.",
      "Eels might not be universally beloved, but they're important in part because they're an indicator species that helps scientists understand the health of the ecosystem around them, Timoshyna said.",
      "\u201cIt's not about banning it or stopping fishing practices,\u201d Timoshyna said. \u201cIt's about industry being responsible, and there is massive power in industry.\u201d",

      "After an outcry among Labour lawmakers, and a better-than-expected update on the public finances, the government signaled it preferred a smorgasbord of smaller revenue-raising measures such as a \u201cmansion tax\u201d on expensive homes and a pay-per-mile tax for electric vehicle drivers.",

      "Patrick Diamond, professor in public policy at Queen Mary University of London, said satisfying both markets and voters is difficult.",
      "\u201cYou can give markets confidence, but that probably means raising taxes, which is very unpopular with voters,\u201d he said. \u201cOn the other hand, you can give voters confidence by trying to minimize the impact of tax rises, but that makes markets nervous because they feel that the government doesn\u2019t have a clear fiscal plan.\u201d",
      "The budget comes as Starmer is facing mounting concern from Labour lawmakers over his dire poll ratings. Opinion polls consistently put Labour well behind the hard-right Reform UK party led by Nigel Farage.",
      "The prime minister\u2019s office sparked a flurry of speculation earlier this month by preemptively telling news outlets that Starmer would fight any challenge to his leadership. What looked like an attempt to strengthen Starmer\u2019s authority backfired. The reports set off jitters verging on panic among Labour lawmakers, who fear the party is heading for a big defeat at the next election.",
      "That election does not have to be held until 2029, and the government continues to hope that its economic measures will spur higher growth and ease financial pressures.",
      "But analysts say a misfiring budget could be another nail in the coffin of Starmer\u2019s government.",
      "\u201cBoth Starmer and Reeves are really unpopular,\u201d Rutter said. \u201cThey may be hanging on for now, but I don\u2019t think people will be giving you great odds that they\u2019ll necessarily last the course of the Parliament,\u201d which runs until the next election.",

      "U.S. stocks are climbing again on hopes for a coming cut to interest rates",
      "NEW YORK -- The U.S. stock market is climbing again Tuesday on hopes for a coming cut to interest rates.",
      "The S&P 500 rose 0.8% after breaking out of a morning lull, where it bobbed between small gains and losses. The Dow Jones Industrial Average was up 650 points, or 1.4%, with less than an hour remaining in trading, and the Nasdaq composite was 0.5% higher.",
      "Stocks got a boost from easing yields in the bond market. Lower interest rates can cover up many sins in financial markets, including prices going too high, and hopes are high that the Federal Reserve will cut its main interest rate at its next meeting to juice the economy further.",
      "A raft of mixed economic data on Tuesday left traders betting on a nearly 85% probability that the Fed will cut in December, according to data from CME Group. That\u2019s roughly the same as a day before and up sharply from the coin flip\u2019s chance that traders saw just a week ago.",
      "One of Thursday's reports said that shoppers bought less at U.S. retailers  in September than economists expected. Another said confidence among U.S. consumers worsened  by more than expected, a second signal that the economy could potentially use the help of lower interest rates.",
      "Easier rates can boost the economy by encouraging households and companies to borrow more and investors to pay higher prices for investments than they would otherwise.",
      "A third report, meanwhile, said that inflation at the wholesale level was a touch worse in September than economists expected, but a closely tracked underlying trend was slightly better. That\u2019s important because lower interest rates can make inflation worse, and high inflation is the main deterrent that could keep the Fed from cutting rates.",
      "After taking all the data together, economists suggested the Fed and its chair, Jerome Powell, could be leaning toward cutting rates on Dec. 10. The Fed has already cut rates twice this year in hopes of shoring up a slowing job market.",
      "\u201cTaking a pause on rate cuts would probably do more damage to sentiment than a cut would help,\u201d according to Brian Jacobsen, chief economist at Annex Wealth Management, who also said \u201cPowell doesn\u2019t need to be the Grinch that stole Christmas.\u201d",
      "Easier interest rates can give particularly big boosts to smaller companies, because many of them need to borrow to grow. The Russell 2000 index of the smallest U.S. stocks jumped 2.1% to lead the market.",

      "Florida has hired Jon Sumrall from Tulane as football coach, after Lane Kiffin chose LSU over the Gators",
      "GAINESVILLE, Fla. -- Florida hired Tulane\u2019s Jon Sumrall as football coach Sunday, settling for its second choice after Lane Kiffin picked LSU over the Gators.",
      "Sumrall finalized a six-year, $44.7 million contract that comes with incentives, according to a person familiar with the search. The person spoke to The Associated Press on condition of anonymity because financial details were not released. The deal averages $7.45 million annually.",
      "The 43-year-old Sumrall will remain with the 22nd-ranked Green Wave for the American Conference title game next week and through the College Football Playoff if Tulane makes the 12-team field.",
      "The Gators also agreed to terms with longtime NFL executive Dave Caldwell as their general manager. Caldwell won a Super Bowl during his five seasons with the Philadelphia Eagles and built a roster that made the AFC title game in eight years (2013-20) with the Jacksonville Jaguars. He also spent time with Atlanta, Indianapolis and Carolina.",
      "Caldwell is expected to help manage Florida's salary cap and evaluate talent \u2014 essentially taking some things off Sumrall's plate as college football moves closer to adopting NFL-style front offices.",
      "Sumrall played linebacker at Kentucky (2002-04) and returned to his alma mater for a three-year stint before becoming Troy\u2019s head coach in 2022. He won consecutive Sun Belt championships in two seasons with the Trojans and then enjoyed similar success at Tulane.",
      "Sumrall is 19-7 in two years in New Orleans and led the Green Wave to the American championship game both seasons. So he has made four league title games in four years as a head coach. The Gators are hoping he's Urban Meyer 2.0 and not Billy Napier 2.0.",
      "\u201cNot many coaches win big at two different non-Power programs, and even fewer do it as quickly as Jon has done it,\u201d Florida athletic director Scott Stricklin said. \"He joins rare company \u2014 coaches like Urban Meyer, Brian Kelly and Willie Fritz \u2014 who\u2019ve delivered immediate success at multiple stops. Jon\u2019s track record of rapid turnarounds speaks directly to his leadership and the culture he establishes.\u201d",
      "Sumrall had been considered a possibility at Auburn, Arkansas and Ole Miss. Florida made a late push when Kiffin\u2019s interest in the Gators waned. Florida fans are likely to view him as a consolation prize, another gamble from a Group of Five conference.",
      "Sumrall replaces Napier, who was fired in mid-October and went 22-23 over four seasons in Gainesville. Napier was nicknamed \u201cSun Belt Billy\u201d because he often looked in over his head in the powerhouse Southeastern Conference.",
      "Going back to Louisiana for another G5 coach? And a defensive guy to boot? That\u2019s a bold move for Stricklin, who is sure to draw the ire of the Florida faithful for failing to land Kiffin.",
      "He was roundly booed at a championship celebration to honor men\u2019s basketball coach Todd Golden and his title-winning team in April. Now, the fan base is calling for his job.",

      "But Stricklin seemingly has the support of the Board of Trustees, which gave him a three-year contract extension in June and allowed him to conduct a coaching search that included roughly 10 interviews without interference.",
      "There were rumors and reports about boosters getting involved and straining relationships with Kiffin and his camp. But Stricklin made it clear he was the only one making the hire. Kiffin chose LSU after a public tug-of-war involving all three schools.",
      "Kiffin\u2019s family members took scouting trips to Gainesville and Baton Rouge, and he met with administrators and fundraisers on several occasions. The trip to Gainesville was underwhelming, according to people familiar with the search, and high school football in the area left plenty to be desired.",
      "Florida even turned to Heisman Trophy winners Steve Spurrier and Danny Wuerffel during its pursuit of Kiffin, who eventually slowed communication with UF officials to the point where the Gators decided they had to move on in a crowded market.",
      "Now, Sumrall will be counted on to lead a downtrodden program back to prominence in the powerhouse Southeastern Conference.",
      "Tulane\u2019s numbers are far from gaudy: The Green Wave rank 39th in the country in total offense and 64th in total defense. Sumrall is expected to hire outside coordinators to help him rebuild in Gainesville.",
      "The Gators (4-8) clearly have talent and ended a dismal season with one of their best performances, a 40-21 victory against rival Florida State in the Swamp in which running back Jadan Baugh ran for a career-high 266 yards and two touchdowns and DJ Lagway threw for three scores.",

      "The Buffalo Bills have bounced back from a loss at Houston by pushing around the Pittsburgh Steelers in a 26-7 win",
      "PITTSBURGH -- Josh Allen and the Buffalo Bills came to Pittsburgh looking for something \u2014 anything, really \u2014 to snap themselves out of a midseason lull that had robbed them of their swagger, not to mention their usual grip on first place in the AFC East.",
      "The Bills found it during three hours of remarkably simple and remarkably effective football in a 26-7 victory on Sunday that made up for in sheer force what it lacked in style.",
      "Allen threw for a touchdown and ran for another, Joey Bosa sacked Aaron Rodgers to spring Christian Benford for a game-tilting, 17-yard scoop-and-score, and the Bills (8-4) set an Acrisure Stadium record by piling up 249 yards rushing while whipping the reeling Steelers.",
      "\u201cFound a way to win, that's all that matters,\u201d said Allen, last season's MVP.",
      "Maybe, but the Bills may also have found something that could be effective down the stretch.",
      "Playing without their starting offensive tackles and coming off a loss at Houston in which Allen was sacked eight times, Buffalo responded by opting to gash the Steelers. James Cook ran for 144 yards, Ray Davis added 62 and Allen chipped in 38, including the 76th rushing touchdown of his career, the most by a quarterback.",
      "Allen demurred when asked about breaking the mark of 75 previously held by Cam Newton, saying that's not why he plays. Still, his bulldozing 8-yard score early in the fourth quarter that put the game out of reach was symbolic of a day when Buffalo absorbed a couple of blows from the Steelers and kept on chugging.",
      "Allen juked past one defender, then fought off three more while his teammates dragged him across the goal line.",
      "\u201cThe line coming to throw me in there was pretty cool,\u201d Allen said.",
      "And pretty alarming for Pittsburgh (6-6). On a blustery day that made passing treacherous, the Steelers knew they were going to be tested by one of the NFL's best rushing teams. They failed repeatedly. Buffalo held the ball for nearly 42 minutes and probably could have taken control earlier if not for a pair of first-half turnovers.",
      "\u201cThat's an awful performance by us,\" Pittsburgh coach Mike Tomlin said.",
      "The Steelers have dropped five of seven since a 4-1 start. While they remain tied with Baltimore atop the AFC North, they have not looked competitive at times against quality opponents during a funk that shows little sign of abating.",
      "Rodgers, playing with a brace protecting his broken left wrist, was largely ineffective and missed the chunk of one drive early in the second half after getting drilled by Bosa on the first play of the third quarter.",
      "The four-time MVP fumbled on the play, and Benford picked up the loose ball and sprinted to the end zone to turn a 7-3 halftime deficit into a 10-7 lead. The 41-year-old quarterback left the field with a bloody nose.",
      "Mason Rudolph filled in for Rodgers for a series and threw an interception that ended up in Benford\u2019s hands. Buffalo marched 56 yards in eight plays, and Allen\u2019s fourth-down flip to Coleman gave the Bills firm control.",
      "Rodgers returned but finished 10 of 21 for 117 yards as the Steelers lost for the fifth time in seven games while being booed frequently.",

      "The figure, which stood at $60 billion a year ago, encompasses everything from a ChatGPT query to AI-supplied gift suggestions on a retailer\u2019s website, Schwartz said.",
      "Despite the advancements, AI\u2019s impact on holiday shopping will be \u201crelatively limited\u201d this year since not every shopping site has useful tools and not every shopper is willing to try them, said Brad Jashinsky, a senior retail industry analyst at information technology research and consulting firm Gartner.",
      "\u201cThe more retailers that launch these tools, the better they get, and the more that consumers get comfortable and start to seek them out,\u201d Jashinsky said. \"But customer behavior takes a long time to change.\u201d",
      "Here are three ways the technology is poised to influence holiday shopping habits in 2025:",
      "AI's potential to simplify the search for the perfect present is most apparent so far in tools that promise to give shoppers faster and more detailed results than a web browser with a lot fewer clicks.",
      "OpenAI upgraded ChatGPT with a shopping research feature that provides personalized buyers' guides. The information comes from product pages, reviews. prices and a user's previous interactions with the chatbot. The tool works best for complicated products like electronics and appliances, or for \u201cdetail-heavy\u201d items like beauty or sporting goods, OpenAI said.",
      "Then there's Rufus, the shopping assistant that Amazon rolled out last year. It now remembers information customers previously fed it, like having four children that all like board games, for example. A user's browsing and purchase history and reviews are used to personalize recommendations.",
      "Google upgraded its AI Mode search tool to provide answers to detailed questions composed in natural language. For example, users can tell the agent they want to buy a casual sweater to wear with skirt or jeans in New York in January that goes with a skirt or jeans,",
      "Responses are pulled from Google's 50 billion product listings. The tool can also produce charts with side-by-side comparisons of prices, features, reviews and other factors. Previously, shoppers had to use keywords, filters and product links to find the information they needed.",
      "\u201cThis is an expansionary moment, I think, for all of technology and for commerce,\u201d Lilian Rincon, vice president of product, consumer shopping at Google, recently told The Associated Press.",
      "Meanwhile, Walmart\u2019s AI shopping assistant, Sparky, offers occasion-based recommendations and synthesizes reviews. An AI-powered gift finder on Target's app exclusively for the holidays responds to prompts such as the age and special hobbies of the recipient.",
      "Tools for tracking online prices have been around for years, including CamelCamelCamel, a third-party service for Amazon prices, as well as Paypal\u2019s Honey browser extension for monitoring thousands of online shops.",

      "OpenAI launched a new instant checkout feature that lets users buy products suggested by ChatGPT without leaving the app. Users can order merchandise from Etsy sellers and from some brands that use Shopify, including Glossier, Skims and Spanx.",
      "OpenAI and Walmart announced a similar deal in October, saying the partnership would allow ChatGPT members to use the instant checkout feature to shop for nearly everything available on Walmart\u2019s website except for fresh food. For now, however, the feature only supports buying one item at a time.",
      "A different deal Target struck with OpenAI lets shoppers put multiple items in a cart on ChatGPT, including fresh food products. But when customers are ready to pay for their orders, they are directed away from the chatbot to the Target app.",

While the services still are limited, \u201cagentic AI\u201d is intended to be more independent and advanced than the generative AI chatbots that excel at research and writing, experts say.",

The feature is available for products sold by Wayfair, Chewy, Quince and some Shopify merchants, and Google expects to keep adding more stores, the company said. sellers.",
      "Google also expanded its web browser with an automated AI call feature that phones local businesses on behalf of customers looking for information or specific products. Google's program discloses to the store that it's an AI caller, and stores can choose not to participate, the company said.",
      "Google said it's applying the feature initially to specific product categories: toys, health and beauty, and electronics. Target and Walmart declined to comment on whether this type of service would be part of their future plans.",

      "KHERSON, Ukraine -- When Olena Horlova leaves home or drives through town outside the southern Ukrainian city of Kherson, she fears that she's a target. She believes that Russian drones could be waiting on a rooftop, along the road or aiming for her car.",
      "To protect herself and her two daughters, the girls stay indoors, and she stays alert \u2014 sometimes returning home at night along dark roads without headlights so as not to be seen.",
      "After living through the occupation, refusing to cooperate with Russian forces and hiding from them, Horlova, like so many other residents, found that even after her town was liberated in 2022, the ordeal didn't end.",
      "Kherson was among the first places where Russian forces began using short-range, first-person view, or FPV, drones against civilians. The drones are equipped with livestreaming cameras that let operators see and select their targets in real time. The tactic later spread more than 300 kilometers (185 miles) along the right bank of the Dnipro River, across the Dnipropetrovsk, Kherson and Mykolaiv regions.",
      "The United Nations' Independent International Commission of Inquiry on Ukraine says the attacks leave little doubt about their intent. In an October report, the commission said that the attacks have repeatedly killed and wounded civilians, destroyed homes and forced thousands to flee, concluding that they amount to the crimes against humanity of murder and forcible transfer.",

      "Horlova lives in Komyshany, a village just outside Kherson and only 4 kilometers (2\u00bd miles) from the Dnipro River, where the level of intense attacks has remained the same, despite Ukrainian forces retaking the city from Russian occupation in November 2022 \u2014 about nine months after Russia launched its full-scale invasion on Feb. 24 of that year.",
      "But the war didn't end there. Instead, it shifted into a phase in which the area has effectively become what locals and the military term a \u201chuman safari,\u201d describing it as a testing ground where people are often the target of drone attacks.",
      "Horlova says that FPVs often land on rooftops when their batteries run low and then wait out.",
      "\u201cWhen people, cars or even a cyclist appear, the drone suddenly lifts off and drops the explosive,\u201d she said. \u201cIt\u2019s gotten to the point where they even drop them on animals \u2014 cows, goats.\u201d",
      "She believes that civilians are hunted as \u201crevenge\u201d for the celebrations that broke out when Kherson was liberated.",
      "The report from the Independent International Commission of Inquiry on Ukraine says the attacks have spread terror among civilians and violated their right to life and other fundamental human rights. Investigators found that Russian units on the occupied left bank of the Dnipro carried out the strikes and identified specific drone units, operators and commanders involved. They also noted that Russian Telegram channels routinely share videos of the attacks, often with mocking captions and threats of more.",
      "The U.N. commission said that it examined Russian claims that Ukrainian forces had launched drone attacks on civilians in occupied areas, unable to conclude its investigation because it lacked access to the territory, couldn't ensure witness safety and didn't receive answers from Russian authorities.",
      "Interceptions obtained by The Associated Press from the 310th Separate Marine Electronic Warfare Battalion show Russian FPV drones that appear to be hunting for vehicles. The videos capture drones flying low over roads and locking onto moving or parked cars \u2014 often pickups, supply vehicles, sedans and even clearly marked ambulances \u2014 before diving for a strike.",
      "The commander of the 310th Battalion, which protects the skies over 470 kilometers (nearly 300 miles) of southern Ukraine, including Kherson, says at least 300 drones fly toward the city every day. In October alone, the number of drones that flew over Kherson was 9,000.",
      "\u201cThis area is like a training ground,\u201d said the battalion\u2019s commander, Dmytro Liashok, a 16-year military veteran and one of Ukraine\u2019s early pioneers in electronic warfare. \u201cThey bring new Russian crews here to gain experience before sending them elsewhere.\u201d The AP couldn't independently verify the claim.",

      "In the 40 years since Marc Buoniconti, then a college football linebacker at the Citadel, was paralyzed during a routine tackle, they have been told countless times that it was a problem that couldn\u2019t be fixed. The Buonicontis didn\u2019t listen.",
      "Instead, through the fund that bears their name, they have helped raise more than $550 million for The Miami Project to Cure Paralysis, and improved the lives of millions with spinal cord and brain injuries.",
      "\u201cThe Buoniconti Fund has lasted because we\u2019re relentless,\u201d Marc Buoniconti recently told The Associated Press. \u201cWe never give up. When we see a challenge, we face it head-on and don\u2019t stop until we find a solution. It\u2019s that determination, that refusal to quit that\u2019s kept us going all these years.\u201d",
      "That drive has also led The Miami Project to expand its work beyond curing paralysis. Its research center at the University of Miami Miller School of Medicine now also studies neurological diseases and disorders including Alzheimer\u2019s disease and Parkinson\u2019s disease, and it is testing the brain-computer interface implant from Elon Musk\u2019s technology company Neuralink.",
      "Dr. Barth A. Green, chairman of The Miami Project, who co-founded the organization in 1985 with Nick Buoniconti, says the most surprising developments from the center have been the broadest ones.",
      "\u201cEvery operating room in the world that puts people to sleep monitors their nervous system for safety,\u201d Dr. Green said. \u201cThat was all developed at The Miami Project.\u201d",
      "Therapeutic hypothermia, where the body is cooled after an injury to protect the brain and spinal cord, is another widely used treatment developed at the center.",
      "Dr. Green said that before Buoniconti\u2019s accident he had been working on helping those who had been paralyzed for 20 years. Yet there wasn\u2019t a hub for that work until The Miami Project was established.",
      "It provided a home for him and \u201cthousands of scientists and researchers in Miami and around the world, who were equally engaged by the opportunity to change people\u2019s everyday quality of life and their opportunities to have more function and a better opportunity to be mobile and do things they never dreamt they could before.\u201d",
      "Miami Project Scientific Director W. Dalton Dietrich III said gathering those people from a variety of disciplines \u2013 neuroscientists, researchers, clinicians, biomedical engineers \u2013 into one building has led to unexpected advances.",
      "\u201cNot one particular treatment is going to cure paralysis,\u201d Dietrich said. \u201cSo I\u2019ve tried to look at other disciplines to bring into the project to help us achieve that goal.\u201d",
      "One new, multidisciplinary area, neuromodulation, is \u201csomething we never thought about five years ago,\u201d Dietrich said. \u201cIt\u2019s just an exciting area where you can stimulate these residual circuits after brain injury or spinal cord injury in patients and they start moving their limbs.\u201d",

      "The Buoniconti Fund\u2019s support for the center helps accelerate research in these areas by funding early trials. That, in turn, makes it easier to eventually receive grants from government agencies like the National Institutes of Health or the Department of Defense, Dietrich said.",
      "Marc Buoniconti says \u201cit\u2019s hard to put into words\u201d seeing so many people rally behind him and the millions of others who have been paralyzed.",
      "\u201cWhat started as a promise to help me walk again became a mission to help millions,\u201d he said. \u201cEvery resource, every dollar, every hour given is a testament to the belief that we can change lives.\u201d",
      "Mark Dalton, chairman and CEO of Tudor Investment Corp., said that belief resonated with him and made him want to get involved with The Buonicontis even before he met them.",
      "\u201cI had tremendous admiration for him as a father who was never going to give up on finding a cure for what ailed his son,\u201d Dalton said. \u201cAnd his son was a representation of millions of other people.\u201d",
      "Once he learned more about The Miami Project, Dalton said he was impressed by its science-driven approach. Its setting on a university campus was also important to the former chairman of the board of trustees at Denison and Vanderbilt universities.",
      "\u201cThey put the line in the water,\u201d said Dalton, who now chairs the Buoniconti Fund\u2019s biggest annual fundraiser, The Great Sports Legends Dinner. \u201cThey hooked me. I\u2019m all in.\u201d",
      "That\u2019s a common feeling around The Miami Project, which counts legendary golfer Jack Nicklaus and Grammy winner Gloria Estefan among its supporters. And it\u2019s something Marc Buoniconti says he does not take for granted.",
      "He hopes The Miami Project\u2019s work will continue to expand.",
      "\u201cMy biggest dream is for our researchers to find a way to fully repair the nervous system,\u201d Buoniconti said. \u201cWhen we do that, we\u2019ll change the entire landscape for paralysis and so many other neuro conditions. We\u2019ll give so many people their lives back. That\u2019s what keeps me going, and that\u2019s what makes every struggle to this point worth it.\u201d",

      "A federal judge called out an immigration enforcement agent for using artificial intelligence to write the narrative of a use-of-force report as just a small part of a scathing opinion that rebutted federal officials' narratives about appropriate force...",
      "Tucked in a two-sentence footnote in a voluminous court opinion, a federal judge recently called out immigration agents using artificial intelligence to write use-of-force reports, raising concerns that it could lead to inaccuracies and further erode public confidence in how police have handled the immigration crackdown in the Chicago area and ensuing protests.",
      "U.S. District Judge Sara Ellis wrote the footnote in a 223-page opinion issued last week, noting that the practice of using ChatGPT to write use-of-force reports undermines the agents\u2019 credibility and \u201cmay explain the inaccuracy of these reports.\u201d She described what she saw in at least one body camera video, writing that an agent asks ChatGPT to compile a narrative for a report after giving the program a brief sentence of description and several images.",
      "The judge noted factual discrepancies between the official narrative about those law enforcement responses and what body camera footage showed. But experts say the use of AI to write a report that depends on an officer\u2019s specific perspective without using an officer\u2019s actual experience is the worst possible use of the technology and raises serious concerns about accuracy and privacy.",
      "Law enforcement agencies across the country have been grappling with how to create guardrails that allow officers to use the increasingly available AI technology while maintaining accuracy, privacy and professionalism. Experts said the example recounted in the opinion didn't meet that challenge.",
      "\u201cWhat this guy did is the worst of all worlds. Giving it a single sentence and a few pictures \u2014 if that\u2019s true, if that\u2019s what happened here \u2014 that goes against every bit of advice we have out there. It\u2019s a nightmare scenario,\u201d said Ian Adams, assistant criminology professor at the University of South Carolina who serves on a task force on artificial intelligence through the Council for Criminal Justice, a nonpartisan think tank.",
      "The Department of Homeland Security did not respond to requests for comment, and it was unclear if the agency had guidelines or policies on the use of AI by agents. The body camera footage cited in the order has not yet been released.",
      "Adams said few departments have put policies in place, but those that have often prohibit the use of predictive AI when writing reports justifying law enforcement decisions, especially use-of-force reports. Courts have established a standard referred to as objective reasonableness when considering whether a use of force was justified, relying heavily on the perspective of the specific officer in that specific scenario.",
      "\u201cWe need the specific articulated events of that event and the specific thoughts of that specific officer to let us know if this was a justified use of force,\u201d Adams said. \u201cThat is the worst case scenario, other than explicitly telling it to make up facts, because you\u2019re begging it to make up facts in this high-stakes situation.\u201d",
      "Besides raising concerns about an AI-generated report inaccurately characterizing what happened, the use of AI also raises potential privacy concerns.",
      "Katie Kinsey, chief of staff and tech policy counsel at the Policing Project at NYU School of Law, said if the agent in the order was using a public ChatGPT version, he probably didn't understand he lost control of the images the moment he uploaded them, allowing them to be part of the public domain and potentially used by bad actors.",
      "Kinsey said from a technology standpoint most departments are building the plane as it\u2019s being flown when it comes to AI. She said it\u2019s often a pattern in law enforcement to wait until new technologies are already being used and in some cases mistakes being made to then talk about putting guidelines or policies in place.",

      "The researchers documented 55 instances of what they call \u201cmini lightning\u201d over two Martian years, primarily during dust storms and dust devils. Almost all occurred on the windiest Martian sols, or days, during dust storms and dust devils.",
      "Just inches (centimeters) in size, the electrical arcs occurred within 6 feet (2 meters) of the microphone perched atop the rover\u2019s tall mast, part of a system for examining Martian rocks via camera and lasers. Sparks from the electrical discharges \u2014 akin to static electricity here on Earth \u2014 are clearly audible amid the noisy wind gusts and dust particles smacking the microphone.",

      "The suspected gunman, 29-year-old Rahmanullah Lakanwal, is accused of firing at two National Guard members, 20-year-old Sarah Beckstrom and 24-year-old Andrew Wolfe, on Wednesday afternoon.",
      "Lakanwal -- an Afghan national who worked with the CIA during the U.S. war in Afghanistan -- came to the U.S. after Afghanistan's government fell to the Taliban in 2021 and was granted asylum in April of this year.",
      "\"He was brought into the country by the Biden administration through Operation Allies Welcome. And then, maybe vetted after that, but not done well, based on what the guidelines were put forward by President Biden,\" Noem told ABC News' \"This Week\" co-anchor Jonathan Karl on Sunday morning. \"And now, since he's been here, we believe he could have been radicalized in his home community and in his home state.\"",
      "Noem repeatedly claimed that the alleged shooter was \"unvetted\" by the Biden administration.\u00a0Pressed by Karl on whether any vetting had been performed by the Trump administration, which\u00a0had been in office for several months when Lakanwal\u00a0was granted asylum earlier this year, Noem said that the information that was used to vet him was collected by the previous administration.",
      "\"All the information that was gathered on that vetting process was gathered under the Biden administration. His asylum claim application started under the Biden administration. That information was provided by them, and the responsibility lies with them,\" she said.",

      "Noem responded: \"The processes put in place were put in place using information that was gathered during the application process. It happened under Joe Biden, and that has been completely fixed, and new metrics and new processes have been added under President Trump.\"",

      "Additionally, ABC News previously reported that a\u00a0senior U.S. official said that the suspect had been vetted at one point by the National Counterterrorism Center and \"nothing came up\" during that review. The official added that \"he was clean on all checks.\" The suspect's arrangement with the CIA during the war, which was confirmed by the director, would have almost certainly required him to be vetted by the agency at the time.",

      "WASHINGTON -- For many children, the experience of getting their first pair of glasses is an inevitable milestone, the first in a lifetime of visits to the eye doctor.",
      "But what if those lenses could actually help preserve the child\u2019s vision and reduce the chances for more serious eye problems in adulthood?",
      "That\u2019s the promise of a new type of lens approved by the Food and Drug Administration in September. While the technology has previously been available in Europe, Asia and other parts of the world, it\u2019s now rolling out in the U.S.",
      "Here\u2019s what to know about the new approach.",
      "Myopia, commonly called nearsightedness, is when people can clearly see objects at close range but struggle with distant objects, which often appear blurry or indistinct.",
      "Studies conducted around the world have shown rising rates of myopia, which researchers have associated with increased time indoors looking at screens, books and other objects held close to the eyes.",
      "In the U.S., 30% to 40% of children will have myopia by the time they finish high school, according to Dr. Michael Repka, a professor and pediatric ophthalmologist at the Johns Hopkins School of Medicine.",
      "Until now, doctors had few options for treating the condition.",
      "\u201cIt was typically and simply: \u2018Your child needs to wear glasses and they\u2019ll live with it,\u2019\u201d Repka said. \u201c'It will be lifelong and it will likely get worse over the next few years.\u2019\u201d",
      "The specialized glasses, sold under the brand Essilor Stellest, are approved by the FDA to slow nearsightedness in 6- to 12-year-olds.",
      "The FDA said it cleared the lenses based on company data showing children experienced a 70% reduction in the progression of their myopia after two years.",
      "Over time, myopia causes the eye to grow longer, worsening vision and increasing the risk of tears to the retina \u2014 the light-sensitive tissue at the back of the eye that is essential for vision.",
      "The new lenses use 11 concentric rings filled with tiny raised dots to refocus light onto the retina in a way that is believed to slow elongation of the eye.",
      "\u201cWhether this hypothesis is ultimately proven to be true, of course, matters only in part,\u201d Repka said, noting that the lenses appear to work regardless of how the underling science works.",
      "In the company study, children wearing the lens showed a 50% reduction in eye lengthening when measured after two years. Currently, researchers in the U.S. and other countries are conducting their own independent studies to confirm those results.",
      "Ophthalmologists say the potential benefits go beyond preserving vision to heading off some long-term consequences of severe myopia, which can include cataracts, glaucoma and retinal detachment that can lead to blindness.",

      "Major U.S. vision insurance providers are expected to cover the lenses for children who meet the prescribing criteria.",
      "The only other FDA-approved product to slow myopia are contact lenses made by a company called MiSight. The daily disposable lenses, approved in 2019, use a similar approach intended to slow the progression of nearsightedness in children ages 8 to 12.",
      "But Gupta says many parents and physicians are likely to prefer the glasses.",
      "\u201cA lot of people might be hesitant to put a child as young as 8 in contact lenses, so the glasses offer a really nice alternative,\u201d she said.",
      "Some doctors prescribe medicated eye drops intended to slow myopia, but those are not approved by the FDA.",
      "Under the FDA\u2019s approval decision, the lenses can be prescribed to any child with myopia who\u2019s within the recommended age range. There were no serious side effects, according to FDA, although some children reported visual disturbances, such as halos around objects while wearing the lenses.",

      "NEW YORK -- As the first anniversary of UnitedHealthcare CEO Brian Thompson\u2019s killing looms this week, the man charged in his death will be in court fighting to prevent prosecutors from using evidence they say links him to the crime.",
      "Luigi Mangione, 27, is set for hearings starting Monday on his bid to block the Manhattan District Attorney's Office from showing or telling jurors about items seized during his arrest at a yet-unscheduled state murder trial .",
      "Those items include a 9 mm handgun that prosecutors say matches the one used in the Dec. 4, 2024, killing and a notebook in which they say he described his intent to \u201cwack\u201d a health insurance executive.",
      "After getting state terrorism charges thrown out in September, Mangione's lawyers are now zeroing in on what they say was unconstitutional conduct that tainted his arrest and threatens his right to a fair trial.",
      "They contend that the gun and other items should be excluded because police lacked a warrant to search the backpack in which they were found. They also want to suppress some of his statements to police, such as allegedly giving a false name, because officers started asking questions before telling him he had a right to remain silent.",
      "Eliminating the gun and notebook would be critical wins for Mangione\u2019s defense and a major setback for prosecutors, depriving them a possible murder weapon and evidence they say points to motive.",
      "The Manhattan District Attorney\u2019s Office has quoted extensively from Mangione\u2019s handwritten diary in court filings including his praise for Unabomber Ted Kaczynski.",
      "In it, prosecutors say, Mangione mused about rebelling against \u201cthe deadly, greed fueled health insurance cartel\u201d and said killing an industry executive \u201cconveys a greedy bastard that had it coming.\u201d",
      "Mangione has pleaded not guilty to state and federal murder charges. The state charges carry the possibility of life in prison, while federal prosecutors are seeking the death penalty.",
      "Mangione\u2019s lawyers want to bar evidence from both cases, but this week\u2019s hearings pertain only to the state case. The next hearing in the federal case is scheduled for Jan. 9.",
      "Court officials say the hearings beginning Monday could take more than a week. If that holds, Mangione is almost certain to be in court on the anniversary of Thompson\u2019s death on Thursday.",

      "The Afghan man accused of gunning down two National Guard members blocks from the White House last week had been unraveling for years, unable to hold a job and flipping between long, lightless stretches of isolation and taking sudden weeks-long cross-country drives. His behavior deteriorated so sharply that a community advocate reached out to a refugee organization for help, fearing he was becoming suicidal.",
      "Emails obtained by The Associated Press reveal mounting warnings about the suspect, Rahmanullah Lakanwal, an asylum seeker whose erratic conduct raised alarms long before the attack that jolted the nation's capital on the eve of Thanksgiving. The previously unreported concerns offer the clearest picture yet of how he was struggling in his new life in the United States.",
      "Even so, when the community member who works with Afghan families in Washington state saw on the news that Lakanwal was named as the suspect in the National Guard shooting, they said they were stunned, unable to square the violence with the memory of seeing Lakanwal play with his young sons. The person spoke on the condition of anonymity to share undisclosed details while cooperating with the FBI in its investigation.",
      "West Virginia National Guard Specialist Sarah Beckstrom, 20, and Staff Sgt. Andrew Wolfe, 24, were critically wounded in what officials described as an ambush attack on Wednesday afternoon, and Beckstrom died from her injuries the next day. Investigators are still working to establish a motive for the attack.",
      "Lakanwal, 29, has been charged with first-degree murder.",
      "In Afghanistan, Lakanwal worked in a special Afghan Army unit known as a Zero Unit. The units were backed by the CIA. He entered the U.S. in 2021 through Operation Allies Welcome, a program that evacuated and resettled tens of thousands of Afghans after the U.S. withdrawal from the country, many of whom had worked alongside U.S. troops and diplomats.",
      "He resettled with his wife and their five sons, all under the age of 12, in Bellingham, Washington \u2014 but struggled, according to the community member, who shared emails that had been sent to the U.S. Committee for Refugees and Immigrants, a nonprofit group that provides services to refugees.",
      "\"Rahmanullah has not been functional as a person, father and provider since March of last year, 03/2023. He quit his job that month, and his behavior has changed greatly,\u201d the person wrote in a January 2024 email.",

      "While his turnaround is seen as a sign of desperation by supporters of Venezuela\u2019s political opposition, whose leaders have repeatedly told their backers in Washington that the threat of military action would crack Maduro\u2019s inner circle, months of pressure have yet to produce defections or a government transition.",
      "Behind this knack for staying in power is a system that punishes disloyal associates harshly and allows loyal ministers, justices, military leaders and other officials to enrich themselves.",
      "\u201cThe Bolivarian Revolution possesses a remarkable ability: the capacity for cohesion in the face of external pressure,\u201d Ronal Rodr\u00edguez, a researcher at the Venezuela Observatory in Colombia\u2019s Universidad del Rosario, said referring to the political movement, also known as Chavismo, that Maduro inherited from the late President Hugo Ch\u00e1vez. \u201cWhen pressure comes from abroad, they manage to unite, defend and protect themselves.\"",
      "Underpinning the loyalty-or-punishment principle are corruption networks blessed by Ch\u00e1vez and Maduro that give the loyal permission to get richer. The policy has vexed previous efforts to unseat Maduro and has helped him and his close associates to skirt economic sanctions, obtain U.S. presidential pardons and claim an electoral victory they resoundingly lost.",
      "Rodr\u00edguez explained that prison and torture can be part of the punishment, which is usually harsher for accused wrongdoers with military affiliation. The strategy has been crucial for an authoritarian Maduro to keep control of the military, which he lets traffic drugs, oil, wildlife and myriad goods in exchange for coup-proof barracks.",
      "\u201cThis has been a very effective tool because Chavismo has always been able to eliminate those actors who at some point try to rise up, and it has been able to expose corrupt practices from all sorts of actors,\u201d Rodr\u00edguez said.",
      "Venezuela\u2019s political opposition, led by Nobel Peace Prize winner Mar\u00eda Corina Machado, had banked on the military\u2019s support to dislodge Maduro after credible evidence showed that he lost the 2024 presidential election. But Defense Minister Vladimir Padrino L\u00f3pez and other military leaders stood by Maduro, just like they did in 2019 during a barracks revolt by a cadre of soldiers who swore loyalty to Juan Guaid\u00f3, the opposition leader recognized at the time by the first Trump administration as Venezuela\u2019s rightful leader.",
      "Since returning to office, U.S. President Donald Trump has increased the pressure on Maduro and his allies, including by doubling to $50 million the reward for information that leads to his arrest on narcoterrorism charges. A 2020 indictment accused Maduro of leading the Cartel de los Soles, which the U.S. State Department on Monday designated as a foreign terrorist organization.",
      "Maduro denies the accusations.",
      "On Saturday, Trump said that the airspace \u201cabove and surrounding\u201d the South American country should be considered as \u201cclosed in its entirety.\" Maduro's government responded by accusing Trump of making a \u201dcolonial threat,\u201d rallying supporters behind what it called an assault on national sovereignty.",
      "In early September, the U.S. military began blowing up boats that the Trump administration has accused of transporting drugs in the Caribbean Sea and eastern Pacific Ocean, killing more than 80 people.",
      "Many, including Maduro himself, see the U.S. military moves as an effort to end Chavismo\u2019s hold on power. The opposition only added to this perception by reigniting its promise to remove Maduro from office.",

      "Pope Leo XIV has doubled down on the Holy See\u2019s insistence on a two-state solution to resolve the Israeli-Palestinian conflict",
      "ABOARD THE PAPAL PLANE -- Pope Leo XIV doubled down Sunday on the Holy See\u2019s insistence on a two-state solution to resolve the Israeli-Palestinian conflict, saying in his first airborne news conference that it was the \u201conly solution\u201d that could guarantee justice for both sides.",
      "Leo made the comments as he flew from Istanbul to Beirut for the second and final leg of his maiden voyage as pope. Though Leo has been fielding journalists\u2019 questions at informal gatherings at his country house, the brief encounter marked his first news conference as pope and followed the tradition of his predecessors of using his trips to engage with the media. But it was limited to two questions from Turkish journalists.",
      "The American pope was asked by one about his private talks with Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan upon his arrival in Ankara and whether they discussed the wars in Gaza and Ukraine.",
      "Leo confirmed they had, and said that Turkey had an \u201cimportant role to play\u201d in both conflicts, noting that Erdogan\u2019s government had already helped facilitate low-level negotiations between Russia and Ukraine to end the war.",
      "\u201cUnfortunately we still haven\u2019t seen a solution. But today there are new, concrete proposals for peace.\u201d He said that the Holy See hopes that Erdogan would pursue his dialogue with Ukraine, Russia and the United States to help reach a ceasefire and end the nearly four-year war.",
      "On Gaza, he repeated the Holy See\u2019s longstanding position supporting a two-state solution for Israel and the Palestinians. The creation of a Palestinian state in east Jerusalem, the West Bank and Gaza has long been seen internationally as the only way to resolve the conflict.",
      "The Holy See had recognized a Palestinian state in 2015, but the push for a two-state solution received new impetus this year during the Israel-Hamas war in Gaza. Several more countries formally recognized a Palestinian state during the U.N. General Assembly.",
      "\u201cWe know that in this moment, Israel doesn\u2019t accept this solution, but we see it as the only one that can offer a solution to the conflict that they are living in,\u201d he said. \u201cWe are also friends with Israel and we try with both sides to be a mediating voice that can help bring them closer to a solution with justice for all.\u201d",
      "Leo had avoided any direct mention of the Gaza conflict while in Turkey. And in his brief remarks to journalists summarizing his trip so far, he omitted any reference to his visit to Istanbul\u2019s Blue Mosque, his most visible engagement with Turkey\u2019s Muslim majority.",

      "Prosecutors have also said that Ana Walshe had taken out $2.7 million in life insurance naming her husband as the sole beneficiary.

Brawls in store aisles over toys and TVs with limited-time discounts are spectacles of holidays past. Online shopping and retailers launching discounts weeks before the turkey feast subdued that kind of fervor.",
      "But the sales event still has enough enthusiasts to make the day after Thanksgiving the one when U.S. stores get the most shoppers coming in the door. For that reason, Black Friday still rules as the unofficial start of the holiday shopping season.",

      "While planning for the holidays in the spring and summer, retail companies were wrestling with the volatility of President Donald Trump \u2019s wide-ranging tariffs on imported goods. Many accelerated shipments of some merchandise before the tariffs took effect or decided to absorb some of the import tax costs instead of raising prices for customers.",

      "Toys, baby products, housewares, and team sports equipment were among the hardest hit categories. For example, 83% of toys sold in September saw an increase of at least 5%, Circana said. Industry group The Toy Association says nearly 80% of the toys sold in the U.S. are made in China, a country the Trump administration hit with especially high tariffs at various points this year.",
      "Still, analysts and mall executives cited solid momentum heading into Black Friday week. At the Mall of America in Bloomington, Minnesota, foot traffic in recent weeks surpassed the numbers from pre-pandemic 2019, said Jill Renslow, the mall's chief business development and marketing officer.",

      "THC-infused drinks and snacks have soared in popularity as alcohol sales have declined in recent years",
      "MINNEAPOLIS -- The production lines at Indeed Brewing moved quickly, the cans filling not with beer, but with THC-infused seltzer. The product, which features the compound that gets cannabis users high, has been a lifeline at Indeed and other craft breweries as alcohol sales have fallen in recent years.",
      "But that boom looks set to come to a crashing halt. Buried in the bill that ended the federal government shutdown this month was a provision to ban those drinks, along with other impairing beverages and snacks made from hemp, which have proliferated across the country in recent years. Now the $24 billion hemp industry is scrambling to save itself before the provision takes effect in November 2026.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s a big deal,\" said Ryan Bandy, Indeed's chief business officer. \"It would be a mess for our breweries, for our industry, and obviously for a lot of people who like these things.\u201d",
      "Here's what to know about the looming ban on impairing products derived from hemp.",
      "Marijuana and hemp are the same species. Marijuana is cultivated for high levels of THC in its flowers. Low-THC hemp is grown for its sturdy fibers, food or wellness products. \u201cRope, not dope\u201d was long the motto of farmers who supported legalizing hemp.",
      "After states began legalizing marijuana for adult use over a decade ago, hemp advocates saw an opening at the federal level. As part of the 2018 farm bill, Congress legalized the cultivation of industrial hemp to give farmers, including in Republican Sen. Mitch McConnell's home state of Kentucky, a new cash crop.",
      "But the way that law defined hemp \u2014 as having less than 0.3% of a specific type of THC, called delta-9 \u2014 opened a huge loophole. Beverages or bags of snacks could meet that threshold and still contain more than enough THC to get people high. Businesses could further exploit the law by extracting a non-impairing compound, called CBD, and chemically changing it into other types of impairing THC, such as delta-8 or delta-10.",
      "The result? Vape oil, gummy candies, chips, cookies, sodas and other unregulated, untested products laden with hemp-derived THC spread around the country. In many places, they have been available at gas stations or convenience stores, even to teens. In legal marijuana states, they undercut heavily taxed and regulated products. In others, they evaded the prohibition on recreational use of weed.",
      "Some states, including Indiana, have reported spikes in calls to poison-control centers for pediatric exposure to THC.",
      "Dozens of states have since taken steps to regulate or ban impairing hemp products. In October, Democratic California Gov. Gavin Newsom signed a bill banning the sale of intoxicating hemp products outside the state's legal marijuana system.",
      "Texas, which has a massive hemp market, is moving to regulate sales of impairing hemp, such as by restricting them to those over 21. In Nebraska, lawmakers have instead considered a bill to criminalize the sale and possession of products containing hemp-based THC.",
      "Washington state adopted a program to regulate hemp growing. But the number of licensed growers has cratered since the state banned intoxicating hemp products outside of the regulated cannabis market in 2023. Five years ago, there were 220, said Trecia Ehrlich, cannabis program manager with the state agriculture department. This year, there were 42, and with a federal ban looming, she expects that number to drop by about half next year.",
      "Minnesota made infused beverages and foods legal in 2022 for people 21 and older. The products, which must be derived from legally certified hemp, have become so popular that Target is now offering THC drinks at some of its stores in the state.",
      "They've also been a boon to liquor stores and to small Minneapolis brewers like Indeed, where THC drinks make up close to one-quarter of the business, Bandy said. At Bauhaus Brew Labs, a few blocks away, THC drinks account for 26% of their revenues from distributed products and 11% of revenues at the brewery\u2019s taproom.",
      "None of that was what McConnell intended when he helped craft the 2018 farm bill. He finally closed the loophole by inserting a federal hemp THC ban in the measure to end the 43-day federal government shutdown, approved by the Senate on Nov. 10.",
      "\u201cIt will keep these dangerous products out of the hands of children, while preserving the hemp industry for farmers,\u201d McConnell said. \u201cIndustrial hemp and CBD will remain legal for industrial applications.\u201d",

That has given the industry hope that there is still time to pass regulations that will improve the hemp THC industry \u2014 such as by banning synthetically derived THC, requiring age restrictions on sales, and prohibiting marketing to children \u2014 rather than eradicate it.",

      "A federal judge in Washington has relaunched his contempt probe of the Trump administration for failing to turn around two planes carrying Venezuelan migrants to El Salvador in March",
      "Two planes carrying Venezuelan migrants out of the U.S. were midair on March 15 when a federal judge in Washington ordered the Trump administration to turn them around.",
      "Instead, the planes landed in El Salvador hours later, touching off an extraordinary power struggle between the judicial and executive branches of the U.S. government over what happened and why the judge's order went unexecuted.",
      "That fight entered a critical phase on Friday when U.S. District Judge James Boasberg relaunched an investigation to determine whether the Republican administration deliberately ignored his instruction, letting the planes continue onto El Salvador.",
      "The judge previously concluded it did and threatened to have the responsible official or officials prosecuted on a contempt charge. The administration has denied any violation.",
      "But an appeals court threw Boasberg's decision out. The contempt probe appeared dead until in yet another twist, a larger panel of judges on the same appeals court ruled on November 14 that the investigation could proceed.",
      "Here\u2019s a look at what makes this case unusual and what could happen now:",
      "They are a last resort, former federal judges Jeremy Fogel and Liam O'Grady told The Associated Press in an interview Monday conducted on Zoom.",
      "\u201cThe judge has to believe that some line may have been crossed that you can\u2019t ignore,\u201d said Fogel, who spent 20 years on the bench in Northern California before retiring in 2018.",
      "Fogel said the issues raised by Boasberg's contempt probe \u2014 whether the migrants were deprived of their due process rights and whether the court's authority was flouted \u2014 meet that standard.",
      "\u201cWhatever actually happened, I think it would be very hard for him to just let it go,\u201d the judge said.",
      "O'Grady, who served in Alexandria, Virginia, just outside Washington, for 16 years, credited Boasberg for his efforts to determine the facts.",
      "\u201cHe\u2019s making sure that his record is absolutely clear,\u201d O'Grady said.",
      "On Friday, Boasberg ordered the administration to submit declarations by December 5 from all officials involved in the decision not to return the flights to the U.S. He said he will then decide whether to seek testimony from witnesses.",
      "The declarations should detail the officials' roles in the decision, the judge said in the brief order.",
      "Justice Department attorneys had urged him to abandon the probe, but Boasberg said he must determine whether Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem or anyone else \u201cshould be referred for potential contempt prosecution.\u201d",
      "\u201cIn other words, the Court must decide if: (1) the court order was \u2018clear and reasonably specific\u2019; (2) \u2018the defendant violated the order\u2019; and (3) \u2018the violation was willful,\u2019\u201d he wrote.",

      "That order blocked the administration from removing \u201cany of the individual Plaintiffs from the United States for 14 days,\u201d but said nothing about the flights already airborne.",
      "The two planes had already departed U.S. territory and airspace, so the migrants aboard them had already been \u201cremoved\u201d and therefore fell outside of the court's order, Justice Department lawyers said in the court filing.",
      "\u201cAccordingly, the Government maintains that its actions did not violate the Court\u2019s order \u2014 certainly not with the clarity required for criminal contempt \u2014 and no further proceedings are warranted or appropriate,\u201d they wrote.",
      "A federal appeals court judge said in August that the administration's interpretation of Boasberg's order was plausible. The order \u201ccould reasonably have been read\u201d as only prohibiting the government from \u201cexpelling detainees from United States territory,\u201d wrote Gregory Katsas, a judge on the U.S. Court of Appeals for the D.C. Circuit. Katsas was appointed by President Donald Trump.",

      "Noll said he expects the Justice Department to fight the inquiry from the start, with \u201clots of appeals and chest thumping\u201d that Boasberg is exceeding his authority.",
      "Trump has already attacked Boasberg. After the March 15 ruling, Trump derided the judge as a \u201ctroublemaker and agitator\u201d and called for his impeachment. Boasberg was nominated to the bench by Democratic President Barack Obama and currently serves as the chief judge of the federal court for the District of Columbia.",
      "In July, the Justice Department filed a misconduct claim against him, alleging he told Chief Justice John Roberts and other federal judges in March that the administration would trigger a constitutional crisis by disregarding federal court rulings.",
      "Boasberg has framed the contempt inquiry as an effort to uphold the U.S. Constitution, which he says requires compliance with judicial orders. Separately, he is considering a request to require the administration to give at least 137 of the migrants, who are now back in Venezuela, a chance to challenge their gang designation.",
      "He has accused Trump administration officials of rushing the migrants out of the U.S. and said significant evidence had surfaced indicating that many of them were not connected to the Tren de Aragua gang.",
      "But history shows such punishments are rarely issued or allowed to stand against the government.",
      "A survey of thousands of federal court opinions published in the Harvard Law Review in 2018 turned up 82 contempt findings against government officials and agencies since the end of World War II. Judges issued or tried to issue fines in 16 of those cases, but higher courts blocked them in all but three.",
      "Prison time is even more uncommon. Judges locked up or credibly threatened to lock up a federal agency official in only four of the cases, and high courts similarly intervened to block the sanction, the study by Yale Law School professor Nicholas Parrillo found.",
      "Noll, the Rutgers Law professor, said if the inquiry moves ahead, it could influence public debate about whether the administration can carry out its mass deportation policy legally.",
      "\u201cA lot of a district court's power just comes from the ability to get an issue in front of the public,\u201d he said in a phone interview on Tuesday.",

    "published": "Sun, 30 Nov 2025 13:44:10 -0500",
    "summary": "The \"Avatar\" director, who uses performance capture to help create fantasy characters, has consistently raised the level of movie visual effects. But James Cameron believes using artificial intelligence to create a character and performance without an actor is \"horrifying.\"",
    "story": [
      "Much of what we see from the Earth-like moon of Pandora, the fantastical setting for the \"Avatar\" franchise, comes from a soundstage in Los Angeles, where scenes from the second and third movies were filmed. \"We had to build an ocean,\" director James Cameron said. \"We could make a two-meter swell. We could make a wave crash up on a shoreline if we built the shoreline.\"",
      "Sigourney Weaver, Zoe Salda\u00f1a  and other actors shot their underwater scenes in the nearly 250,000-gallon tank. Digital artists then took those shots, called performance captures, as a template to render the final versions of the characters we see on screen.",
      "\"So, performance capture, we use a whole bunch of cameras to capture the body performance of the actor,\" Cameron explained. \"And we use a single camera (or now we use actually two) to video their face. They're in a close-up 100% of the time. But there's a beautiful thing about being in a close-up 100% of the time. It's very much like theater rehearsal.\"",
      "\"Avatar: Fire and Ash\" is the third film in the series. It tells the story of the indigenous Na'vis' fight to defend their paradise from colonizing humans.",
      "Cameron created these stories and this world. He's always been a dreamer, even as a kid in rural Canada. \"I lived in a world of my imagination \u2013 it was comic books, it was science fiction. I read a lot. There were movies, TV shows,\" he said. \"I mean, I had a pretty fertile imagination.\"",
      "Cameron moved to Los Angeles with his parents as a teen. He briefly attended community college, where studies included marine biology, before dropping out and picking up odd jobs, including truck driving.",
      "So, how did he go from blue collar to Hollywood? \"Watching 'Star Wars,'\" he said. \"I used to put my headphones on and listen to fast electronic music and imagine space battles, hyperkinetic space battles with all kinds of maneuvers and energy weapons, and people going through debris fields and all that. If the things I'm seeing in my mind can be the same things that are in a movie that's the number one movie in movie history, then I've got a salable imagination.\"",
      "He returned to school, although not in an official capacity. \"I started to study visual effects, and the way I did it was, I didn't have the money to go to USC or anything like that. So what I used to do is, I'd go down to USC, I'd go bury myself on a Saturday, when I wasn't driving a truck, in the stacks. And I'd read everything I could find on optical printing and front-screen projection and, you know, sodium process traveling mattes. All self-taught. I'd Xerox all these scholarly papers, put them all in binders. And I had this shelf full of black binders that had essentially a graduate course in visual effects and cinematography.\"",
      "He found jobs in visual effects departments and production design, rising through the ranks quickly due to his technical knowledge.",
      "Then, in the early 1980s, Cameron, inspired by a literal dream about a robot exoskeleton, co-wrote and directed \"The Terminator.\" The movie put him on the map, and proved he could turn his imagination into reality.",
      "But CGI wasn't available at the time; the effects were done largely through puppeteering. \"We just figured out how to do it all practically,\" Cameron said.",
      "He showed us around his private museum in Los Angeles, full of movie props from his films, including \"Aliens,\" where puppeteers brought Sigourney Weaver's powerlifter - and the Alien Queen \u2013 to life. Of the Alien Queen, Cameron said, \"Her head had, I think, seven or eight different axes of movement that were controlled by cables that went basically out her butt. And we had to hide all that stuff, so there was a lotta steam and smoke and backlight and things like that.\"",
      "Cameron's first use of CGI came with the science fiction movie \"The Abyss,\" It was also his first cinematic foray into another one of his fascinations: the deep sea. His second venture into an oceanic film? \"Titanic.\" It became the then-highest-grossing movie of all time. Cameron took home three Oscars himself.",
      "But the film itself was never the priority for Cameron: He said he wrote the script in order to explore the wreck of the Titanic. \"It was a little bit of a means to an end, you know?\" he said. \"I thought, 'I can just go do this. All right, I need a story. Okay, 'Romeo and Juliet.' You know, young, doomed love on the Titanic.' Boom! Like, instantaneous.\"",
      "He found a way to use Hollywood to invest in his passion for scientific exploration. \"Yeah, exactly,\" he said. \"And then I had so much fun on my expedition that was to shoot Titanic for the movie, that I basically took an eight-year hiatus from Hollywood, an eight-year sabbatical. And I did subsequently six more expeditions for a total of seven, before I started 'Avatar.'\"",
      "Cameron wrote the treatment for \"Avatar\" before \"Titanic,\" but it wasn't until 2005 that he thought the current technology could support his vision. And even then, he wasn't sure the business of Hollywood would go along. \"For years, there was this sense that, 'Oh, they're doing something strange with computers and they're replacing actors,' when in fact, once you really drill down and you see what we're doing, it's a celebration of the actor-director moment,\" he said.",
      "\"Now, go to the other end of the spectrum, and you've got generative AI, where they can make up a character,\" he continued. \"They can make up an actor. They can make up a performance from scratch with a text prompt. It's like, no. That's horrifying to me. That's the opposite. That's exactly what we're not doing.\"",
      "Cameron's \"Avatar: Fire and Ash\" opens next months.",
      "So, how does he feel a few weeks from the premiere? \"Nervous!\" he laughed. \"Are you kidding? Always. Always.\"",
      "Despite the uncertainty, Cameron is still undaunted, and enamored by the unknown. \"I'm attracted, in case you haven't noticed, by things I don't know how to do,\" he said. \"Because you grow and you learn. If I'm still making movies when I got an oxygen tube up my nose and I'm 87 or whatever, should I be that lucky, I want to still be doing things I don't know how to do.\"",

    "summary": "The heavy metal band has not only changed lives with their music; they've also changed lives with their philanthropy \u2013 from donations to food banks and disaster relief, to their charity, All Within My Hands, which has donated to workforce education and other critical services.",
    "story": [
      "Carmen DeBerry is a newly-minted commercial delivery driver in Baltimore, Maryland. She says having this new job has completely changed her life. \"It feels awesome,\" she said. \"You know, I take care of my daughter, and I also take care of my mother.\"",
      "The commercial driver's license, like the type DeBerry got at the Community College of Baltimore County, can cost up to $7,500, money she didn't have \u2013 which is where four kind of unlikely guys from the Bay Area stepped in.",
      "Yes, we are talking about the guys from the band Metallica, one of the most commercially successful bands of all time, with more than 180 million records sold. \"I mean, to be honest, I didn't know when I first signed up that it was through Metallica; they just called it a scholarship,\" DeBerry said.",
      "A Metallica Scholarship, to be precise, part of the more than $10 million the band's charity All Within My Hands has donated to workforce education, mostly in the form of grants through trade schools and community colleges.",
      "\"Not everyone is built for college, and not everyone needs college,\" said Metallica lead singer James Hetfield. And he should know; he himself is the son of a truck driver, something he's hasn't forgotten.",
      "\"It was very evident during COVID, you know, when we weren't able to go out and do our thing,\" said Hetfield. \"But the plumber, the electrician, the truck driver, the people that needed to help keep America running were there. And thank God for them. You know, my thought is that the next millionaires will be the tradesmen.\"",
      "\"We all came from, I mean, pretty humble beginnings,\" said Metallica bassist Robert Trujillo, who worked in construction before he became a professional musician. \"At a certain point you realize, like, hey, you know, we're selling tickets, we're doing well, the ship's not sinking. What can we do to make people's lives better?\"",
      "The band's philanthropy actually began with the simple question of what to do with their leftover food backstage at the sports arenas and stadiums they'd been playing. They started donating it to local food banks; then, they starting donating sizable checks to those food banks as well, which turned into disaster relief.",
      "\"It was a bit profound for us because one of the first things that happened was in, maybe 2017, we had the Northern California fires that affected so many people in the Bay Area,\" said guitarist Kirk Hammett. When disaster struck in the band's backyard, that's when he says it hit home: \"And we were able to, like, jump in and, like, really help people right off the bat. And there's been other instances where there's been earthquakes, you know, disasters, people in need of food and medicine. And we've been able to step up and send money, and not just a pittance, but like enough money that makes a difference to, you know, a good group of people who need it.\"",
      "But actually talking about their charity work publicly? That didn't come as easily, says drummer Lars Ulrich. \"We had never screamed from the rooftops about it,\" he said. \"I think instinctively you just want to help. I mean, we all depend on each other \u2013 you know, if you really want to break it down, then you go, humans are herd animals and really thrive, you know, the flock does better when everybody is doing well.\"",
      "Now, if all this doesn't sound very Metallica-like, well, in a way neither does the annual fundraiser concert that they've been putting on in Los Angeles. Last year it raised $3.5 million and brought in some big Metallica admirers, like Aquaman himself Jason Momoa. \"They've kind of been the soundtrack of my life, man. I've kind of discovered them probably when I was ten years old. And I think these are your heroes. These are my heroes.\"",
      "It might come as a surprise to some that a band with songs like \"Nothing Else Matters\" and \"Seek and Destroy\" spends so much time thinking about how to better other people's lives. But for Hetfield, it's a thought process that comes with age.",
      "\"It seems clearer that we have a purpose,\" he said. \"And that purpose is to bring joy to people on this planet, and absolutely still blows my mind that there's three generations out there, you know, rocking out to 'Master of Puppets.' Like, really? You like this song? Okay! That was written when I was 22 years old, and I was pissed off. But beyond what we've done in the music thing, as you get older, you start to see the world in a different light, you know? My philosophy is, you're climbing to the next layer of the high rise. And the older you get, the better the view is of the world, and what you get to see, and where you can be of service. And this is certainly one of them.\"",
      "Up until now, Hetfield had never actually met a Metallica scholar, but that changed backstage before a show in Landover, Maryland, when a very appreciative Carmen DeBerry stopped by. \"I really think that your scholarship, me telling them about your scholarship, is what got me the job,\" she told Hetfield. \"Because once I told them that I got the Metallica scholarship, they were like, Whaaaaat? I got an entrance, and they took a chance with me. And I appreciate it.\"",
      "\"Right on!\" Hetfield replied.",
      "I asked, \"You're about to go out and play to thousands and thousands of people, and yet you just had a moment of getting to talk to somebody whose life has been significantly changed from All Within My Hands' charity work. What's that feel like?\"",
      "Hetfield replied, \"It is so amazing. We get to go make some people smile out there, deliver the goods by playing songs that saved us in our lives. And then to create a foundation that's giving back to, you know, the blue collar America? We get to go from thousands that are making big noise, that we know we're impacting, but to get a one-on-one, you know, heart-to-heart with somebody whose life you've changed, it changes mine.\"",

    "summary": "From living on her Upstate New York farm, to her roles in movies like the forthcoming \"The Testament of Ann Lee\" and \"The Housemaid,\" to her battling serious anxiety and OCD, the Oscar-nominee reveals a grounded movie star living a grounded life.",
    "story": [
      "Breakfast is served on Amanda Seyfried's Upstate New York farm, which means feeding the horses, the goats, and Cliff, a 35-year-old pony. \"I love it,\" Seyfried said, \"'cause nothing else matters, because they need to get fed. It's a responsibility that, like, keeps me focused on what's important.\"",
      "I asked, \"What is it about this place that makes you feel whatever it is that it makes you feel?\"",
      "\"I don't know if you know this, but Hollywood is really \u2026 it's tricky, and it's got a lot of personalities,\" Seyfried replied. \"There are a lot of people that are working in a way that doesn't necessarily make it feel like a safe place. This is exactly what I have always wanted.\"",
      "And she's is not merely putting on a show for the cameras. \"Last night it was raining, it was pouring, and I was doing the same ****. I just didn't look this nice!\" she said.",
      "This is where Seyfried lives, but she goes where the work is, and there's been plenty of it \u2013 as Karen, memorably clueless in \"Mean Girls,\" later as Sophie in the mega-hit \"Mamma Mia!\"",
      "A big change of pace came in 2020, starring as early Hollywood actress Marion Davies in \"Mank.\" The film earned Seyfried an Oscar nomination.",
      "She agrees that she wants to be challenged, badly. \"Because here's the thing: the challenge is within a certain parameter. I have had enough therapy and enough insight and perspective to know what happens when I may fall too deep into something, and I have enough tools and support to not let that happen. So, every time I'd say it's a challenge, it's really hard, and I look back and I'm like, I wouldn't want to do that again! But when I'm in it, it's more than a challenge; it's a new life. I'm being born into something \u2013 a new version of myself.\"",
      "Her commitment is right there on the screen in two movies out next month: the psychological thriller \"The Housemaid,\" co-starring Sydney Sweeney; and the dramatic musical \"The Testament of Ann Lee.\"",
      "In that 18th century story, Seyfried plays Ann Lee, the founder of the Shakers, a religious sect that embraced equality and chastity, even inside of marriage.",
      "\"Her conviction was everything,\" Seyfried said of Lee. \"The coolest thing about her is that she created a utopia. The idea that we're better off working together as equals, it still rings true to this day. Like, if you take away power and control of each other, there's nothing we can't do.\"",
      "The cast received a long standing ovation at the Venice Film Festival, while the role has made Seyfried an Oscar contender.",
      "\"It's like, I worked my ass off in this specific experience, and I worked my ass off throughout my career, and I've stayed true to who I am,\" she said. \"I've definitely changed, and evolved, and become a better person. Do I still make mistakes? Uh-huh, yeah. Do I still make bad choices? Yeah! But I'm human, and I'm, like, doing the best I can. And I'm nice. And I'm f****** nice!\" she laughed. \"'Cause there's no other reason not to be.\"",
      "I can testify, she is \u2026 nice! And refreshingly honest. Raised in Allentown, Pennsylvania, Seyfried studied acting and music as a kid, did some modeling, too. In high school, she was a regular on the soap opera \"All My Children.\" She was on the show for ten months.",
      "Why'd she leave it? \"Why did I leave? Why did Megan McTavish write me off? I don't know, ask her!\" she laughed.",
      "Getting fired, even at 17, hurt. She figured acting was over, so she enrolled at New York's Fordham University, sort of. \"I, like, took the elevator up, and then I stood there, looked at the elevators, and then I took the escalator down, and then I went home. That was my time at Fordham,\" she laughed.",
      "Immediately after \"college,\" Seyfried landed an audition for \"Mean Girls,\" her first big break. \"Mamma Mia!\" was her second. It led to a sequel, 2018's \"Mamma Mia! Here We Go Again\" \u2026 and maybe a trilogy? Asked if there was going to be a third one, she replied, \"Yeah, absolutely.\"",
      "\"Do we know anything about the story?\" I asked.",
      "\"No, I think if we all decided we'll do it for free, they'll be like, 'Cool. Let's do it tomorrow,'\" she replied. \"I know Judy Craymer, who created it, is working furiously on a script. I just assume it'll happen exactly ten years from when we shot the last one, which was '17. So, we'll shoot it in 2027, out in 2028. Every ten years! I just don't know how they get Meryl back.\"",
      "Well, that is the tricky part, as her character is (spoiler) dead. Evil twin? \"There it is!\" Seyfried smiled.",
      "Some character traits can stay with Seyfried, like the voice of Elizabeth Holmes, the Theranos founder convicted of fraud in \"The Dropout\" (2022). The role won Seyfried an Emmy.",
      "Seyfried is candid about everything, including battling serious anxiety and obsessive compulsive disorder, obstacles she believes help her as an actor. \u00a0\"All the things that I have, I've been diagnosed with, I've been able to channel them in the right ways and take the right medication to use it to my advantage,\" she said, \"and to, like, shut it up when it's no longer helpful, for the most part. And that has helped me. Self-loathing, self-judgment, all that, at times helped me keep my s*** together.\"",
      "Seyfried, who turns 40 this week, is married to actor Thomas Sadowski. They have two children. Her daughter was close by during our conversation, as was a guitar. It's one of many instruments Seyfried  plays.",
      "She was looking right at her daughter as she sang.",
      "Seeing her in own house, this farm upstate, surrounded by family and animals, reveals a grounded movie star living a grounded life.",
      "\"It's my world now,\" she said. \"Like, I've been in it for 25 years or whatever. And I, like, totally feel at home in it. And people know me well enough, I don't feel like I have anything to prove. I'm nice to people. I'm not trying to cover up any scandals \u2013 yet! Wait! \u2013 and I'm not trying to, you know, hide or, like, run away from any bad press. So it's like, I've made it easy for myself. So far!\"",

    "published": "Sat, 29 Nov 2025 20:58:40 -0500",
    "summary": "Stoppard was often hailed as the greatest British playwright of his generation.",
    "story": [
      "British playwright Tom Stoppard, who won an Academy Award for the screenplay for 1998's \"Shakespeare In Love,\" has died. He was 88.",
      "United Agents said in a statement Saturday that Stoppard died \"peacefully\" at his home in Dorset in southern England, surrounded by his family.",
      "\"He will be remembered for his works, for their brilliance and humanity, and for his wit, his irreverence, his generosity of spirit and his profound love of the English language. It was an honour to work with Tom and to know him,\" the statement said.",
      "\"My wife and I are deeply saddened to learn of the death of one of our greatest writers, Sir Tom Stoppard,\" King Charles said in a statement. \"A dear friend who wore his genius lightly, he could, and did, turn his pen to any subject, challenging, moving and inspiring his audiences, borne from his own personal history. We send our most heartfelt sympathy to his beloved family. Let us all take comfort in his immortal line: \"Look on every exit as being an entrance somewhere else.\"",
      "Stoppard was born in the Czech Republic in 1937. His family fled to Singapore after Nazi Germany's invasion in 1939. He, his brother and their mother fled again when Japanese forces closed in on the city in 1941. His father died trying to leave the city. His mother married an English officer in 1946, and the family moved to postwar Britain. The 8-year-old Tom \"put on Englishness like a coat,\" he later said, growing up to be a quintessential Englishman who loved cricket and Shakespeare.",
      "Stoppard first worked as a journalist before turning to theater in the 1960s. Stoppard was often hailed as the greatest British playwright of his generation and was garlanded with honors, including a shelf full of theater gongs.",
      "His brain-teasing plays ranged across Shakespeare, science, philosophy and the historic tragedies of the 20th century. Five of them won Tony Awards for best play: \"Rosencrantz and Guildenstern Are Dead\" in 1968; \"Travesties\" in 1976; \"The Real Thing\" in 1984; \"The Coast of Utopia\" in 2007; and \"Leopoldstadt\" in 2023.",
      "He wrote plays for radio and television including \"A Walk on the Water,\" televised in 1963, and made his stage breakthrough with \"Rosencrantz and Guildenstern Are Dead,\" which reimagined Shakespeare's \"Hamlet\" from the viewpoint of two hapless minor characters.",
      "Stoppard was a strong champion of free speech who worked with organizations including PEN\u00a0and Index on Censorship. He claimed not to have strong political views otherwise, writing in 1968: \"I burn with no causes. I cannot say that I write with any social objective. One writes because one loves writing, really.\"",
      "That was especially true of his late play \"Leopoldstadt,\" which drew on his own family's story for the tale of a Jewish Viennese family over the first half of the 20th century. Stoppard said he began thinking of his personal link to the Holocaust quite late in life, only discovering after his mother's death in 1996 that many members of his family, including all four grandparents, had died in concentration camps.",
      "\"Leopoldstadt\" premiered in London at the start of 2020 to rave reviews; weeks later all theaters were shut by the COVID-19 pandemic. It eventually opened on Broadway in late 2022, going on to win four Tonys.",
      "Dizzyingly prolific, Stoppard also wrote many radio plays, a novel, television series including \"Parade's End\" (2013) and many film screenplays. These included dystopian Terry Gilliam comedy \"Brazil\" (1985), Steven Spielberg-directed war drama \"Empire of the Sun\" (1987), Elizabethan romcom \"Shakespeare in Love\" (1998) \u2014 for which he and Marc Norman shared a best adapted screenplay Oscar \u2014 code breaking thriller \"Enigma\" (2001) and Russian epic \"Anna Karenina\" (2012).",
      "He was knighted by Queen Elizabeth II in 1997 for his services to literature.",

    "story": [
      "Louisiana Surgeon General Ralph Abraham, a critic of COVID-19 vaccines, has been named second-in-command at the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.",
      "While there has not been an official announcement about Abraham's role, a CDC spokesperson confirmed with CBS News Atlanta that he was listed in the Atlanta-based agency's address book as principal deputy director. A Health and Human Services spokesperson has also confirmed his appointment.",
      "Abraham, a 70-year-old former Republican congressman and doctor from rural northeast Louisiana, served three terms in the House of Representatives before losing his bid for governor in 2019. He was appointed surgeon general in December 2023.",
      "In February, Abraham ordered his staff to stop engaging in media campaigns and community health fairs to encourage vaccinations, saying in a memo that the Louisiana Department of Health \"will no longer promote mass vaccination.\" The announcement was made the same day that Robert F. Kennedy Jr. was sworn in to serve as President Trump's health secretary.",
      "In a letter posted on the Louisiana Department of Health's website, Abraham decried \"blanket government mandates\" for vaccines and criticized the CDC's COVID-19 vaccination push, saying individuals should make their own decisions about vaccinations.",
      "\"Government should admit the limitations of its role in people's lives and pull back its tentacles from the practice of medicine,\" Abraham argued.",
      "Dr. Nirav Shah, an epidemiologist who served in the position under former President Biden's administration, criticized the appointment on X.",
      "\"Dr. Abraham has been on the wrong side of several important public health issues over the past decade,\" Shah wrote. \"His track record, which includes undermining confidence in vaccines and minimizing the risk of outbreaks, disqualifies him from steering an agency charged with protecting all Americans.\"",
      "Abraham's appointment comes as Kennedy, a longtime anti-vaccine activist, has intensified attacks on some components used in vaccinations. Earlier this month, a CDC webpage was\u00a0updated with language claiming that studies have not ruled out linking vaccines to the development of autism. Kennedy later told the\u00a0New York Times in an interview that he personally directed the agency to update the page.",
      "The CDC has remained without a permanent director since August, after Kennedy fired\u00a0Dr. Susan Monarez less than a month after the Senate confirmed her to lead the agency. Monarez testified in front of Congress in September that Kennedy had pressured her to change CDC guidance over childhood vaccinations.",

    "link": "https://www.cbsnews.com/news/medicare-drug-prices-15-medications-trump-biden-savings/",
    "published": "Wed, 26 Nov 2025 13:52:54 -0500",
    "summary": "The Trump administration tapped a Biden-era rule to negotiate lower prices on 15 widely used medications for seniors.",
    "story": [
      "The Trump administration has negotiated lower prices for 15 widely used medications covered by Medicare, with the federal government saying the effort will cut spending on those drugs by 44%, or about $12 billion. So will the initiative help save money for seniors?",
      "That's less clear, given that Medicare enrollees are already protected by a cap on drug costs. But the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS)\u00a0said Monday the new prices will save the 55 million people enrolled in the Part D pharmaceutical plan a total of about $685 million.",
      "Individuals' out-of-pocket reductions are likely to vary based on whether they use one or more of the drugs covered under the new agreement and if they've reached their annual spending cap. On average, however, with 5.3 million people using the newly discounted drugs, that equates to savings of roughly $129 per Medicare enrollee.",
      "CMS didn't immediately respond to a request for comment about the projected individual savings under the new Medicare pricing plan.",
      "The lower drug prices were arranged through the Inflation Reduction Act, which included a measure to negotiate prices for some of Medicare's most expensive drugs. Before the 2022 law, Medicare was prohibited from negotiating with pharmaceutical firms to secure more favorable drug prices for participants in the government health program.",
      "Under the new agreement, lower prices for the 15 drugs will take effect in 2027 for medications bought through Medicare's Part D prescription plan, CMS\u00a0said. The discounts will range from 38% to 85% off the medications' list prices, according to the agency.",
      "The best-known drugs covered by the agreement include Novo Nordisk's Ozempic and Wegovy, popular medications used for diabetes treatment and weight loss, while other drugs on the list are used to treat common diseases such as asthma and prostate cancer.",
      "The cost of prescription drugs ranks among the top concerns of seniors, according to AARP.",
      "Starting in 2025, the Inflation Reduction Act also introduced a $2,000 out-of-pocket spending cap for seniors. Because that spending limit is adjusted annually for inflation, it could reach about $2,200 in 2027 based on current trends. Medicare enrollees pay nothing for covered prescriptions above that amount. In other words, the negotiated prices for the 15 drugs could help seniors lower their costs until they hit that threshold.",
      "About 5.3 million people with Medicare Part D coverage used the 15 drugs to treat diseases such as diabetes and asthma, CMS said. The medications account for $40.7 billion in spending in Medicare Part D.",
      "Aside from savings that individuals might see on their prescriptions, the lower drug pricing will benefit Medicare itself, Merith Basey, executive director of Patients For Affordable Drugs, an advocacy group for lowering prescription costs, told CBS News.",
      "\"Medicare is using its bargaining power to lower prices on the most expensive drugs covered by the program,\" Basey said. \"The savings gained from the new, lower negotiated prices are what allow the program to pay for the out-of-pocket cap.\"",
      "The program's ability to negotiate drug costs also represents \"the most powerful tool we currently have in place to rein in drug prices and hold the pharmaceutical industry accountable,\" she added.",
      "Medicare's negotiations are separate from deals negotiated by President Trump to lower prices for Zepbound, Ozempic and Wegovy, announced earlier this month. Under that agreement \u2014 which covers eligible patients on Medicare, Medicaid and the planned TrumpRX pharmaceutical website \u2014 the monthly cost of the GLP-1 drugs will range from $245 to $350, down from\u00a0as high as $1,350 per month.",
      "However, the price for Medicare enrollees for Wegovy and Ozempic under the earlier deal will be $245, less than the $274 negotiated by CMS. In Monday's announcement, CMS didn't specify how the two programs might work together.",
      "In a statement to CBS News, CMS said the earlier deal's pricing is \"expected to supersede\" the prices stipulated under IRA.",

      "Traffic particularly piled up between the hours of 10 a.m. and 2 p.m. local time nationwide, when $12.5 million passed through online shopping carts every minute. Mobile shopping was estimated to drive more than half of all sales, according to Adobe.",
      "Consumers also spent a record $6.4 billion online on Thanksgiving Day, per Adobe. Top categories that saw an uptick in sales across both days included video game consoles, electronics and home appliances. Shopping services powered by artificial intelligence and social media advertising have also particularly influenced what consumers choose to buy, the firm said.",
      "In-store traffic continues to dwindle",
      "Meanwhile, software company Salesforce estimated that Black Friday online sales totaled $18 billion in the U.S. and $79 billion globally. And e-commerce platform Shopify said its merchants raked in a record $6.2 billion in sales worldwide on Black Friday. At its peak, sales reached $5.1 million per minute - with top categories including cosmetics and clothing, according to the Canadian company.",
      "Black Friday is far from the sales event that created midnight mall crowds or doorbuster mayhem just decades ago. More and more consumers have instead turned to online deals to make post-Thanksgiving purchases from the comfort of their own homes - or opt to stretch out spending across longer promotions now offered by retailers.",
      "As a result, in-store traffic has continued to dwindle. Initial data from RetailNext, which measures real-time foot traffic in physical stores, found that U.S. Black Friday traffic fell 3.6% from 2024.",
      "But \"the story isn't just that shoppers stayed home; it's that they're changing how and when they shop,\" Joe Shasteen, global manager of advanced analytics at RetailNext said in emailed comments on Saturday. He explained that customers are now spreading out purchases over a longer time frame and \"walking into stores with a far narrower mission than we've seen in past holiday seasons.\"",
      "Black Friday remains a major date on retailers' calendar - and Shasteen added that Friday's drop is \"notably better\" than a sharper 6.2% decline RetailNext saw in in-store traffic for the days leading up to Thanksgiving. This indicates that, while shoppers remain cautious and are pulling back on in-store spending overall, \"they're still willing to show up for the biggest promotional moments,\" he said.",
      "Experts expect heightened holiday spending to continue through the weekend. In terms of e-commerce, Adobe expects U.S. shoppers to spend another $5.5 billion Saturday and $5.9 billion on Sunday - before reaching an estimated $14.2 billion peak on Cyber Monday, which would mark yet another record.",
      "Tariffs create strain on businesses and households",
      "Still, rising prices could be contributing to some of those numbers. U.S. President Donald Trump's barrage of tariffs\u00a0on foreign imports have strained businesses and households alike over the last year. The federal government had raised $195 billion in customs duties for the fiscal year ending Sept. 30,\u00a0according to\u00a0the U.S. Department of the Treasury.",
      "Despite spending more overall, Salesforce found U.S. shoppers purchased fewer items at checkout on Black Friday (down 2% from last year). Order volumes also slipped 1%, the firm noted, as average selling prices climbed 7%.",
      "This year's holiday spending rush arrives amid heightened economic uncertainty for consumers. Beyond tariffs, workers across public and private sectors are also struggling with anxieties over job security - amid both corporate layoffs and the after-effects of the 43-day government shutdown.",
      "For the November-December holiday season overall, the National Retail Federation estimates U.S. shoppers will spend more than $1 trillion for the first time this year. But the rate of growth is slowing - with an anticipated increase of 3.7% to 4.2% year over year, compared to 4.3% in 2024's holiday season.",
      "At the same time, credit card debt and delinquencies on other short-term loans have been rising. And more and more shoppers are turning to \"buy now, pay later\" plans, which allows them to delay payments on holiday decor, gifts and other items.",

    "summary": "The S&amp;P 500 closed near its Oct. 28 record, buoyed by optimism that the Federal Reserve could cut interest rates next month.",
    "story": [
      "Stocks gained in a short Friday session to close near a record high, capping a five-day rally that helped the S&P 500 index erase nearly all its losses from earlier in the month.",
      "The S&P 500 rose 36 points, or 0.5%, to close at 6,849, 42 points shy of its Oct. 28 record. The Dow Jones Industrial Average increased 289 points, or 0.6%, to close at 47,716. The tech-heavy Nasdaq Composite rose 0.7% on Friday but ended November with a decline of 1.5% because of losses for some big tech stocks.",
      "Stock indexes closed at 1 p.m. EDT on Friday due to the Thanksgiving holiday.",
      "The multi-day rebound came after a largely volatile month for stocks, sparked by concerns about a possible bubble in artificial intelligence and tech stocks. AI chipmaker Nvidia lost 1.8% Friday and closed the month with a double-digit loss. Oracle tumbled 23% in November while Palantir Technologies sank 16%.",
      "\"The market needs to prove it can sustain this momentum, but right now, the weakness after Nvidia's earnings looks like it could be more of a short-term AI-selling climax than a sign of heightened bearishness,\" Chris Larkin, Managing Director of trading and investing at E*TRADE from Morgan Stanley, said in an email.",
      "Some investors have expressed worry that an AI bubble\u00a0could burst, triggering devastating financial losses. Bubbles occur when stocks surge on inflated growth expectations that ultimately prove to be disconnected from a company's underlying fundamentals.",
      "Some tech stocks did notch monthly gains, most notably Alphabet, which rose nearly 14%, due to excitement about its recently released Gemini AI model.",
      "The market turned around on hopes that the Federal Reserve would again cut interest rates at its meeting next month. Recent comments from Fed officials have given traders more confidence that the central bank will again cut interest rates at its meeting that ends Dec. 10.",
      "Traders are betting on a nearly 87% probability that the Fed will cut next month, according to data from CME Group.",
      "The central bank, which has already cut rates twice this year in hopes of shoring up the slowing job market, is facing an increasingly difficult decision on interest rates as inflation rises and the job market slows. Cutting interest rates further could help support the economy as employment weakens, but it could also fuel inflation. The latest round of corporate earnings reports was mostly positive, but economic data has been mixed.",
      "The minutes of the Fed's most recent meeting in October indicate there are likely to be strong divisions among policymakers about the Fed's next step.",
      "Investors also had their eye on retail stocks as they wait to see if shoppers rushed to take advantage of the annual Black Friday sales event. Macy's fell 0.3% while Kohl's gained 1.4%. Dick's Sporting Goods dropped 0.5%. Among specialty retailers, Abercrombie & Fitch rose 2.9% and American Eagle Outfitters gained 0.7%.",
      "Amid the volatility in tech stocks, traders moved money into other parts of the market. Pharmaceutical companies Eli Lilly and Merck each rose more than 20% for the month. Travel-related companies such as Marriott and Expedia also posted strong monthly gains.",
      "Earlier, futures for the Dow Jones Industrial Average, S&P 500 and Nasdaq were halted for hours due to a technical issue at the Chicago Mercantile Exchange. CME said the problem was tied to an outage at a CyrusOne data center.",
      "Treasury yields rose slightly, with the 10-year yield at 4.02%.",

    "published": "Thu, 27 Nov 2025 11:42:01 -0500",
    "summary": "Tech giants including Alibaba, Amazon and Meta are counting on AI as the \"killer app\" that convinces consumers to try smart glasses.",
    "story": [
      "If seeing the world through the eyes of artificial intelligence sounds appealing, a growing number of technology companies have just the thing: AI eyeglasses.",
      "The latest entrant is from Alibaba, which on Thursday started selling smart glasses that let wearers access the Chinese online retailer's Qwen AI app with the touch of a button. Consumers can use the device, dubbed Quark AI Glasses, to search the internet, automatically compile meeting notes, make payments, listen to music and manage their schedule, among other functions.",
      "Consumers can also use the glasses' built-in camera to snap a picture of a product and instantly price it on Alibaba's e-commerce site, Taobao. The glasses, which start at 3,799 yuan (roughly $537), are only available for purchase in China, according to Alibaba.",
      "Companies have been down this road before \u2014 often unsuccessfully. Google launched smart glasses, which could be used to search the web, get directions and record video, more than a decade ago. But the product failed to catch on, with consumers put off by the $1,500 price tag.",
      "After repositioning Google Glass as a tool for businesses, the Alphabet-owned company pulled the plug in 2023.",
      "Yet the idea of wearing a computer on your face, rather than carrying one around in your pocket in the form of a smartphone, never went away. Today, major tech players, including Amazon, Meta and Xiaomi, are all rolling out digital glasses, betting on AI as the \"killer app\" that wins over consumers. Dozens of smaller players are also entering the fray with a variety of products.",
      "In the U.S., Meta this summer teamed with eyewear maker Oakley to introduce AI glasses that lets users make calls, send and receive text messages, listen to music, stream video, translate foreign languages, and generally tap the internet via the company's AI app. Geared to athletes, the product starts at $399. Meta also offers AI glasses in a partnership with Ray-Ban.",
      "Such devices are attracting users beyond tech fans. For example, some visually impaired people are using Meta's smart glasses to connect with volunteers for real-time help completing tasks such as shopping or going through their mail.",
      "Although smart glasses remain a niche product, tech market researcher IDC forecasts steady growth, from global sales of 9.4 million units this year to nearly 20 million in 2029. Roughly 17% of online adults in the U.S report having tried smart glasses, according to Forrester, up from 4% in 2024.",
      "One obstacle AI eyewear will have to overcome to gain broader acceptance, according to security experts: privacy. Smart glasses capture, store and share personal data, while their capacity to record and stream video raises thorny questions about filming people without their consent, according to legal experts.",

      "Discounts and deals abound around Thanksgiving, but other days may offer better prices for holiday shopping, according to retail experts.",
      "This year may be a mixed bag for discounts, as some business owners have told CBS News that rising costs are giving them less room to roll out aggressive holiday sales. Still, holiday spending this year could top $1 trillion for the first time, according to a forecast from the National Retail Federation, which expects roughly 187 million people to shop between Black Friday and Cyber Monday this year.",
      "So far in 2025, consumer spending has been driven by high-earning households, while low- and middle-income families are feeling pinched by inflation and affordability pressures, economic research shows.",

      "Shop in-store for big appliances",
      "Looking to buy a big appliance, like a refrigerator, washing machine, or kitchen appliance? It's best to shop in person at brick-and-mortar stores on Black Friday, according to Deborah Weinswig, founder and CEO of Coresight Research, a provider of retail research.",
      "\"We expect to see lots of promotions that are unique to in-store purchases at retailers like Home Depot and Lowe's,\" she told CBS News.",
      "Shoppers should also head to retailers early, because inventory could be limited. Additionally, she expects retailers to adjust pricing in real time, based on consumer demand. Promotions could even vary on a store-by-store basis, depending on inventory levels, Weinswig noted.",
      "When to find travel deals",
      "While the Tuesday after Thanksgiving has been dubbed \"Travel Tuesday,\" it's not necessarily the cheapest time to book. Instead, consumers should start looking for deals as early as Thursday evening, said Julian Kheel, founder of Points Path, a flight search engine.",
      "The best way to keep on top of such promotions is to sign up for your favorite airline or hotel's email alerts, Kheel said. You can always unsubscribe after you've made a reservation, he notes.",
      "\"Most companies will try to get ahead of the competition by launching sales by the morning of Black Friday at the latest,\" he said. \"So don't wait until late Tuesday to look for a great travel deal.\"",

      "\"We'll see discounts in the range of 10% to 28%,\" he told CBS News.",
      "When to buy toys",
      "Black Friday will provide the lowest prices for popular kids' toys, according to retail analysts. It won't pay to wait later than that for deals, especially on hot items like Legos and Labubu dolls that tend to fly off shelves quickly, according to Pandya.",
      "Marshal Cohen, retail advisor at Circana, also advised that consumers should look beyond advertised prices and comparison shop for additional savings.",

      "Chris Butler, CEO of the National Tree Company \u2014 a company that sells artificial Christmas trees and other holiday-themed products \u2014 says tariffs on those items \"basically went from zero\" to between 20% and 30%, \"depending on the country of origin.\"",
      "Butler said his company has had to pass along some costs to consumers. He estimated that 85% of Americans still choose artificial Christmas trees over real ones, and said he's actively lobbying lawmakers to push for tariff relief. He says the price of an approximately $100 artificial tree has risen about $10 to $15 due to tariffs.",
      "\"We want to be treated the same as bananas, coffee, mangoes, etc.,\" Butler said, in reference to an executive order signed by Mr. Trump earlier this month that exempts products including beef, coffee, tea, bananas, mangoes, avocados, cocoa and certain spices from the new tariffs. \"Those things are not grown in the U.S. We know that those are now being exempted. Our raw materials are not available in the U.S. And so we think we should be treated in the same way.\"",
      "Meanwhile, for the Pena family, it's tradition that drove them to handpick an 8-foot-tall Fraser pine at Dutchman Tree Farms as their Christmas tree.",
      "\"The smell triggers those memories growing up, and I just want to provide that for my family,\" David Pena said.",
      "It's a scent that farmers like Powell are banking on to boost sales.",
      "\"It's the smell and the joy of bringing that real tree into their home,\" Powell said. \"That's what we're really selling.\"",

    "summary": "AI is swiftly reshaping America's labor market, performing many technical and cognitive tasks across a range of industries, study says.",
    "story": [
      "Artificial intelligence can do the work currently performed by nearly 12% of America's workforce, according to a recent\u00a0study from the Massachusetts Institute of Technology.",
      "The researchers, relying on a metric called the \"Iceberg Index\" that measures a job's potential to be automated, conclude that AI already has the cognitive and technical capacity to handle a range of tasks in technology, finance, health care and professional services.",
      "The index simulated how more than 150 million U.S. workers across nearly 1,000 occupations interact and overlap with AI's abilities. Specifically, it measures exposure to AI capabilities and how the rapidly emerging technology overlaps with workers' occupational skills.",
      "The study doesn't seek to shed light on how many workers AI may already have displaced or could supplant in the future. To what extent such tools take over job functions performed by people depends on a number of factors, including individual businesses' strategy, societal acceptance and possible policy interventions, the researchers note.",
      "AI's uses extend far beyond some of its most visible applications, such as writing computer code, the researchers note. Among the ways employers across different industries are using AI:",
      "Financial services firms use AI for document processing and analytical support\u00a0Health care providers are adapting AI to handle administrative tasks, allowing clinical staff to focus on patient careManufacturers use the tech for quality control, including automating inspectionsLogistics operators are implementing AI to handle fulfillment",

      "Manufacturers use the tech for quality control, including automating inspections",
      "Logistics operators are implementing AI to handle fulfillment",
      "The study analyzed workers' distinct skills and compared them to the abilities of more than 13,000 AI tools. In some cases, AI can augment human efforts, while in other types of work the technology is far more transformative, according to the researchers.",
      "For example, AI can streamline filling out paperwork, freeing nurses up to spend more time with patients. It can also quickly and accurately produce software code, forcing software engineers with limited skills to shift their focus.",
      "In addition, \"[F]inancial analysts will not disappear, but AI systems may demonstrate capability across significant portions of document-processing and routine analysis work,\" the researchers said. \"This reshapes how roles are structured and which skills remain in demand, without necessarily reducing headcount.\"",
      "AI is also already doing\u00a0some of the entry-level jobs\u00a0that have historically been reserved for recent college graduates or relatively inexperienced workers, the report notes.",
      "\"AI systems now generate more than a billion lines of code each day, prompting companies to restructure hiring pipelines and reduce demand for entry-level programmers,\" the researchers wrote. \"These observable changes in technology occupations signal a broader reorganization of work that extends beyond software development.\"",

    "summary": "The Trump administration tapped a Biden-era rule to negotiate lower prices on 15 widely used medications for seniors.",
    "story": [
      "The Trump administration has negotiated lower prices for 15 widely used medications covered by Medicare, with the federal government saying the effort will cut spending on those drugs by 44%, or about $12 billion. So will the initiative help save money for seniors?",
      "That's less clear, given that Medicare enrollees are already protected by a cap on drug costs. But the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS)\u00a0said Monday the new prices will save the 55 million people enrolled in the Part D pharmaceutical plan a total of about $685 million.",
      "Individuals' out-of-pocket reductions are likely to vary based on whether they use one or more of the drugs covered under the new agreement and if they've reached their annual spending cap. On average, however, with 5.3 million people using the newly discounted drugs, that equates to savings of roughly $129 per Medicare enrollee.",
      "CMS didn't immediately respond to a request for comment about the projected individual savings under the new Medicare pricing plan.",
      "The lower drug prices were arranged through the Inflation Reduction Act, which included a measure to negotiate prices for some of Medicare's most expensive drugs. Before the 2022 law, Medicare was prohibited from negotiating with pharmaceutical firms to secure more favorable drug prices for participants in the government health program.",
      "Under the new agreement, lower prices for the 15 drugs will take effect in 2027 for medications bought through Medicare's Part D prescription plan, CMS\u00a0said. The discounts will range from 38% to 85% off the medications' list prices, according to the agency.",
      "The best-known drugs covered by the agreement include Novo Nordisk's Ozempic and Wegovy, popular medications used for diabetes treatment and weight loss, while other drugs on the list are used to treat common diseases such as asthma and prostate cancer.",
      "The cost of prescription drugs ranks among the top concerns of seniors, according to AARP.",
      "Starting in 2025, the Inflation Reduction Act also introduced a $2,000 out-of-pocket spending cap for seniors. Because that spending limit is adjusted annually for inflation, it could reach about $2,200 in 2027 based on current trends. Medicare enrollees pay nothing for covered prescriptions above that amount. In other words, the negotiated prices for the 15 drugs could help seniors lower their costs until they hit that threshold.",
      "About 5.3 million people with Medicare Part D coverage used the 15 drugs to treat diseases such as diabetes and asthma, CMS said. The medications account for $40.7 billion in spending in Medicare Part D.",
      "Aside from savings that individuals might see on their prescriptions, the lower drug pricing will benefit Medicare itself, Merith Basey, executive director of Patients For Affordable Drugs, an advocacy group for lowering prescription costs, told CBS News.",
      "\"Medicare is using its bargaining power to lower prices on the most expensive drugs covered by the program,\" Basey said. \"The savings gained from the new, lower negotiated prices are what allow the program to pay for the out-of-pocket cap.\"",
      "The program's ability to negotiate drug costs also represents \"the most powerful tool we currently have in place to rein in drug prices and hold the pharmaceutical industry accountable,\" she added.",
      "Medicare's negotiations are separate from deals negotiated by President Trump to lower prices for Zepbound, Ozempic and Wegovy, announced earlier this month. Under that agreement \u2014 which covers eligible patients on Medicare, Medicaid and the planned TrumpRX pharmaceutical website \u2014 the monthly cost of the GLP-1 drugs will range from $245 to $350, down from\u00a0as high as $1,350 per month.",
      "However, the price for Medicare enrollees for Wegovy and Ozempic under the earlier deal will be $245, less than the $274 negotiated by CMS. In Monday's announcement, CMS didn't specify how the two programs might work together.",
      "In a statement to CBS News, CMS said the earlier deal's pricing is \"expected to supersede\" the prices stipulated under IRA.",

    "story": [
      "The government shutdown highlighted a fragile link in the nation's aviation system: finding enough air traffic controllers to keep flights on schedule. The 43-day closure, during which controllers were required to work without pay, has only heightened that challenge.",
      "\"It's a good job with good benefits, but partisan fighting over appropriations is not an ideal situation to try to bring in new air traffic controllers and convince them that this is a good career field,\" Tim Kiefer, a retired air traffic controller who is now a professor of air traffic management at Embry-Riddle Aeronautical University, told CBS News. \"It's not a positive to try to bring people into this industry by saying, 'You never know if you're not going to get paid.'\"",
      "The shutdown saw a spike in the number of controllers choosing to retire, according to U.S. Secretary of Transportation Sean Duffy. The spectacle could also scare away younger workers from entering the field, Kiefer said.",
      "\"If you are a brand new person looking to enter a career, you may be thinking twice if you have to worry whether you're going to be paid or not. That may be a deterrent, and they might find another job because of that,\" he added.",
      "A spokesperson from the Department of Transportation told CBS News that \"the failure to pay air traffic controllers for 44 days created uncertainty, drove many experienced controllers out of the profession and harmed the recruitment pipeline.\"",
      "\"No one wants to enter a job where their paycheck could be held hostage,\" the spokesperson added.",
      "In 2024, the U.S. had roughly\u00a011,700\u00a0certified professional controllers and certified controllers in training, leaving the nation some 4,000 short of the FAA's target staffing level. The agency expects to hire at least 8,900 new air traffic controllers through 2028, while nearly 7,000 are projected to leave over the same period.",
      "The FAA hit its hiring target in 2025, bringing in 2,026 new air traffic controllers, according to the agency.",
      "\"This administration is working all avenues from increasing starting salaries for controllers to streamlining the hiring process to effectively bring about the Golden Age of Travel and ensure America has the safest airspace in the world,\" the Transportation Department spokesperson said.",
      "What are the qualifications?",
      "On the FAA's website, Duffy describes controlling air traffic as \"one of the best, most rewarding \u00a0jobs in America.\" He also highlighted \"the urgent need to do all that we can to recruit more people to join in our shared mission of safety in our skies.\"",
      "Recruiting prospective air traffic controllers is one thing, but getting them to stick with the roughly four years of training required to be certified by the FAA is another matter, according to industry experts.",
      "\"The washout rate at various stages of the controller recruitment and training process is high,\" Robert Poole, director of transportation policy at the Reason Foundation, a group promoting libertarian principles, told CBS News.",
      "Before someone qualifies to train at the FAA's Air Traffic Controller Academy in Oklahoma City, Okla., job candidates must undergo a rigorous application process. To even apply through USAJobs, the federal government's official employment site, they must meet the following criteria:",

      "Aspiring controllers must also pass an exam that the FAA\u00a0says\u00a0predicts candidates' \"aptitude to be an air traffic controller.\" Within a week, they are notified if they have passed.",
      "Stephen Abraham, a retired air traffic controller formerly based at John F. Kennedy International Airport in Queens, New York, told CBS News that the aptitude exam weeds out many job candidates.",
      "\"It's an assessment that determines if you have the right mental makeup to be an air traffic controller,\" he said, noting that people can not prepare or study for the test. \"If you succeed, they send you to Oklahoma City for eight to 12 weeks, where your training is more tailored toward success.\"",
      "Candidates who pass the test must then undergo comprehensive medical and background checks before they begin training at the academy. The medical red flags include using certain types of contact lenses to correct their vision, which is automatically disqualifying, and abnormal blood pressure.",
      "According to the FAA, fewer than 10% of applicants meet the agency's requirements to work as an air traffic controller and gain admission to the training program.",
      "How much do controllers earn?",
      "Once enrolled at the Oklahoma City academy, students spend months learning the basics of controlling the nation's airspace, such as understanding where to position planes on tabletop models of airports, Abraham explained. As they progress, they start using simulators to practice managing air traffic.",
      "Other training focuses on how to communicate with pilots and other controllers assigned to different parts of the airspace, as well as how to determine the best flight routes based on changing weather conditions and other factors.",
      "In time, trainees are assigned to an air traffic control facility, typically a control tower at a small airport with lighter plane traffic, where they spend an additional two to four years working as controllers under the supervision of more experienced staff.",
      "Joining the FAA academy isn't the only path to becoming a controller. Candidates can instead attend a college that offers an FAA-certified curriculum, and then proceed directly to on-the-job training.",
      "In 2024 (the last year for which federal data is available), the median annual wage for air traffic controllers was $144,580, according\u00a0to the Bureau of Labor Statistics.",
      "But pay varies widely based on experience and location. Annual income for less experienced controllers at smaller airports is closer to $60,000, according to aviation experts. Abraham said controllers' pay can rise as they rise to working at busier facilities, gain experience and get promoted.",
      "\"A lot of people get to that point, and when they are at their first facility, trying to learn to control real traffic, some just don't make it,\" Poole said. \"It's more stressful than being a pilot, who flies a route from point A to B mostly on autopilot.\"",

    "summary": "Past-due balances are becoming a reality for many U.S. households as they struggle to keep up with costlier utility bills.",
    "story": [
      "Americans' energy bills are piling up, forcing them deeper into debt and even triggering power shutoffs.",
      "As of June, nearly one in 20 households went into collections or fell in arrears on their utility bills, according to a new\u00a0joint report from The Century Foundation, a progressive think tank, and advocacy group Protect Borrowers. The problem was even more pronounced in parts of the South and Appalachia, where one in 12 households was already in collections or on the verge of it.",
      "In the last three years, the average overdue balance on utility bills climbed from $597 to $789, a 32% jump, the report found.",
      "More Americans are falling behind on their utility payments due to\u00a0rising energy prices, alongside a jump in costs for other essentials, ranging from child care to housing.",
      "\"When we see families unable to pay their utility bills, it raises alarm bells about a crisis of home heating and electricity, but it also raises alarm bells about people's ability to deal with their cost of living across the board,\" said Julie Margetta Morgan, president of The Century Foundation.",
      "Residential electricity prices rose by 10.5% between January and August 2025, one of the fastest increases in a decade, government data analyzed by the National Energy Assistance Directors Association (NEADA), an educational and policy organization, shows. Natural gas is still the most popular way Americans heat their homes, although a growing\u00a0share are using electricity.",
      "A combination of high interest rates, rising natural gas costs and an increase in demand from data centers has pushed up prices, according to NEADA.",
      "The issue will likely come into sharper focus this winter when millions of consumers face heating bills. NEADA predicts that Americans will see their energy bills rise nearly 8% this winter to an average of roughly $976 per month.",
      "More Americans at risk of shutoffs",
      "When people fail to pay their energy bills on time, it can lead to electricity shutoffs, or when a utility turns off a household's power until people pay the balance, along with a so-called reconnection fee.",
      "Most states have some sort of safeguard against utility shutoffs when the temperature dips below a certain level, but not all. States without cold-weather protection include Alaska, Florida, Hawaii, Kentucky, Nebraska, North Dakota, South Carolina, Tennessee and Utah, according to the Energy Justice Lab, a joint project of Indiana University and the University of Pennsylvania.",
      "Despite these protections, Americans are becoming increasingly vulnerable to shutoffs, experts told CBS News.",
      "While no official national count of utility cutoffs exists, NEADA estimates that 3.5 million American households had their power cut off at some point in 2024 based on public data reported by utility companies. That number is expected to swell to 4 million this year, NEADA estimates.",
      "\"Past due balances climbing, particularly for lower-income families, suggest that shutoffs are going to become much more prevalent,\" the Century Foundation's Margetta Morgan said.",
      "Con Edison, a utility serving New York City and Westchester County in New York, has cut off almost 168,000 customers at some point this year, according to data NEADA shared with CBS News. That's more than five times the number of shutoffs the utility reported last year.",
      "Most Americans whose power is cut off have services restored within a few days, according to Mark Wolfe, NEADA's executive director. Still, the shutoffs can create major disruptions to Americans' day-to-day lives as they lose refrigeration, internet and lighting. Pipes can also freeze, and residents could get sick if their apartments get too cold, Wolfe added.",
      "Shutoffs tend to have a bigger impact on low-income households, given they are already stretched thin by everyday expenses, Wolfe said. Many turn to payday lenders, friends and family or state forgiveness plans to cover reconnection costs or overdue bills, he added.",
      "\"When money is limited, people have to prioritize essentials like food and medicine, and utility bills become one of the few expenses they can postpone,\" Wolfe told CBS News. \"That flexibility gives them a small sense of control, but it also increases the risk of falling behind and facing shutoffs.\"",

    "published": "Tue, 25 Nov 2025 15:44:54 -0500",
    "summary": "The impact of the Republicans' tax and spending law could result in the \"largest refund season of the last decade,\" a Wall Street report says.",
    "story": [
      "Federal tax refunds often represent a family's single largest check of the year, and next year's refunds could be even bigger, with the average payment set to increase by about $1,000 per filer, according to a recent analysis from financial services company Piper Sandler.",
      "That could boost the typical refund check to roughly $4,151 per filer, based on IRS data that shows the average tax refund was $3,151 for the 2025 tax filing season. Americans will file their 2025 individual returns in early 2026, with most people receiving their refunds within 21 days of submitting their forms to the tax agency.",
      "The analysis aligns with other forecasts predicting a bumper year for tax refunds, driven by the \"one big, beautiful\" tax and spending law signed by President Trump in July. The legislation enacted a bevy of new tax breaks retroactive to 2025, including eliminating taxes on some overtime and tipped income, as well as lifting the cap on the deduction for state and local taxes, or SALT, from $10,000 to $40,000.",
      "\"When people go to file, they'll be surprised by really, really large refunds,\" Don Schneider, deputy head of U.S. policy at Piper Sandler and one of the report's authors, said in a recent podcast about the analysis. \"In a typical year, we might have about $270 billion in tax refunds, and it'll be that plus another $90 billion.\"",
      "Americans generally aren't adjusting their withholding to reflect the new law's retroactive tax cuts, largely because it's hard for employees to estimate the impact, Schneider added. As a result, when people file their taxes in early 2026, their refunds could be about one-third larger than usual \u2014 that amounts to roughly an extra $1,000 per filer, according to the report's calculations.",
      "\"It could be one of the largest tax refund seasons ever,\" Schneider added.",
      "Still, the impact won't be evenly distributed, with the benefits largely going toward middle- and upper-middle-income households, or those earning between $60,000 to $400,000 per year, according to Piper Sandler.",
      "That echoes earlier tax analyses projecting that higher-income Americans are likely to see a bigger relative boost from the new tax law compared with lower-income households. People who earn over $217,000 a year are likely to get $6 of every $10 in new tax breaks from the law, according to a Tax Policy Center analysis published in July.",
      "Some of the law's benefits won't reach the highest-earning households because of income phase-outs, Piper Sandler noted. For example, the new $40,000 SALT deduction begins to phase out for filers with annual income of more than $500,000.",
      "The lowest-earning households are also likely to see little benefit from parts of the new tax law. For instance, the higher SALT deduction cap only helps people whose state and local taxes exceed the 2025 standard deduction, which stands at $15,750 for single filers and $31,500 for married couples.",
      "Because filers must itemize to claim the SALT deduction, lower-income households typically can't take advantage of it, according to tax experts.",
      "\"This isn't going to the very bottom of the distribution. It isn't going to the very top of the distribution either,\" Scheider said.",

      "It belonged to Jean's godmother, Jeanne Baudot, a friend and student of Renoir's, who passed the painting on to her heirs.",
      "Believed to have been painted between 1890 and 1895, it features the artist's second son, who went on to become an Oscar-winning filmmaker, shown sitting with his nanny.",
      "Pascal Perrin, an art historian and Renoir expert, lauded the \"exceptional condition of the work, which has undergone no restoration,\" while presenting the canvas.",
      "\"We were particularly surprised by how fresh the painting was,\" Perrin told PBS earlier this month. \"In other words, it is a painting that has retained all of its colors perfectly, which has not been recanvassed, retouched or revarnished.\"",
      "Jean Renoir, born in 1894, went on to receive a Lifetime Achievement Academy Award in 1975, several years before he died at the age of 84. His works include the 1930s classic \"La Grande Illusion,\" which follows two French prisoners of war trying to escape German captivity during World War I.",
      "The painting of him as a child had been valued at 1-1.5 million euros and was acquired by an \"international buyer,\" Drouot said on Tuesday.",

    "published": "Tue, 25 Nov 2025 09:25:10 -0500",
    "summary": "Criminals are targeting shoppers with fake websites, bogus charities and other fraudulent pitches, according to insights from Visa.",
    "story": [
      "The holiday shopping season is creating fresh openings for scammers looking to snag consumers' payment data, according to Visa's 2025 Holiday Threats Report.",
      "Artificial intelligence is also helping criminals move faster and reach more victims, according to Visa's scam disruption team. AI tools can generate authentic-sounding text for fake websites that look legitimate but are designed to steal your information.",
      "\"Just as regular consumers are excited for shopping season, scammers are also excited, because it gives them opportunities to capitalize on these feelings, and illicitly gather payment data, or other personal information from unsuspecting victims,\" Michael Jabbara, global head of fraud services at Visa, told CBS News.",
      "Here are five of the most common types of scams to watch for this holiday season, according to Visa.",
      "Fake retail websites",
      "Websites that appear authentic but have been constructed for the sole purpose of scamming customers are proliferating, according to Visa. These sites can closely mimic popular companies, duping shoppers into handing over credit card information.",
      "Sometimes they ship shoddy goods to customers, but in other cases, they don't bother sending anything.",
      "Jabbara said it can be difficult to distinguish between legitimate and copycat sites, and that it's wise to do extra research if your gut instinct says something is awry.",
      "\"Scammers do this for a living and are very good at it. You don't want to underestimate them,\" Jabbara said. \"If a consumer has a feeling that a deal is too good to be true, or a website looks fishy, do some validation.\"",
      "That can include looking at online reviews of the site or going directly to the business's site by typing in its URL, versus clicking on a social media site. For example, open a web browser and type in Gap.com, as opposed to clicking a link in a digital ad promoting T-shirts.",
      "Package delivery scams",
      "Scam artists are sending consumers texts claiming there is a \"delivery problem\" with an online order they probably didn't place. Criminals posing as package delivery services like UPS or FedEx tell consumers they must turn over their credit card information to receive a phony delivery.",
      "This type of scam proliferates around the holidays, when consumers make more online purchases and shippers deal with higher-than-normal volumes of packages, Visa notes.",
      "Criminals may sell and trade your personal information on the dark web, or enroll you in recurring billing cycles you never signed up for. Some consumers might not catch these issues if they don't pay close attention to their credit card statements, according to Visa.",
      "\"They input your payment information into a form and monetize it on different channels,\" Jabbara said.",
      "Jabbara advises that consumers never click on links from unknown senders.",
      "Paying for seasonal work",
      "Fake job offers also crop up during the holidays, when many Americans are trying to earn extra cash to cover gift-giving and travel. Scammers take advantage of that financial pressure.",
      "Visa advises job seekers to apply only through a company's official channels and to avoid any role that requires upfront payments.",
      "\"We see 'job offers' that tell workers they have to pay a fee to apply, or for a background check,\" Jabbara said. \"That is a surefire sign of a scam.\"",
      "Consumers should also verify that any company they're applying to is legitimate, he added.",
      "Travel-related fraud",
      "Scammers are also creating fake travel sites and sending phishing emails targeting people with holiday travel plans.",
      "Make sure to make reservations through trusted travel sites, and if a deal appears to be too good to be true, it probably is. Looking at reviews can help determine if a site is legitimate, Jabbara advises.",
      "Charity scams",
      "The year-end giving season also attracts scammers who exploit people's generosity by setting up phony charities.",
      "Fraudsters may build convincing websites or approach people in person with tap-to-donate schemes, Visa said. As with other scams, it's wise to confirm a charity's legitimacy before donating.",

      "Some batteries that power a popular brand of e-bike pose a fire hazard that can cause serious injury or death and shouldn't be used, the Consumer Product Safety Commission (CPSC) said in a\u00a0notice Monday.",
      "The commission is warning customers to immediately stop using lithium-ion batteries that power e-bikes made by Seattle, Washington-based Rad Power Bikes. The batteries can ignite and explode, causing serious injury or death, the agency warned.",
      "Rad Power Bikes said it disagreed with the agency's warning.",
      "\"Rad Power Bikes firmly stands behind our batteries and our reputation as leaders in the e-bike industry, and strongly disagrees with the CPSC's characterization of certain Rad batteries as defective or unsafe,\" a Rad spokesperson said in a statement to CBS News.",
      "The batteries that pose a fire hazard are model numbers are RP-1304 and HL-RP-S1304, according to the CPSC. They are particularly vulnerable to catching fire when they are exposed to water and also to what the commission describes as \"debris.\"",
      "CPSC said it has received 31 reports of the batteries causing fires, including 12 reports of fires that caused property damage. Cumulatively, accidents related to the batteries have caused roughly $734,500 in property damage, it said, adding that some of the incidents took place when a battery was neither charging nor in use.",
      "CPSC is urging consumers to immediately stop using the batteries, which it said should be removed from the e-bikes and disposed of in accordance with local disposal procedures. It added that Rad Power Bikes has not agreed to recall the products.",
      "Rad Power Bikes added that its bikes are equipped with batteries that it says \"meet or exceed rigorous international safety standards.\"",
      "Rad said it tested its batteries at independent third-party labs, which confirmed that the batteries met the industry's highest standards.",
      "\"Our understanding is that the CPSC does not dispute the conclusions of these tests,\" a Rad spokesperson added in a statement to CBS News.",
      "Rad also pointed out that all lithium-ion batteries can catch fire if they are improperly charged or mishandled, and that Rad advises against misusing them in its customer safety guides.",
      "Rad added that it had hoped to work with the CPSC to help its customers upgrade to the company's \"Safe Shield\" batteries, which incorporate new technology, at a discounted rate. Rad said the commission's request that Rad either offer replacement batteries or refunds to all consumers would put it out of business.",
      "The batteries cost $550 alone, or between $1,500 and $2,000 when sold with e-bikes.",
      "Rad did not indicate how many products are affected by the CPSC's notice when asked by CBS News.",

    "published": "Sun, 30 Nov 2025 19:09:51 -0500",
    "summary": "Juan Orlando Hernandez was convicted in U.S. court of conspiring to import cocaine into the U.S. He had served two terms as the leader of Honduras.",
    "story": [
      "President Trump said Friday that he will be pardoning former Honduran President Juan Orlando Hernandez, who in 2024 was convicted in New York for drug trafficking and weapons charges and sentenced to 45 years in prison.",
      "The president explained his decision on social media by posting that \"according to many people that I greatly respect,\" Hernandez was \"treated very harshly and unfairly.\"",
      "In March of last year, Hernandez was convicted in U.S. court of conspiring to import cocaine into the U.S. He had served two terms as the leader of the Central American nation of roughly 10 million people.",
      "Hernandez has been appealing his conviction and serving time at the U.S. Penitentiary, Hazelton in West Virginia.",
      "Shortly after Mr. Trump's announcement, Hern\u00e1ndez's wife and children gathered on the steps on their home in Tegucigalpa and kneeled in prayer, thanking God that Hern\u00e1ndez would return to their family after almost four years apart.",
      "It was the same home that Honduran authorities hauled him out of in 2022 just months after leaving office. He was extradited to the United States to stand trial.",
      "Garc\u00eda said they had just been able to speak with Hern\u00e1ndez and tell him the news.",
      "\"He still didn't know of this news and believe me, when we shared it his voice broke with emotion,\" she said.",
      "Garc\u00eda thanked Mr. Trump, saying Mr. Trump had corrected an injustice, maintaining that Hern\u00e1ndez's prosecution was a coordinated plot by drug traffickers and the \"radical left\" to seek revenge against the former president.",
      "She said they had not been told exactly when Hern\u00e1ndez would return, but said \"we hope that in the coming days.\"",
      "A lawyer for Hernandez, Renato C. Stabile, expressed gratitude for Mr. Trump's actions.",
      "\"A great injustice has been righted and we are so hopeful for the future partnership of the United States and Honduras,\" Stabile said. \"Thank you President Trump for making sure that justice was served. We look forward to President Hernandez's triumphant return to Honduras.\"",
      "A separate lawyer for Hernandez, Sabrina Shroff, declined comment.",
      "Republican Sen. Bill Cassidy, of Louisiana, was critical of the pardon, saying Sunday on social media, \"Why would we pardon [Hernandez] and then go after Maduro for running drugs into the United States? Lock up every drug runner! Don't understand why he is being pardoned.\"",
      "Mr. Trump defended the move to reporters aboard Air Force One on Sunday, claiming, \"Many of the people of Honduras said it was a Biden setup. ... He was the president of the country, and they basically said he was a drug dealer because he was the president of the country. And they said it was a Biden administration setup, and I looked at the facts and I agreed with them.\"",
      "When asked what evidence he had seen to indicate Hernandez's case was a setup, Mr. Trump said, \"You take any country you want, if somebody sells drugs in that country, that doesn't mean you arrest the president and put him in jail for the rest of his life.\"",
      "Mr. Trump's post on Friday was part of a broader message by the U.S. president backing Tito Asfura for Honduras' presidency, with Mr. Trump saying the U.S. would be supportive of the country if he wins. But if Asfura loses the election this Sunday, Trump posted that \"the United States will not be throwing good money after bad, because a wrong Leader can only bring catastrophic results to a country, no matter which country it is.\"",
      "Asfura, 67, is making his second run for president for the conservative National Party. He was mayor of Tegucigalpa and has pledged to solve Honduras' infrastructure needs. But he has previously been accused of embezzling public funds, allegations that he denies.",
      "In addition to Asfura, there are two other likely contenders for Honduras' presidency: Rixi Moncada, who served as the finance and later defense secretary before leaving to run for president for the incumbent democratic socialist Libre party, and Salvador Nasralla, a former television personality who is making his fourth bid for the presidency, this time as the candidate for the Liberal Party.",
      "Mr. Trump has framed Honduras' election as trial for democracy, suggesting in a separate Truth Social post that if Asfura loses, the country could go the way of Venezuela and fall under the influence of that country's leader, Nicol\u00e1s Maduro.",
      "Mr. Trump has sought to apply pressure on Maduro, who the Trump administration has accused of leading a drug cartel, ordering a series of strikes against boats suspected of carrying drugs, building up the U.S. military presence in the Caribbean with warships, including the Navy's most advanced aircraft carrier, the USS Gerald R. Ford.",
      "The U.S. president has not ruled out taking military action or covert action by the CIA against Venezuela, though he has also floated that he was open to speaking with Maduro.",
      "Outgoing Honduran President Xiomara Castro has leaned into a leftist stance, but she has kept a pragmatic and even cooperative attitude in dealing with the U.S. administration and she has received visits from Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem and U.S. Army Gen. Laura Richardson, when she was the commander of U.S. Southern Command. The president has even backed off his threats to end Honduras' extradition treaty and military cooperation with the U.S.",
      "Under Castro, Honduras has also received its citizens deported from the U.S. and acted as a bridge for deported Venezuelans who were then picked up by Venezuela in Honduras.",

    "summary": "Democratic Sen. Tim Kaine of Virginia said a reported U.S. follow-on strike on an alleged drug boat earlier this year \"rises to the level of a war crime if it's true.\"",
    "story": [
      "Washington \u2014 Democratic Sen. Tim Kaine of Virginia said Sunday that a reported U.S. follow-on strike on an alleged drug boat earlier this year \"rises to the level of a war crime if it's true.\"",
      "\"If that reporting is true, it's a clear violation of the DoD's own laws of war, as well as international laws about the way you treat people who are in that circumstance,\" Kaine said on \"Face the Nation with Margaret Brennan.\"",
      "The Washington Post reported Friday that in the U.S.' first strike on a suspected drug smuggling boat in the Caribbean in September, Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth gave a verbal order to leave no survivors. A follow-on strike was ordered to comply with the instructions, killing two survivors in the water, the Post reported. Hegseth called the reporting \"fabricated, inflammatory and derogatory,\" claiming the operations in the Caribbean are \"lawful under both U.S. and international law.\"",
      "CBS News has not independently confirmed the Washington Post's reporting.",
      "Targeting civilians or members of the armed forces who are wounded is prohibited under the Geneva Conventions, which also require the wounded to be \"collected and cared for.\" A group of former military lawyers outlined in an assessment Saturday that the reported second strike would be a violation of international or domestic law. And the leaders of the House and Senate Armed Services committees pledged to investigate the reported follow-on strike.",
      "Asked about the reported follow-on strike while aboard Air Force One on Sunday, President Trump said, \"First of all, I don't know that that happened, and Pete [Hegseth] said he didn't even know what people were talking about.\"",
      "\"So, we'll look into it. But no, I wouldn't have wanted that, a second strike,\" Mr. Trump said. \"The first strike was very lethal. It was fine. If there were two people around \u2014 but Pete [Hegseth] said that didn't happen. I have great confidence in him ... I'm going to find out about it, but Pete said he didn't order the death of those two men.\"",
      "Since the first strike on Sept. 2, the U.S. has carried out close to two dozen boat strikes in the Caribbean and eastern Pacific Ocean. Kaine outlined to CBS News' chief White House correspondent Nancy Cordes that lawmakers have been seeking answers to a number of questions about the strikes, including seeking evidence that \"the folks on board were really narco traffickers,\" the question of why to strike rather than interdict, and the legal rationale for the strikes.",
      "\"We had to pry with a crowbar after weeks and weeks out of the administration, the supposed legal rationale for the strikes at international waters,\" Kaine said. \"It was very shoddy.\"",
      "The Virginia Democrat said, \"It's time for Congress to rein in a president who is deciding to wage war on his own say-so, which is not what the Constitution allowed.\"",
      "Kaine has twice tried to pass war powers resolutions aimed at preventing the president from conducting strikes against Venezuela, earning support from two Republicans.",
      "\"That was before all of these assets have amassed around Venezuela, and before President Trump said that the airspace needs to be closed,\" Kaine said.",
      "Mr. Trump posted on Truth Social Saturday that Venezuela's airspace should be considered \"CLOSED IN ITS ENTIRETY.\" The post comes as the administration has increased pressure on Venezuelan President Nicolas Maduro, with signs that military action, including possible ground action, could be imminent.",
      "Kaine said if there's ground action, the numbers in the Senate would change. And he noted that he would move \"immediately\" on a war powers resolution \"should there be military action.\"",
      "\"The circumstances have changed in the months since we had that vote,\" Kaine said. \"We think the escalating pace and some of the recent revelations \u2014 so, for example, the recent revelation about the kill everyone order apparently dictated by Secretary Hegseth \u2014 we do believe that we will get more support for these motions when they are refiled.\"",
      "Rep. Mike Turner, an Ohio Republican who sits on the Armed Services Committee and previously led the House Intelligence Committee, also appeared on \"Face the Nation\" Sunday. He said \"Congress does not have information\" that the reported follow-on strike occurred.",
      "\"If that occurred, that would be very serious, and I agree that that would be an illegal act,\" Turner added.",

      "As the meeting kicked off Sunday, Rubio outlined that \"the end goal is obviously not just the end of the war,\" but also \"securing an end to the war that leaves Ukraine sovereign and independent and with an opportunity at real prosperity.\"",
      "Rubio's comments come after the White House floated a peace proposal earlier this month that critics said favored Russia, initially including several provisions that Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy had rejected in the past. But the plan has since been revised, Mr. Trump has outlined, citing progress on both sides.",
      "Asked by CBS' chief White House correspondent Nancy Cordes whether he still has concerns about the plan being too pro-Russia, Turner, who sits on the House Armed Services Committee and formerly chaired the House Intelligence Committee, said \"I think we all have those concerns.\" But he added, \"one thing that I think everybody understands is that you can't have, you can't be America first and pro-Russia, because Russia is a self-declared adversary of the United States.\"",
      "\"It's fielding new, advanced nuclear weapons that are specifically targeting the United States, it's constantly attacking the United States with offensive cyber, it continuously identifies both NATO and the west, the United States, as its adversary,\" Turner said. \"You have to understand that the balance of this peace arrangement has to be one where you have to look at Russia as a skeptical adversary.\"",
      "Asked about a transcript of a call published by Bloomberg in which Witkoff appeared to be coaching a Kremlin aide on how to negotiate with President Trump, Turner said \"the part that concerned me most is that there appeared to be an orchestration of giving Putin an opportunity to speak to Trump before President Zelenskyy was on his way to the White House.\"",
      "Turner said \"this is not a military against military action, they are bombing into Ukraine and murderously killing civilians in Ukraine.\"",
      "\"The Ukrainian people are being subjected to this, and President Trump needs to be able to hear Zelenskyy's voice clearly, and not just the authoritarian, murderous Putin,\" Turner added.",
      "As for Witkoff, Turner said \"I think you can't take just one slice of someone's conversation during the long, stretched out aspects of negotiations as reflective. But I think it's certainly important that when we do get that opportunity, that our voices are heard of caution and concern.\"",
      "\"The orchestration of inserting Putin's voice before Zelenskyy's is very concerning,\" Turner said. \"Because Ukraine's sovereignty and security needs to be preeminent. And we heard that this morning from Rubio, and that needs to be the focus.\"",
      "On Sunday afternoon, Rubio called the day's meeting \"another very productive session,\" reiterating the intention to end the war while also working to \"help Ukraine be safe forever.\" He called it a \"shared vision.\"",
      "\"But there's more work to be done,\" Rubio said after the meeting. \"This is delicate, it's complicated, there are a lot of moving parts, and obviously there's another party involved here that will have to be a part of the equation, and that will continue later this week when Mr. Witkoff travels to Moscow.\"",

      "The following is the transcript of the interview with Feeding America CEO Claire Babineaux-Fontenot that aired on \"Face the Nation with Margaret Brennan\" on Nov. 30, 2025.",
      "NANCY CORDES: We turn now to the fight against hunger in the United States. According to government data, 47.4 million people lived in what the Department of Agriculture calls a food insecure household in 2023. That's when a household can't necessarily obtain enough food to feed all of its members. One of the largest groups working to combat food insecurity is Feeding America, and we're joined now by CEO Claire Babineaux-Fontenot, who is in Charleston, South Carolina this morning. Claire, thanks so much for being with us, and happy Thanksgiving.",
      "CLAIRE BABINEAUX-FONTENOT: Thanks for having me back.",
      "NANCY CORDES: Absolutely. So during the shutdown, we saw these incredibly long lines at food banks. The shutdown has now been over for a couple of weeks. SNAP benefits are going out again, but even before the shutdown, food insecurity was at its highest rate in nearly a decade. So, what is the situation now that you're seeing at food banks around the country as we head into the holidays?",
      "BABINEAUX-FONTENOT: Yeah. So I'm so glad that you- you made that point. I- I think your viewers may be surprised to learn that food insecurity rates before the shutdown were higher than at any point during the pandemic, as an example. We're continuing to see very high demand. I think part of the reason is because the fastest growing group of people turning to the charitable food system, they're people who don't even qualify for any federal nutrition programs so this is an area that we've got to stay focused on. We know the kinds of things that work. We need to do those things so that we can really address what's happening with hunger and poverty in the country,",
      "NANCY CORDES: What do you think is contributing to the rise in hunger and this group of people who, as you say, don't qualify for benefits, but are showing an increased need for food?",
      "BABINEAUX-FONTENOT: Yeah, I think it's that the system is broken. Right now, there's so many people, if you can imagine, in this country who can't afford to get a raise at work, because we have a system that does not incentivize people to continue to move up the ladder. We've got ladders with big missing rungs, if you will, so we can do something about that. We could have a sliding scale, for instance, that allows people to move out of poverty. By doing that, because food insecurity is actually a symptom of poverty, they'll move out of that as well. We as a nation should all want people to be able to provide for themselves. We should all want them to be able to get work that they can feel proud of and support their families with. We have the power to do all of those things, it will require that we work together, that we be honest about what's broken, and that we really get committed about fixing those things.",
      "NANCY CORDES: What are the main challenges that the organizations in your network are facing this holiday season as they try to feed people who are hungry? Is the food there for the people who need it?",
      "BABINEAUX-FONTENOT: \u00a0Yeah, unfortunately, the lines are longer than- than the food that is available, and one of the hardest things to witness will be seeing these people who have the same dreams, aspirations for their kids and themselves, as I have for mine and all of your viewers have for theirs, feeling the need to turn to the charitable food system. It takes a lot of courage and resiliency and commitment to family ofttimes to be able to do that, and then for them to turn up in spite of all of those barriers, and not- us not be able to provide them with what they really need so I have a deep respect for people experiencing hunger in this country. I've been a person who's experienced hunger before. I know many people who have, many people who still do, so many of them are my heroes. And then another set of heroes that I have are people working in this fight in the Feeding America network, who show up shoulder to shoulder with people experiencing hunger, who are so deeply committed to their well being. So we need to position people experiencing hunger to be able to fend for themselves, and we need to position food banks to be able to provide them with the support that they need in this moment, until they get there.",
      "NANCY CORDES: As you know, there are about two million Americans who are going to be affected by changes to the SNAP program that were made earlier this year in a vote by Congress. They will not be receiving SNAP benefits any longer. What are the economic implications of that? And in about 30 seconds, what can your organizations do about it?",
      "BABINEAUX-FONTENOT: According to the Congressional Budget Office, we're probably looking at about a six billion meal per year gap that's going to be created. So the kinds of things that we ought to do: we ought to address fraud where it exists. We ought to incentivize people to be able to get the hand up that they need and to move out of poverty. We ought to address error rates, but we ought to do all of these things strategically, and we ought to do them in a bipartisan way. This ought to be the kind of thing that this country can come together around, that we can hold hands shoulder to shoulder, because when people experiencing hunger win, we all do.",
      "NANCY CORDES: Claire Babineaux-Fontenot, we have to leave it there. We've got a hard out. But thank you so much, Claire Babineaux-Fontenot from Feeding America. Thank you so much.",

    "story": [
      "The following is the transcript of the interview with White House National Economic Council Director Kevin Hassett that aired on \"Face the Nation with Margaret Brennan\" on Nov. 30, 2025.",
      "NANCY CORDES: We turn now to the Director of the White House National Economic Council, Kevin Hassett. Kevin, thanks so much for being with us.",
      "KEVIN HASSETT, DIRECTOR NATIONAL ECONOMIC COUNCIL: Great to be here.",
      "NANCY CORDES: So we've all eaten the turkey. Holiday shopping has begun in earnest. So let's talk about what the holiday shopping season looks like. We've got new surveys from Goldman Sachs and Bank of America that paint a modest picture of the holiday spending outlook. They say low and middle income Americans are planning to pull back a little bit because they perceive that prices are higher. And they say if spending is up this year, it's going to be because goods, in part, are more expensive. Is this the temporary result or long term result of the Trump tariffs?",
      "HASSETT: Right. Well, what we've seen- those were reports about what people anticipated would happen over the Thanksgiving weekend, but we now have hard data for Black Friday and even for Saturday and the online sales were up almost 10%, in store sales were up 4%, it was really a blockbuster weekend after Thanksgiving. And so I think that the folks who are saying, wow, maybe people are going to be anxious about going back and getting presents for the kids and so on. They've been disproven this weekend. And I think the reason is that people- incomes are up this year. We had a great jobs report and with strong income and the government shut down over so that people presumably have a little pent up demand as well. I think that we're looking at a great recovery from a weak few weeks because of the shutdown.",
      "NANCY CORDES: Sure. I'm wondering how much of that spending increase you think is attributable to the fact that prices are up. Let me give you an example. The maker of Tonka Trucks said a couple days ago that a toy truck that cost $30 last year is going to cost $40 this year, partly because they lost about eight weeks of shipping due to the U.S. trade war with China. What's your advice to holiday shoppers who don't want to spend more this year than they did last year, or can't afford to spend more?",
      "HASSETT: Right. Well, as you know, it depends on what you're looking at. Like egg prices are down. Gasoline prices drop below $2 a gallon in a lot of places, mortgage rates are down--",
      "NANCY CORDES: --you mean below- gas prices on average are still at $3 a gallon.",
      "HASSETT: Yeah that's right for a few states they got below two. And so the point is just that- in the end, what matters is in the aggregate, the average across everything that everybody buys, and that averaged about 5% under Joe Biden, and is a little bit above two and a half percent- about cut in half for President Trump. And the bottom line, though, is really the wages have been growing faster than prices, and that's why real incomes this year are up by about $1,200 so far. That's why we could have a great Black Friday and a great Thanksgiving sales weekend because people feel like they have more money in their pockets. Even though you're right, there are some things that cost more, some things that cost less, but on average, we're about half the inflation rate of Joe Biden",
      "NANCY CORDES: Polls show that the public, despite some of the data you're presenting, is getting more skeptical. In our latest CBS News poll, 68% of Americans said they believe that President Trump's policies are pushing grocery prices up. They're up about 1.4% year to date. And economic sentiment, the number of people who think the economy is good, has actually dropped six points since he took office. How do you explain that?",
      "HASSETT: Well, first of all, you mentioned quite accurately, the 1.4% increase in grocery prices. I think the interesting thing about that is that that's way below the Fed's target of two for everything else, right? And so you'd have to concede that 1.4% is very, very low inflation. And so I think that the bottom line is that we've got the 'Big, Beautiful, Bill' cutting taxes on overtime, taxes for tips and so on, and all that money is going to start to be in people's pockets, and that's why they're optimistic about next year. Scott Bessent said last week that he's looking at first half of next year that could be in the 4% range. And the reason is that we passed the tax cuts in July, and so they didn't have time to change all the tax forms and everything. And so people are going to get really, really big refunds in the fall as well. And so we're really optimistic, and we think that the good news around Thanksgiving is a sign of something that's even stronger to come.",
      "NANCY CORDES: You mentioned purchasing power. One thing that is going to affect purchasing power for 22 million Americans is the expiration of Obamacare premium subsidies. Last week, a funny situation. The White House floated this plan to extend the subsidies for two years, then you dropped the proposal, and then the President said on Air Force One, somebody said I wanted to extend it for two years. I don't want to extend it for two years. I'd rather not extend them at all. Was this a case of the right hand not talking to the left hand?",
      "HASSETT: No, I think that people were talking to each other. But what happened as, you know, as a professional journalist, is that sometimes people leak pre-decisional things that are confidential and pre-decisional. And I think that somebody did that, and then it rolled back because it hadn't been through the whole process, but President Trump has been clear that he's very concerned about the cost of health care, and that's why we had $50 billion for rural hospitals in the 'Big, Beautiful, Bill,' why we tried to get $30 billion in for cost sharing. And the Democrats didn't like that. They had an alternative approach. And so I think that what we're going to see now, between now and Christmas, is that people are going to work- work this out, because we have a solution. The White House has a solution for cost- cost sharing, and the Democrats have an alternative. And, you know, people don't want for the few seniors that have really, really massive increases to see those. But don't forget, the vast majority of people in the Affordable Care Act are getting their insurance for less than $50 a month, and so- so while this is an issue that needs to be worked out, we don't want to cause panic for the folks who are worried that they're going to lose the thing that they have, it's really just the very, very high cost people who are closer to retirement age that have the problem.",
      "NANCY CORDES: Bloomberg is reporting, as I'm sure you know, that you are now considered the front runner to replace Fed Reserve Chair Jay Powell when his term expires in the spring. Secretary Bessent, who is heading up this search, said he was holding final interviews this week. How did yours go?",
      "HASSETT: You know, I am not sure that Bloomberg has the story right. I'm really honored to be amongst a group of really great candidates. The thing that I was most impressive about this week when that story leaked was that really, I think the news for markets was that President Trump is close to announcing a new person who is going to replace Jay Powell. And if you look at the market response to that, it was very, very positive. We had a great Treasury auction. Interest rates went down. And so I think that the American people could expect President Trump to pick somebody who's going to help them, you know, have cheaper car loans and easier access to mortgages at lower rates. And that's what we saw in the market response to the rumor about me, which, you know, is probably about as valuable as the rumor about the health care policy that we just talked about.",
      "NANCY CORDES: Well, I guess we'll find out if they're right sooner rather than later, when we hear the president's decision. So for now, Director of the White House, National Economic Council, that's your title today. Kevin Hassett, thank you so much.",
      "HASSETT: Thank you.",
      "NANCY CORDES: And we'll be back in a moment.",

      "NANCY CORDES: Welcome back to Face The Nation. We're joined by Virginia Democratic Senator Tim Kaine. Senator, thanks so much for being with us.",
      "SENATOR TIM KAINE: Absolutely, Nancy.",
      "NANCY CORDES: I want to start out by asking you about the situation in Venezuela, because there are now serious signs that military action, including potentially ground action, could be imminent. You have tried twice to pass war powers resolutions that would force President Trump to get approval from Congress first before any military action. Twice, you have failed. Do you think the numbers on this will change if there is ground action, and will it even matter at that point?",
      "SEN. KAINE: I d- I do believe the numbers will change. You're right, I along with others, filed a resolution, no war in Venezuela or against Venezuela without congressional approval. It failed, but that was before all of these assets have amassed around Venezuela, and before President Trump said that the airspace needs to be closed. I will move with colleagues, Senator Schumer, Senator Paul, Senator Schiff, immediately should there be military action. And then secondly, I also attempted to stop the, what I view as illegal boat strikes in the Caribbean and the Pacific together with Adam Schiff, and the circumstances have changed in the months since we had that vote. In each of these instances, we were able to get two Republicans to vote together with Democrats. We think the escalating pace and some of the recent revelations, so, for example, the recent revelation about the kill everyone order apparently dictated by Secretary Hegseth. We do believe that we will get more support for these motions when they are refiled.",
      "NANCY CORDES: You're referring to this new Washington Post report that says that Secretary Hegseth called for everyone aboard, the first suspected drug boat that was targeted, to be killed when two people survived. The military went back in, reportedly with a follow-on strike. What questions do you have for the Pentagon about that situation?",
      "SEN. KAINE: Well, first, if that reporting is true, it's a clear violation of the DOD's own laws of war, as well as international laws about the way you treat people who are in that circumstance. And so this rises to the level of a war crime if it's true. And the questions that we've been asking for months are give us the evidence that the folks on board were really narcotraffickers. In one instance, there were two survivors, one Colombian, one Ecuadoran in a different strike. Instead of arresting them and prosecuting them, the U.S. picked them up and returned them to their countries of origin where they were released. So if they were narcotraffickers, why would we do that? We need more evidence about that. And we definitely need the administration to finally answer the question of why strike rather than interdict. If you know where the ships are, you can interdict. And when you do, you get evidence. You get individuals. You can squeeze them to give testimony against their higher-ups. You get evidence with the drug seizures. And finally, the other question that my colleagues and I are deeply worried about is the entire legal rationale for the strikes. We had to pry with a crowbar after weeks and weeks out of the administration. The supposed legal rationale for the strikes in international waters, it was very shoddy. Because it's classified, I can't tell you what's in it. But I can tell you it was not at all persuasive that these are legal actions. And so together with a whole series of things, the early retirement of the head of SOUTHCOM, the news that the SOUTHCOM's lead attorney said the strikes were not lawful, the decision of allies like the U.K. to stop sharing intelligence with the United States in this area because they believe the strikes are illegal. It's time for Congress to rein in a president who is deciding to wage war on his own say so, which is not what the Constitution allows.",
      "NANCY CORDES: A lot of lawmakers on both sides have questions that are similar to the ones you're raising. On a related note, President Trump just announced this weekend that he plans to pardon former Honduras President Juan OrlandoHern\u00e1ndez, who was accused of conspiring with drug cartels to move 400 tons of cocaine from Honduras to the U.S. He's currently serving a 45-year sentence. Were you surprised by the President's plan to pardon him, given how strongly the President feels about drugs coming from other countries like Venezuela?\u00a0SEN. KAINE: This is shocking, and again, this is not an individual who was accused of running drugs to the United States. He was convicted in a federal court in the United States. One of the bits of evidence was his statement that was picked up by those near to him that he wanted to shove drugs up the nose of gringos and flood the United States with cocaine more than 400 tons. He was the leader of one of the largest criminal enterprises that has ever been subject to a conviction in U.S. courts, and less than one year into his sentence, President Trump is pardoning him, suggesting that President Trump cares nothing about narcotrafficking. Suggesting possibly that pardons are now for sale by this White House. And if he doesn't care about narcotrafficking, and this was also shown earlier this year with the pardoning of Ross Ulbricht, then what is this Venezuela thing really about? The President of Colombia has said that he thinks it's about the U.S. trying to seize oil assets in Venezuela. I lived in Honduras for a year as a missionary way back when. The conspiracy theories are running wild in the Americas about why this- this military effort is so important to the President when he's pardoning drug kingpins who are running drugs into the United States. These are also questions that we're going to have to dig deeply into when we return to Washington tomorrow.NANCY CORDES: I want to ask you about some big developments in Washington this week. The Trump administration is making big changes in the wake of this tragic shooting of two National Guard members. They are halting all asylum decisions. They are halting Afghan immigration applications. The President says he wants a permanent pause to immigration from what he calls \"third world countries,\" we don't know how many countries. Do they have a case that it makes sense to put some of these processes on hold while they figure out what happened here?",
      "SEN. KAINE: Well, you know, first, let's just acknowledge this sad fact, these two guards, members, Ms. Beckstrom andMr. Wolfe, what a tragedy for them and their families. And you know what? They should have been at home at Thanksgiving, celebrating Thanksgiving with their families, not deployed in a political deployment, to do law enforcement in D.C. that the D.C. police and other local law enforcement agencies can do. And this demonstrates, yet again, something we've seen so often our troops, including our guards members, they're going to serve in brave and courageous and self-sacrificing ways, and we can be so proud of them, but the orders that they get from their civilian leaders, that's where the problem comes in. Whether it's a Hegseth order to kill them all, or an order to send guardsmen and women in a political stunt deployment to cities around the country, these two individuals should have been celebrating Thanksgiving with their families, and I just mourn for them and all who suffer as a result. The President's decision to say, okay, this particular criminal who should be prosecuted to the full extent of the law, who came in under an asylum grant, that President Trump and his administration decided this past summer, that now we're going to pause processes or asylum from 19 quote \"third world countries\" you don't know which ones they are. You shouldn't paint with a broad brush. Go after a criminal to the full extent of the law. But don't say that all Afghans in the United States, those who served with our military and who lost their lives and their health and their families in many ways by doing so, don't say that they're all bad. Don't say that people who come from third world countries are bad. Virginia, about one out of nine of us is an immigrant, and our immigrant communities in Virginia have been an enormous source of strength to our commonwealth and to our country. And it's wrong to target them all for the bad actions of an individual, just like we wouldn't target- target other communities in the United States for the bad actions of one individual.NANCY CORDES: Something tells me this is going to be a big topic of Congress- of conversation rather, in Congress--SEN. KAINE: --It will--NANCY CORDES: --this week. Senator Kaine, I really appreciate you being with us, and Happy Thanksgiving.SEN. KAINE: So glad we could do it. Thanks.\u00a0NANCY CORDES: And we'll be right back.",

      "The following is the transcript of the interview with Rep. Mike Turner, Republican of Ohio, that aired on \"Face the Nation with Margaret Brennan\" on Nov. 30, 2025.",
      "NANCY CORDES: We're joined now by Ohio Republican Congressman Mike Turner. Congressman, thanks for being with us. Happy Thanksgiving.",
      "REP. MIKE TURNER: Thank you, Nancy. Happy Thanksgiving to you also.",
      "NANCY CORDES: So, you heard what Sam Vinograd just had to say about the vetting process. You've also heard what administration officials are saying about it. Do you believe that this was a failure of vetting, or do you believe this is someone who just became radicalized or became mentally disturbed here in the United States?",
      "REP. TURNER: This is very difficult, because, I mean, this is classic terrorism. And this is where an individual who tries to break the heart of a nation who doesn't enact a murderous act right before Thanksgiving and the- I think what Samantha is missing in all of this is that we didn't go to Afghanistan to bring Afghanis here. We went to Afghanistan to kill Osama bin Laden, to dismantle and destroy al-Qaeda, to avenge 9//11, to dismantle and to overthrow the Taliban and to ensure that Afghanistan was no longer a safe haven for terrorism. What occurred is that the Biden administration allowed Afghanistan to fall and fled, and in doing so, then found itself in a situation where those who had been aiding us were then at risk, and in doing so made the decision--",
      "NANCY CORDES:-- You don't think they would have been at risk either way?",
      "REP. TURNER: No, they were- their intention was that they would be still there. That Afghanistan would no longer be a safe haven for terrorists, that it would not be a return to the Taliban, and there would not be a need for those people to be evacuated. You wouldn't see American planes on the tarmac, as you showed with people running to try to get on them. By the way, those planes wouldn't be being chased by people if they were on their way to China or Russia, they were on their way to America, and those people were fleeing what the Biden administration was allowing to unfold, which is that it would once again be a nation that would be at risk to us. And so, you know, that's how you get to the situation where those individuals are at risk. Now, obviously the vetting was flawed. By your own report, you showed that individuals who were on our known terrorist watch list made it into this country through that process. So obviously that the vetting process\u2013",
      "NANCY CORDES:-- But then- then they were identified--",
      "REP. TURNER:-- but they made it in. They made it in, right? They made it into this country. So obviously the process was flawed, and it was also a process that should have been unnecessary, if there hadn't been this hasty fall of Afghanistan. In which the Biden administration had promised us all that they were not going to run for the exits. And they not only ran for the exits, they did so at night. You know, Congress was, you know, after hearing, after hearing, you know, raised the issues of the manner in which the Biden administration fled and what the consequences would be. And we're all living with this consequence now, the investigation is underway.",
      "NANCY CORDES: Weren't their hands tied in part by the fact that Trump had cut a deal with the Taliban promising to leave by a certain date?",
      "REP. TURNER: No, their hands were not tied. The manner in which they did so, and Congress did a number of investigations, at a number of hearings, and filed a number of reports that showed that it was the actions of the Biden administration, a manner in which they completely withdrew. But that investigation is underway. It's going to be underway as to this individual, and I think we all need to wait for that investigation to be concluded.",
      "NANCY CORDES: The President has called for 500 more National Guard troops to be sent to the nation's capital. Your state has already contributed 150. Do you believe that more troops being deployed is the answer, or do you think it's time to wind this deployment down?",
      "REP. TURNER: When you ask this, is that the answer? You have to first talk about what the question is, and the question is, is there a national issue of- of crime and safety? And certainly the American people, by all polls, indicate that people are experiencing it and report that there is. And certainly in the nation's capital, there has been- there has been unbelievable reports of just the- the criminal activity, though, the- those individuals who have succumbed to, you know, violent crime. And certainly, there's been a reporting that the National Guard presence has made a difference.",
      "NANCY CORDES: Right. No question, I think crime is down 30% something like that in DC in the last four months. I want to turn to Ukraine now, another issue very important to you. A team of Ukrainian negotiators is meeting right now in Miami with Secretary of State Marco Rubio, Special Envoy Steve Witkoff. What's your understanding of where the negotiations stand right now. There were concerns initially that the White House plan was too pro-Russia. Do you still have those concerns?",
      "REP. TURNER: Well, I think we all have those concerns. The- the- you know, the President's goal of peace is incredibly important, and we saw today with Secretary Rubio his statement of, you know, we have to have a strong and sovereign Ukraine, and I- and that's everyone's goal, and the- and certainly a prosperous Ukraine. And we saw the Ukrainian representative there, who is, you know, committed. And we certainly think, and I think everyone thinks that President Zelenskyy is committed to peace. But you know, one thing that I think everybody understands is that you can't have- you can't be America first and pro-Russia, because Russia has- is a self declared adversary of the United States. It's fielding new, advanced nuclear weapons that are specifically targeting the United States. It's constantly attacking the United States with offensive cyber. It continuously identifies both NATO and the West, the United States as its adversary. So in this and of course, when it identifies Ukraine as its adversary, it does so in identifying the West and the United States as its adversary. You have to understand that the balance of this- this peace arrangement has to be one where you have to look at Russia as a skeptical adversary.",
      "NANCY CORDES: Speaking of the question of being pro-Russian, this week, Bloomberg got a hold of this transcript of a call between Steve Witkoff, the special envoy, and a Putin advisor, in which Witkoff appeared to be coaching the Russian on how to win over President Trump. And there are several Republicans that have great concerns about that. Brian Fitzpatrick of Pennsylvania called it a major problem. Don Bacon of Nebraska said Witkoff fully favors the Russians and should be fired. What do you think?",
      "REP. TURNER: Well, the part that concerned me most is that there appeared to be an orchestration of giving Putin an opportunity to speak to Trump before President Zelensky was on his way to the White House. And I wouldn't want any orchestration of lessening President Zelenskyy's relationship with Trump, because it's very important when you have negotiations that, especially as you have, you know- in this instance Russia is being, you know, obviously, unbelievably murderous of the Ukrainian people. It is an aggressive authoritarian regime in this it's killing civilians. It is- it is not just this. Is not a military against military action. They are bombing into Ukraine and murderously killing civilians in Ukraine. The- the Ukrainian people are being subjected to this, and the President Trump needs to be able to hear Zelenskyy's voice clearly, and not just the authoritarian murderous Putin.",
      "NANCY CORDES: So given your concerns, should Witkoff continue to serve as one of the main US negotiators here and should he be sent by President Trump to Moscow this week to meet with Putin?",
      "REP. TURNER: I think you can't take just one slice of someone's conversation during a long, stretched out aspect of negotiations as reflective, but I think it's certainly important that when we do get that opportunity, that our voices are heard of caution and concern. And the orchestration of inserting Putin's voice before Zelenskyy is very concerning, and I think the White House should be very concerned about any efforts to orchestrate Putin's voice at the White House before Zelenskyy's because Ukraine's sovereignty and security needs to be preeminent. And we heard that this morning from Rubio, and that needs to be the focus.",
      "NANCY CORDES: President Trump said this was just regular deal making. I want to turn to Venezuela, because you're on the House Armed Services Committee. We've all been watching the military buildup in the waters around Venezuela. Just yesterday, the President said airlines should consider Venezuelan airspace closed. Do you take that to mean that a military operation is imminent?",
      "REP. TURNER: Well, the President did not say that, and the President certainly has not given Congress any notice that that is going to occur. And he certainly has not made the case. There is a buildup that the President has not explained in a way that relates solely to the actions that are currently going down in the Caribbean, and with respect to the drug trade that the President has been discussing with Congress, it is certainly a significant concern in Congress.",
      "NANCY CORDES: The Washington Post is reporting that before the strike on the very first suspected drug vote in September, Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth ordered that everyone on board be killed, and then when two of the 11 people on board survived, a follow-on strike was ordered to finish them off in the water. Now some law of war experts are saying that that was illegal, that killing people who are no longer able to fight is a war crime. What is your view and what questions do you have for the Pentagon?",
      "REP. TURNER: Congress does not have information that that had occurred. Both the chairman of the Senate Armed Services Committee, Chairman of the House Armed Services Committee, and ranking members have opened investigations. Obviously, if that occurred, that would be- be very serious, and I agree that- that- that would- would be an illegal act. That is not the legal opinion or the information or the legal justification, the acts that have been described to Congress that are being undertaken in- in this. There are very serious concerns in Congress about the attacks on the so-called drug boats down in the Caribbean and the Pacific, and the legal justification has been provided. But this is- is completely outside of anything that has been discussed with Congress, and there is an ongoing investigation.",
      "NANCY CORDES: Very interesting to hear you say that this might be an illegal act. I know your committee is asking more questions. We'd love to learn what you find out. Congressman Mike Turner of Ohio, thank you so much for being with us.",
      "REP. TURNER: I appreciate it.",
      "NANCY CORDES: And we'll be right back with a lot more Face the Nation. Stay with us.",

      "Good morning, and welcome to Face the Nation. Margaret is off today.",
      "As Thanksgiving weekend draws to a close, for some, the holiday shopping spree is officially under way, while others are braving the crowds at airports and on highways to get home.",
      "Here in Washington, a simmering debate over immigration and national security has boiled over following the shooting of two National Guard members.",
      "Our homeland security and justice correspondent, Nicole Sganga, is here with the latest.",
      "You have been out front on this story, Nicole. What's the latest?",
      "NICOLE SGANGA: The targeted attack just blocks away from the White House killed 20-year-old Army Specialist Sarah Beckstrom. This morning, Air Force Staff Sergeant Andrew Wolfe remains in critical condition, fighting for his life.",
      "Moments ago, Attorney General Pam Bondi and Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem said Rahmanullah Lakanwal may have been radicalized on American soil, but argued the attack was the consequence of failed vetting.",
      "(Begin VT)",
      "NICOLE SGANGA (voice-over): The investigation is under way. Intelligence analysts are now tasked with combing through the suspect's devices and online presence for signs of radicalization.",
      "So far, sources tell CBS News there have been no confirmed extremist ties. Rahmanullah Lakanwal served for eight years on a CIA-backed Zero Unit team, an Afghan paramilitary outfit notorious for intense combat and high-risk raids.",
      "U.S. and Afghan officials tell CBS News the suspect had been deeply disturbed by casualties in his unit and more recently troubled by the killing of his close friend by armed men in Pakistan. Lakanwal first entered the U.S. in 2021 under Operation Allies Welcome following the fall of Kabul.",
      "The 29-year-old was granted asylum in the U.S. this April. Now he faces first-degree murder charges. A 2025 Justice Department audit found only 55 evacuees arriving to the U.S. under the program were flagged by terrorism- screening databases. Last year, just nine remained on the watch list.",
      "This weekend, D.C. police accompanied National Guard on their street patrols. Governor Patrick Morrisey oversees West Virginia's National Guard.",

      "GOVERNOR PATRICK MORRISEY (R-West Virginia): I think people who question the mission should look at what's happened in Washington, D.C., and you had a city that had a lot of problems with crime, and there have been clear and meaningful reductions. I think that matters a lot.",
      "(End VT)",
      "NICOLE SGANGA: President Trump has ordered 500 more National Guard members to D.C., bringing the total to nearly 3,000 troops.",
      "And, on Friday, the U.S. directed immigration officers to pause all asylum decisions, leaving over two million applicants in limbo, Nancy.",
      "NANCY CORDES: Nicole Sganga, thank you so much for staying on top of this.",
      "And for more on the vetting of the suspect before he entered the country, we are joined now by Samantha Vinograd, who is a former top counterterrorism official at the Department of Homeland Security under President Biden and was deeply involved in the process for screening and vetting. She is now a national security contributor here at CBS News.",
      "Sam, so good to have you with us.",
      "Just this morning, the attorney general said that this suspect entered the U.S. with minimal to little vetting. Is that accurate?",
      "SAMANTHA VINOGRAD: Well, Nancy, I'm happy to talk about the vetting.",
      "But, at this point, we don't have indications that the horrific tragedy was a result of a vetting failure. Instead, the attorney general also said this morning it appears the individual was radicalized once here. And let's be clear on what the vetting system is and what it isn't.",
      "The vetting system is a system in which an individual's identifiers, their biographic information and biometric information, iris scans, fingerprints, facial images, are run against datasets of information about individuals with ties to terrorism and criminal history.",
      "The vetting system is not predictive of whether an individual with no derogatory information is or is not at some point going to become violent. What I can tell you is this. And I was involved in the process. Every Afghan evacuee underwent vetting overseas before they were cleared to be manifested for a flight to the United States.",
      "They underwent vetting once they were manifested for a flight at a port of entry before entering the United States. And then Afghan evacuees, including the suspect, were vetted again once in the U.S. by the Biden administration.",
      "And this suspect underwent the most comprehensive vetting under the current administration when he applied for asylum. That process would typically involve an interview and a review of social media handles.",
      "NANCY CORDES: OK, I hear what you're saying, but I want to read to you something that a DOJ inspector general report laid out earlier this year.",
      "They said that, when tens of thousands of Afghans arrived at once here in the U.S. at the end of the war \u2013 quote \u2013 \"The normal processes required to determine whether individuals posed a threat to national security and public safety were overtaken by the need to immediately evacuate and protect the lives of Afghans, increasing the potential that bad actors could try to exploit the expedited evacuation.\"",
      "Were there vetting corners that had to be cut here?",
      "SAMANTHA VINOGRAD: Well, during the Afghanistan withdrawal in the subsequent period, there were various priorities in place, certainly. We wanted to help our Afghan partners and bring at-risk Afghans here.",
      "But protecting national security and public safety was the foremost priority. And that's why a process was designed that vetted individuals overseas, but it was never intended to be a one-and-done. It was a multistage process with various U.S. government agencies.",
      "Afghan evacuees were vetted overseas by graphic and biometric vetting. And then there were other stages of vetting that occurred once individuals were here. So we have to put this vetting process in context.",
      "NANCY CORDES: Let's talk about this suspect specifically.",
      "What can you tell us about these so-called Zero Units that the suspect was a part of in Afghanistan? He worked with the CIA for years, right?",
      "SAMANTHA VINOGRAD: He did, which means that he was vetted by the CIA prior to beginning work in the Zero Unit, which was a paramilitary and intelligence force that partnered with the CIA incredibly closely on some very intense missions.",
      "So this suspect reportedly underwent vetting by the CIA for the first time over a decade ago. He had highly specialized training. He did undergo vetting at the time that he started working with the CIA and went on some very complex missions. These units were accused of certain human rights abuses.",
      "NANCY CORDES: And, as you pointed out, the attorney general did say this morning that it's believed that the shooter was radicalized here in the United States.",
      "The AP is now reporting that his behavior deteriorated so sharply in recent months that a community advocate was afraid that he was suicidal. Where does this investigation go from here?",
      "SAMANTHA VINOGRAD: Well, this horrific tragedy could be the result of an individual that quickly mobilized to violence without any ties to foreign terrorism. And as we have discussed in other cases, trying to find lone actors before they initiate an attack is harder than trying to find a needle in a haystack.",
      "That work, trying to find a lone actor who's mobilizing to violence quickly, involves intelligence, law enforcement, and counterterrorism officials here in the U.S., not vetting experts, but here in the U.S. at all levels of government, federal, state, and local, to try to find size \u2013 signs that an individual is mobilizing to violence and try to get them help before they actually initiate an attack.",
      "NANCY CORDES: When the president says that he wants to have everyone who came in here to the United States from Afghanistan, about 90,000 people, rescreened, reexamined, how would that work? And does DHS have the resources to do that?",
      "SAMANTHA VINOGRAD: Well, to be very clear, DHS is not the only entity involved in vetting. Various members of the counterterrorism, law enforcement, and intelligence community perform vetting.",
      "I do have questions about the number of resources available to engage in that exercise, just based upon resource constraints within the federal government. But it is possible. It will take time. But, to be clear, Afghan evacuees have been re-vetted since coming to the United States. They were re-vetted under the Biden administration.",
      "And then, as they have adjusted their status to asylum or other things, they had to go through already other vetting processes.",
      "NANCY CORDES: You know, you talk about this suspect and trying to find signs that he was radicalized. How will investigators go about doing that?",
      "SAMANTHA VINOGRAD: Well, investigators are certainly already speaking to individuals that knew the suspect, friends, family, co-workers, the organizations that helped support him in the community.",
      "And we don't yet know, Nancy, whether this individual was known to law enforcement in his community. I think we will learn that in the coming days.",
      "NANCY CORDES: Great insight.",
      "SAMANTHA VINOGRAD: Thanks, Nancy.",
      "NANCY CORDES: Sam Vinograd, CBS News contributor, thank you so much.",
      "SAMANTHA VINOGRAD: Thank you.",

      "(ANNOUNCEMENTS)",
      "NANCY CORDES: We're joined now by Ohio Republican Congressman Mike Turner.",
      "Congressman, thanks for being with us. Happy Thanksgiving.",
      "REPRESENTATIVE MIKE TURNER (R-Ohio): Thank you, Nancy. Happy Thanksgiving to you also.",
      "NANCY CORDES: So, you heard what Sam Vinograd just had to say about the vetting process. You've also heard what administration officials are saying about it.",
      "Do you believe that this was a failure of vetting, or do you believe this is someone who just became radicalized or became mentally disturbed here in the United States?",
      "REPRESENTATIVE MIKE TURNER: Nancy, this is very difficult, because, I mean, this is classic terrorism. And this is where an individual who tries to break the heart of a nation who does an act, a murderous act, right before Thanksgiving, and the \u2013 I think what Samantha is missing in all of this is that we didn't go to Afghanistan to bring Afghanis here.",
      "We went to Afghanistan to kill Osama bin Laden, to dismantle and destroy al Qaeda, to avenge 9/11, to dismantle and to overthrow the Taliban, and to ensure that Afghanistan was no longer a safe haven for terrorism.",
      "What occurred is that the Biden administration allowed Afghanistan to fall and fled, and, in doing so, then found itself in a situation where those who had been aiding us were then at risk, and in doing so made the decision\u2026",
      "NANCY CORDES: You don't think they would have been at risk either way?",
      "REPRESENTATIVE MIKE TURNER: No, they were \u2013 their intention was that they would be still there, that Afghanistan would no longer be a safe haven for terrorists, that it would not be returned to the Taliban, and there would not be a need for those people to be evacuated.",
      "You wouldn't see American planes on the tarmac, as you showed, with people running to try to get on them. By the way, those planes wouldn't be being chased by people if they were on their way to China or Russia. They were on their way to America, and those people were fleeing what the Biden administration was allowing to unfold, which is that it would once again be a nation that would be at risk to us.",
      "And so, you know, that's how you get to the situation where those individuals are at risk. Now, obviously, the vetting was flawed. By your own report, you showed that individuals who were on our known terrorist watch list made it into this country through that process, so, obviously, that the vetting process\u2026",
      "NANCY CORDES: But then they were \u2013 then they were identified\u2026",
      "(CROSSTALK)",
      "REPRESENTATIVE MIKE TURNER: But they made it in. They made it in, right?",
      "NANCY CORDES: Yes.",
      "REPRESENTATIVE MIKE TURNER: They made it into this country. So, obviously, the process was flawed, and it was also a process that should have been unnecessary, if there hadn't been this hasty fall of Afghanistan, which the Biden administration had promised us all that they were not going to run for the exits.",
      "And they not only ran for the exits. They did so at night. You know, Congress was \u2013 you know, after hearing, after hearing, you know, raised the issues of the manner in which the Biden administration fled and what the consequences would be. And we're all living with those consequences. Now, the investigation is under way.",
      "NANCY CORDES: Weren't their hands tied in part by the fact that Trump had cut a deal with the Taliban promising to leave by a certain date?",
      "REPRESENTATIVE MIKE TURNER: No, their hands were not tied. The manner in which they did so \u2013 and Congress did a number of investigations and a number of hearings and filed a number of reports that showed that it was the actions of the Biden administration, the manner in which they completely withdrew.",
      "But that investigation is under way. It's going to be underway as to this individual, and I think we all need to wait for that investigation to be concluded.",
      "NANCY CORDES: The president has called for 500 more National Guard troops to be sent to the nation's capital. Your state has already contributed 150.",
      "Do you believe that more troops being deployed is the answer, or do you think it's time to wind this deployment down?",
      "REPRESENTATIVE MIKE TURNER: Well, when you ask, is that the answer, you have to first talk about what the question is.",
      "And the question is, is there a national issue of \u2013 of crime and safety? And, certainly, the American people, by all polls, indicate that people are experiencing it and report that there is. And, certainly, in the nation's capital, there has been.",
      "There has been unbelievable reports of just the \u2013 the criminal activity, those \u2013 the \u2013 those individuals who have succumbed to, you know, violent crime. And, certainly, there's been a reporting that the National Guard presence has made a difference.",
      "NANCY CORDES: Right, no question, I think crime is down 30 percent, something like that, in D.C. in the last four months.",
      "I want to turn to Ukraine now\u2026",
      "REPRESENTATIVE MIKE TURNER: Yes.",
      "NANCY CORDES: \u2026 another issue very important to you.",
      "A team of Ukrainian negotiators is meeting right now in Miami with Secretary of State Marco Rubio, Special Envoy Steve Witkoff. What's your understanding of where the negotiations stand right now? There were concerns initially that the White House plan was too pro-Russia. Do you still have those concerns?",
      "REPRESENTATIVE MIKE TURNER: Well, I think we all have those concerns.",
      "The \u2013 the \u2013 you know, the president's goal of peace is incredibly important, and we saw today with Secretary Rubio his statement of, you know, we have to have a strong and sovereign Ukraine.",
      "And I \u2013 and that's everyone's goal and the \u2013 and certainly a prosperous Ukraine. And we saw the Ukrainian representative there, who is, you know, committed. And we certainly think and I think everyone thinks that President Zelenskyy is committed to peace.",
      "But, you know, one thing that I think everybody understands is that you can't have \u2013 you can't be America first and pro-Russia, because Russia has \u2013 is a self-declared adversary of the United States. It's fielding new advanced nuclear weapons that are specifically targeting the United States.",
      "It's constantly attacking the United States with offensive cyber. It continuously identifies both NATO and the West, the United States as its adversary. So, in this \u2013 and, of course, when it identifies Ukraine as its adversary, it does so in identifying the West and the United States as its adversary.",
      "You have to understand that the balance of this \u2013 this peace arrangement has to be one where you have to look at Russia as a skeptical adversary.",
      "NANCY CORDES: Speaking of the question of being pro-Russian, this week, Bloomberg got a hold of this transcript of a call between Steve Witkoff, the special envoy, and a Putin adviser, in which Witkoff appeared to be coaching the Russian on how to win over President Trump.",
      "And there are several Republicans that have great concerns about that. Brian Fitzpatrick of Pennsylvania called it a major problem. Don Bacon of Nebraska said Witkoff fully favors the Russians and should be fired.",
      "What do you think?",
      "REPRESENTATIVE MIKE TURNER: Well, the part that concerned me most is that there appeared to be an orchestration of giving Putin an opportunity to speak to Trump before President Zelenskyy was on his way to the White House.",
      "And I wouldn't want any orchestration of lessening President Zelenskyy's relationship with Trump, because it's very important when you have negotiations that \u2013 especially as you have, you know, in this instance, Russia is being, you know, obviously, unbelievably murderous of the Ukrainian people.",
      "It is an aggressive authoritarian regime in this. It's killing civilians. It is \u2013 it is not just \u2013 this is not a military-against-military action. They are bombing into Ukraine and murderously killing civilians in Ukraine.",
      "The \u2013 the Ukrainian people are being subjected to this, and the \u2013 President Trump needs to be able to hear Zelenskyy's voice clearly, and not just the authoritarian, murderous Putin.",
      "NANCY CORDES: So, given your concerns, should Witkoff continue to serve as one of the main U.S. negotiators here, and he \u2013 should he be sent by President Trump to Moscow this week to meet with Putin?",
      "REPRESENTATIVE MIKE TURNER: I \u2013 I think you can't take just one slice of someone's conversation during a long, stretched-out aspect of negotiations as reflective, but I think it's certainly important that, when we do get that opportunity, that our voices are heard of caution and concern.",
      "And the orchestration of inserting Putin's voice before Zelenskyy is very concerning, and I think the White House should be very concerned about any efforts to orchestrate Putin's voice at the White House before Zelenskyy's, because Ukraine's sovereignty and security needs to be preeminent.",
      "And we heard that this morning from Rubio, and that needs to be the focus.",
      "NANCY CORDES: And President Trump said this was just regular dealmaking.",
      "I want to turn to Venezuela, because you're on the House Armed Services Committee. We've all been watching the military buildup in the waters around Venezuela. Just yesterday, the president said airlines should consider Venezuelan airspace closed.",
      "Do you take that to mean that a military operation is imminent?",
      "REPRESENTATIVE MIKE TURNER: Well, the president did not say that, and the president certainly has not given Congress any notice that that is going to occur.",
      "And he certainly has not made the case. There is a buildup that the president has not explained in a way that relates solely to the actions that are currently going down in the Caribbean and with respect to the drug trade that the president has been discussing with Congress. It is certainly a significant concern in Congress.",
      "NANCY CORDES: \"The Washington Post\" is reporting that, before the strike on the very first suspected drug boat in September, Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth ordered that everyone on board be killed, and then, when two of the 11 people on board survived, a follow-on strike was ordered to finish them off in the water.",
      "Now, some law of war experts are saying that that was illegal, that killing people who are no longer able to fight is a war crime. What is your view and what questions do you have for the Pentagon?",
      "REPRESENTATIVE MIKE TURNER: Congress does not have information that that had occurred. Both the chairman of the Senate Armed Services Committee, chairman of the House Armed Services Committee, and ranking members have opened investigations.",
      "Obviously, if that occurred, that would be \u2013 be very serious, and I agree that that would \u2013 would be an illegal act. That is not the legal opinion or the information or the legal justification, the acts that have been described to Congress that are being undertaken in \u2013 in this.",
      "There are very serious concerns in Congress about the attacks on the so- called drug boats down in the Caribbean and the Pacific, and the legal justification has been provided. But this is \u2013 is completely outside of anything that has been discussed with Congress, and there is an ongoing investigation.",
      "NANCY CORDES: Very interesting to hear you say that this might be an illegal act. I know your committee is asking more questions. We'd love to learn what you find out.",
      "Congressman Mike Turner of Ohio, thank you so much for being with us.",
      "REPRESENTATIVE MIKE TURNER: Thank you, Nancy.",

      "Stay with us.",
      "(ANNOUNCEMENTS)",
      "NANCY CORDES: Welcome back to \"FACE THE NATION.\"",
      "We're joined by Virginia Democratic Senator Tim Kaine.",
      "Senator, thanks so much for being with us.",
      "SENATOR TIM KAINE (D-VA): Absolutely, Nancy.",
      "NANCY CORDES: I want to start out by asking you about the situation in Venezuela because there are now serious signs that military action, including potentially ground action, could be imminent. You have tried twice to pass war powers resolutions that would force President Trump to get approval from Congress first before any military action. Twice you have failed. Do you think the numbers on this will change if there is ground action and will it even matter at that point?",
      "SENATOR TIM KAINE: I do \u2013 I do believe the numbers will change. You're right, I, along with others, filed a resolution, no war in Venezuela or against Venezuela without congressional approval. It failed. But that was before all of these assets have amassed around Venezuela and before President Trump said that the airspace needs to be closed. I will move with colleagues, Senator Schumer, Senator Paul, Senator Schiff, immediately should there be military action.",
      "And then secondly, I also attempted to stop the, what I view as illegal boat strikes in the Caribbean and the Pacific, together with Adam Schiff. And the circumstances have changed in the months since we had that vote. In each of these instances, we were able to get two Republicans to vote together with Democrats. We think the escalating pace and some of the recent revelations, so, for example, the recent revelation about the kill everyone order apparently dictated by Secretary Hegseth, we do believe that we will get more support for these motions when they are refiled.",
      "NANCY CORDES: You're referring to this new \"Washington Post\" report that says that Secretary Hegseth called for everyone aboard the first suspected drug boat that was targeted to be killed. When two people survived, the military went back in, reportedly, with a follow-on strike.",
      "What questions do you have for the Pentagon about that situation?",
      "SENATOR TIM KAINE: Well, first, if that reporting is true, it's a clear violation of the DOD's own laws of war, as well as international laws about the way you treat people who are in that circumstance. And so this rises to the level of a war crime if it's true. And the questions that we've been asking for months are, give us the evidence that the folks on board were really narco traffickers. In one instance, there were two survivors, one Columbian, one Ecuadorian in a different strike. Instead of arresting them and prosecuting them, the U.S. picked them up and returned them to their countries of origin, where they were released. So, if they were narco traffickers, why would we do that? We need more evidence about that. And we definitely need the administration to finally answer the question of why strike rather than interdict? If you know where the ships are, you can interdict. And when you do, you get evidence. You get individuals. You can squeeze them to give testimony against their higher ups. You get evidence with the drug seizures.",
      "And finally, the other question that my colleagues and I are deeply worried about, is the entire legal rationale for these strikes. We had to pry with a crowbar, after weeks and weeks, out of the administration the supposed legal rationale for the strikes in international waters. It was very shoddy because it's classified. I can't tell you what's in it, but I can tell you it was not at all persuasive that these are legal actions. And so together with a whole series of things, the early retirement of the head of SOUTHCOM, the news that the SOUTHCOM's lead attorney said these strikes were not lawful, the decision of allies, like the U.K., to stop sharing intelligence with the United States in this area because they believe the strikes are illegal. It's time for Congress to reign in a president who is deciding to wage war on his own say so, which is not what the Constitution allows.",
      "NANCY CORDES: Yes, a lot of lawmakers on both sides have questions that are similar to the ones you're raising.",
      "On a related note, President Trump just announced this weekend that he plans to pardon former Honduras President Juan Orlando Hernandez, who was accused of conspiring with drug cartels to move 400 tons of cocaine from Honduras to the U.S. he's currently serving a 45-year sentence. Were you surprised by the president's plan to pardon him given how strongly the president feels about drugs coming from other countries like Venezuela?",
      "SENATOR TIM KAINE: This is shocking. And again, this is not an individual who was accused of running drugs to the United States. He was convicted in a federal court in the United States. One of the bits of evidence was his statement that was picked up by those near to him that he wanted to shove drugs up the nose of gringos and flood the United States with cocaine. More than 400 tons.",
      "He was the leader of one of the largest criminal enterprises that has ever been subject to a conviction in U.S. courts. And less than one year into his sentence, President Trump is pardoning him, suggesting that President Trump cares nothing about narco trafficking. Suggesting possibly that pardons are now for sale by this White House. And if he doesn't care about narco trafficking, and this was also shown earlier this year with the pardoning of Ross Ulbricht, then what is this Venezuela thing really about?",
      "The president of Columbia has said that he think it's about the U.S. trying to seize oil assets in Venezuela. I lived in Honduras for years as a missionary way back when. The conspiracy theories are running wild in the Americas about why this military effort is so important to the president when he's pardoning drug kingpins who are running drugs into the United States. These are also questions that we're going to have to dig deeply into when we return to Washington tomorrow.",
      "NANCY CORDES: I want to ask you about some big developments in Washington this week. The Trump administration is making big changes in the wake of this tragic shooting of two National Guard members. They are halting all asylum decisions. They are halting Afghan immigration applications. The president says he wants a permanent pause to immigration from what he calls third world countries. We don't know how many countries. Do they have a case that it makes sense to put some of these processes on hold while they figure out what happened here?",
      "SENATOR TIM KAINE: Well, you know, first, let's just acknowledge this sad fact. These two Guards members, Ms. Beckstrom and Mr. Wolfe. What a tragedy for them and their families. And you know what? They should have been at home at Thanksgiving celebrating Thanksgiving with their families, not deployed in a political deployment to do law enforcement in D.C. that the D.C. police and other local law enforcement agencies can do.",
      "And this demonstrates yet again something we've seen so often. Our troops, including our Guards members, they're going to serve in brave and courageous and self-sacrificing ways. And we can about so proud of them.",
      "But the orders that they get from their civilian leaders, that's where the problem comes in. Whether it's a Hegseth order to kill them all or an order to send Guards men and women, in a political stunt deployment to cities around the country, these two individuals should have been celebrating Thanksgiving with their families. And I just mourn for them and all who suffer as a result.",
      "The president's decision to say, OK, this particular criminal, who should be prosecuted to the full extent of the law, who came in under an asylum grant that President Trump and his administration decided this past summer, that now we're going to pause processes or asylum from 19, quote, \"third world countries,\" we don't know which ones they are, you shouldn't paint with a broad brush. Go after a criminal to the full extent of the law, but don't say that all Afghans in the United States, those who served with our military and who lost their lives and their health and their families in many ways by doing so, don't say that they're all bad. Don't say that people who come from third-world countries are bad.",
      "Virginia, about one out of nine of us is an immigrant. And our immigrant communities in Virginia have been an enormous source of strength to our commonwealth and to our country. And it's wrong to target them all for the bad actions of an individual, just like we wouldn't target other communities in the United States for the bad actions of one individual.",
      "NANCY CORDES: Something tells me this is going to be a big topic of conversation in Congress this week.",
      "SENATOR TIM KAINE: It will.",
      "NANCY CORDES: Senator Kaine, I really appreciate you being with us and Happy Thanksgiving.",
      "SENATOR TIM KAINE: So glad we could do it. Thanks.",
      "NANCY CORDES: And we'll be right back.",
      "(ANNOUNCEMENTS)",
      "NANCY CORDES: We turn now to the director of the White House National Economic Council, Kevin Hassett.",
      "Kevin, thanks so much for being with us.",
      "KEVIN HASSETT (Director, White House National Economic Council): Great to be here.",
      "NANCY CORDES: So, we've all eaten the turkey.",
      "KEVIN HASSETT: Yes.",
      "NANCY CORDES: Holiday shopping has begun in earnest. So, let's talk about what the holiday shopping season looks like. We've got new surveys from Goldman Sachs and Bank of America that paint a modest picture of the holiday spending outlook. They say low and middle income Americans are planning to pull back a little bit because they perceive that prices are higher. And they say, if spending is up this year, it's going to be because goods in part are more expensive. Is this the temporary result or long-term result of the Trump tariffs?",
      "KEVIN HASSETT: Right. Well, what we've seen \u2013 those were reports about what people anticipated would happen over the Thanksgiving weekend. But we now have hard data for Black Friday and even for Saturday. And the online sales were up almost 10 percent, in-store sales were up four percent. It was really a blockbuster weekend after Thanksgiving.",
      "And so I think that the folks who were saying, wow, maybe people are going to be anxious about, you know, going back and getting presents for the kids and so on, they've been disproven this weekend. And I think the reason is that people \u2013 incomes are up this year. We had a great jobs report. And with strong income and the government shutdown over so that people presumably have a little pent-up demand as well, I think that we're looking at a great recovery from a weak few weeks because of the shutdown.",
      "NANCY CORDES: Sure. I'm wondering how much of that spending increase you think is attributable to the fact that prices are up? Let me give you an example. The maker of Tonka trucks said a couple of days ago that a toy truck that cost $30 last year is going to cost $40 this year, partly because they lost about eight weeks of shipping due to the U.S. trade war with China.",
      "What's your advice to holiday shoppers who don't want to spend more this year than they did last year, or can't afford to spend more?",
      "KEVIN HASSETT: Right. Well, as you know, it depends on what you're looking at. Like, egg prices are down. Gasoline prices dropped below $2 a gallon in a lot of places. Mortgage rates are down.",
      "NANCY CORDES: You mean below \u2013",
      "KEVIN HASSETT: Yes, mortgage rates are down.",
      "NANCY CORDES: Gas prices, on average, are still at $3 a gallon across the country, right?",
      "KEVIN HASSETT: Yes, that's right. For a few states, they got \u2013 they got below $2. And so the point is just that, in the end, what matters is, in the aggregate, the average across everything that everybody buys. And that averaged about 5 percent under Joe Biden and is a little bit above 2.5 percent, about cut in half for President Trump.",
      "And the bottom line, though, is really that wages have been growing faster than prices, and that's why real incomes this year are up by about $1,200 so far. That's why we can have a great Black Friday and a great Thanksgiving sales weekend because people feel like they have more money in their pockets. Even though, you're right, there are some things that cost most and some things that cost less. But on average, we're about half the inflation rate of Joe Biden.",
      "NANCY CORDES: Polls show that the public, despite some of the data you're presenting, is getting more skeptical. In our latest CBS News poll, 68 percent of Americans said they believe that President Trump's policies are pushing grocery prices up. They're up about 1.4 percent year to date. And economic sentiment, the number of people who think the economy is good, has actually dropped six points since he took office.",
      "How do you explain that?",
      "KEVIN HASSETT: Well, first of all, you mentioned, quite accurately, the 1.4 percent increase in grocery prices. I think the interesting thing about that is that that's way below the Fed's target of two for everything else, right? And so you'd have to concede that 1.4 percent is very, very low inflation.",
      "And so I think that the bottom line is that we've got the big, beautiful bill cutting taxes on overtime, taxes for tips and so on. And all that money is going to start to be in people's pockets. And that's why they're optimistic about next year.",
      "Scott Bessent said last week that he's looking at the first half of next year that could be in the four percent range. And the reason is that we passed the tax cuts in July and so they didn't have time to change all the tax forms and everything. And so people are going to get really, really big refunds in the fall as well.",
      "And so we're really optimistic. And we think that the good news around Thanksgiving is a sign of something that's even stronger to come.",
      "NANCY CORDES: You mentioned purchasing power. One thing that is going to affect purchasing power for 22 million Americans is the expiration of Obamacare premium subsidies. Last week a funny situation. The White House floated this plan to extend the subsidies for two years. Then you dropped the proposal. And then the president said, on Air Force One, \"somebody said I wanted to extend it for two years. I don't want to extend it for two years. I'd rather not extend them at all.\"",
      "Was this a case of the right hand not talking to the left hand?",
      "KEVIN HASSETT: No, I think that people were talking to each other. But what happened, as you know, as a professional journalist, is that sometimes people leak pre-decisional things that are confidential and pre-decisional. And I think that somebody did that. And then it rolled back because it hadn't been through the whole process.",
      "But President Trump has been clear that he's very concerned about the cost of health care. And that's why we had $50 million for rural hospitals in big, beautiful bill, why we tried to get $30 billion in for cost sharing and the Democrats didn't like that. They had an alternative approach.",
      "And so, I think that what we're going to see now, between now and Christmas, is that people are going to work this out because we have a solution \u2013 the White House has a solution for cost sharing and the Democrats have an alternative. And, you know, people don't want \u2013 you know, for the few seniors that have really, really massive increases to see those.",
      "But don't forget, the vast majority of people in the Affordable Care Act are getting their insurance for less than $50 a month. And so while this is an issue that needs to be worked out, we don't want to cause panic for the folks who are worried that they're going to lose the thing that they have. It's really just the very, very high cost people who are, you know, closer to retirement age that have the problem.",
      "NANCY CORDES: \"Bloomberg\" is reporting, as I'm sure you know, that you are now considered the frontrunner to replace Fed Reserve Chair Jay Powell when his term expires in the spring. Secretary Bessent, who is heading up this search, said he was holding final interviews this week. How did yours go?",
      "KEVIN HASSETT: You know, I am not sure that \"Bloomberg\" has the story right. I'm really honored to be amongst a group of really great candidates. The thing that I was most impressed about this week when that story leaked was that really I think the news for markets was that President Trump is close to announcing a new person who's going to replace Jay Powell. And if you look at the market response to that, it was very, very positive. We had a great Treasury auction. Interest rates went down.",
      "And so, I think that the American people could expect President Trump to pick somebody who's going to help them, you know, have cheaper car loans and easier access to mortgages at lower rates. And that's what we saw in the market response to the rumor about me, which, you know, is probably about as valuable as the rumor about the health care policy that we just talked about.",
      "NANCY CORDES: Well, I guess we'll find out if they're right, sooner rather than later, when we hear the president's decision.",
      "KEVIN HASSETT: Right. That's true.",
      "NANCY CORDES: So, for now, director of the White House National Economic Council, that's your title today, Kevin Hassett, thank you so much.",

      "Claire, thanks so much for being with us and Happy Thanksgiving.",
      "CLAIRE BABINEAUX-FONTENOT (CEO, Feeding America): Thanks for having me back.",
      "NANCY CORDES: Absolutely.",
      "So, during the shutdown, we saw these incredibly long lines at food banks. The shutdown has now been over for a couple of weeks. SNAP benefits are going out again. But even before the shutdown, food insecurity was at its highest rate in nearly a decade. So, what is the situation now that you're seeing at food banks around the country as we head into the holidays?",
      "CLAIRE BABINEAUX-FONTENOT: Yes. So, I'm so glad that you made that point. I think your viewers may be surprised to learn that food insecurity rates before the shutdown were higher than at any point during the pandemic as an example.",
      "We're continuing to see very high demand. I think part of the reason is because the fastest growing group of people turning to the charitable food system are people who don't even qualify for any federal nutrition programs. So, this is an area that we've got to stay focused on. We know the kinds of things that work. We need to do those things so that we can really address what's happening with hunger and poverty in the country.",
      "NANCY CORDES: What do you think is contributing to the rise in hunger and this group of people who, as you say, don't qualify for benefits but are showing an increased need for food?",
      "CLAIRE BABINEAUX-FONTENOT: Yes, I think it's that the system is broken. Right now there's so many people, if you can imagine, in this country who can't afford to get a raise at work because we have a system that does not incentivize people to continue to move up the ladder. We've got ladders with big \u2013 missing rungs, if you will. So, we can do something about that. We could have a sliding scale, for instance, that allows people to move out of poverty. By doing that, because food insecurity is actually a symptom of poverty, they'll move out of that as well.",
      "We, as a nation, should all want people to be able to provide for themselves. We should all want them to be able to get work that they can feel proud of and support their families with. We have the power to do all of those things. It will require that we work together, that we be honest about what's broken, and that we really get committed about fixing those things.",
      "NANCY CORDES: What are the main challenges that the organizations in your network are facing this holiday season as they try to feed people who are hungry? Is the food there for the people who need it?",
      "CLAIRE BABINEAUX-FONTENOT: Yes, unfortunately, the lines are longer than the food that is available. And one of the hardest things to witness will be seeing these people who have the same dreams, aspirations for their kids and themselves as I have for mine, and all of your viewers have for theirs, feeling the need to turn to the charitable food system. It takes a lot of courage and resiliency and commitment to family off times to be able to do that. And then for them to turn up, in spite of all of those barriers and not \u2013 us not be able to provide them with what they really need.",
      "So, I have a deep respect for people experiencing hunger in this country. I have been a person who has experienced hunger before. I know many people who have, many people who still do. So many of them are my heroes.",
      "And then another set of heroes that I have are people working in this fight in the Feeding America network who show up, shoulder to shoulder with people experiencing hunger, who are so deeply committed to their wellbeing. So, we need to position people experiencing hunger to be able to fend for themselves, and we need to position food banks to be able to provide them with the support that they need in this moment until they get there.",
      "NANCY CORDES: As you know, there are about two million Americans who are going to be affected by changes to the SNAP program that were made earlier this year in a vote by Congress. They will not be receiving SNAP benefits any longer. What are the economic implications of that? And in about 30 seconds, what can your organizations do about it?",
      "CLAIRE BABINEAUX-FONTENOT: According to the Congressional Budget Office, we're probably looking at about a six billion meal per year gap that's going to be created. So, the kinds of things that we ought to do, we ought to address fraud where it exists. We ought to incentivize people to be able to get the hand up that they need and to move out of poverty. We ought to address error rates. But we ought to do all of these things strategically, and we ought to do them in a bipartisan way. This ought to be the kind of thing that this country can come together around.",
      "NANCY CORDES: OK.",
      "CLAIRE BABINEAUX-FONTENOT: And we can hold hands, shoulder to shoulder, because when \u2013 people experiencing hunger when we all do.",
      "NANCY CORDES: Claire Babineaux-Fontenot, we have to leave it there. We've got a hard out. But thank you so much, Claire Babineaux-Fontenot from Feeding America. Thank you so much.",
      "We'll be right back.",

    "story": [
      "Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem claimed Sunday that the suspect in the shooting of two National Guard members near the White House last week was \"radicalized since he's been here in this country\" after arriving in Sept. 2021 from Afghanistan.",
      "Officials have said the suspect, Rahmanullah Lakanwal, an Afghan national, entered the U.S. as part of Operation Allies Welcome after the chaotic U.S. withdrawal from Afghanistan. Lakanwal was granted asylum by the Trump administration earlier this year. The CIA said Thursday that Lakanwal previously worked with the U.S. government, including the CIA, as a member of a partner force in Kandahar that ended in 2021 following the U.S. withdrawal from Afghanistan.",
      "Since Wednesday's shooting, the Trump administration has ordered all asylum applications paused, according to an internal directive obtained by CBS News and two sources familiar with the order.",
      "\"We do believe it was through connections in his home community and state, and we're going to continue to talk to those who interacted with him,\" Noem said Sunday on NBC's \"Meet the Press.\" She provided no further details.",
      "On Wednesday, a gunman opened fire near the White House on National Guard members stationed in Washington. One of the victims, Army Spc. Sarah Beckstrom, 20, died Thursday, while the other, Air Force Staff Sgt. Andrew Wolfe, 24, remains hospitalized.",
      "The suspect was shot by a National Guard member and is also hospitalized. U.S. Attorney Jeanine Pirro said he faces murder charges.",
      "On ABC's \"This Week,\" Noem suggested the suspect was not thoroughly vetted before he came to the U.S.",
      "\"What they did was check a few names and a few data points,\" Noem alleged. \"But what President Trump has put in place now for vetting is biometric information, checking social media platforms, communications, contacts, matching updates of service that was never done under Joe Biden. He didn't do that. In fact, he brought people to this country and then just said, well, we'll vet them later.\"",
      "The White House has blamed policies of former President Joe Biden's administration for allowing Lakanwal to enter the U.S. Samantha Vinograd, a top counterterrorism official in the Obama administration and a current CBS News contributor, said Sunday on \"Face the Nation with Margaret Brennan\" that there are no indications the \"horrific tragedy was a result of a vetting failure.\"",
      "\"Let's be clear on what the vetting system is and it isn't,\" Vinograd said. \"The vetting system is a system in which an individual's identifiers \u2014 their biographic information, iris scans, fingerprints, facial images \u2014 are run against data sets of information about individuals with ties to terrorism and criminal history. The vetting system is not predicative of whether an individual with no derogatory information is or is not going to become violent.\"",
      "Vinograd said every Afghan refugee underwent vetting overseas before being cleared to enter the U.S., and then they were vetted again by the Biden administration. The suspect in last week's shooting also underwent the \"most comprehensive vetting\" under the Trump administration to receive asylum, Vinograd added.",
      "Since the shooting, the White House has put in place a number of restrictive immigration policies. On Thursday, the U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services director ordered, at Mr. Trump's direction, a \"full scale, rigorous reexamination\" of green card cases involving nationals affected by a presidential proclamation that fully or partially suspended travel and immigration from 19 countries.",

      "In a statement released Saturday \u2014 in response to the message posted earlier by Mr. Trump \u2014 Venezuela's government demanded \"unrestricted respect\" for its airspace. \"Such statements constitute a hostile, unilateral, and arbitrary act, incompatible with the most basic principles of international law, and are part of a permanent policy of aggression against our country,\" the Venezuelan government release read in part.",
      "Mr. Trump had said in a\u00a0Truth Social post\u00a0that all airlines, pilots, drug dealers, and human traffickers should consider the airspace \"above and surrounding\" the South American nation as \"closed in its entirety\" \u2014 an assertion that appeared to signal further\u00a0U.S. pressure on Venezuelan leader Nicol\u00e1s Maduro.",
      "The White House did not respond to questions about Mr. Trump's post, and it was unclear whether he was announcing a new policy or simply reinforcing the messaging around his\u00a0campaign against Maduro, which has involved\u00a0multiple strikes\u00a0in the Caribbean Sea and eastern Pacific Ocean on small boats accused of ferrying drugs as well as a\u00a0buildup of naval forces\u00a0in the region.",
      "More than 80 people have been killed in such strikes since early September.",
      "International airlines last week began to cancel flights to Venezuela after the Federal Aviation Administration told pilots to be cautious flying around the country because of heightened military activity. Three U.S. airlines that regularly fly over Venezuela airspace confirmed to CBS News earlier this month that they had not been using the country's airspace for a while.",
      "The FAA's jurisdiction is generally limited to the United States and its territories. The agency does routinely warn pilots about the dangers of flying over areas with ongoing conflicts or military activity around the globe, as it did earlier this month with Venezuela. The agency, which works with other countries and the International Civil Aviation Organization on international issues, urged civilian aircraft in Venezuelan airspace to \"exercise caution\" due to the \"worsening security situation and heightened military activity in or around Venezuela.\"",
      "\"No authority outside the Venezuelan institutionality has the power to interfere, block or condition the use of national airspace,\" the Venezuelan government said in its statement Saturday, citing ICAO rules. It also said that flights that were part of a plan to repatriate Venezuelan migrants had been \"unilaterally suspended\" as a result of U.S. actions.",
      "The FAA and ICAO did not immediately respond to requests for comment Saturday.",
      "The Trump administration has sought to ratchet up pressure on Maduro. The U.S. government does not view Maduro as the legitimate leader of the oil-rich but increasingly impoverished South American nation and he faces charges of narcoterrorism in the U.S.",

The Ford rounds off the largest buildup of U.S. firepower in the region in generations.

      "The move is the administration's latest effort to tighten the American immigration system after Wednesday's attack, which was allegedly carried out by an Afghan man who was granted asylum by U.S. immigration officials earlier this year.",
      "Asylum officers at USCIS, a branch of the Department of Homeland Security, were instructed to refrain from approving, denying or closing asylum applications received by the agency, according to the internal notice and sources, who requested anonymity to describe an action that has not been publicly announced.",
      "On Thursday, the Trump administration said it would start a review of asylum approvals under the Biden administration, citing the shooting of the two National Guard members, one of whom has died. The man accused of shooting the soldiers, Rahmanullah Lakanwal, is an Afghan national who entered the U.S. in 2021 during former President Joe Biden's presidency and was granted asylum this spring under the second Trump administration.",
      "The action relayed to USCIS asylum officers internally on Friday amounts to an indefinite pause on asylum adjudications for all nationalities. Asylum cases are filed by foreigners who claim they will suffer persecution if deported or returned to their home countries because of certain factors, including their race, nationality, religion or political views.",
      "\"Do not enter any decision information for affirmative cases,\" a USCIS notice to asylum officers in one office read, referring to asylum cases overseen by the agency. \"Defensive\" cases, the other type of asylum applications, are filed by those facing deportation and are decided by federal immigration judges at the Justice Department.",
      "Officers were told the pause applied to all USCIS asylum cases, including those filed by Afghans who arrived under a Biden administration resettlement effort dubbed \"Operation Allies Welcome.\" They were also told that in-person appointments for asylum applicants to find out what decisions have been made on their cases would be canceled, at least for Monday.",
      "The guidance said officers could continue asylum application interviews and review cases up to the point of making a decision. \"Once you've reached decision entry, stop and hold,\" the directive said.",
      "In a statement to CBS News Friday, USCIS Director Joseph Edlow confirmed CBS News' reporting.",
      "\"USCIS has halted all asylum decisions until we can ensure that every alien is vetted and screened to the maximum degree possible,\" Edlow said. \"The safety of the American people always comes first.\"",
      "According to Homeland Security officials, Lakanwal was allowed to enter the U.S. in September 2021 through the humanitarian parole policy, which the Biden administration used to resettle tens of thousands of Afghans evacuated following the Taliban takeover of Afghanistan. He applied for asylum in 2024 and his application was granted earlier this year, the officials said.",
      "Following Wednesday's shooting, the Trump administration has unveiled a series of immigration measures it argues will bolster the government's ability to mitigate the chances of similar attacks.",
      "Officials first announced an indefinite pause on the processing of all legal immigration applications \u2014 ranging from citizenship and green card cases, to requests for work permits and asylum \u2014 filed by applicants from Afghanistan.",
      "Edlow, the USCIS director, then\u00a0announced he had ordered, at President Trump's direction, a \"full scale, rigorous reexamination\" of green card cases involving nationals affected by a presidential proclamation that fully or partially suspended travel and immigration from 19 countries. That list, released in June and which the White House referred to as a \"travel ban,\" includes Afghanistan and other countries in Asia and the Middle East, such as Iran, as well as African nations, including Somalia and Sudan. Mr. Trump's order also applies to nationals of Cuba, Haiti and Venezuela.",
      "USCIS published a policy Thursday that allows adjudicators to cite concerns about the inability to properly vet and identify green card applicants from the group of 19 countries as a potential reason to deny their cases.",
      "\"Certain countries (including but not limited to Afghanistan, Eritrea, Libya, Somalia, Sudan, Yemen, and Venezuela) lack a competent or central authority for issuing passports and civil documents among other concerns, which directly relates to USCIS' ability to meaningfully assess eligibility for benefit requests including identity, and therefore whether an alien warrants a favorable exercise of discretion,\" USCIS said in its guidance.",
      "Late Thursday, Mr. Trump vowed to \"permanently pause migration from all Third World Countries,\" writing on Truth Social that his administration would revoke the citizenship of those it deems \"undermine domestic tranquility\" and deport any foreigner \"who is a public charge, security risk, or non-compatible with Western Civilization.\"",

      "According to the military's Joint Task Force \u2013 District of Columbia, there are 180 West Virginia Guard members deployed in D.C. as of Friday. They are among about 1,300 out-of-state Guard troops that were dispatched to D.C. as part of the Trump administration's efforts to crack down on crime in the city.",
      "Although Mr. Trump\u00a0has ordered\u00a0an additional 500 Guard personnel to D.C. in response to the shooting, Morrisey repeatedly sidestepped questions on whether West Virginia troops would join that surge.",
      "And though he expressed openness towards it, Morrisey said he will not pre-judge future deployment decisions, and avoided committing additional units.",
      "\"Right now, I'm focusing on the families, the guardsmen, and healing,\" the governor said. \"As time evolves, I'll keep talking with Guard leadership to make the right call.\"",
      "Still, he insisted the mission continues and should not be abandoned in the wake of the shooting.",
      "\"When evildoers come in and commit heinous acts, we can't back down,\" Morrisey said. \"That's exactly what they want.\"",
      "The suspect now faces charges of first degree murder. The former West Virginia attorney general told CBS News that the death penalty should remain \"on the table.\"",
      "Twenty-year-old Army Spc. Sarah Beckstrom was killed in Wednesday's shooting, and 24-year-old Air Force Staff Sgt. Andrew Wolfe was critically wounded.",
      "Morrisey, who met Beckstrom's parents at the hospital following her death, described the young soldier as deeply respected among her unit \u2014 someone whose presence \"brought positive energy to every room.\"",
      "\"She was loved and respected greatly,\" Morrisey said. \"There's an energy around her \u2014 people lining up to pay respects, showing sympathy, standing by their friend and the Guard.\"",
      "Wolfe, who remains in intensive care, comes from what Morrisey called \"a rich tradition of service.\" Wolfe's father serves in the Berkeley County Sheriff's Office, and his grandfather earned multiple Purple Hearts. \"His family asked for one thing \u2014 prayers,\" Morrisey said. \"He's fighting for his life.\"",
      "Law enforcement sources told CBS News that following the ambush shooting, the suspected gunman, identified as a 29-year-old Afghan national, was stabbed with a pocketknife by a third Guard member, while a fourth returned fire and shot the suspect multiple times, ending the attack.",
      "President Trump said Thursday that the suspect remains hospitalized in serious condition.",
      "The governor Friday confirmed West Virginia soldiers were directly involved in subduing the alleged gunman, but withheld operational details pending a federal review. He praised their response as swift, coordinated and heroic, crediting them with preventing further casualties.",

      "In a post to Truth Social, Mr. Trump wrote that he \"will permanently pause migration from all Third World Countries to allow the U.S. system to fully recover.\"",
      "The declaration follows Wednesday's shooting in downtown Washington, D.C., just blocks from the White House, in which a National Guard member was killed and a second Guard member critically wounded. The suspect detained in the shooting has been identified as a 29-year-old Afghan national who was admitted to the U.S. in September 2021, along with thousands of other Afghan refugees, a month after the U.S. withdrew its troops from Afghanistan.",
      "Since the shooting, the Trump administration has taken an aggressive stance on U.S. immigration policies it says are to blame for allowing the suspect into the U.S., and has vowed to change them.",
      "The president did not clarify when such a move might take effect or how the pause would be implemented. He also did not disclose which countries would fall under such a designation.",
      "CBS News has reached out to the White House for clarification.",
      "The president also wrote that he would \"terminate\" the status of millions of migrants admitted under former President Joe Biden's administration and \"remove anyone who is not a net asset to the United States.\"",
      "He said he would end \"Federal benefits and subsidies\" for \"noncitizens\" and deport foreign nationals who are determined to be a \"security risk, or non-compatible with Western Civilization.\"",
      "Earlier Thursday, the Trump administration\u00a0said it would be conducting a \"full-scale, rigorous reexamination\" of all green cards for every immigrant from 19 countries \"of concern.\"",
      "Those countries included Afghanistan, Cuba, Haiti, Iran, Somalia, Libya, Sudan, Yemen and Venezuela.",
      "Also Thursday, a Department of Homeland Security spokesperson confirmed to CBS News in a statement that the White House is now reviewing all asylum cases approved under the Biden administration.",
      "Prior to the shooting, on Nov. 21, the Trump administration, in a memo\u00a0directed U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services\u00a0to review the cases of all refugees admitted under Biden.",
      "The suspect in the shooting, Rahmanullah Lakanwal, immigrated to the U.S. from Afghanistan in September 2021, paroled on humanitarian grounds, a DHS official told CBS News. His asylum case was granted earlier this year, during Mr. Trump's presidency, the DHS official said.",
      "U.S. Attorney Jeanine Pirro said Thursday that the suspect lived with his family in Bellingham, Washington, and drove across the country to D.C. prior to the attack.",

      "Washington \u2014 President Trump said Friday he is canceling all orders signed by former President Joe Biden using an autopen, a mechanical device that reproduces signatures.",
      "\"Any document signed\" by Biden via the use of an autopen \"is hereby terminated, and of no further force or effect,\" Mr. Trump wrote\u00a0on Truth Social.",
      "\"I am hereby cancelling all Executive Orders, and anything else that was not directly signed by Crooked Joe Biden, because the people who operated the Autopen did so illegally,\" Mr. Trump said. \"Joe Biden was not involved in the Autopen process and, if he says he was, he will be brought up on charges of perjury.\"",
      "Biden signed 162 executive orders during his presidency, according to the American Presidency Project. It's unclear how many were signed using an autopen, though it's not unusual for presidents to revoke their predecessor's directives.",
      "Mr. Trump has already rolled back dozens of Biden's executive orders. The president rescinded nearly 70 of Biden's executive orders shortly after he was sworn in on Jan. 20 for his second term and another 19 on March 14, according to the White House.",
      "Mr. Trump previously ordered an investigation into the Biden White House's use of the autopen to sign presidential documents like pardons, claiming there was a \"conspiracy\" to \"abuse the power of presidential signatures through the use of an autopen to conceal Biden's cognitive decline.\"",
      "In a July statement, Biden called Mr. Trump's claims \"nothing more than distraction.\"",
      "\"Let me be clear: I made the decisions during my presidency. I made the decisions about the pardons, executive orders, legislation, and proclamations. Any suggestion that I didn't is ridiculous and false,\" Biden said.",
      "House Republicans released a report last month that was critical of Biden's autopen use, but did not include clear evidence that his aides conspired to sign laws or other directives without his knowledge.",
      "Presidents have long used an autopen to sign documents. In 2005, the Justice Department under President George W. Bush said the president can legally use an autopen to sign bills into law.",

      "U.S. Attorney Jeanine Pirro said Friday the suspect will be charged with murder in the first degree. On Thursday, she said he was facing charges of assault with intent to kill while armed and possession of a firearm during a crime of violence.",
      "Here's what we know about the suspect so far. This story will be updated as additional information is confirmed.",
      "Suspect entered U.S. 4 years ago",
      "Lakanwal, 29, entered the United States in 2021, multiple law enforcement sources told CBS News on Wednesday.",
      "Secretary of Homeland Security Kristi Noem said on X\u00a0that the suspect was paroled into the U.S. on Sept. 8, 2021, under a Biden-era program for Afghan nationals called Operation Allies Welcome.",
      "The suspect and his family fled Taliban threats in Afghanistan's Khost province, and relocated to Kabul before being transferred to the United States, multiple U.S. officials told CBS News.",
      "President Trump described him as \"a foreigner who entered our country from Afghanistan, a hellhole on Earth,\" in a video message late Wednesday. He said the suspect's status was extended \"under legislation signed by President Biden.\"",
      "A Department of Homeland Security official told CBS News the suspect was paroled into the U.S. on humanitarian grounds back in 2021. That was the main legal mechanism the Biden administration used to welcome tens of thousands of Afghan evacuees after the Taliban takeover in August 2021.",
      "Lakanwal\u00a0later applied for asylum with U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services in 2024 and his application was granted in 2025, the DHS official said. But his request for a green card, which is tied to the asylum grant, is pending.",
      "Many of the Afghan nationals who were admitted to the U.S. in 2021 were issued special immigrant visas offered to those who worked alongside the military during its 20-year war, while others were given a temporary humanitarian status known as parole.",
      "More than 8,000 people from Afghanistan were also granted deportation relief under a separate program called temporary protected status, which Biden extended in 2023 but Mr. Trump chose to end earlier this year.",
      "Suspect had worked with U.S. forces and CIA in Afghanistan",
      "A CIA spokesperson confirmed Thursday that the suspect worked with the U.S. government, including the CIA, during the war in Afghanistan.",
      "CBS News has also learned that the suspect led a team in the former Afghan national armed forces that worked directly with U.S. and British forces.",
      "Operational vetting conducted during the war was aimed largely at ensuring Afghan partner forces would not turn their weapons on U.S. personnel, and former intelligence officials said that the screening was not meant to serve as an immigration clearance.",
      "According to a former Afghan commando who spoke with CBS News on Thursday, Lakanwal led a unit of Afghan special forces in the south of the country and worked closely with the international troops.",
      "The former commando told CBS News that Lakanwal was left deeply troubled by the death of a close friend and fellow Afghan commander in 2024, whom he said had unsuccessfully sought asylum in the U.S.",
      "Multiple law enforcement sources told CBS News on Thursday that a running theory of investigators is that the suspect suffered from paranoia and other mental health challenges that indicated he believed authorities sought to deport him from the U.S. Counterterrorism officials said that ISIS and al-Qaeda-aligned narratives often target former U.S. partner forces with messaging that they will be abandoned or deported. While the suspect repeatedly expressed a fear of deportation, investigators have not linked that anxiety to extremist propaganda or a specific organization, officials said. Investigators are searching for evidence of extremist influence.",
      "Suspect placed on a ventilator",
      "The suspect was subdued at the scene of the shooting and taken into custody by National Guard members and law enforcement officers, Jeff Carroll, executive assistant chief of the D.C. Metropolitan Police Department, told reporters Wednesday.",
      "The suspect has been sedated and placed on a ventilator since the shooting, multiple U.S. officials told CBS News. The treatment has complicated efforts to interview him and retain biometrics.",
      "Police say suspect was \"lone gunman\" who \"ambushed\" National Guard",
      "Carroll said the suspect appeared to be \"a lone gunman that raised the firearm and ambushed these members of the National Guard\" as they patrolled near a mass transit station in downtown D.C.",
      "The suspect had four rounds in his handgun initially, multiple sources familiar with the investigation told CBS News. The revolver used in the attack was not registered to the suspect, according to investigators. Instead, it belonged to a deceased Washington state resident. Officials said the number of bullets in the weapon is unusual and remains unexplained.",
      "The first victim \u2014 a female guard member \u2014 was struck immediately and collapsed where she stood. She sustained at least two gunshot wounds during the ambush, the sources said.",
      "Then, the suspect took her weapon and used it to continue shooting, striking the second guard member, according to multiple sources. A third guard member, who was not injured, ultimately returned fire, ending the attack.",
      "One of the victims, 20-year-old Army Spc. Sarah Beckstrom, has died, Mr. Trump said Thursday. The second victim, Air Force Staff Sgt. Andrew Wolfe, 24, was in critical condition after undergoing surgery, Pirro said earlier Thursday.",
      "The guard members were on \"high visibility patrols,\" Carroll said, part of a monthslong deployment of National Guard troops from D.C. and several states ordered by Mr. Trump.",
      "Suspect drove from Washington state",
      "Pirro said Thursday morning that the suspect drove to D.C. from Bellingham, in Washington state, with \"the intended target of coming to our nation's capital.\" She said the suspect lived with his wife and, officials believe, five children.",
      "FBI Director Kash Patel said a search warrant had been executed at the suspect's last known address in Washington state. Based on what was found at the address, law enforcement were able to find people associated with him in San Diego.",
      "\"During that process, we seized numerous electronic devices to include cellphones, laptops, iPads and other material that is being analyzed as we speak,\" Patel said. \"Interviews were conducted and are going to continue to be conducted, and we will go anywhere in the country or the world where the evidence leads us.\"",
      "Multiple family members of the suspect in Washington state have been interviewed by investigators following a search of the suspect's Bellingham home, multiple law enforcement sources told CBS News on Thursday.",

    "story": [
      "Washington \u2014 President Trump has lashed out at several female reporters who have asked him questions or written critically of him in recent weeks, calling them \"ugly,\" \"stupid,\" and \"piggy.\"",
      "The most recent incident came at Mar-a-Lago on Thursday night, when CBS News chief White House correspondent Nancy Cordes asked the president about the suspect in the shooting of two members of the National Guard in Washington, D.C., on Wednesday. The suspect, Rahmanullah Lakanwal, is an Afghan national who was let into the U.S. under the Biden administration and granted asylum under the Trump administration.",
      "Cordes pointed out that the inspector general of the Justice Department found that Afghans who entered the U.S. after the fall of Kabul in 2021 had been thoroughly vetted. She asked the president: \"So why do you blame the Biden administration \u2014\"",
      "\"Because they let him in. Are you stupid? Are you a stupid person? Because they came in on a plane, along with thousands of other people that shouldn't be here, and you're just asking questions because you're a stupid person,\" Mr. Trump responded.",
      "On Wednesday, the president assailed New York Times correspondent Katie Rogers, who co-authored an article on his age and physical stamina in his second term, calling her \"third rate\" and \"ugly, both inside and out.\"",
      "The president's insults at Cordes and Rogers are just the latest in recent weeks that have been aimed at female reporters covering his presidency. While speaking to members of the press on Air Force One earlier this month, the president snapped at Bloomberg White House correspondent Catherine Lucey, telling her \"Quiet. Quiet, piggy.\"",
      "Lucey was asking the president about releasing the files from the Justice Department's investigation into convicted sex offender Jeffrey Epstein.",
      "Asked about the comment, White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt said Mr. Trump is \"very frank and honest\" with reporters and contrasted the president's willingness to take questions from the press to his predecessor, former President Joe Biden.",
      "\"I think the president being frank and open and honest to your faces rather than hiding behind your backs, is, frankly, a lot more respectful than what you saw in the last administration, where you had a president who lied to your face and then didn't speak to you for weeks and hid upstairs and didn't take your questions,\" she said. \"So I think everyone in this room should appreciate the frankness and the openness that you get from President Trump on a near daily basis.\"",
      "A Bloomberg spokesperson told the Washington Post that \"our White House journalists perform a vital public service, asking questions without fear or favor. We remain focused on reporting issues of public interest fairly and accurately.\"",
      "Then last week, while hosting Saudi Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman in the Oval Office last week, Mr. Trump berated ABC News chief White House correspondent Mary Bruce when she asked about the 2018 murder of Washington Post columnist Jamal Khashoggi. An intelligence report released by the Biden administration concluded that bin Salman ordered the attack on Khashoggi.",
      "Mr. Trump accused Bruce of embarrassing the crown prince with her question and later called her a \"terrible person and a terrible reporter.\" The president said her question was \"horrible\" and \"insubordinate.\"",
      "Wednesday's insult against Rogers was provoked by a New York Times article published Tuesday that examined the frequency of the president's public events and domestic travel, as well as the timing of his appearances on his public schedule. At 79, Mr. Trump is the oldest person elected to serve as president.",
      "Signs of bruising on his right hand as well as swollen ankles have prompted new questions about Mr. Trump's health. The president also revealed to reporters last month that he underwent an MRI during a physical at Walter Reed National Military Medical Center in April.",
      "Rogers' byline on the piece about Mr. Trump's aging in office is listed alongside another reporter, Dylan Freedman, a machine-learning engineer and journalist at the New York Times.",
      "The president attacked the Times and Rogers over the article, which he claimed was a \"hit piece.\" He called the newspaper a \"cheap 'rag'\" that is \"truly an 'enemy of the people.'\"",
      "\"The writer of the story, Katie Rogers, who is assigned to write only bad things about me, is a third rate reporter who is ugly, both inside and out,\" Mr. Trump wrote on Truth Social.\u00a0 He did not mention the story's co-author.",
      "The New York Times defended the article and Rogers.",
      "\"The Times' reporting is accurate and built on first hand reporting of the facts. Name-calling and personal insults don't change that, nor will our journalists hesitate to cover this administration in the face of intimidation tactics like this,\" a spokesperson said in a statement. \"Expert and thorough reporters like Katie Rogers exemplify how an independent and free press helps the American people better understand their government and its leaders.\"",
      "The Society of Professional Journalists condemned Mr. Trump's attacks on Bruce and Lucey last week, which it said were not isolated and instead \"part of an unmistakable pattern of hostility \u2014 often directed at women \u2014 that undermines the essential role of a free and independent press.\"",
      "\"Journalists are not props at a photo op \u2014 they are watchdogs for the public,\" Caroline Hendrie, executive director of the group, said in a statement. \"When reporters ask hard questions about the murder of a fellow journalist, that is not an embarrassment. What's embarrassing is a leader trying to silence those questions.\"",

In remarks Wednesday night addressing the shooting, Mr. Trump confirmed that he directed the department to mobilize an additional 500 troops to D.C. A U.S. official had told CBS News that the Army has received the request and will work to fulfill it quickly.",
      "The 500 additional service members will join roughly 2,200 troops who were deployed in D.C. as of Sunday morning. That includes around 900 members of the D.C. National Guard and more than 1,200 members of several states' Guard forces, according to a press release from the military's Joint Task Force \u2013 District of Columbia.",

      "The U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services said in a statement that the \"processing of all immigration requests relating to Afghan nationals is stopped indefinitely pending further review of security and vetting protocols,\" effective immediately.",
      "The announcement came shortly after the Department of Homeland Security announced publicly that the suspected shooter \u2014 who was shot by a Guard member and is now in custody \u2014 was a man named Rahmanullah Lakanwal who entered the U.S. in 2021 under a Biden-era initiative for Afghans called Operation Allies Welcome.",
      "President Trump said in remarks following the shooting: \"We must now reexamine every single alien who has entered our country from Afghanistan under Biden, and we must take all necessary measures to ensure the removal of any alien from any country who does not belong here or add benefit to our country.\"",
      "The U.S. military evacuated tens of thousands of people from Afghanistan in 2021, as the United States' two-decade-long war in the country ended with the Taliban returning to power.",
      "Upward of 85,000 Afghans were settled in the U.S. under Operation Allies Welcome. In many cases, they were initially housed at military bases and flown to the U.S. after undergoing processing.",

That program was plagued by years of backlogs, however.",
      "Others from Afghanistan applied for asylum \u2014 which is offered to people fleeing persecution \u2014 or visas based on being family members of U.S. citizens or green card holders.",
      "And many were granted less permanent protections like humanitarian parole and temporary protected status, putting them in an uncertain situation with no clear pathway to permanent residency unless they qualified for some other immigration status.",
      "A Department of Homeland Security official told CBS News the shooting suspect was paroled into the U.S. on humanitarian grounds in 2021. Lakanwal later applied for asylum with U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services in 2024 and his application was granted in 2025, the DHS official said. But his request for a green card, which is tied to the asylum grant, is pending.",
      "More than 8,000 people from Afghanistan were also granted deportation relief under a separate program called temporary protected status, which Biden extended in 2023 but Mr. Trump\u00a0chose to end earlier this year.",

    "summary": "The review comes after an Afghan national who arrived in the U.S. in 2021 was arrested in the shooting of two National Guard members.",
    "story": [
      "The Trump administration said Thursday it will be conducting a \"full-scale, rigorous reexamination\" of all green cards for every immigrant from \"a country of concern\" in the wake of the shooting of two National Guard members in Washington, D.C. An Afghan national who arrived in the U.S. in 2021 has been arrested as a suspect in Wednesday's attack.",
      "U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services Director Joseph Edlow said Thursday that the order had come at the request of President Trump. Two Homeland Security officials told CBS News there are 19 countries on that list, including Afghanistan, Cuba, Haiti, Iran, Somalia, Libya, Sudan, Yemen and Venezuela.",
      "Two members of the West Virginia National Guard, Army Spc. Sarah Beckstrom, 20, and Air Force Staff Sgt. Andrew Wolfe, 24, were shot Wednesday near the White House in what authorities described as an \"ambush-style attack.\" President Trump on Thursday told reporters that Beckstrom had died from her injuries. Wolfe was in critical condition as of Thursday morning, U.S. Attorney Jeanine Pirro said.",
      "The suspect, Rahmanullah Lakanwal, was shot Wednesday by a member of the National Guard, ending the attack, authorities said. He faces three counts of assault with intent to kill while armed, and he will also be charged with possession of a firearm during a crime of violence, Pirro said Thursday. The charges could still change pending the condition of the guard members.",
      "The Department of Homeland Security identified the suspect in Wednesday's shooting as Lakanwal, an Afghan national who authorities said was paroled into the U.S. in 2021 under a Biden-era program for Afghan nationals called Operation Allies Welcome. The CIA confirmed Thursday that Lakanwal had worked with the agency in Afghanistan.",
      "Department of Homeland Security spokeswoman Tricia McLaughlin said in a statement to CBS News on Thursday that the agency is now reviewing all asylum cases approved under the Biden administration.",
      "It's unclear how wide-ranging Homeland Security's review of the asylum policies will be. The Trump administration ordered an unprecedented review and rescreening of all refugees admitted to the U.S. under the Biden administration earlier this month. Refugees and asylum-seekers have to meet the same legal definition, but arrive in the U.S. under different circumstances.",
      "Lakanwal entered the U.S. in 2021, and his asylum case was granted earlier this year, while Mr. Trump was in office, a Homeland Security official told CBS News. In her statement, McLaughlin appeared to blame the shooting suspect's approval on a Biden-era court settlement that required the federal government to expedite the processing of Afghan asylum cases.",
      "Since the shooting, the Trump administration had already paused all immigration processing requests from Afghan nationals. An estimated 85,000 Afghans were settled in the U.S. under Operation Allies Welcome after the 2021 withdrawal from Afghanistan. In many cases, they were initially housed at military bases and flown to the U.S. after undergoing processing.",
      "Mr. Trump posted a video on social media on Wednesday night addressing the shooting, calling it an \"act of evil and an act of hatred and an act of terror. It was a crime against our entire nation. It was a crime against humanity.\"",
      "Mr. Trump also noted that the suspect had come to the U.S. under the Biden-era program and vowed to \"reexamine every single alien who has entered our country from Afghanistan under Biden, and we must take all necessary measures to ensure the removal of any alien from any country who does not belong here, or add benefit to our country.\"",
      "\"No country can tolerate such a risk to our country,\" Mr. Trump added, while pivoting to discussing Somali immigrants in Minnesota.",
      "Earlier this week, CBS News reported that the Trump administration directed immigration officials to review the cases of refugees admitted under former President Joe Biden, as part of an unprecedented effort to identify potential reasons that would disqualify them from being able to stay in the U.S.",

    "published": "Wed, 26 Nov 2025 15:04:44 -0500",
    "summary": "President Trump and more than a dozen of his allies were charged with offenses in Georgia relating to the 2020 presidential election.",
    "story": [
      "Washington \u2014 A Georgia judge on Wednesday agreed to dismiss the state's case against President Trump and his allies stemming from the 2020 presidential election after the local prosecutor who took over the case said he would no longer pursue the charges \"to serve the interests of justice and promote judicial finality.\"",
      "Fulton County Superior Court Judge Scott McAfee issued a brief order dismissing the case \"in its entirety\" shortly after Peter Skandalakis, who stepped in to replace Fulton County District Attorney Fani Willis after she was disqualified from the case, filed a motion informing the court of his decision to abandon the prosecution of Mr. Trump and more than a dozen others, including former White House chief of staff Mark Meadows and former New York City Mayor Rudy Giuliani.",
      "Skandalakis wrote in a memo accompanying the notice that overt acts listed in the indictment that were taken by the president and other Republicans \"are not acts I would consider sufficient\" to sustain a racketeering case. Skandalakis said that after reviewing the evidence, he concluded that a federal prosecution was more appropriate than one pursued by the state of Georgia, and said the \"strongest and most prosecutable case\" against those who allegedly sought to overturn the results of the 2020 election was the one being pursued by former special counsel Jack Smith.",
      "The president was charged with four federal counts stemming from an alleged effort to subvert the transfer of power after the 2020 election, but Smith dropped the case after Mr. Trump won a second term in the White House.",
      "Steve Sadow, Mr. Trump's lawyer in the Georgia case, said in response to Skandalakis' motion, \"The political persecution of President Trump by disqualified DA Fani Willis is finally over. This case should never have been brought. A fair and impartial prosecutor has put an end to this lawfare.\"",
      "Mr. Trump called the prosecution an \"illegal, unconstitutional and unAmerican hoax.\"",
      "\"LAW and JUSTICE have prevailed in the Great State of Georgia,\" he wrote on social media.",
      "Mr. Trump and 18 of his associates were indicted by a Fulton County grand jury in August 2023 under Georgia's racketeering law and were accused of coordinating a scheme to thwart certification of the 2020 election results in the state. The indictment capped an extraordinary and historic five months, across which the president was charged in four separate cases involving allegations of conduct that bookended his first term in office. Mr. Trump was the first former president to be charged with a crime.",
      "Two of those cases were brought by Smith and involved federal offenses, and a third was brought by the Manhattan District Attorney and stemmed from an alleged \"hush money\" payment to an adult film actress before the 2016 election. Smith ended his prosecutions of the president \u2014 one related to the 2020 election and the other involving his alleged mishandling of sensitive government documents after leaving office in January 2021 \u2014 after he won a second term.",
      "In the New York case, Mr. Trump was found guilty of 34 state felony counts of falsifying business records in June 2024 and has appealed the conviction.",
      "Mr. Trump was initially charged with 13 felony counts in Georgia, but several have been dismissed in the years since the indictment. He pleaded not guilty and denied any wrongdoing. Four of the president's 18 co-defendants accepted plea deals from prosecutors.",
      "The prosecution in Fulton County moved the slowest of the criminal cases involving the president, and proceedings were derailed for months by the bombshell revelation that Willis, the Fulton County district attorney, had a romantic relationship with Nathan Wade, whom she hired as a special prosecutor to assist in the investigation into Mr. Trump and his allies.",
      "The two acknowledged the relationship but said it didn't begin until months after Wade was hired in November 2021.",
      "The trial court judge overseeing the case, Scott McAfee, held a multi-day hearing to examine whether Willis had a conflict of interest in the case because of her relationship with Wade and travels with him, during which both prosecutors testified.",
      "McAfee ultimately declined to disqualify Willis from the case but said Wade had to step aside, which he did. But Mr. Trump and a group of his co-defendants appealed the ruling.",
      "The Georgia Court of Appeals reversed McAfee's decision in December and said disqualification of Willis was the only remedy to restore public confidence in the integrity of the proceedings. The Georgia Supreme Court turned away Willis' appeal\u00a0in September, leaving the ruling mandating her removal from the case against Mr. Trump intact.",
      "The Prosecuting Attorneys Council of Georgia, which of Skandalakis is the executive director, was tasked with finding a replacement to take over the case from Willis. He announced earlier this month that he would helm the prosecution himself after several others contacted declined to do so.",

    "story": [
      "The U.S. Interior Department said Tuesday the National Park Service is going to start charging the millions of international tourists who visit U.S. national parks each year $100 per person to enter some of the most popular sites, while leaving them out of fee-free days that will be reserved for American residents.",
      "The fee change for international visitors will impact 11 national parks, including the Grand Canyon, Yellowstone and Yosemite, according to the Interior Department.",
      "As part of the changes, which are set to take effect Jan. 1, foreign tourists will also see their annual parks pass price jump to $250, while U.S. residents will continue to be charged $80, according to the department's statement.",
      "Only approximately 100 of the more than 400 parks in the national park system collect an entrance fee.",
      "The announcement declaring \"America-first entry fee policies\" comes as national parks deal with the strain of a major staff reduction and severe budget cuts, along with recovering from damage during the recent government shutdown and significant lost revenue due to fees not being collected during that time. The park service furloughed well over half its staff during the shutdown.",
      "Interior Secretary Doug Burgum said in a post on the social platform X that the changes make sure U.S. taxpayers who support the park service \"continue to enjoy affordable access, while international visitors contribute their fair share to maintaining and improving our parks for future generations!\"",
      "A White House social media post laying out the increased fees ended with the phrase, \"AMERICANS FIRST.\"",
      "The announcement follows a July executive order in which President Donald Trump directed the parks to increase entry fees for foreign tourists.",
      "At the time, Mr. Trump also ordered the Interior Department to give U.S. residents \"preferential treatment\" over foreign visitors regarding \"recreational access rules, including permitting or lottery rules\" that parks might have in place.",
      "In its 2026 fiscal year\u00a0budget proposal\u00a0released in May, the Interior Department estimated that such a surcharge on international visitors would generate more than $90 million annually.",
      "\"There's a lot to unpack in this announcement, including many questions on its implementation \u2013 all which NPCA will raise with the Department of Interior,\" Kati Schmidt, a spokesperson for National Parks Conservation Association, said in an email.",
      "The U.S. Travel Association estimated that in 2018, national parks and monuments saw more than 14 million international visitors. Yellowstone reported that in 2024, nearly 15% of its visitors were from outside the country, which was down from 30% in 2018.",
      "The money made off the new fees will help support the national parks, including with upgrading facilities for visitors and maintenance, according to the statement.",
      "The \"resident-only patriotic fee-free days\" next year include Veterans Day, which was one of the parks' eight free days open to everyone in 2025. The Department of the Interior had announced those days by saying they wanted to ensure that \"everyone, no matter their zip code, can access and enjoy the benefits of green spaces and our public lands.\"",

    "story": [
      "Democratic Rep. Eric Swalwell of California filed a lawsuit Tuesday against Trump housing official Bill Pulte, who referred him to the Justice Department earlier this month for an investigation of mortgage and tax fraud allegations.",
      "Swalwell, who entered the California governor's race last week, filed the 19-page federal civil lawsuit in the U.S. Court for the District of Columbia accusing Pulte, the Federal Housing Finance Agency director, of violations of privacy in obtaining Swalwell's mortgage records. The lawsuit also accuses the Trump administration of engaging in a pattern of political retribution through the courts.",
      "\"Pulte's brazen practice of obtaining confidential mortgage records from Fannie Mae and/or Freddie Mac and then using them as a basis for referring individual homeowners to DOJ for prosecution is unprecedented and unlawful,\" the lawsuit alleged.",
      "Pulte has also submitted criminal referrals to the Justice Department for investigations of Democratic Sen. Adam Schiff, New York Attorney General Letitia James and Federal Reserve Board member Lisa Cook.",
      "The Federal Housing Finance Agency did not respond to a request for comment.",
      "The allegations against Swalwell are related to the mortgage on his property in Washington, D.C., CBS News previously reported.",
      "Swalwell's lawsuit says that the disclosure of his mortgage records harmed his reputation \"at a critical juncture in his career: the very moment when he had planned to announce his campaign for Governor of California.\"",
      "The civil complaint said that \"before President Trump reassumed office in January 2025, he routinely threatened to use his power to punish his political opponents,\" and then continued that \"after taking office, he wasted little time in following through on those threats.\"",
      "James' criminal case was dismissed Monday after a judge found that the interim U.S. attorney who secured her indictment was improperly appointed. James has also sought to have her case tossed out on other grounds, including that the prosecutions are vindictive and selective.",
      "Mr. Trump moved to fire Cook in August after Pulte accused her of making misrepresentations on mortgage documents. But Cook filed a lawsuit arguing her removal was unlawful, and the Supreme Court will hear arguments in January on whether Mr. Trump can fire her from the Federal Reserve Board of Governors.",

    "summary": "The discovery could cast some doubt on the status of Lucy's species as the direct ancestor of Homo sapiens.",
    "story": [
      "Newly discovered fossils prove that a mysterious foot found in Ethiopia belongs to a little-known, recently named ancient human relative who lived alongside the\u00a0species of the famous Lucy, scientists said Wednesday.",
      "The discovery is the latest twist in the tale of human evolution and could even cast some doubt on the status of Lucy's species, Australopithecus afarensis, as the direct ancestor of Homo sapiens.",
      "Until the foot was discovered in Burtele in northeastern Ethiopia in 2009, Lucy's species was thought to be the only human relative living in the area more than three million years ago.",
      "But the appendage clearly does not belong to Lucy's species because it has an opposable toe \u2014 similar to a thumb \u2014 allowing its owner to grab onto tree branches like apes.",
      "The team of scientists who found the mystery foot went on to name a new species, Australopithecus deyiremeda, in 2015 based on some roughly 3.4-million-year-old jaw bones found in Burtele.",
      "The announcement was met with some skepticism in scientific circles. Due to the scarcity of fossils, attempts to add a new branch to the human family tree usually provoke fierce debate.",
      "The team was also unable to say that the foot bones \u2014 dubbed the Burtele foot \u2014 belonged to their new species.",
      "Now, in a study published Tuesday called \"Mystery owner of African hominin foot identified,\" the scientists announced that new fossils including a jawbone with 12 teeth found at the site show that the foot was that of A. deyiremeda.",
      "\"We have no doubt about the Burtele foot belonging to the same species as these teeth and the jaw,\" lead study author, Yohannes Haile-Selassie of Arizona State University, told AFP.",
      "The research also revealed more details about this species, offering further clues about who could have been the true ancestor of us Homo sapiens.",
      "\"Co-existence is deep in our ancestry\"",
      "A CT scan of the teeth suggested that A. deyiremeda was more primitive than its cousin Lucy, the study said.",
      "Isotope analysis of the teeth meanwhile showed that its diet consisted mainly of leaves, fruit and nuts of trees.",
      "The grasping big toe also suggested this human relative spent more time in the trees. Big toes played an important role in human evolution, allowing our ancestors to leave the trees behind and walk on two legs.",
      "A lingering question about A. deyiremeda was how it could have co-existed with Lucy's species at the same place and time, Haile-Selassie said.",
      "The new research suggests that the former spent its time in the forest, more likely eating from trees, while the latter spent more time on the ground, a difference that allowed them to live together.",
      "It also demonstrates that \"co-existence is deep in our ancestry\", Haile-Selassie emphasised.",
      "Earlier this year, in the same region where was Lucy was discovered, archaeologists found 3,000-million-year-old knives that are believed to be some of the first tools ever used on Earth.\u00a0 Rick Potts, the director of the Smithsonian's human origins program and the leader of research on the peninsula, told CBS News that discovery can\u00a0help frame humans' existence\u00a0on the planet.",
      "\"We are the last biped standing, as I call it,\" Potts said. \"All of those other ways of life became extinct. And so that gives us a lot to think about, and it draws attention to the fragility of life, even in our own journey through time.\"",
      "New technologies have made the sites easier to date, and new discoveries across eastern Africa have refined researchers' understanding of human roots. Researchers knew that modern homo sapiens emerged in Africa about 300,000 years ago, but it wasn't until recently that they understood that their hominin ancestors began walking on two legs at least 6 million years ago.",
      "Search for the identity of our true ancestor",
      "John McNabb, a paleolithic archaeologist at the UK's University of Southampton not involved in the study, praised the new research.",
      "\"There will always be sceptics, but I think these new finds, and their validation of older ones, will help many researchers to be more accepting of A. deyiremeda,\" he told AFP.",
      "It also \"adds a new player into the mix\" in the search for the identity of our true ancestor, McNabb added.",
      "Because A. deyiremeda was more primitive and had a less human-like foot than Lucy, it is unlikely to dethrone her as the prime suspect in this search, both scientists agreed.",
      "But the discovery \"opens this possibility that we might still find more species within that time period because it looks like the Australopiths were experimenting with bipedality,\" or walking on two legs, Haile-Selassie said.",
      "\"Could there be another species which could be a better candidate to be the ancestor of the genus Homo?\" he asked.",
      "\"We don't know -- it depends on what we find.\"",

      "Those tiny, fluffy dogs walking down the street may look cute but beware \u2014 they probably have some wolf in them.",
      "That is the discovery announced on Monday by U.S. scientists, who were surprised to find that nearly two thirds of all dog breeds have a detectable amount of wolf DNA.",
      "And it is not genetic leftovers from when dogs originally evolved from wolves around 20,000 years ago, but instead suggests that domesticated dogs and wild wolves have interbred within the last few thousand years.",
      "This does not mean that \"wolves are coming into your house and mixing it up with your pet dog,\" Logan Kistler, a curator at the Smithsonian Museum of Natural History and co-author of a new study, told AFP.",
      "It also seems to have influenced the size, smelling power and even personality of modern dog breeds, the scientists said.",
      "\"The majority of dogs today have low, but detectable levels of post domestication wolf ancestry that has shaped their evolution and conferred unique advantages to their survival in diverse human environments,\" the scientists conclude in a study published on Monday.",
      "Dogs and wolves can produce offspring together, but interbreeding is thought to be rare.",
      "\"Prior to this study, the leading science seemed to suggest that in order for a dog to be a dog, there can't be very much wolf DNA present, if any,\" lead study author Audrey Lin of the American Museum of Natural History said in a statement.",
      "To find out more, the team analyzed thousands of dog and wolf genomes in publicly available databases.",
      "They found that over 64 percent of modern breeds have wolf ancestry, with even tiny chihuahuas carrying around 0.2 percent.",
      "\"This completely makes sense to anyone who owns a chihuahua,\" Lin joked.",
      "Which dogs have the most wolf DNA?",
      "Czechoslovakian and Saarloos wolfdogs had the most wolf DNA, with up to 40 percent.",
      "For breeds used as pets, the most \"wolfy\" was the Grand Anglo-Francais Tricolore hound, with around five percent of wolf DNA. Sight hounds such as Salukis and Afghans also ranked high.",
      "While dogs with wolf DNA tended to be bigger, this was not always the case \u2014\u00a0Saint Bernards did not have any.",
      "The research also showed that 100 percent of village dogs \u2014 which live on human settlements but are not anyone's pet -- have wolf ancestry.",
      "Kistler speculated that village dogs, which have more opportunities to get intimate with wolves, could be how wolf DNA was getting into the dog gene pool.",
      "Female wolves separated from their wolf pack by human activities such as habitat destruction could end up breeding with stray dogs, he suggested.",
      "Overall, \"Arctic sled dogs, pariah breeds, and hunting dogs have the greatest wolf ancestry, while on average, terriers, gundogs, and scent hounds have the least,\" the researchers write.",
      "Friendly or territorial?",
      "The researchers also compared their findings to the terms that kennel clubs use to describe the personalities of different breeds.",
      "Breeds with little or no wolf in them were more likely to be described as friendly, easy to train and affectionate.",
      "On the other hand, dogs with more wolf DNA were more often considered to be suspicious of strangers, independent, dignified or territorial.",
      "However, researchers said some descriptors occurred with similar frequency in low wolf and high wolf-content dogs, including \"intelligent,\" \"obedient,\" \"good with children,\" \"dedicated,\" \"calm,\" and \"cheerful.\"",
      "Kistler emphasized that descriptions of breeds are imperfect and do not predict the behavior of any individual dog.",
      "\"Wolves are evolved for specific habitats and specific conditions, and dogs have been carried to every corner of the inhabited world by people,\" he said.",
      "Dogs have simply had to adapt to the places humans took them, and \"wolf genes that gave them advantages in certain contexts,\" he explained.",
      "For example, many Tibetan breeds, such as the fluffy little Lhasa Apso, have a gene called EPAS1 that came from adapting to higher altitudes. Tibetan wolves have the same gene.",
      "The study was published in the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences.",

    "summary": "Researchers have documented 55 instances of \"mini lightning\" over two Martian years by eavesdropping on the whirling wind recorded by NASA's Perseverance rover.",
    "story": [
      "Scientists have detected what they believe to be lightning on Mars by eavesdropping on the whirling wind recorded by NASA's Perseverance rover.",
      "The crackling of electrical discharges was captured by a microphone on the rover, a French-led team reported Wednesday.",
      "The researchers documented 55 instances of \"mini lightning\" over two Martian years, primarily during dust storms and dust devils. Almost all occurred on the windiest Martian sols, or days, during dust storms and dust devils.",
      "Just inches in size, the electrical arcs occurred within 6 feet of the microphone perched atop the rover's tall mast, part of a system for examining Martian rocks via camera and lasers. Sparks from the electrical discharges \u2014 akin to static electricity here on Earth \u2014 are clearly audible amid the noisy wind gusts and dust particles smacking the microphone.",
      "Scientists have been looking for electrical activity and lightning at Mars for half a century, said the study's lead author Baptiste Chide, of the Institute for Research in Astrophysics and Planetology in Toulouse.",
      "\"It opens a completely new field of investigation for Mars science,\" Chide said, citing the possible chemical effects from electrical discharges. \"It's like finding a missing piece of the puzzle.\"",
      "The evidence is strong and persuasive, but it's based on a single instrument that was meant to record the rover zapping rocks with lasers, not lightning blasts, said Cardiff University's Daniel Mitchard, who was not involved in the study. What's more, he noted in an article accompanying the study in the journal Nature, the electrical discharges were heard \u2014 not seen.",
      "\"It really is a chance discovery to hear something else going on nearby, and everything points to this being Martian lightning,\" Mitchard said in an email. But until new instruments are sent to verify the findings, \"I think there will still be a debate from some scientists as to whether this really was lightning,\" he said.",
      "\"Like a thunderstorm on Earth, but barely visible with a naked eye\"",
      "Lightning has already been confirmed on Jupiter and Saturn, and Mars has long been suspected of having it too.",
      "To find it, Chide and his team analyzed 28 hours of Perseverance recordings, documenting episodes of \"mini lightning\" based on acoustic and electric signals.",
      "Electrical discharges generated by the fast-moving dust devils lasted just a few seconds, while those spawned by dust storms lingered as long as 30 minutes.",
      "\"It's like a thunderstorm on Earth, but barely visible with a naked eye and with plenty of faint zaps,\" Chide said in an email. He noted that the thin, carbon dioxide-rich Martian atmosphere absorbs much of the sound, making some of the zaps barely perceptible.",
      "Mars' atmosphere is more prone than Earth's to electrical discharging and sparking through contact among grains of dust and sand, according to Chide.",
      "\"The current evidence suggests it is extremely unlikely that the first person to walk on Mars could, as they plant a flag on the surface, be struck down by a bolt of lightning,\" Mitchard wrote in Nature. But the \"small and frequent static-like discharges could prove problematic for sensitive equipment.\"",
      "These aren't the first Mars sounds transmitted by Perseverance. Earthlings have listened in to the rover's wheels crunching over the Martian surface and the whirring blades of its no-longer-flying helicopter sidekick, Ingenuity.",
      "Perseverance has been scouring a dry river delta at Mars since 2021, collecting samples of rock for possible signs of ancient microscopic life. NASA plans to return these core samples to Earth for laboratory analysis, but the delivery is on indefinite hold as the space agency pursues cheaper options.",
      "Blue Origin's Blue and Gold NASA satellites en route to study Mars",
      "Earlier this month, Blue Origin launched its second heavy-lift New Glenn rocket that put two small NASA satellites onto a long, looping course to Mars. The satellites are aiming to learn more about how the sun has slowly blown away the red planet's once-thick atmosphere.",
      "The NASA-sponsored payload, managed by the University of California, Berkeley Space Sciences Laboratory, is made up of two small, low-budget satellites known as Blue and Gold that make up the heart of the ESCAPADE mission \u2014 Escape, Plasma Acceleration and Dynamics Explorers. Mars launch windows typically open every two years when Earth and the red planet reach favorable positions in their orbits to permit direct flights using current rockets. The next such window opens in 2026.",
      "Passing within 600 miles of Earth in November 2027, the ESCAPADE probes will make velocity-boosting gravity-assist flybys, augmented by onboard propulsion, to finally head for Mars. In all, the twin spacecraft will spend a full year in that initial kidney bean-shaped orbit out past the moon and back, and another 10 months in transit to Mars. The probes won't reach the red planet until September 2027.",
      "While the ESCAPADE mission is modest compared to Mars rovers and more sophisticated orbiters, the probes are designed to answer key questions about the evolution of the Martian atmosphere.",
      "Mars once had a global magnetic field like Earth's, but its molten core, which powered that field, mostly froze in place long ago, leaving only patchy, isolated remnants of that once-protective field in magnetized deposits.",
      "Without a protective global field like Earth's, the Martian atmosphere faces a constant barrage of high-speed electrons and protons blown away from the sun and from dense clouds of charged particles erupting from powerful solar storms.",

      "American astronomer-turned-medical physicist and now NASA astronaut Chris Williams joined two Russian cosmonauts aboard a Soyuz ferry ship Thursday for a Thanksgiving Day flight to the International Space Station.",
      "With commander Sergey Kud-Sverchkov at the controls of the Soyuz MS-28/74S spacecraft, flanked on his left by flight engineer Sergey Mikaev and on the right by Williams, the crew's Soyuz 2.1a booster roared to life at 4:27 a.m. Eastern and smoothly climbed away from the Russian-leased Baikonur Cosmodrome in Kazakhstan.",
      "Nine minutes and 45 seconds later, the Soyuz spacecraft was released from the booster's upper stage, its two solar wings unfolded and the crew set off in pursuit of the space station. Three hours later, they caught up with the orbital outpost and moved in for docking at the lab's Earth-facing Rassvet module at 7:34 a.m. Eastern.",
      "Williams, a former volunteer fire fighter and emergency medical technician who went on to earn a Ph.D. in astrophysics from MIT, was a board-certified medical physicist at Harvard Medical School when he was selected to join NASA's astronaut corps in 2021.",
      "He and flight engineer Mikaev were making their first space flight on Thursday, while Kud-Sverchkov is a seasoned veteran who logged 185 days aboard the space station in 2020-2021.",
      "\"It's a really great crew,\" Williams said in a NASA interview. \"Sergey and Sergey are both just absolutely wonderful people, really kind, super interested, super intellectually curious, which is really fun. Had a lot of really, really great discussions, just talking and talking about things.",
      "\"It's been been wonderful to both spend some time with them over in Star City, and also to be able to spend some time with them in Houston through our training.\"",
      "The Soyuz MS-28 crew is replacing Soyuz MS-27/73S commander Sergey  Ryzhikov, flight engineer Alexey Zubritsky and NASA astronaut Jonny Kim,  who were launched to the space station last April. They plan to return  to Earth on Dec. 9 to wrap up their eight-month stay on the ISS.",
      "Also  on hand to welcome Williams and his crewmates aboard the station: NASA  Crew 11 commander Zena Cardman, Michael Fincke, Japanese astronaut  Kimiya Yui and cosmonaut Oleg Platonov. They launched atop a SpaceX  Falcon 9 rocket last August and plan to come home in February or March,  after their replacements \u2014 Crew 12 \u2014 arrive.",
      "All 11 station  fliers planned to gather for a traditional welcome aboard video call to  mission managers and family back in Moscow before a safety briefing and  the start of familiarization with the space station's complex systems.",
      "Williams, an Eagle Scout with a private pilot's license, is a standout among super achievers.",
      "After  graduating from Stanford University with a bachelor's degree in  physics, he was doing radio astronomy research on the way to a  Ph.D. and, \"down the street from my house, there was a volunteer fire  department. And I was like, oh, that sounds like something that could be  kind of like fun and interesting to do.\"",
      "\"So I started  volunteering. Got trained as an EMT and a firefighter, and started just  sort of doing that on a volunteer basis. And I found that I really liked  it. I got a lot of satisfaction out of knowing that ... at the end of  the shift, I would have really made a very direct and immediate positive  impact on somebody's life.\"",
      "He kept that up throughout graduate  school. Then, as he was winding up his doctorate in astrophysics,  Williams said he ran into a doctor he knew at a party who told him there  was \"a big need for physicists in medicine, in particular, in radiation  oncology, where we use radiation to treat cancer.\"",
      "He talked with a few other people, including one who had been an astronomer before switching to medical physics, and \"I was struck by how much of what I knew and had learned as an astronomer would actually be useful and apply very directly to medicine.\"",
      "\"A lot of the math behind (medical) imaging is the exact same math that actually you use in a radio telescope to make an image,\" Williams said. \"It was kind of neat to see that image processing techniques that I'd used as (a radio astronomer) actually carried over pretty directly into medicine.\"",
      "At the time of his selection as an astronaut, Williams was on the staff at Harvard Medical School as a clinical physicist and researcher. He is the second member of the 2021 class of astronauts to fly in space, getting assigned to the Soyuz MS-28 mission shortly after finishing astronaut candidate training.",
      "He said the training for launch on a Russian spacecraft was difficult, primarily because of the travel required. He credited his wife, Aubrey, with keeping the family's life on an even keel throughout.",
      "As for what he looks forward to during his eight-month stay in space, Williams repeated a familiar theme.",
      "\"I've got a lot of different goals, but I think the biggest one, and the thing I'm most excited about, is to truly be able to put my training into practice and to do a really good job to push forward the science and research that we're doing on on the space station.\"",
      "\"I think it's incredibly important. I think it's incredibly interesting and incredibly inspiring, and I feel really lucky to have the opportunity to contribute to that.\"",

      "Companies have been down this road before \u2014 often unsuccessfully. Google launched smart glasses, which could be used to search the web, get directions and record video, more than a decade ago. But the product failed to catch on, with consumers put off by the $1,500 price tag.",
      "After repositioning Google Glass as a tool for businesses, the Alphabet-owned company pulled the plug in 2023.",
      "Yet the idea of wearing a computer on your face, rather than carrying one around in your pocket in the form of a smartphone, never went away. Today, major tech players, including Amazon, Meta and Xiaomi, are all rolling out digital glasses, betting on AI as the \"killer app\" that wins over consumers. Dozens of smaller players are also entering the fray with a variety of products.",
      "In the U.S., Meta this summer teamed with eyewear maker Oakley to introduce AI glasses that lets users make calls, send and receive text messages, listen to music, stream video, translate foreign languages, and generally tap the internet via the company's AI app. Geared to athletes, the product starts at $399. Meta also offers AI glasses in a partnership with Ray-Ban.",
      "Such devices are attracting users beyond tech fans. For example, some visually impaired people are using Meta's smart glasses to connect with volunteers for real-time help completing tasks such as shopping or going through their mail.",
      "Although smart glasses remain a niche product, tech market researcher IDC forecasts steady growth, from global sales of 9.4 million units this year to nearly 20 million in 2029. Roughly 17% of online adults in the U.S report having tried smart glasses, according to Forrester, up from 4% in 2024.",
      "One obstacle AI eyewear will have to overcome to gain broader acceptance, according to security experts: privacy. Smart glasses capture, store and share personal data, while their capacity to record and stream video raises thorny questions about filming people without their consent, according to legal experts.",

    "story": [
      "Artificial intelligence can do the work currently performed by nearly 12% of America's workforce, according to a recent\u00a0study from the Massachusetts Institute of Technology.",
      "The researchers, relying on a metric called the \"Iceberg Index\" that measures a job's potential to be automated, conclude that AI already has the cognitive and technical capacity to handle a range of tasks in technology, finance, health care and professional services.",
      "The index simulated how more than 150 million U.S. workers across nearly 1,000 occupations interact and overlap with AI's abilities. Specifically, it measures exposure to AI capabilities and how the rapidly emerging technology overlaps with workers' occupational skills.",
      "The study doesn't seek to shed light on how many workers AI may already have displaced or could supplant in the future. To what extent such tools take over job functions performed by people depends on a number of factors, including individual businesses' strategy, societal acceptance and possible policy interventions, the researchers note.",
      "AI's uses extend far beyond some of its most visible applications, such as writing computer code, the researchers note. Among the ways employers across different industries are using AI:",

      "The study analyzed workers' distinct skills and compared them to the abilities of more than 13,000 AI tools. In some cases, AI can augment human efforts, while in other types of work the technology is far more transformative, according to the researchers.",
      "For example, AI can streamline filling out paperwork, freeing nurses up to spend more time with patients. It can also quickly and accurately produce software code, forcing software engineers with limited skills to shift their focus.",
      "In addition, \"[F]inancial analysts will not disappear, but AI systems may demonstrate capability across significant portions of document-processing and routine analysis work,\" the researchers said. \"This reshapes how roles are structured and which skills remain in demand, without necessarily reducing headcount.\"",
      "AI is also already doing\u00a0some of the entry-level jobs\u00a0that have historically been reserved for recent college graduates or relatively inexperienced workers, the report notes.",
      "\"AI systems now generate more than a billion lines of code each day, prompting companies to restructure hiring pipelines and reduce demand for entry-level programmers,\" the researchers wrote. \"These observable changes in technology occupations signal a broader reorganization of work that extends beyond software development.\"",

    "summary": "Over the weekend, Elon Musk's X unveiled a feature that lets users see where an account is based \u2014 and it led to some surprises.",
    "story": [
      "They go by names like @TRUMP_ARMY\u2014 or @MAGANationX, and their verified accounts proudly display portraits of President Donald Trump, voter rallies and American flags. And they're constantly posting about U.S. politics to their followers, sounding like diehard fans of the president.",
      "But after a weekend update to the social media platform X, it's now clear that the owners of these accounts, and many others, are located in regions such as South Asia, Africa and Eastern Europe.",
      "Elon Musk's X unveiled a feature Saturday that lets users see where an account is based. Online sleuths and experts quickly found that many popular accounts posting in support of the MAGA movement to thousands or hundreds of thousands of followers, are based outside the United States \u2014 raising concerns about foreign influence on U.S. politics.",
      "Researchers at NewsGuard, a firm that tracks online misinformation, identified several popular accounts \u2014 purportedly run by Americans interested in politics \u2014 that instead were based in Eastern Europe, Asia or Africa.",
      "The accounts were leading disseminators of some misleading and polarizing claims about U.S. politics, including ones that said Democrats bribed the moderators of a 2024 presidential debate.",
      "Nikita Bier, X's head of product, announced Saturday that the social media platform is rolling out an \"About This Account\" tool, which lets users see the country or region where an account is based. To find an account's location, tap or click the signup date displayed on the profile.",
      "\"This is an important first step to securing the integrity of the global town square. We plan to provide many more ways for users to verify the authenticity of the content they see on X,\" Bier wrote.",
      "In countries with punitive speech restrictions, a privacy tool on X lets account holders only show their region rather than a specific country. So instead of India, for instance, an account can say it is based in South Asia.",
      "Bier said Sunday that after an update to the tool, it would 99.99% accurate, though this could not be independently verified. Accounts, for instance, can use a virtual private network, or VPN, to mask their true location. On some accounts, there's a notice saying the location data may not be accurate, either because the account uses a VPN or because some internet providers use proxies automatically, without action by the user.",
      "\"Location data will always be something to use with caution,\" said Alexios Mantzarlis, director of the Security, Trust, and Safety Initiative at Cornell Tech and a former director of the International Fact-Checking Network. \"Its usefulness probably peaks now that it was just exposed, and bad actors will adapt. Meta has had similar information for a while and no one would suggest that misinformation has been eliminated from Facebook because of it.\"",
      "Some of the accounts supported slain conservative activist Charlie Kirk as well as President Donald Trump's children. Many of the accounts were adorned with U.S. flags or made comments suggesting they were American. An account called \"@BarronTNews_,\" for instance, is shown as being located in \"Eastern Europe (Non-EU),\" even though the display location on its profile says \"Mar A Lago.\" The account, which has more than 580,000 followers, posted on Tuesday that \"This is a FAN account, 100 % independent, run by one guy who loves this country and supports President Trump with everything I've got.\"",
      "Chris Krebs, former director of the Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency, told CBS News these types of accounts are fueled by public interest in current events and America's highly polarized politics.",
      "\"It is shining a light on this new rage economy that exists on social media, including X, that takes advantage of current things,\" Krebs said. \"What's the latest event? As we've seen over the last couple of years ... there has been a rightward shift of the platform. And I think what we're really seeing here is foreign-based accounts that are looking to make a little bit of money and taking advantage of this.\"",
      "He added, \"I think X deserves some credit to shine a light, to kind of expose some of these. ... I suspect you'll see a bunch of these accounts lose influence.\"",
      "NewsGuard also found evidence that some X users are spreading misinformation about the location feature itself, incorrectly accusing some accounts of being operated from abroad when they're actually used by Americans. Investigators found several instances where one user created fake screenshots that appear to suggest an account was created overseas.",
      "It's not always clear what the motives of the accounts. While some may be state actors, it's likely that many are financially motivated, posting commentary, memes and videos to draw engagement.",
      "\"For the most visible accounts unmasked this week, money is probably the main motivator,\" Mantzarlis said. \"That doesn't mean that X \u2014 as documented extensively by prior work done by academic and nonprofit organizations that are being attacked and defunded \u2014 isn't also a target for state actors.\"",
      "Users were divided over the new ability to see an account's location information, with some questioning whether it went too far.",
      "\"Isn't this kind of an invasion of privacy?\" One X user wrote. \"No one needs to see this info.\"",

      "There were 12,113 inbound and outbound flight delays reported across the U.S. on Sunday, according to the tracking site FlightAware. The tracker also showed 1,424 flight cancellations. Airports in Chicago, New York City, Boston, Des Moines, Fort Lauderdale and Detroit were among those most affected. There was also at least one rail disruption in Providence, Rhode Island, where a fire broke out beneath three Amtrak train cars with passengers inside. The Providence Fire Department said crews extinguished the fire and relocated the train cars, and no one was injured. CBS News reached out to Amtrak for information about wider delays but did not receive an immediate response.",
      "A powerful snowstorm in the Midwest and Great Lakes regions initially interrupted air travel for some in the wake of last week's holiday. National Weather Service offices issued a flurry of winter storm warnings and advisories from Montana to Ohio as a result, and forecasters cautioned that airport delays and slow-moving traffic would likely follow. That was especially true for places where snowfall was expected to accumulate at rates of more than one inch per hour.",
      "The storm at first dropped upwards of 8 inches of snow on northern Iowa, the National Weather Service said. By Saturday night, more than 1,400 flights were canceled at airports in Chicago, where the winter storm was expected to bring as much as 10 inches of snow, CBS Chicago reported.",
      "Similar accumulation was forecast in other parts of Illinois as well as in Indiana, Michigan and Wisconsin. Airports in Detroit faced more than 300 flight delays and dozens of cancellations as the storm moved over that area Saturday night, CBS Detroit reported.",
      "Airlines also reported disruptions over the weekend after the Federal Aviation Administration flagged thousands of Airbus A320 airliners around the world in need of software updates, including the one that Pope Leo XIV was using to travel around the Middle East.",
      "JetBlue canceled approximately 170 flights on Sunday as the airline performed the updates on a portion of its Airbus A320 and A321 models, which were mandated by the Federal Aviation Administration. The airline said in a statement that it expected software installations to be completed for nearly 120 aircraft by Sunday morning, with another 30 or so still remaining.",
      "\"Additional cancellations are possible as we continue working through the software updates,\" the statement said. \"We understand the impact this has on customers, especially during a busy holiday travel period, and we are doing everything we can to minimize disruptions.\"",
      "FlightAware showed JetBlue had canceled 74 flights originally scheduled for Sunday, which was about 7% of its schedule. Asked whether the updates would be finished Sunday or continue into Monday, a JetBlue source told CBS News senior transportation correspondent Kris Van Cleave that the airline was \"working as quickly as possible.\"",
      "Frontier Airlines and Spirit Airlines also confirmed that some of their Airbus planes required updates under the FAA directive.

      "The suspect accused of shooting two West Virginia National Guard members in Washington, D.C., had been struggling with his mental health \u2014 often isolating himself in a dark room \u2014 in the years after he left Afghanistan and entered the U.S., according to emails sent by a case worker who was helping his family access services after they resettled in Bellingham, Washington.",
      "Rahmanullah Lakanwal entered the U.S. in 2021 as part of the Biden-era Operation Allies Welcome after the chaotic U.S. withdrawal from Afghanistan, officials said.",
      "According to emails dated January 2024 obtained by CBS News, the 29-year-old had been struggling to hold a job and had not been doing well mentally for more than a year.",
      "In an email sent on Jan. 11, 2024, to the nonprofit group U.S. Committee for Refugees and Immigrants, the concerned case worker said Lakanwal had not worked in a year and his family had been served an eviction notice for nonpayment of rent.",
      "\"World Relief volunteers are trying to patch things for that family - but I think the father has mental health issues that are not addressed, and he won't talk to anyone,\" the email, sent the year before Lakanwal's asylum claim was approved,\u00a0 read in part.",
      "World Relief is one of the refugee resettlement agencies that assisted in the relocation of Afghan evacuees. Washington state took in nearly 3,000 Afghan nationals, including Lakanwal, his wife and their five sons.",
      "The family had been living in Bellingham, and Lakanwal drove across the country to Washington, D.C., before the attack, U.S. Attorney Jeanine Pirro said during a news conference last week. One of the victims, Army Spc. Sarah Beckstrom, 20, died Thursday, while the other, Air Force Staff Sgt. Andrew Wolfe, 24, remains hospitalized.",
      "In another email sent Jan. 31, 2024, the case worker said Lakanwal had \"not been functional as a person, father and provider since March of last year, 03/2023.\"",
      "\"He spends most of his time for weeks on end in his darkened bedroom, not speaking to anyone, not even his wife and older kids,\" the email said.",
      "The email also describes \"manic episodes for one or two weeks at a time where he will take off in the family car,\" but also \"interim\" periods where he \"tries to make amends.\" The case worker, who is not a mental health professional, later said in the email that they believed Lakanwal is suffering \"\u2026PTSD from his work with the US military in Afghanistan.\"",
      "According to a former Afghan commando who spoke with CBS News, Lakanwal led a unit of Afghan special forces in the south of the country and worked closely with the international troops before the U.S. withdrawal from Afghanistan. The former commando also said that Lakanwal was left deeply troubled by the death of a close friend and fellow Afghan commander in 2024, whom the former commando said had unsuccessfully sought asylum in the U.S.",
      "Lakanwal applied for asylum in December 2024, which is a lawful immigration process overseen by the Department of Homeland Security. As part of that process, he would have gone through extensive vetting \u2014- including background checks, social media reviews, and in-person interviews. He passed his reviews and was eventually granted asylum in April 2025.",
      "Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem claimed Sunday that Lakanwal, who is facing murder charges, was \"radicalized since he's been here in this country.\"",
      "\"We do believe it was through connections in his home community and state, and we're going to continue to talk to those who interacted with him,\" Noem said Sunday on NBC's \"Meet the Press.\" She provided no further details.",
      "\"This violent act does not reflect the Afghan community, which continues to contribute across the United States and undergoes some of the most extensive vetting of any immigrant population,\" said Shawn VanDiver, President of AfghanEvac, a nonprofit that advocates for the resettlement of Afghans who worked with the U.S. military.",
      "Lakanwal was shot by another National Guard member during his attack and is also hospitalized. He has been sedated and placed on a ventilator since the shooting, multiple U.S. officials told CBS News. The treatment has complicated investigators' efforts to interview him.",
      "As part of the investigation, U.S. intelligence analysts are combing Lakanwal's communications and online footprint for signs of international coordination or ideological radicalization, multiple U.S. officials said.

      "Shortly after Mr. Trump's announcement, Hern\u00e1ndez's wife and children gathered on the steps on their home in Tegucigalpa and kneeled in prayer, thanking God that Hern\u00e1ndez would return to their family after almost four years apart.",
      "It was the same home that Honduran authorities hauled him out of in 2022 just months after leaving office. He was extradited to the United States to stand trial.",
      "Garc\u00eda said they had just been able to speak with Hern\u00e1ndez and tell him the news.",
      "\"He still didn't know of this news and believe me, when we shared it his voice broke with emotion,\" she said.",
      "Garc\u00eda thanked Mr. Trump, saying Mr. Trump had corrected an injustice, maintaining that Hern\u00e1ndez's prosecution was a coordinated plot by drug traffickers and the \"radical left\" to seek revenge against the former president.",
      "She said they had not been told exactly when Hern\u00e1ndez would return, but said \"we hope that in the coming days.\"",
      "A lawyer for Hernandez, Renato C. Stabile, expressed gratitude for Mr. Trump's actions.",
      "\"A great injustice has been righted and we are so hopeful for the future partnership of the United States and Honduras,\" Stabile said. \"Thank you President Trump for making sure that justice was served. We look forward to President Hernandez's triumphant return to Honduras.\"",
      "A separate lawyer for Hernandez, Sabrina Shroff, declined comment.",
      "Republican Sen. Bill Cassidy, of Louisiana, was critical of the pardon, saying Sunday on social media, \"Why would we pardon [Hernandez] and then go after Maduro for running drugs into the United States? Lock up every drug runner! Don't understand why he is being pardoned.\"",
      "Mr. Trump defended the move to reporters aboard Air Force One on Sunday, claiming, \"Many of the people of Honduras said it was a Biden setup. ... He was the president of the country, and they basically said he was a drug dealer because he was the president of the country. And they said it was a Biden administration setup, and I looked at the facts and I agreed with them.\"",
      "When asked what evidence he had seen to indicate Hernandez's case was a setup, Mr. Trump said, \"You take any country you want, if somebody sells drugs in that country, that doesn't mean you arrest the president and put him in jail for the rest of his life.\"",
      "Mr. Trump's post on Friday was part of a broader message by the U.S. president backing Tito Asfura for Honduras' presidency, with Mr. Trump saying the U.S. would be supportive of the country if he wins. But if Asfura loses the election this Sunday, Trump posted that \"the United States will not be throwing good money after bad, because a wrong Leader can only bring catastrophic results to a country, no matter which country it is.\"",
      "Asfura, 67, is making his second run for president for the conservative National Party. He was mayor of Tegucigalpa and has pledged to solve Honduras' infrastructure needs. But he has previously been accused of embezzling public funds, allegations that he denies.",
      "In addition to Asfura, there are two other likely contenders for Honduras' presidency: Rixi Moncada, who served as the finance and later defense secretary before leaving to run for president for the incumbent democratic socialist Libre party, and Salvador Nasralla, a former television personality who is making his fourth bid for the presidency, this time as the candidate for the Liberal Party.",
      "Mr. Trump has framed Honduras' election as trial for democracy, suggesting in a separate Truth Social post that if Asfura loses, the country could go the way of Venezuela and fall under the influence of that country's leader, Nicol\u00e1s Maduro.",
      "Mr. Trump has sought to apply pressure on Maduro, who the Trump administration has accused of leading a drug cartel, ordering a series of strikes against boats suspected of carrying drugs, building up the U.S. military presence in the Caribbean with warships, including the Navy's most advanced aircraft carrier, the USS Gerald R. Ford.",
      "The U.S. president has not ruled out taking military action or covert action by the CIA against Venezuela, though he has also floated that he was open to speaking with Maduro.",
      "Outgoing Honduran President Xiomara Castro has leaned into a leftist stance, but she has kept a pragmatic and even cooperative attitude in dealing with the U.S. administration and she has received visits from Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem and U.S. Army Gen. Laura Richardson, when she was the commander of U.S. Southern Command. The president has even backed off his threats to end Honduras' extradition treaty and military cooperation with the U.S.",
      "Under Castro, Honduras has also received its citizens deported from the U.S. and acted as a bridge for deported Venezuelans who were then picked up by Venezuela in Honduras.",

    "story": [
      "Washington \u2014 Democratic Sen. Tim Kaine of Virginia said Sunday that a reported U.S. follow-on strike on an alleged drug boat earlier this year \"rises to the level of a war crime if it's true.\"",
      "\"If that reporting is true, it's a clear violation of the DoD's own laws of war, as well as international laws about the way you treat people who are in that circumstance,\" Kaine said on \"Face the Nation with Margaret Brennan.\"",
      "The Washington Post reported Friday that in the U.S.' first strike on a suspected drug smuggling boat in the Caribbean in September, Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth gave a verbal order to leave no survivors. A follow-on strike was ordered to comply with the instructions, killing two survivors in the water, the Post reported. Hegseth called the reporting \"fabricated, inflammatory and derogatory,\" claiming the operations in the Caribbean are \"lawful under both U.S. and international law.\"",
      "CBS News has not independently confirmed the Washington Post's reporting.",
      "Targeting civilians or members of the armed forces who are wounded is prohibited under the Geneva Conventions, which also require the wounded to be \"collected and cared for.\" A group of former military lawyers outlined in an assessment Saturday that the reported second strike would be a violation of international or domestic law. And the leaders of the House and Senate Armed Services committees pledged to investigate the reported follow-on strike.",
      "Asked about the reported follow-on strike while aboard Air Force One on Sunday, President Trump said, \"First of all, I don't know that that happened, and Pete [Hegseth] said he didn't even know what people were talking about.\"",
      "\"So, we'll look into it. But no, I wouldn't have wanted that, a second strike,\" Mr. Trump said. \"The first strike was very lethal. It was fine. If there were two people around \u2014 but Pete [Hegseth] said that didn't happen. I have great confidence in him ... I'm going to find out about it, but Pete said he didn't order the death of those two men.\"",
      "Since the first strike on Sept. 2, the U.S. has carried out close to two dozen boat strikes in the Caribbean and eastern Pacific Ocean. Kaine outlined to CBS News' chief White House correspondent Nancy Cordes that lawmakers have been seeking answers to a number of questions about the strikes, including seeking evidence that \"the folks on board were really narco traffickers,\" the question of why to strike rather than interdict, and the legal rationale for the strikes.",
      "\"We had to pry with a crowbar after weeks and weeks out of the administration, the supposed legal rationale for the strikes at international waters,\" Kaine said. \"It was very shoddy.\"",
      "The Virginia Democrat said, \"It's time for Congress to rein in a president who is deciding to wage war on his own say-so, which is not what the Constitution allowed.\"",
      "Kaine has twice tried to pass war powers resolutions aimed at preventing the president from conducting strikes against Venezuela, earning support from two Republicans.",
      "\"That was before all of these assets have amassed around Venezuela, and before President Trump said that the airspace needs to be closed,\" Kaine said.",
      "Mr. Trump posted on Truth Social Saturday that Venezuela's airspace should be considered \"CLOSED IN ITS ENTIRETY.\" The post comes as the administration has increased pressure on Venezuelan President Nicolas Maduro, with signs that military action, including possible ground action, could be imminent.",
      "Kaine said if there's ground action, the numbers in the Senate would change. And he noted that he would move \"immediately\" on a war powers resolution \"should there be military action.\"",
      "\"The circumstances have changed in the months since we had that vote,\" Kaine said. \"We think the escalating pace and some of the recent revelations \u2014 so, for example, the recent revelation about the kill everyone order apparently dictated by Secretary Hegseth \u2014 we do believe that we will get more support for these motions when they are refiled.\"",
      "Rep. Mike Turner, an Ohio Republican who sits on the Armed Services Committee and previously led the House Intelligence Committee, also appeared on \"Face the Nation\" Sunday. He said \"Congress does not have information\" that the reported follow-on strike occurred.",
      "\"If that occurred, that would be very serious, and I agree that that would be an illegal act,\" Turner added.",

    "story": [
      "Washington \u2014 GOP Rep. Mike Turner of Ohio expressed concern Sunday that the White House-backed proposed plan to end the war in Ukraine is too pro-Russia, while urging that any peace arrangement must look at Russia as a \"skeptical adversary.\"",
      "Turner said on \"Face the Nation with Margaret Brennan\" that the president's \"goal of peace is incredibly important,\" while acknowledging comments made by Secretary of State Marco Rubio's supporting a sovereign Ukraine as negotiators gathered in Miami on Sunday morning.",
      "The team of Ukrainian negotiators began meeting Sunday morning with Rubio, Special Envoy Steve Witkoff and Jared Kushner, President Trump's son-in-law. Witkoff is expected to travel to Moscow later this week.",
      "As the meeting kicked off Sunday, Rubio outlined that \"the end goal is obviously not just the end of the war,\" but also \"securing an end to the war that leaves Ukraine sovereign and independent and with an opportunity at real prosperity.\"",
      "Rubio's comments come after the White House floated a peace proposal earlier this month that critics said favored Russia, initially including several provisions that Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy had rejected in the past. But the plan has since been revised, Mr. Trump has outlined, citing progress on both sides.",
      "Asked by CBS' chief White House correspondent Nancy Cordes whether he still has concerns about the plan being too pro-Russia, Turner, who sits on the House Armed Services Committee and formerly chaired the House Intelligence Committee, said \"I think we all have those concerns.\" But he added, \"one thing that I think everybody understands is that you can't have, you can't be America first and pro-Russia, because Russia is a self-declared adversary of the United States.\"",
      "\"It's fielding new, advanced nuclear weapons that are specifically targeting the United States, it's constantly attacking the United States with offensive cyber, it continuously identifies both NATO and the west, the United States, as its adversary,\" Turner said. \"You have to understand that the balance of this peace arrangement has to be one where you have to look at Russia as a skeptical adversary.\"",
      "Asked about a transcript of a call published by Bloomberg in which Witkoff appeared to be coaching a Kremlin aide on how to negotiate with President Trump, Turner said \"the part that concerned me most is that there appeared to be an orchestration of giving Putin an opportunity to speak to Trump before President Zelenskyy was on his way to the White House.\"",
      "Turner said \"this is not a military against military action, they are bombing into Ukraine and murderously killing civilians in Ukraine.\"",
      "\"The Ukrainian people are being subjected to this, and President Trump needs to be able to hear Zelenskyy's voice clearly, and not just the authoritarian, murderous Putin,\" Turner added.",
      "As for Witkoff, Turner said \"I think you can't take just one slice of someone's conversation during the long, stretched out aspects of negotiations as reflective. But I think it's certainly important that when we do get that opportunity, that our voices are heard of caution and concern.\"",
      "\"The orchestration of inserting Putin's voice before Zelenskyy's is very concerning,\" Turner said. \"Because Ukraine's sovereignty and security needs to be preeminent. And we heard that this morning from Rubio, and that needs to be the focus.\"",
      "On Sunday afternoon, Rubio called the day's meeting \"another very productive session,\" reiterating the intention to end the war while also working to \"help Ukraine be safe forever.\" He called it a \"shared vision.\"",
      "\"But there's more work to be done,\" Rubio said after the meeting. \"This is delicate, it's complicated, there are a lot of moving parts, and obviously there's another party involved here that will have to be a part of the equation, and that will continue later this week when Mr. Witkoff travels to Moscow.\"",

      "And this week on Face the Nation: President Trump escalates his anti- immigration crackdown after the deadly shooting of National Guard troops in D.C. And, as the president's team pushes for peace in Ukraine, the pressure campaign on Venezuela intensifies.",
      "The horrific shooting in Washington, D.C., allegedly by an Afghan national, left one National Guard member dead and another fighting for his life, angering President Trump, who accused the Biden administration of allowing thousands of Afghans into the country without proper vetting.",
      "(Begin VT)",
      "NANCY CORDES: Your DOJ I.G. just reported this year that there was thorough vetting by DHS and by the FBI of these Afghans who were brought into the U.S., so why do you blame the Biden administration for what this man did?",
      "DONALD TRUMP (President of the United States): Because they let him in. Are you stupid?",
      "NANCY CORDES: Well, no.",
      "PRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP: Are you a stupid person? Because they came in to - - on a plane, along with thousands of other people that shouldn't be here.",
      "(End VT)",
      "NANCY CORDES: Investigators have yet to find a clear motive behind the shooting, but President Trump isn't waiting. He's halting immigration from Afghanistan and elsewhere. We will bring you the latest on the shooting and the policy response.",
      "Plus: Russia launches a massive drone and missile strike on Kyiv, defying the U.S. push for peace in Ukraine.",
      "And the president warns commercial planes to clear the airspace over Venezuela. Is that a sign of an imminent attack by the U.S.?",
      "We will get the latest on both fronts from Republican Congressman Mike Turner and Democratic Senator Tim Kaine.",
      "And we will check in with President Trump's top economic adviser, Kevin Hassett, on the biggest shopping weekend of the year and get a reality check on the worsening hunger crisis with Feeding America CEO Claire Babineaux-Fontenot.",
      "It's all just ahead on Face the Nation.",
      "Good morning, and welcome to Face the Nation. Margaret is off today.",
      "As Thanksgiving weekend draws to a close, for some, the holiday shopping spree is officially under way, while others are braving the crowds at airports and on highways to get home.",
      "Here in Washington, a simmering debate over immigration and national security has boiled over following the shooting of two National Guard members.",
      "Our homeland security and justice correspondent, Nicole Sganga, is here with the latest.",
      "You have been out front on this story, Nicole. What's the latest?",
      "NICOLE SGANGA: The targeted attack just blocks away from the White House killed 20-year-old Army Specialist Sarah Beckstrom. This morning, Air Force Staff Sergeant Andrew Wolfe remains in critical condition, fighting for his life.",
      "Moments ago, Attorney General Pam Bondi and Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem said Rahmanullah Lakanwal may have been radicalized on American soil, but argued the attack was the consequence of failed vetting.",
      "(Begin VT)",
      "NICOLE SGANGA (voice-over): The investigation is under way. Intelligence analysts are now tasked with combing through the suspect's devices and online presence for signs of radicalization.",
      "So far, sources tell CBS News there have been no confirmed extremist ties. Rahmanullah Lakanwal served for eight years on a CIA-backed Zero Unit team, an Afghan paramilitary outfit notorious for intense combat and high-risk raids.",
      "U.S. and Afghan officials tell CBS News the suspect had been deeply disturbed by casualties in his unit and more recently troubled by the killing of his close friend by armed men in Pakistan. Lakanwal first entered the U.S. in 2021 under Operation Allies Welcome following the fall of Kabul.",
      "The 29-year-old was granted asylum in the U.S. this April. Now he faces first-degree murder charges. A 2025 Justice Department audit found only 55 evacuees arriving to the U.S. under the program were flagged by terrorism- screening databases. Last year, just nine remained on the watch list.",
      "This weekend, D.C. police accompanied National Guard on their street patrols. Governor Patrick Morrisey oversees West Virginia's National Guard.",
      "What do you say to Americans who are watching this play out and, in the wake of this tragedy, they might feel like Guardsmen now have a target on their back?",
      "GOVERNOR PATRICK MORRISEY (R-West Virginia): I think people who question the mission should look at what's happened in Washington, D.C., and you had a city that had a lot of problems with crime, and there have been clear and meaningful reductions. I think that matters a lot.",
      "(End VT)",
      "NICOLE SGANGA: President Trump has ordered 500 more National Guard members to D.C., bringing the total to nearly 3,000 troops.",
      "And, on Friday, the U.S. directed immigration officers to pause all asylum decisions, leaving over two million applicants in limbo, Nancy.",
      "NANCY CORDES: Nicole Sganga, thank you so much for staying on top of this.",
      "And for more on the vetting of the suspect before he entered the country, we are joined now by Samantha Vinograd, who is a former top counterterrorism official at the Department of Homeland Security under President Biden and was deeply involved in the process for screening and vetting. She is now a national security contributor here at CBS News.",
      "Sam, so good to have you with us.",
      "Just this morning, the attorney general said that this suspect entered the U.S. with minimal to little vetting. Is that accurate?",
      "SAMANTHA VINOGRAD: Well, Nancy, I'm happy to talk about the vetting.",
      "But, at this point, we don't have indications that the horrific tragedy was a result of a vetting failure. Instead, the attorney general also said this morning it appears the individual was radicalized once here. And let's be clear on what the vetting system is and what it isn't.",
      "The vetting system is a system in which an individual's identifiers, their biographic information and biometric information, iris scans, fingerprints, facial images, are run against datasets of information about individuals with ties to terrorism and criminal history.",
      "The vetting system is not predictive of whether an individual with no derogatory information is or is not at some point going to become violent. What I can tell you is this. And I was involved in the process. Every Afghan evacuee underwent vetting overseas before they were cleared to be manifested for a flight to the United States.",
      "They underwent vetting once they were manifested for a flight at a port of entry before entering the United States. And then Afghan evacuees, including the suspect, were vetted again once in the U.S. by the Biden administration.",
      "And this suspect underwent the most comprehensive vetting under the current administration when he applied for asylum. That process would typically involve an interview and a review of social media handles.",
      "NANCY CORDES: OK, I hear what you're saying, but I want to read to you something that a DOJ inspector general report laid out earlier this year.",
      "They said that, when tens of thousands of Afghans arrived at once here in the U.S. at the end of the war \u2013 quote \u2013 \"The normal processes required to determine whether individuals posed a threat to national security and public safety were overtaken by the need to immediately evacuate and protect the lives of Afghans, increasing the potential that bad actors could try to exploit the expedited evacuation.\"",
      "Were there vetting corners that had to be cut here?",
      "SAMANTHA VINOGRAD: Well, during the Afghanistan withdrawal in the subsequent period, there were various priorities in place, certainly. We wanted to help our Afghan partners and bring at-risk Afghans here.",
      "But protecting national security and public safety was the foremost priority. And that's why a process was designed that vetted individuals overseas, but it was never intended to be a one-and-done. It was a multistage process with various U.S. government agencies.",
      "Afghan evacuees were vetted overseas by graphic and biometric vetting. And then there were other stages of vetting that occurred once individuals were here. So we have to put this vetting process in context.",
      "NANCY CORDES: Let's talk about this suspect specifically.",
      "What can you tell us about these so-called Zero Units that the suspect was a part of in Afghanistan? He worked with the CIA for years, right?",
      "SAMANTHA VINOGRAD: He did, which means that he was vetted by the CIA prior to beginning work in the Zero Unit, which was a paramilitary and intelligence force that partnered with the CIA incredibly closely on some very intense missions.",
      "So this suspect reportedly underwent vetting by the CIA for the first time over a decade ago. He had highly specialized training. He did undergo vetting at the time that he started working with the CIA and went on some very complex missions. These units were accused of certain human rights abuses.",
      "NANCY CORDES: And, as you pointed out, the attorney general did say this morning that it's believed that the shooter was radicalized here in the United States.",
      "The AP is now reporting that his behavior deteriorated so sharply in recent months that a community advocate was afraid that he was suicidal. Where does this investigation go from here?",
      "SAMANTHA VINOGRAD: Well, this horrific tragedy could be the result of an individual that quickly mobilized to violence without any ties to foreign terrorism. And as we have discussed in other cases, trying to find lone actors before they initiate an attack is harder than trying to find a needle in a haystack.",
      "That work, trying to find a lone actor who's mobilizing to violence quickly, involves intelligence, law enforcement, and counterterrorism officials here in the U.S., not vetting experts, but here in the U.S. at all levels of government, federal, state, and local, to try to find size \u2013 signs that an individual is mobilizing to violence and try to get them help before they actually initiate an attack.",
      "NANCY CORDES: When the president says that he wants to have everyone who came in here to the United States from Afghanistan, about 90,000 people, rescreened, reexamined, how would that work? And does DHS have the resources to do that?",
      "SAMANTHA VINOGRAD: Well, to be very clear, DHS is not the only entity involved in vetting. Various members of the counterterrorism, law enforcement, and intelligence community perform vetting.",
      "I do have questions about the number of resources available to engage in that exercise, just based upon resource constraints within the federal government. But it is possible. It will take time. But, to be clear, Afghan evacuees have been re-vetted since coming to the United States. They were re-vetted under the Biden administration.",
      "And then, as they have adjusted their status to asylum or other things, they had to go through already other vetting processes.",
      "NANCY CORDES: You know, you talk about this suspect and trying to find signs that he was radicalized. How will investigators go about doing that?",
      "SAMANTHA VINOGRAD: Well, investigators are certainly already speaking to individuals that knew the suspect, friends, family, co-workers, the organizations that helped support him in the community.",
      "And we don't yet know, Nancy, whether this individual was known to law enforcement in his community. I think we will learn that in the coming days.",
      "NANCY CORDES: Great insight.",
      "SAMANTHA VINOGRAD: Thanks, Nancy.",
      "NANCY CORDES: Sam Vinograd, CBS News contributor, thank you so much.",
      "SAMANTHA VINOGRAD: Thank you.",
      "NANCY CORDES: And Face the Nation will be back in one minute. Stay with us.",
      "(ANNOUNCEMENTS)",
      "NANCY CORDES: We're joined now by Ohio Republican Congressman Mike Turner.",
      "Congressman, thanks for being with us. Happy Thanksgiving.",
      "REPRESENTATIVE MIKE TURNER (R-Ohio): Thank you, Nancy. Happy Thanksgiving to you also.",
      "NANCY CORDES: So, you heard what Sam Vinograd just had to say about the vetting process. You've also heard what administration officials are saying about it.",
      "Do you believe that this was a failure of vetting, or do you believe this is someone who just became radicalized or became mentally disturbed here in the United States?",
      "REPRESENTATIVE MIKE TURNER: Nancy, this is very difficult, because, I mean, this is classic terrorism. And this is where an individual who tries to break the heart of a nation who does an act, a murderous act, right before Thanksgiving, and the \u2013 I think what Samantha is missing in all of this is that we didn't go to Afghanistan to bring Afghanis here.",
      "We went to Afghanistan to kill Osama bin Laden, to dismantle and destroy al Qaeda, to avenge 9/11, to dismantle and to overthrow the Taliban, and to ensure that Afghanistan was no longer a safe haven for terrorism.",
      "What occurred is that the Biden administration allowed Afghanistan to fall and fled, and, in doing so, then found itself in a situation where those who had been aiding us were then at risk, and in doing so made the decision\u2026",
      "NANCY CORDES: You don't think they would have been at risk either way?",
      "REPRESENTATIVE MIKE TURNER: No, they were \u2013 their intention was that they would be still there, that Afghanistan would no longer be a safe haven for terrorists, that it would not be returned to the Taliban, and there would not be a need for those people to be evacuated.",
      "You wouldn't see American planes on the tarmac, as you showed, with people running to try to get on them. By the way, those planes wouldn't be being chased by people if they were on their way to China or Russia. They were on their way to America, and those people were fleeing what the Biden administration was allowing to unfold, which is that it would once again be a nation that would be at risk to us.",
      "And so, you know, that's how you get to the situation where those individuals are at risk. Now, obviously, the vetting was flawed. By your own report, you showed that individuals who were on our known terrorist watch list made it into this country through that process, so, obviously, that the vetting process\u2026",
      "NANCY CORDES: But then they were \u2013 then they were identified\u2026",
      "(CROSSTALK)",
      "REPRESENTATIVE MIKE TURNER: But they made it in. They made it in, right?",
      "NANCY CORDES: Yes.",
      "REPRESENTATIVE MIKE TURNER: They made it into this country. So, obviously, the process was flawed, and it was also a process that should have been unnecessary, if there hadn't been this hasty fall of Afghanistan, which the Biden administration had promised us all that they were not going to run for the exits.",
      "And they not only ran for the exits. They did so at night. You know, Congress was \u2013 you know, after hearing, after hearing, you know, raised the issues of the manner in which the Biden administration fled and what the consequences would be. And we're all living with those consequences. Now, the investigation is under way.",
      "NANCY CORDES: Weren't their hands tied in part by the fact that Trump had cut a deal with the Taliban promising to leave by a certain date?",
      "REPRESENTATIVE MIKE TURNER: No, their hands were not tied. The manner in which they did so \u2013 and Congress did a number of investigations and a number of hearings and filed a number of reports that showed that it was the actions of the Biden administration, the manner in which they completely withdrew.",
      "But that investigation is under way. It's going to be underway as to this individual, and I think we all need to wait for that investigation to be concluded.",
      "NANCY CORDES: The president has called for 500 more National Guard troops to be sent to the nation's capital. Your state has already contributed 150.",
      "Do you believe that more troops being deployed is the answer, or do you think it's time to wind this deployment down?",
      "REPRESENTATIVE MIKE TURNER: Well, when you ask, is that the answer, you have to first talk about what the question is.",
      "And the question is, is there a national issue of \u2013 of crime and safety? And, certainly, the American people, by all polls, indicate that people are experiencing it and report that there is. And, certainly, in the nation's capital, there has been.",
      "There has been unbelievable reports of just the \u2013 the criminal activity, those \u2013 the \u2013 those individuals who have succumbed to, you know, violent crime. And, certainly, there's been a reporting that the National Guard presence has made a difference.",
      "NANCY CORDES: Right, no question, I think crime is down 30 percent, something like that, in D.C. in the last four months.",
      "I want to turn to Ukraine now\u2026",
      "REPRESENTATIVE MIKE TURNER: Yes.",
      "NANCY CORDES: \u2026 another issue very important to you.",
      "A team of Ukrainian negotiators is meeting right now in Miami with Secretary of State Marco Rubio, Special Envoy Steve Witkoff. What's your understanding of where the negotiations stand right now? There were concerns initially that the White House plan was too pro-Russia. Do you still have those concerns?",
      "REPRESENTATIVE MIKE TURNER: Well, I think we all have those concerns.",
      "The \u2013 the \u2013 you know, the president's goal of peace is incredibly important, and we saw today with Secretary Rubio his statement of, you know, we have to have a strong and sovereign Ukraine.",
      "And I \u2013 and that's everyone's goal and the \u2013 and certainly a prosperous Ukraine. And we saw the Ukrainian representative there, who is, you know, committed. And we certainly think and I think everyone thinks that President Zelenskyy is committed to peace.",
      "But, you know, one thing that I think everybody understands is that you can't have \u2013 you can't be America first and pro-Russia, because Russia has \u2013 is a self-declared adversary of the United States. It's fielding new advanced nuclear weapons that are specifically targeting the United States.",
      "It's constantly attacking the United States with offensive cyber. It continuously identifies both NATO and the West, the United States as its adversary. So, in this \u2013 and, of course, when it identifies Ukraine as its adversary, it does so in identifying the West and the United States as its adversary.",
      "You have to understand that the balance of this \u2013 this peace arrangement has to be one where you have to look at Russia as a skeptical adversary.",
      "NANCY CORDES: Speaking of the question of being pro-Russian, this week, Bloomberg got a hold of this transcript of a call between Steve Witkoff, the special envoy, and a Putin adviser, in which Witkoff appeared to be coaching the Russian on how to win over President Trump.",
      "And there are several Republicans that have great concerns about that. Brian Fitzpatrick of Pennsylvania called it a major problem. Don Bacon of Nebraska said Witkoff fully favors the Russians and should be fired.",
      "What do you think?",
      "REPRESENTATIVE MIKE TURNER: Well, the part that concerned me most is that there appeared to be an orchestration of giving Putin an opportunity to speak to Trump before President Zelenskyy was on his way to the White House.",
      "And I wouldn't want any orchestration of lessening President Zelenskyy's relationship with Trump, because it's very important when you have negotiations that \u2013 especially as you have, you know, in this instance, Russia is being, you know, obviously, unbelievably murderous of the Ukrainian people.",
      "It is an aggressive authoritarian regime in this. It's killing civilians. It is \u2013 it is not just \u2013 this is not a military-against-military action. They are bombing into Ukraine and murderously killing civilians in Ukraine.",
      "The \u2013 the Ukrainian people are being subjected to this, and the \u2013 President Trump needs to be able to hear Zelenskyy's voice clearly, and not just the authoritarian, murderous Putin.",
      "NANCY CORDES: So, given your concerns, should Witkoff continue to serve as one of the main U.S. negotiators here, and he \u2013 should he be sent by President Trump to Moscow this week to meet with Putin?",
      "REPRESENTATIVE MIKE TURNER: I \u2013 I think you can't take just one slice of someone's conversation during a long, stretched-out aspect of negotiations as reflective, but I think it's certainly important that, when we do get that opportunity, that our voices are heard of caution and concern.",
      "And the orchestration of inserting Putin's voice before Zelenskyy is very concerning, and I think the White House should be very concerned about any efforts to orchestrate Putin's voice at the White House before Zelenskyy's, because Ukraine's sovereignty and security needs to be preeminent.",
      "And we heard that this morning from Rubio, and that needs to be the focus.",
      "NANCY CORDES: And President Trump said this was just regular dealmaking.",
      "I want to turn to Venezuela, because you're on the House Armed Services Committee. We've all been watching the military buildup in the waters around Venezuela. Just yesterday, the president said airlines should consider Venezuelan airspace closed.",
      "Do you take that to mean that a military operation is imminent?",
      "REPRESENTATIVE MIKE TURNER: Well, the president did not say that, and the president certainly has not given Congress any notice that that is going to occur.",
      "And he certainly has not made the case. There is a buildup that the president has not explained in a way that relates solely to the actions that are currently going down in the Caribbean and with respect to the drug trade that the president has been discussing with Congress. It is certainly a significant concern in Congress.",
      "NANCY CORDES: \"The Washington Post\" is reporting that, before the strike on the very first suspected drug boat in September, Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth ordered that everyone on board be killed, and then, when two of the 11 people on board survived, a follow-on strike was ordered to finish them off in the water.",
      "Now, some law of war experts are saying that that was illegal, that killing people who are no longer able to fight is a war crime. What is your view and what questions do you have for the Pentagon?",
      "REPRESENTATIVE MIKE TURNER: Congress does not have information that that had occurred. Both the chairman of the Senate Armed Services Committee, chairman of the House Armed Services Committee, and ranking members have opened investigations.",
      "Obviously, if that occurred, that would be \u2013 be very serious, and I agree that that would \u2013 would be an illegal act. That is not the legal opinion or the information or the legal justification, the acts that have been described to Congress that are being undertaken in \u2013 in this.",
      "There are very serious concerns in Congress about the attacks on the so- called drug boats down in the Caribbean and the Pacific, and the legal justification has been provided. But this is \u2013 is completely outside of anything that has been discussed with Congress, and there is an ongoing investigation.",
      "NANCY CORDES: Very interesting to hear you say that this might be an illegal act. I know your committee is asking more questions. We'd love to learn what you find out.",
      "Congressman Mike Turner of Ohio, thank you so much for being with us.",
      "REPRESENTATIVE MIKE TURNER: Thank you, Nancy.",

      "And we'll be right back with a lot more Face the Nation. Stay with us.",
      "(ANNOUNCEMENTS)",
      "NANCY CORDES: Some sad news out of California overnight. Four people were killed and 10 others hurt when a gunman opened fire during a family celebration at a banquet hall in Stockton, California. The local sheriff's office says early indications suggest the shooting was targeted.",
      "A suspect has not been identified and is still at large. Police are urging anyone with any information that may be helpful to come forward.",
      "We will be right back.",
      "(ANNOUNCEMENTS)",
      "NANCY CORDES: We will be right back with Virginia Democratic Senator Tim Kaine, White House economic adviser Kevin Hassett, and Feeding America CEO Claire Babineaux-Fontenot.",
      "Stay with us.",
      "(ANNOUNCEMENTS)",
      "NANCY CORDES: Welcome back to \"FACE THE NATION.\"",
      "We're joined by Virginia Democratic Senator Tim Kaine.",
      "Senator, thanks so much for being with us.",
      "SENATOR TIM KAINE (D-VA): Absolutely, Nancy.",
      "NANCY CORDES: I want to start out by asking you about the situation in Venezuela because there are now serious signs that military action, including potentially ground action, could be imminent. You have tried twice to pass war powers resolutions that would force President Trump to get approval from Congress first before any military action. Twice you have failed. Do you think the numbers on this will change if there is ground action and will it even matter at that point?",
      "SENATOR TIM KAINE: I do \u2013 I do believe the numbers will change. You're right, I, along with others, filed a resolution, no war in Venezuela or against Venezuela without congressional approval. It failed. But that was before all of these assets have amassed around Venezuela and before President Trump said that the airspace needs to be closed. I will move with colleagues, Senator Schumer, Senator Paul, Senator Schiff, immediately should there be military action.",
      "And then secondly, I also attempted to stop the, what I view as illegal boat strikes in the Caribbean and the Pacific, together with Adam Schiff. And the circumstances have changed in the months since we had that vote. In each of these instances, we were able to get two Republicans to vote together with Democrats. We think the escalating pace and some of the recent revelations, so, for example, the recent revelation about the kill everyone order apparently dictated by Secretary Hegseth, we do believe that we will get more support for these motions when they are refiled.",
      "NANCY CORDES: You're referring to this new \"Washington Post\" report that says that Secretary Hegseth called for everyone aboard the first suspected drug boat that was targeted to be killed. When two people survived, the military went back in, reportedly, with a follow-on strike.",
      "What questions do you have for the Pentagon about that situation?",
      "SENATOR TIM KAINE: Well, first, if that reporting is true, it's a clear violation of the DOD's own laws of war, as well as international laws about the way you treat people who are in that circumstance. And so this rises to the level of a war crime if it's true. And the questions that we've been asking for months are, give us the evidence that the folks on board were really narco traffickers. In one instance, there were two survivors, one Columbian, one Ecuadorian in a different strike. Instead of arresting them and prosecuting them, the U.S. picked them up and returned them to their countries of origin, where they were released. So, if they were narco traffickers, why would we do that? We need more evidence about that. And we definitely need the administration to finally answer the question of why strike rather than interdict? If you know where the ships are, you can interdict. And when you do, you get evidence. You get individuals. You can squeeze them to give testimony against their higher ups. You get evidence with the drug seizures.",
      "And finally, the other question that my colleagues and I are deeply worried about, is the entire legal rationale for these strikes. We had to pry with a crowbar, after weeks and weeks, out of the administration the supposed legal rationale for the strikes in international waters. It was very shoddy because it's classified. I can't tell you what's in it, but I can tell you it was not at all persuasive that these are legal actions. And so together with a whole series of things, the early retirement of the head of SOUTHCOM, the news that the SOUTHCOM's lead attorney said these strikes were not lawful, the decision of allies, like the U.K., to stop sharing intelligence with the United States in this area because they believe the strikes are illegal. It's time for Congress to reign in a president who is deciding to wage war on his own say so, which is not what the Constitution allows.",
      "NANCY CORDES: Yes, a lot of lawmakers on both sides have questions that are similar to the ones you're raising.",
      "On a related note, President Trump just announced this weekend that he plans to pardon former Honduras President Juan Orlando Hernandez, who was accused of conspiring with drug cartels to move 400 tons of cocaine from Honduras to the U.S. he's currently serving a 45-year sentence. Were you surprised by the president's plan to pardon him given how strongly the president feels about drugs coming from other countries like Venezuela?",
      "SENATOR TIM KAINE: This is shocking. And again, this is not an individual who was accused of running drugs to the United States. He was convicted in a federal court in the United States. One of the bits of evidence was his statement that was picked up by those near to him that he wanted to shove drugs up the nose of gringos and flood the United States with cocaine. More than 400 tons.",
      "He was the leader of one of the largest criminal enterprises that has ever been subject to a conviction in U.S. courts. And less than one year into his sentence, President Trump is pardoning him, suggesting that President Trump cares nothing about narco trafficking. Suggesting possibly that pardons are now for sale by this White House. And if he doesn't care about narco trafficking, and this was also shown earlier this year with the pardoning of Ross Ulbricht, then what is this Venezuela thing really about?",
      "The president of Columbia has said that he think it's about the U.S. trying to seize oil assets in Venezuela. I lived in Honduras for years as a missionary way back when. The conspiracy theories are running wild in the Americas about why this military effort is so important to the president when he's pardoning drug kingpins who are running drugs into the United States. These are also questions that we're going to have to dig deeply into when we return to Washington tomorrow.",
      "NANCY CORDES: I want to ask you about some big developments in Washington this week. The Trump administration is making big changes in the wake of this tragic shooting of two National Guard members. They are halting all asylum decisions. They are halting Afghan immigration applications. The president says he wants a permanent pause to immigration from what he calls third world countries. We don't know how many countries. Do they have a case that it makes sense to put some of these processes on hold while they figure out what happened here?",
      "SENATOR TIM KAINE: Well, you know, first, let's just acknowledge this sad fact. These two Guards members, Ms. Beckstrom and Mr. Wolfe. What a tragedy for them and their families. And you know what? They should have been at home at Thanksgiving celebrating Thanksgiving with their families, not deployed in a political deployment to do law enforcement in D.C. that the D.C. police and other local law enforcement agencies can do.",
      "And this demonstrates yet again something we've seen so often. Our troops, including our Guards members, they're going to serve in brave and courageous and self-sacrificing ways. And we can about so proud of them.",
      "But the orders that they get from their civilian leaders, that's where the problem comes in. Whether it's a Hegseth order to kill them all or an order to send Guards men and women, in a political stunt deployment to cities around the country, these two individuals should have been celebrating Thanksgiving with their families. And I just mourn for them and all who suffer as a result.",
      "The president's decision to say, OK, this particular criminal, who should be prosecuted to the full extent of the law, who came in under an asylum grant that President Trump and his administration decided this past summer, that now we're going to pause processes or asylum from 19, quote, \"third world countries,\" we don't know which ones they are, you shouldn't paint with a broad brush. Go after a criminal to the full extent of the law, but don't say that all Afghans in the United States, those who served with our military and who lost their lives and their health and their families in many ways by doing so, don't say that they're all bad. Don't say that people who come from third-world countries are bad.",
      "Virginia, about one out of nine of us is an immigrant. And our immigrant communities in Virginia have been an enormous source of strength to our commonwealth and to our country. And it's wrong to target them all for the bad actions of an individual, just like we wouldn't target other communities in the United States for the bad actions of one individual.",
      "NANCY CORDES: Something tells me this is going to be a big topic of conversation in Congress this week.",
      "SENATOR TIM KAINE: It will.",
      "NANCY CORDES: Senator Kaine, I really appreciate you being with us and Happy Thanksgiving.",
      "SENATOR TIM KAINE: So glad we could do it. Thanks.",
      "NANCY CORDES: And we'll be right back.",
      "(ANNOUNCEMENTS)",
      "NANCY CORDES: We turn now to the director of the White House National Economic Council, Kevin Hassett.",
      "Kevin, thanks so much for being with us.",
      "KEVIN HASSETT (Director, White House National Economic Council): Great to be here.",
      "NANCY CORDES: So, we've all eaten the turkey.",
      "KEVIN HASSETT: Yes.",
      "NANCY CORDES: Holiday shopping has begun in earnest. So, let's talk about what the holiday shopping season looks like. We've got new surveys from Goldman Sachs and Bank of America that paint a modest picture of the holiday spending outlook. They say low and middle income Americans are planning to pull back a little bit because they perceive that prices are higher. And they say, if spending is up this year, it's going to be because goods in part are more expensive. Is this the temporary result or long-term result of the Trump tariffs?",
      "KEVIN HASSETT: Right. Well, what we've seen \u2013 those were reports about what people anticipated would happen over the Thanksgiving weekend. But we now have hard data for Black Friday and even for Saturday. And the online sales were up almost 10 percent, in-store sales were up four percent. It was really a blockbuster weekend after Thanksgiving.",
      "And so I think that the folks who were saying, wow, maybe people are going to be anxious about, you know, going back and getting presents for the kids and so on, they've been disproven this weekend. And I think the reason is that people \u2013 incomes are up this year. We had a great jobs report. And with strong income and the government shutdown over so that people presumably have a little pent-up demand as well, I think that we're looking at a great recovery from a weak few weeks because of the shutdown.",
      "NANCY CORDES: Sure. I'm wondering how much of that spending increase you think is attributable to the fact that prices are up? Let me give you an example. The maker of Tonka trucks said a couple of days ago that a toy truck that cost $30 last year is going to cost $40 this year, partly because they lost about eight weeks of shipping due to the U.S. trade war with China.",
      "What's your advice to holiday shoppers who don't want to spend more this year than they did last year, or can't afford to spend more?",
      "KEVIN HASSETT: Right. Well, as you know, it depends on what you're looking at. Like, egg prices are down. Gasoline prices dropped below $2 a gallon in a lot of places. Mortgage rates are down.",
      "NANCY CORDES: You mean below \u2013",
      "KEVIN HASSETT: Yes, mortgage rates are down.",
      "NANCY CORDES: Gas prices, on average, are still at $3 a gallon across the country, right?",
      "KEVIN HASSETT: Yes, that's right. For a few states, they got \u2013 they got below $2. And so the point is just that, in the end, what matters is, in the aggregate, the average across everything that everybody buys. And that averaged about 5 percent under Joe Biden and is a little bit above 2.5 percent, about cut in half for President Trump.",
      "And the bottom line, though, is really that wages have been growing faster than prices, and that's why real incomes this year are up by about $1,200 so far. That's why we can have a great Black Friday and a great Thanksgiving sales weekend because people feel like they have more money in their pockets. Even though, you're right, there are some things that cost most and some things that cost less. But on average, we're about half the inflation rate of Joe Biden.",
      "NANCY CORDES: Polls show that the public, despite some of the data you're presenting, is getting more skeptical. In our latest CBS News poll, 68 percent of Americans said they believe that President Trump's policies are pushing grocery prices up. They're up about 1.4 percent year to date. And economic sentiment, the number of people who think the economy is good, has actually dropped six points since he took office.",
      "How do you explain that?",
      "KEVIN HASSETT: Well, first of all, you mentioned, quite accurately, the 1.4 percent increase in grocery prices. I think the interesting thing about that is that that's way below the Fed's target of two for everything else, right? And so you'd have to concede that 1.4 percent is very, very low inflation.",
      "And so I think that the bottom line is that we've got the big, beautiful bill cutting taxes on overtime, taxes for tips and so on. And all that money is going to start to be in people's pockets. And that's why they're optimistic about next year.",
      "Scott Bessent said last week that he's looking at the first half of next year that could be in the four percent range. And the reason is that we passed the tax cuts in July and so they didn't have time to change all the tax forms and everything. And so people are going to get really, really big refunds in the fall as well.",
      "And so we're really optimistic. And we think that the good news around Thanksgiving is a sign of something that's even stronger to come.",
      "NANCY CORDES: You mentioned purchasing power. One thing that is going to affect purchasing power for 22 million Americans is the expiration of Obamacare premium subsidies. Last week a funny situation. The White House floated this plan to extend the subsidies for two years. Then you dropped the proposal. And then the president said, on Air Force One, \"somebody said I wanted to extend it for two years. I don't want to extend it for two years. I'd rather not extend them at all.\"",
      "Was this a case of the right hand not talking to the left hand?",
      "KEVIN HASSETT: No, I think that people were talking to each other. But what happened, as you know, as a professional journalist, is that sometimes people leak pre-decisional things that are confidential and pre-decisional. And I think that somebody did that. And then it rolled back because it hadn't been through the whole process.",
      "But President Trump has been clear that he's very concerned about the cost of health care. And that's why we had $50 million for rural hospitals in big, beautiful bill, why we tried to get $30 billion in for cost sharing and the Democrats didn't like that. They had an alternative approach.",
      "And so, I think that what we're going to see now, between now and Christmas, is that people are going to work this out because we have a solution \u2013 the White House has a solution for cost sharing and the Democrats have an alternative. And, you know, people don't want \u2013 you know, for the few seniors that have really, really massive increases to see those.",
      "But don't forget, the vast majority of people in the Affordable Care Act are getting their insurance for less than $50 a month. And so while this is an issue that needs to be worked out, we don't want to cause panic for the folks who are worried that they're going to lose the thing that they have. It's really just the very, very high cost people who are, you know, closer to retirement age that have the problem.",
      "NANCY CORDES: \"Bloomberg\" is reporting, as I'm sure you know, that you are now considered the frontrunner to replace Fed Reserve Chair Jay Powell when his term expires in the spring. Secretary Bessent, who is heading up this search, said he was holding final interviews this week. How did yours go?",
      "KEVIN HASSETT: You know, I am not sure that \"Bloomberg\" has the story right. I'm really honored to be amongst a group of really great candidates. The thing that I was most impressed about this week when that story leaked was that really I think the news for markets was that President Trump is close to announcing a new person who's going to replace Jay Powell. And if you look at the market response to that, it was very, very positive. We had a great Treasury auction. Interest rates went down.",
      "And so, I think that the American people could expect President Trump to pick somebody who's going to help them, you know, have cheaper car loans and easier access to mortgages at lower rates. And that's what we saw in the market response to the rumor about me, which, you know, is probably about as valuable as the rumor about the health care policy that we just talked about.",
      "NANCY CORDES: Well, I guess we'll find out if they're right, sooner rather than later, when we hear the president's decision.",
      "KEVIN HASSETT: Right. That's true.",
      "NANCY CORDES: So, for now, director of the White House National Economic Council, that's your title today, Kevin Hassett, thank you so much.",
      "KEVIN HASSETT: Yes. Thank you.",
      "NANCY CORDES: And we'll be back in a moment.",
      "(ANNOUNCEMENTS)",
      "NANCY CORDES: We turn now to the fight against hunger in the United States. According to government data, 47.4 million people lived in what the Department of Agriculture calls a food insecure household in 2023. That's when a household can't necessarily obtain enough food to feed all of its members.",
      "One of the largest groups working to combat food insecurity is Feeding America. And we're joined now by CEO Claire Babineaux-Fontenot, who is in Charleston, South Carolina, this morning.",
      "Claire, thanks so much for being with us and Happy Thanksgiving.",
      "CLAIRE BABINEAUX-FONTENOT (CEO, Feeding America): Thanks for having me back.",
      "NANCY CORDES: Absolutely.",
      "So, during the shutdown, we saw these incredibly long lines at food banks. The shutdown has now been over for a couple of weeks. SNAP benefits are going out again. But even before the shutdown, food insecurity was at its highest rate in nearly a decade. So, what is the situation now that you're seeing at food banks around the country as we head into the holidays?",
      "CLAIRE BABINEAUX-FONTENOT: Yes. So, I'm so glad that you made that point. I think your viewers may be surprised to learn that food insecurity rates before the shutdown were higher than at any point during the pandemic as an example.",
      "We're continuing to see very high demand. I think part of the reason is because the fastest growing group of people turning to the charitable food system are people who don't even qualify for any federal nutrition programs. So, this is an area that we've got to stay focused on. We know the kinds of things that work. We need to do those things so that we can really address what's happening with hunger and poverty in the country.",
      "NANCY CORDES: What do you think is contributing to the rise in hunger and this group of people who, as you say, don't qualify for benefits but are showing an increased need for food?",
      "CLAIRE BABINEAUX-FONTENOT: Yes, I think it's that the system is broken. Right now there's so many people, if you can imagine, in this country who can't afford to get a raise at work because we have a system that does not incentivize people to continue to move up the ladder. We've got ladders with big \u2013 missing rungs, if you will. So, we can do something about that. We could have a sliding scale, for instance, that allows people to move out of poverty. By doing that, because food insecurity is actually a symptom of poverty, they'll move out of that as well.",
      "We, as a nation, should all want people to be able to provide for themselves. We should all want them to be able to get work that they can feel proud of and support their families with. We have the power to do all of those things. It will require that we work together, that we be honest about what's broken, and that we really get committed about fixing those things.",
      "NANCY CORDES: What are the main challenges that the organizations in your network are facing this holiday season as they try to feed people who are hungry? Is the food there for the people who need it?",
      "CLAIRE BABINEAUX-FONTENOT: Yes, unfortunately, the lines are longer than the food that is available. And one of the hardest things to witness will be seeing these people who have the same dreams, aspirations for their kids and themselves as I have for mine, and all of your viewers have for theirs, feeling the need to turn to the charitable food system. It takes a lot of courage and resiliency and commitment to family off times to be able to do that. And then for them to turn up, in spite of all of those barriers and not \u2013 us not be able to provide them with what they really need.",
      "So, I have a deep respect for people experiencing hunger in this country. I have been a person who has experienced hunger before. I know many people who have, many people who still do. So many of them are my heroes.",
      "And then another set of heroes that I have are people working in this fight in the Feeding America network who show up, shoulder to shoulder with people experiencing hunger, who are so deeply committed to their wellbeing. So, we need to position people experiencing hunger to be able to fend for themselves, and we need to position food banks to be able to provide them with the support that they need in this moment until they get there.",
      "NANCY CORDES: As you know, there are about two million Americans who are going to be affected by changes to the SNAP program that were made earlier this year in a vote by Congress. They will not be receiving SNAP benefits any longer. What are the economic implications of that? And in about 30 seconds, what can your organizations do about it?",
      "CLAIRE BABINEAUX-FONTENOT: According to the Congressional Budget Office, we're probably looking at about a six billion meal per year gap that's going to be created. So, the kinds of things that we ought to do, we ought to address fraud where it exists. We ought to incentivize people to be able to get the hand up that they need and to move out of poverty. We ought to address error rates. But we ought to do all of these things strategically, and we ought to do them in a bipartisan way. This ought to be the kind of thing that this country can come together around.",
      "NANCY CORDES: OK.",
      "CLAIRE BABINEAUX-FONTENOT: And we can hold hands, shoulder to shoulder, because when \u2013 people experiencing hunger when we all do.",
      "NANCY CORDES: Claire Babineaux-Fontenot, we have to leave it there. We've got a hard out. But thank you so much, Claire Babineaux-Fontenot from Feeding America. Thank you so much.",
      "We'll be right back.",

    "link": "https://www.cbsnews.com/news/national-guard-shooting-suspect-afghanistan-zero-units/",
    "published": "Sun, 30 Nov 2025 14:39:41 -0500",
    "summary": "The \"Zero Units\" were considered by the U.S. and its international partners to be among Afghanistan's most trusted domestic forces.",
    "story": [
      "An image of an ID badge circulating widely online that shows the suspect in the shooting of the National Guard members says he was assigned to the \"Kandahar Strike Force\" or \"03\" unit, one of a number of so-called \"Zero Units\" that worked closely with U.S. and other foreign forces during the war in Afghanistan. A former senior Afghan military source confirmed to CBS News that the ID badge is authentic.",
      "A U.S. official briefed on the shooting investigation and a former senior Afghan National Defense and Security Forces member told CBS News that the suspect, Rahmanullah Lakanwal, had been part of a \"Zero Unit,\" an Afghan intelligence unit and paramilitary force that worked with the CIA. The units were exclusively composed of\u00a0Afghan nationals\u00a0and operated under the umbrella of the National Directorate of Security, or NDS, the intelligence agency established with CIA backing for Afghanistan's previous, U.S.-backed government. They were considered by the U.S. and its international partners to be among the most trusted domestic forces in Afghanistan.",
      "Those units are often labeled \"death squads\" by human rights groups. The units were known in Afghanistan for their secrecy and alleged brutality, and members were implicated in numerous extrajudicial killings of civilians, particularly during night raids.",
      "The U.S. official briefed on the investigation confirmed the suspect had been disturbed by the casualties in this unit and, more recently, deeply troubled by the killing of his close friend overseas.",
      "The image of the ID badge also carries the words \"Firebase Gecko,\" which was the name of a base used by the CIA and special forces in Kandahar, in southern Afghanistan, inside what was previously the compound of the Taliban's founding leader, Mullah Mohammad Omar.",
      "CIA Director John Ratcliffe said Thursday the suspect had previously worked \"with the U.S. Government, including CIA, as a member of a partner force in Kandahar.\"",
      "Lt. Gen. Sami Sadat, a former commanding general of the Afghan National Special Operations Corps, told CBS News that Lakanwal worked for the \"03\" unit for eight years. A former senior Afghan general under the U.S.-backed government told CBS News on Thursday that \"03 unit, also known as The Kandahar Strike Force (KSF), was under special forces directorate of NDS. They were the most active and professional forces, trained and equipped by the CIA. All their operations were conducted under the CIA command.\" Lakanwal was part of the unit's operations team, Sadat said.",
      "\"He was known for being responsible and professional within his team and had strong anti-Taliban views,\" Sadat said.",
      "\"While we could not establish any connection between him and any terrorist organization, we also cannot completely rule it out,\" Sadat said. \"However, we can confirm that his background does not show any links to terrorists.\"",
      "Lakanwal's family faced serious threats from the Taliban, which led him to relocate them from their native Khost province to Kabul, Sadat said. In the U.S., Sadat said Lakanwal was \"generally calm and maintained a clean record, though he suffered from PTSD.\"",
      "As a member of a Zero Unit, the suspect would have been virtually guaranteed a route to asylum in the U.S. because members of these elite units were high on the list for\u00a0Taliban retaliation\u00a0after the group retook control of the country. Many members of these units played key roles in the August 2021\u00a0evacuation from Kabul, in return for a guarantee of space on a flight for themselves and their families out of Afghanistan.",
      "Samantha Vinograd, a CBS News contributor and former Department of Homeland Security counterterrorism official who worked under the Obama administration, said on \"Face the Nation with Margaret Brennan\" that Afghan evacuees were thoroughly vetted prior to arriving in the U.S. after its withdrawal.",

      "The prosecution laid out Kristil's final hours of life for the jury.",
      "Kate Armstrong: On December 14th of 2023, Kristil Krug started her day like any other day. \u2026 She took her younger two children to school.",
      "And when she returned \u2013",
      "Kate Armstrong: Kristil \u2026 pulled back into her garage. She gets out of the car \u2026 when she is attacked from behind.",
      "Peter Van Sant: And did she ever see him approaching, do you think? \u2026 Or was this an ambush?",
      "Stephanie Fritz: It was an ambush. \u2026 She had two or three skull fractures.",
      "Kate Armstrong: As she's laying on the floor bleeding, he \u2026 pushes her over, gets over her and stabs her \u2026 just above her heart.",
      "Peter Van Sant: And why do you suppose \u2014 he had to do that vicious last stab?",
      "Kate Armstrong: I think it was rage. I think it was control and power that he wanted to exert over Kristil.",
      "Dan Krug had been losing that control for a long time, say prosecutors. Their theory of the crime is that Dan sent Kristil those disturbing messages in an attempt to drive her closer to him and not leave, hoping she'd see him as her heroic protector.",
      "Kate Armstrong: It was not working \u2026 the stalking was not leading her back to him \u2026 I think it then turned to, 'I'm still losing her' kind of, uh, 'if I can't have you, nobody can.'\"",
      "The prosecution says that in the last days of her life, Kristil had begun to suspect that her stalker was possibly her husband.",
      "Stephanie Fritz: We know from Dan's own interview that she confronted him and said, \"I can't rule you out as the stalker.",
      "DAN KRUG (to detectives): She said that right to my face, that she wanted to know if it was me. And I told her no.",
      "Peter Van Sant: He felt the walls closing in.",
      "Stephanie Fritz: Closing in. He was going to lose Kristil anyway. \u2026 He was going to be exposed as the stalker. \u2026 So he did that last, uh, fatal act and murdered her.",
      "Prosecutors say Dan Krug tried to outsmart investigators \u2014 pre-programming those text messages on Kristil's phone before he left the house \u2014 assuming he wouldn't be caught.",
      "Kate Armstrong: Were we not able to discover that that was a delayed send text, it would have appeared as though Kristil was still alive when he left the house.",
      "At trial, the long list of digital evidence against Dan Krug was laid out: the threatening texts, the emails, the internet searches. Also included \u2014 that photograph of Dan arriving at his office, attached to a menacing email seemingly sent by Anthony Holland to Kristil. But there was one problem, according to the state's digital expert.",
      "Peter Van Sant: Who took this picture, do you believe?",
      "Randy Pihlak: Uh, Dan. Dan took this picture.",
      "Pihlak discovered that the phone which snapped that photo was in selfie mode using a timer \u2014 a fact that Kate Armstrong reminded the jury about in her closing argument. That's when the judge allowed cameras into the courtroom.",
      "KATE ARMSTRONG (in court): The phone was propped on the back of this vehicle next to him. \u2026 The defendant took this photograph and then he sent it to his wife.",
      "PHILLIP GEIGLE (in court): We respectfully disagree with the prosecution in this case.",
      "Defense attorney Phillip Geigle argued the murder investigation was poor. The blunt object used on Kristil's head and the knife used to stab her were never recovered by police. The defense also zeroed in on the fact that Kristil's phone was not tested for fingerprints or DNA.",
      "PHILLIP GEIGLE (in court): Why not the phone? \u2026 The prosecution wants to believe, \"Well, you know, there may not be a lot to be found there.\" Well, you won't know if you won't try.",
      "Geigle said other forensic tests supported his claim that Dan Krug is innocent.",
      "PHILLIP GEIGLE (in court): They submitted the chest swabs. \u2026 And you know whose DNA wasn't there? The person who lived in the house, the person who ate in the kitchen with them, the person who shared the living room, that idiot right there (points to Dan Krug).",
      "PHILLIP GEIGLE (in court): There is absolutely no physical evidence on Mr. Krug's clothing. \u2026 There's no blood found on that car inside or out. It's searched three times.",
      "In week three of the trial, the jurors began deliberations. After a day-and-a-half, verdicts were reached.",
      "Judge Priscilla Loew read the verdicts.",
      "JUDGE LOEW: We, the jury, find the defendant guilty of murder in the first degree. \u2026 We, the jury, find the defendant, guilty of count number two, stalking, extreme emotional distress.",
      "Krug was also found guilty of stalking with credible threat and criminal impersonation.",
      "Lars Grimsrud: Guilty, guilty, guilty, guilty. And at that point I think I started breathing again.",
      "Krug was later sentenced to life in prison without the possibility of parole on the murder charge, and an additional nine-and-a-half years for the stalking and impersonation counts. But right after his conviction, in a video call from jail, Dan Krug told his family that the jury got it wrong, saying the real killer remained at large and that his children could be the next targets.",
      "DAN KRUG (video call with family): I need them safe. I don't know where or who did this. Where he is or who he is. I need my children out of Colorado.",
      "Could Kristil Krug's Murder Have Been Prevented?",
      "As Daniel Krug began serving his life sentence, he continued making video calls to his parents and brother in the days immediately after his conviction. The man who viciously murdered his wife, terrorized his own children and lied to everyone, was seeking sympathy from his side of the family.",
      "DAN KRUG (video call with family): I'm probably sleeping like 16 hours a day because of the depression.",
      "PATRICIA KRUG: Mm-hmm.",
      "DAN KRUG: I sleep, I read and I cry. That's about it.",
      "PATRICIA KRUG: OK.",
      "Despite overwhelming digital evidence against him, Krug fell back to his old ways \u2014 lying to his loved ones \u2014 now claiming he was wrongly convicted.",
      "DAN KRUG (video call with family): They never produced a single piece of hard evidence.",
      "His brother, Jeremy Krug, gave Dan Krug a much-needed reality check \u2014 that the foundation of the family's loyalty had started to crack.",
      "JEREMY KRUG (video call with Dan Krug): Support is dwindling. You know, mom and dad want to believe you very much. I want to believe you very much. \u2026 There's a lot that's come out, um, and as imaginative as I can be with finding explanations and ways to theorize how that, you know this or that could have been, the, the reality, um, some of it is beyond even my creativity.",
      "The case that ended with a murder had begun with stalking and criminal impersonation of Anthony Holland. Which begs the question: what if Detective Martinez had acted on the information Kristil and the private investigator had uncovered.",
      "Anthony Holland: They should have found me right away. \u2026 They should have found me, they should have came to my house. They should approached me. They should have talked to me.",
      "But Detective Martinez chose not to call, telling \"48 Hours\" he didn't have enough evidence to do so, and was concerned a phone call could exacerbate the situation.",
      "Peter Van Sant: Is this something where you've kicked yourself about this?",
      "Det. Andrew Martinez: Uh, this case has, uh, haunted me since, um, it occurred. \u2026 And the outcome of this case has haunted me for the past two years.",
      "Peter Van Sant: And if you could get in a time machine, perhaps you'd make that call today?",
      "Det. Andrew Martinez: Absolutely.",
      "And Kristil's parents sympathize with Martinez and believe their daughter was doomed no matter what the outcome of his investigation.",
      "Lars Grimsrud: Inevitably, I think he was gonna kill her. \u2026 When someone sets their mind to do something like that and that's what the plan was \u2026 I don't think that would've stopped the murder from happening.",
      "Kristil's death has left a hole in the lives of those who experienced her love and joy for life.",
      "Anthony Holland: I've had lots of other girlfriends and I've never been in love with anybody else like her.",

    "story": [
      "If seeing the world through the eyes of artificial intelligence sounds appealing, a growing number of technology companies have just the thing: AI eyeglasses.",
      "The latest entrant is from Alibaba, which on Thursday started selling smart glasses that let wearers access the Chinese online retailer's Qwen AI app with the touch of a button. Consumers can use the device, dubbed Quark AI Glasses, to search the internet, automatically compile meeting notes, make payments, listen to music and manage their schedule, among other functions.",
      "Consumers can also use the glasses' built-in camera to snap a picture of a product and instantly price it on Alibaba's e-commerce site, Taobao. The glasses, which start at 3,799 yuan (roughly $537), are only available for purchase in China, according to Alibaba.",
      "Companies have been down this road before \u2014 often unsuccessfully. Google launched smart glasses, which could be used to search the web, get directions and record video, more than a decade ago. But the product failed to catch on, with consumers put off by the $1,500 price tag.",
      "After repositioning Google Glass as a tool for businesses, the Alphabet-owned company pulled the plug in 2023.",
      "Yet the idea of wearing a computer on your face, rather than carrying one around in your pocket in the form of a smartphone, never went away. Today, major tech players, including Amazon, Meta and Xiaomi, are all rolling out digital glasses, betting on AI as the \"killer app\" that wins over consumers. Dozens of smaller players are also entering the fray with a variety of products.",
      "In the U.S., Meta this summer teamed with eyewear maker Oakley to introduce AI glasses that lets users make calls, send and receive text messages, listen to music, stream video, translate foreign languages, and generally tap the internet via the company's AI app. Geared to athletes, the product starts at $399. Meta also offers AI glasses in a partnership with Ray-Ban.",
      "Such devices are attracting users beyond tech fans. For example, some visually impaired people are using Meta's smart glasses to connect with volunteers for real-time help completing tasks such as shopping or going through their mail.",
      "Although smart glasses remain a niche product, tech market researcher IDC forecasts steady growth, from global sales of 9.4 million units this year to nearly 20 million in 2029. Roughly 17% of online adults in the U.S report having tried smart glasses, according to Forrester, up from 4% in 2024.",
      "One obstacle AI eyewear will have to overcome to gain broader acceptance, according to security experts: privacy. Smart glasses capture, store and share personal data, while their capacity to record and stream video raises thorny questions about filming people without their consent, according to legal experts.",

      "\"When we see families unable to pay their utility bills, it raises alarm bells about a crisis of home heating and electricity, but it also raises alarm bells about people's ability to deal with their cost of living across the board,\" said Julie Margetta Morgan, president of The Century Foundation.",
      "Residential electricity prices rose by 10.5% between January and August 2025, one of the fastest increases in a decade, government data analyzed by the National Energy Assistance Directors Association (NEADA), an educational and policy organization, shows. Natural gas is still the most popular way Americans heat their homes, although a growing\u00a0share are using electricity.",
      "A combination of high interest rates, rising natural gas costs and an increase in demand from data centers has pushed up prices, according to NEADA.",
      "The issue will likely come into sharper focus this winter when millions of consumers face heating bills. NEADA predicts that Americans will see their energy bills rise nearly 8% this winter to an average of roughly $976 per month.",
      "More Americans at risk of shutoffs",
      "When people fail to pay their energy bills on time, it can lead to electricity shutoffs, or when a utility turns off a household's power until people pay the balance, along with a so-called reconnection fee.",
      "Most states have some sort of safeguard against utility shutoffs when the temperature dips below a certain level, but not all. States without cold-weather protection include Alaska, Florida, Hawaii, Kentucky, Nebraska, North Dakota, South Carolina, Tennessee and Utah, according to the Energy Justice Lab, a joint project of Indiana University and the University of Pennsylvania.",
      "Despite these protections, Americans are becoming increasingly vulnerable to shutoffs, experts told CBS News.",
      "While no official national count of utility cutoffs exists, NEADA estimates that 3.5 million American households had their power cut off at some point in 2024 based on public data reported by utility companies. That number is expected to swell to 4 million this year, NEADA estimates.",
      "\"Past due balances climbing, particularly for lower-income families, suggest that shutoffs are going to become much more prevalent,\" the Century Foundation's Margetta Morgan said.",
      "Con Edison, a utility serving New York City and Westchester County in New York, has cut off almost 168,000 customers at some point this year, according to data NEADA shared with CBS News. That's more than five times the number of shutoffs the utility reported last year.",
      "Most Americans whose power is cut off have services restored within a few days, according to Mark Wolfe, NEADA's executive director. Still, the shutoffs can create major disruptions to Americans' day-to-day lives as they lose refrigeration, internet and lighting. Pipes can also freeze, and residents could get sick if their apartments get too cold, Wolfe added.",
      "Shutoffs tend to have a bigger impact on low-income households, given they are already stretched thin by everyday expenses, Wolfe said. Many turn to payday lenders, friends and family or state forgiveness plans to cover reconnection costs or overdue bills, he added.",
      "\"When money is limited, people have to prioritize essentials like food and medicine, and utility bills become one of the few expenses they can postpone,\" Wolfe told CBS News. \"That flexibility gives them a small sense of control, but it also increases the risk of falling behind and facing shutoffs.\"",

    "link": "https://www.cbsnews.com/news/pope-leo-message-of-peace-to-lebanon-turkey/",
    "published": "Sun, 30 Nov 2025 21:14:42 -0500",
    "summary": "Pope Leo XIV is wrapping up his visit to Turkey before heading to Lebanon.",
    "story": [
      "Pope Leo XIV wrapped up his visit to Turkey on Sunday before heading to Lebanon, where he aimed to bring a message of hope to its long-suffering people and bolster a crucial Christian community in the Middle East. He preached similar messages of peace and unity, within his own Catholic community and more broadly, during his earlier stops in Turkey.",
      "Leo had two key appointments in Istanbul before flying to Beirut: a prayer at the Armenian Apostolic Cathedral and a divine liturgy with Ecumenical Patriarch Bartholomew, spiritual leader of the world's Orthodox Christians, whose invitation to commemorate an important Christian anniversary was the impetus for Leo's visit.",
      "Leo processed into the Armenian cathedral in a cloud of incense as a choir chanted. He praised the \"courageous Christian witness of the Armenian people throughout history, often amid tragic circumstances.\" It was a reference to the World War I-era slaughter of Armenians by Ottoman Turks.",
      "Pope Francis had termed the massacre a \"genocide,\" angering Turkey, which denies a genocide took place. Leo was more diplomatic in his words on Turkish soil.",
      "While in Turkey, the pope also visited Istanbul's\u00a0Blue Mosque, an Ottoman-era historical structure that has become a popular site for tourists.",
      "\"The Pope visited the Mosque in silence, in a spirit of reflection and listening, with profound respect for the place and the faith of those gathered there in prayer,\" said the Holy See's press office in a statement. He was accompanied by Turkish Culture and Tourism Minister Mehmet Nuri Ersoy, the Provincial Mufti of Istanbul Emrullah Tuncel, and the Grand Imam of the Sultan Ahmed Mosque (the Blue Mosque) Kurra Haf\u0131z Fatih Kaya.",
      "On the second leg of his maiden papal trip, Leo will visit Lebanon at a precarious moment for the small Mediterranean country after years of successive crises. He is fulfilling a promise of Pope Francis, who had wanted to visit for years, but was unable to as his health worsened.",
      "Francis often quoted St. John Paul II, who in 1989 said that Lebanon was more than just a country. It was a \"message\" \u2014 a message of fraternity and coexistence. Under Lebanon's power-sharing system, the country's president is always a Maronite Christian, the prime minister a Sunni Muslim and the parliamentary speaker a Shiite.",
      "Lebanon, a Muslim-majority country where about a third of the population is Christian, has always been a priority for the Vatican, a bulwark for Christians throughout the region. After years of conflict, Christian communities that date from the time of the Apostles have shrunk.",
      "Leo was expected to try to encourage Lebanese who believe their leaders have failed them, and to encourage Lebanese Christians to stay or, if they have already moved abroad, to come home.",
      "\"The Holy Father is coming at a very difficult moment for Lebanon and for our region,\" said Bishop George, archbishop of the Melkite Greek Catholic Archeparchy of Beirut. Lebanese are worried about the future, he said, and still fear a possible return to all-out war with Israel.",
      "\"In this difficult moment, the pope's visit is a sign of hope. It shows that Lebanon is not forgotten,\" he told reportersbefore the visit.",
      "In 2019, the country's currency and banking system collapsed and many Lebanese saw their savings evaporate. The financial crisis drove shortages of electricity, fuel and medicine.",
      "Another disaster followed in 2020, when hundreds of tons of ammonium nitrate improperly stored at the Beirut port detonated in an explosion that blasted through the surrounding neighborhoods, killing 218 people, wounding thousands more and causing billions of dollars in damage.",
      "The highlight of Leo's Lebanese visit will come on his last day, Dec. 2, when he spends time in silent prayer at the site of the blast on Aug. 4, 2020, and meets with some of its victims.",
      "Lebanese citizens were enraged by the blast, which appeared to be the result of government negligence, coming on top of the economic crisis. But an investigation has repeatedly stalled, and five years on, no official has been convicted.",
      "There are hopes among Lebanese that Leo will demand accountability from Lebanon's political class and insist that there can be no peace without truth and justice.",
      "Another important moment will come when Leo meets with young Lebanese. He's expected to give them words of encouragement, amid the decades-long flight abroad, while also acknowledging their disillusionment over the failures of generations before them.",
      "After the Hamas-led attack on southern Israel on Oct. 7, 2023, which sparked the war in Gaza, the Lebanese militant group Hezbollah entered into a low-level conflict with Israel that escalated into a full-fledged war in September 2024, killing more than 4,000 people in Lebanon and causing widespread destruction.",
      "Despite a U.S.-brokered ceasefire that nominally ended the conflict two months later, Israel continues to launch near-daily airstrikes that it says aim to stop Hezbollah from rebuilding.",
      "The pope \"is coming to bless us and for the sake of peace,\" said Farah Saadeh, a Beirut resident walking on the city's seaside promenade. \"We have to wait and see what will happen after he leaves, and we hope nothing is going to happen after his departure.\"",
      "Before Leo's arrival, Hezbollah urged the pope to express his \"rejection to injustice and aggression\" that the country is being subjected to. It was a reference to the Israeli strikes. The group also urged its supporters to line up along the road the papal convoy will take from the airport to the presidential palace to pay their respects.",
      "Hezbollah \u2014 a primarily Shiite group \u2014 has allied with several Christian political groups in the country, including the Free Patriotic Movement and Marada Movement.",
      "However, the Christian party with the largest parliamentary bloc, the Lebanese Forces, is an opponent of Hezbollah and has criticized the group for pulling the country into a war with Israel.",
      "In neighboring Syria, hundreds of thousands of Christians fled during the country's 14 years of civil war.",
      "The country's former autocratic President Bashar Assad was ousted in an offensive led by Islamist insurgents last December. Since then, there have been outbreaks of sectarian violence and some attacks on religious minorities, including a suicide attack on a church in Damascus in June.",
      "While the new government has condemned attacks on minorities, many accuse it of looking the other way or being unable to control allied armed groups.",
      "A delegation of some 300 Syrian Christians, headed by a Greek Melkite Catholic priest, was set to travel to Lebanon to join a meeting between Leo and youth groups and pray in a public mass on Beirut's waterfront.",
      "\"We are in need of someone like the pope to come and give us hope as Christians\" at a time of \"fear of an unknown future,\" said 24-year-old Dima Awwad, one of the delegation members. \"We wish that the pope would come to visit Syria as he visited Lebanon, to reassure the people and to feel that we are present as eastern Christians and that we need to be in this place.\"",

    "published": "Sun, 30 Nov 2025 21:10:59 -0500",
    "summary": "Diplomats have been focused on revisions to a proposed plan developed in negotiations between Washington and Moscow.",
    "story": [
      "U.S. and Ukrainian officials completed roughly four hours of talks Sunday aimed at finding an endgame to the war between Russia and Ukraine.",
      "Secretary of State Marco Rubio described Sunday's session \u2014 which included special envoy Steve Witkoff and Jared Kushner, the son-in-law of President Trump, and Ukrainian delegates \u2014 as \"productive and useful,\" but talks will continue this week in Moscow with Russian leader Vladimir Putin.",
      "\"We don't just want to end the war. We also want to help Ukraine be safe forever. So never again will they face another invasion. And equally importantly, we want them to enter an age of true prosperity,\" he said. \"It's about also the terms that set up Ukraine for long-term prosperity. ... I think we build on that today, but there's more work to be done.\"",
      "Witkoff is set to travel to Moscow on Monday, a U.S. official later confirmed to CBS News.",
      "The negotiations come at a sensitive moment for Ukraine as it continues to push back against Russian forces that invaded in 2022 while dealing with a domestic corruption scandal.",
      "Diplomats have been focused on revisions to a proposed\u00a0plan\u00a0developed in negotiations between Washington and Moscow. That plan has been criticized as being too weighted toward Russian demands. During the meeting Sunday, Rubio focused on reassuring Ukraine.",
      "Rustem Umerov, Ukraine's secretary of national security, thanked American negotiators in brief remarks following the meeting but provided little detail of their discussion.",
      "\"We discussed all the important matters that are important for Ukraine, for Ukrainian people and us, was super supportive. We were already had a successful meeting in Geneva, and today we continue this success,\" Umerov said. \"So at the moment, this meeting was productive and successful on the later stages, hopefully we'll keep you updated.\"",
      "Umerov has been involved in ongoing talks. But until now, Ukraine's head negotiator had been\u00a0Andriy Yermak, the powerful chief of staff of Ukrainian President\u00a0Volodymyr Zelenskyy. On Friday, Zelenskyy announced the resignation of Yermak, after his home was searched by anti-corruption investigators.",
      "Zelenskyy's government has been roiled by fallout from a\u00a0scandal over $100 million\u00a0embezzled from the energy sector through kickbacks paid by contractors, causing newfound domestic pressures for Zelenskyy.",
      "It was only a week ago that Rubio had met with Yermak in Geneva, with each side saying the talks had been positive in putting together a revised peace plan.",
      "Among the other members of the Ukrainian delegation were Andrii Hnatov, the head of Ukraine's armed forces, and presidential adviser Oleksandr Bevz.",
      "The plan, which Mr. Trump has since played down as a \"concept\" or a \"map\" to be \"fine-tuned,\" would have imposed limits on the size of Ukraine's military, blocked the country from joining NATO and required Ukraine to hold elections in 100 days. Negotiators have indicated the framework has changed, but it's not clear how its provisions have been altered.",
      "It had initially envisioned Ukraine ceding the entire eastern region of the Donbas\u00a0to Russia \u2014 a sticking point for Kyiv.",
      "Mr. Trump said Tuesday that he would send Witkoff and perhaps Kushner to Moscow this week to meet with Putin about the plan. Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov, in comments published Sunday on Russian state television, said Putin would see Witkoff before Thursday, when Putin departs for India.",
      "Both Witkoff and Kushner, like Mr. Trump, hail from the world of real estate that values dealmaking over the conventions of diplomacy. The pair also were behind a 20-point proposal that led to a ceasefire in Gaza.",
      "Zelenskyy wrote on X that the Ukrainian delegation would \"swiftly and substantively work out the steps needed to end the war.\"",
      "In his nightly address on Saturday, Zelenskyy said the American side was \"demonstrating a constructive approach.\"",

      "NANCY CORDES: We turn now to the fight against hunger in the United States. According to government data, 47.4 million people lived in what the Department of Agriculture calls a food insecure household in 2023. That's when a household can't necessarily obtain enough food to feed all of its members. One of the largest groups working to combat food insecurity is Feeding America, and we're joined now by CEO Claire Babineaux-Fontenot, who is in Charleston, South Carolina this morning. Claire, thanks so much for being with us, and happy Thanksgiving.",
      "CLAIRE BABINEAUX-FONTENOT: Thanks for having me back.",
      "NANCY CORDES: Absolutely. So during the shutdown, we saw these incredibly long lines at food banks. The shutdown has now been over for a couple of weeks. SNAP benefits are going out again, but even before the shutdown, food insecurity was at its highest rate in nearly a decade. So, what is the situation now that you're seeing at food banks around the country as we head into the holidays?",
      "BABINEAUX-FONTENOT: Yeah. So I'm so glad that you- you made that point. I- I think your viewers may be surprised to learn that food insecurity rates before the shutdown were higher than at any point during the pandemic, as an example. We're continuing to see very high demand. I think part of the reason is because the fastest growing group of people turning to the charitable food system, they're people who don't even qualify for any federal nutrition programs so this is an area that we've got to stay focused on. We know the kinds of things that work. We need to do those things so that we can really address what's happening with hunger and poverty in the country,",
      "NANCY CORDES: What do you think is contributing to the rise in hunger and this group of people who, as you say, don't qualify for benefits, but are showing an increased need for food?",
      "BABINEAUX-FONTENOT: Yeah, I think it's that the system is broken. Right now, there's so many people, if you can imagine, in this country who can't afford to get a raise at work, because we have a system that does not incentivize people to continue to move up the ladder. We've got ladders with big missing rungs, if you will, so we can do something about that. We could have a sliding scale, for instance, that allows people to move out of poverty. By doing that, because food insecurity is actually a symptom of poverty, they'll move out of that as well. We as a nation should all want people to be able to provide for themselves. We should all want them to be able to get work that they can feel proud of and support their families with. We have the power to do all of those things, it will require that we work together, that we be honest about what's broken, and that we really get committed about fixing those things.",
      "NANCY CORDES: What are the main challenges that the organizations in your network are facing this holiday season as they try to feed people who are hungry? Is the food there for the people who need it?",
      "BABINEAUX-FONTENOT: \u00a0Yeah, unfortunately, the lines are longer than- than the food that is available, and one of the hardest things to witness will be seeing these people who have the same dreams, aspirations for their kids and themselves, as I have for mine and all of your viewers have for theirs, feeling the need to turn to the charitable food system. It takes a lot of courage and resiliency and commitment to family ofttimes to be able to do that, and then for them to turn up in spite of all of those barriers, and not- us not be able to provide them with what they really need so I have a deep respect for people experiencing hunger in this country. I've been a person who's experienced hunger before. I know many people who have, many people who still do, so many of them are my heroes. And then another set of heroes that I have are people working in this fight in the Feeding America network, who show up shoulder to shoulder with people experiencing hunger, who are so deeply committed to their well being. So we need to position people experiencing hunger to be able to fend for themselves, and we need to position food banks to be able to provide them with the support that they need in this moment, until they get there.",
      "NANCY CORDES: As you know, there are about two million Americans who are going to be affected by changes to the SNAP program that were made earlier this year in a vote by Congress. They will not be receiving SNAP benefits any longer. What are the economic implications of that? And in about 30 seconds, what can your organizations do about it?",
      "BABINEAUX-FONTENOT: According to the Congressional Budget Office, we're probably looking at about a six billion meal per year gap that's going to be created. So the kinds of things that we ought to do: we ought to address fraud where it exists. We ought to incentivize people to be able to get the hand up that they need and to move out of poverty. We ought to address error rates, but we ought to do all of these things strategically, and we ought to do them in a bipartisan way. This ought to be the kind of thing that this country can come together around, that we can hold hands shoulder to shoulder, because when people experiencing hunger win, we all do.",
      "NANCY CORDES: Claire Babineaux-Fontenot, we have to leave it there. We've got a hard out. But thank you so much, Claire Babineaux-Fontenot from Feeding America. Thank you so much.",

      "KEVIN HASSETT, DIRECTOR NATIONAL ECONOMIC COUNCIL: Great to be here.",
      "NANCY CORDES: So we've all eaten the turkey. Holiday shopping has begun in earnest. So let's talk about what the holiday shopping season looks like. We've got new surveys from Goldman Sachs and Bank of America that paint a modest picture of the holiday spending outlook. They say low and middle income Americans are planning to pull back a little bit because they perceive that prices are higher. And they say if spending is up this year, it's going to be because goods, in part, are more expensive. Is this the temporary result or long term result of the Trump tariffs?",
      "HASSETT: Right. Well, what we've seen- those were reports about what people anticipated would happen over the Thanksgiving weekend, but we now have hard data for Black Friday and even for Saturday and the online sales were up almost 10%, in store sales were up 4%, it was really a blockbuster weekend after Thanksgiving. And so I think that the folks who are saying, wow, maybe people are going to be anxious about going back and getting presents for the kids and so on. They've been disproven this weekend. And I think the reason is that people- incomes are up this year. We had a great jobs report and with strong income and the government shut down over so that people presumably have a little pent up demand as well. I think that we're looking at a great recovery from a weak few weeks because of the shutdown.",
      "NANCY CORDES: Sure. I'm wondering how much of that spending increase you think is attributable to the fact that prices are up. Let me give you an example. The maker of Tonka Trucks said a couple days ago that a toy truck that cost $30 last year is going to cost $40 this year, partly because they lost about eight weeks of shipping due to the U.S. trade war with China. What's your advice to holiday shoppers who don't want to spend more this year than they did last year, or can't afford to spend more?",
      "HASSETT: Right. Well, as you know, it depends on what you're looking at. Like egg prices are down. Gasoline prices drop below $2 a gallon in a lot of places, mortgage rates are down--",
      "NANCY CORDES: --you mean below- gas prices on average are still at $3 a gallon.",
      "HASSETT: Yeah that's right for a few states they got below two. And so the point is just that- in the end, what matters is in the aggregate, the average across everything that everybody buys, and that averaged about 5% under Joe Biden, and is a little bit above two and a half percent- about cut in half for President Trump. And the bottom line, though, is really the wages have been growing faster than prices, and that's why real incomes this year are up by about $1,200 so far. That's why we could have a great Black Friday and a great Thanksgiving sales weekend because people feel like they have more money in their pockets. Even though you're right, there are some things that cost more, some things that cost less, but on average, we're about half the inflation rate of Joe Biden",
      "NANCY CORDES: Polls show that the public, despite some of the data you're presenting, is getting more skeptical. In our latest CBS News poll, 68% of Americans said they believe that President Trump's policies are pushing grocery prices up. They're up about 1.4% year to date. And economic sentiment, the number of people who think the economy is good, has actually dropped six points since he took office. How do you explain that?",
      "HASSETT: Well, first of all, you mentioned quite accurately, the 1.4% increase in grocery prices. I think the interesting thing about that is that that's way below the Fed's target of two for everything else, right? And so you'd have to concede that 1.4% is very, very low inflation. And so I think that the bottom line is that we've got the 'Big, Beautiful, Bill' cutting taxes on overtime, taxes for tips and so on, and all that money is going to start to be in people's pockets, and that's why they're optimistic about next year. Scott Bessent said last week that he's looking at first half of next year that could be in the 4% range. And the reason is that we passed the tax cuts in July, and so they didn't have time to change all the tax forms and everything. And so people are going to get really, really big refunds in the fall as well. And so we're really optimistic, and we think that the good news around Thanksgiving is a sign of something that's even stronger to come.",
      "NANCY CORDES: You mentioned purchasing power. One thing that is going to affect purchasing power for 22 million Americans is the expiration of Obamacare premium subsidies. Last week, a funny situation. The White House floated this plan to extend the subsidies for two years, then you dropped the proposal, and then the President said on Air Force One, somebody said I wanted to extend it for two years. I don't want to extend it for two years. I'd rather not extend them at all. Was this a case of the right hand not talking to the left hand?",
      "HASSETT: No, I think that people were talking to each other. But what happened as, you know, as a professional journalist, is that sometimes people leak pre-decisional things that are confidential and pre-decisional. And I think that somebody did that, and then it rolled back because it hadn't been through the whole process, but President Trump has been clear that he's very concerned about the cost of health care, and that's why we had $50 billion for rural hospitals in the 'Big, Beautiful, Bill,' why we tried to get $30 billion in for cost sharing. And the Democrats didn't like that. They had an alternative approach. And so I think that what we're going to see now, between now and Christmas, is that people are going to work- work this out, because we have a solution. The White House has a solution for cost- cost sharing, and the Democrats have an alternative. And, you know, people don't want for the few seniors that have really, really massive increases to see those. But don't forget, the vast majority of people in the Affordable Care Act are getting their insurance for less than $50 a month, and so- so while this is an issue that needs to be worked out, we don't want to cause panic for the folks who are worried that they're going to lose the thing that they have, it's really just the very, very high cost people who are closer to retirement age that have the problem.",
      "NANCY CORDES: Bloomberg is reporting, as I'm sure you know, that you are now considered the front runner to replace Fed Reserve Chair Jay Powell when his term expires in the spring. Secretary Bessent, who is heading up this search, said he was holding final interviews this week. How did yours go?",
      "HASSETT: You know, I am not sure that Bloomberg has the story right. I'm really honored to be amongst a group of really great candidates. The thing that I was most impressive about this week when that story leaked was that really, I think the news for markets was that President Trump is close to announcing a new person who is going to replace Jay Powell. And if you look at the market response to that, it was very, very positive. We had a great Treasury auction. Interest rates went down. And so I think that the American people could expect President Trump to pick somebody who's going to help them, you know, have cheaper car loans and easier access to mortgages at lower rates. And that's what we saw in the market response to the rumor about me, which, you know, is probably about as valuable as the rumor about the health care policy that we just talked about.",
      "NANCY CORDES: Well, I guess we'll find out if they're right sooner rather than later, when we hear the president's decision. So for now, Director of the White House, National Economic Council, that's your title today. Kevin Hassett, thank you so much.",
      "HASSETT: Thank you.",
      "NANCY CORDES: And we'll be back in a moment.",

      "The following is the transcript of the interview with Sen. Tim Kaine, Democrat of Virginia, that aired on \"Face the Nation with Margaret Brennan\" on Nov. 30, 2025.",
      "NANCY CORDES: Welcome back to Face The Nation. We're joined by Virginia Democratic Senator Tim Kaine. Senator, thanks so much for being with us.",
      "SENATOR TIM KAINE: Absolutely, Nancy.",
      "NANCY CORDES: I want to start out by asking you about the situation in Venezuela, because there are now serious signs that military action, including potentially ground action, could be imminent. You have tried twice to pass war powers resolutions that would force President Trump to get approval from Congress first before any military action. Twice, you have failed. Do you think the numbers on this will change if there is ground action, and will it even matter at that point?",
      "SEN. KAINE: I d- I do believe the numbers will change. You're right, I along with others, filed a resolution, no war in Venezuela or against Venezuela without congressional approval. It failed, but that was before all of these assets have amassed around Venezuela, and before President Trump said that the airspace needs to be closed. I will move with colleagues, Senator Schumer, Senator Paul, Senator Schiff, immediately should there be military action. And then secondly, I also attempted to stop the, what I view as illegal boat strikes in the Caribbean and the Pacific together with Adam Schiff, and the circumstances have changed in the months since we had that vote. In each of these instances, we were able to get two Republicans to vote together with Democrats. We think the escalating pace and some of the recent revelations, so, for example, the recent revelation about the kill everyone order apparently dictated by Secretary Hegseth. We do believe that we will get more support for these motions when they are refiled.",
      "NANCY CORDES: You're referring to this new Washington Post report that says that Secretary Hegseth called for everyone aboard, the first suspected drug boat that was targeted, to be killed when two people survived. The military went back in, reportedly with a follow-on strike. What questions do you have for the Pentagon about that situation?",
      "SEN. KAINE: Well, first, if that reporting is true, it's a clear violation of the DOD's own laws of war, as well as international laws about the way you treat people who are in that circumstance. And so this rises to the level of a war crime if it's true. And the questions that we've been asking for months are give us the evidence that the folks on board were really narcotraffickers. In one instance, there were two survivors, one Colombian, one Ecuadoran in a different strike. Instead of arresting them and prosecuting them, the U.S. picked them up and returned them to their countries of origin where they were released. So if they were narcotraffickers, why would we do that? We need more evidence about that. And we definitely need the administration to finally answer the question of why strike rather than interdict. If you know where the ships are, you can interdict. And when you do, you get evidence. You get individuals. You can squeeze them to give testimony against their higher-ups. You get evidence with the drug seizures. And finally, the other question that my colleagues and I are deeply worried about is the entire legal rationale for the strikes. We had to pry with a crowbar after weeks and weeks out of the administration. The supposed legal rationale for the strikes in international waters, it was very shoddy. Because it's classified, I can't tell you what's in it. But I can tell you it was not at all persuasive that these are legal actions. And so together with a whole series of things, the early retirement of the head of SOUTHCOM, the news that the SOUTHCOM's lead attorney said the strikes were not lawful, the decision of allies like the U.K. to stop sharing intelligence with the United States in this area because they believe the strikes are illegal. It's time for Congress to rein in a president who is deciding to wage war on his own say so, which is not what the Constitution allows.",
      "NANCY CORDES: A lot of lawmakers on both sides have questions that are similar to the ones you're raising. On a related note, President Trump just announced this weekend that he plans to pardon former Honduras President Juan OrlandoHern\u00e1ndez, who was accused of conspiring with drug cartels to move 400 tons of cocaine from Honduras to the U.S. He's currently serving a 45-year sentence. Were you surprised by the President's plan to pardon him, given how strongly the President feels about drugs coming from other countries like Venezuela?\u00a0SEN. KAINE: This is shocking, and again, this is not an individual who was accused of running drugs to the United States. He was convicted in a federal court in the United States. One of the bits of evidence was his statement that was picked up by those near to him that he wanted to shove drugs up the nose of gringos and flood the United States with cocaine more than 400 tons. He was the leader of one of the largest criminal enterprises that has ever been subject to a conviction in U.S. courts, and less than one year into his sentence, President Trump is pardoning him, suggesting that President Trump cares nothing about narcotrafficking. Suggesting possibly that pardons are now for sale by this White House. And if he doesn't care about narcotrafficking, and this was also shown earlier this year with the pardoning of Ross Ulbricht, then what is this Venezuela thing really about? The President of Colombia has said that he thinks it's about the U.S. trying to seize oil assets in Venezuela. I lived in Honduras for a year as a missionary way back when. The conspiracy theories are running wild in the Americas about why this- this military effort is so important to the President when he's pardoning drug kingpins who are running drugs into the United States. These are also questions that we're going to have to dig deeply into when we return to Washington tomorrow.NANCY CORDES: I want to ask you about some big developments in Washington this week. The Trump administration is making big changes in the wake of this tragic shooting of two National Guard members. They are halting all asylum decisions. They are halting Afghan immigration applications. The President says he wants a permanent pause to immigration from what he calls \"third world countries,\" we don't know how many countries. Do they have a case that it makes sense to put some of these processes on hold while they figure out what happened here?",
      "SEN. KAINE: Well, you know, first, let's just acknowledge this sad fact, these two guards, members, Ms. Beckstrom andMr. Wolfe, what a tragedy for them and their families. And you know what? They should have been at home at Thanksgiving, celebrating Thanksgiving with their families, not deployed in a political deployment, to do law enforcement in D.C. that the D.C. police and other local law enforcement agencies can do. And this demonstrates, yet again, something we've seen so often our troops, including our guards members, they're going to serve in brave and courageous and self-sacrificing ways, and we can be so proud of them, but the orders that they get from their civilian leaders, that's where the problem comes in. Whether it's a Hegseth order to kill them all, or an order to send guardsmen and women in a political stunt deployment to cities around the country, these two individuals should have been celebrating Thanksgiving with their families, and I just mourn for them and all who suffer as a result. The President's decision to say, okay, this particular criminal who should be prosecuted to the full extent of the law, who came in under an asylum grant, that President Trump and his administration decided this past summer, that now we're going to pause processes or asylum from 19 quote \"third world countries\" you don't know which ones they are. You shouldn't paint with a broad brush. Go after a criminal to the full extent of the law. But don't say that all Afghans in the United States, those who served with our military and who lost their lives and their health and their families in many ways by doing so, don't say that they're all bad. Don't say that people who come from third world countries are bad. Virginia, about one out of nine of us is an immigrant, and our immigrant communities in Virginia have been an enormous source of strength to our commonwealth and to our country. And it's wrong to target them all for the bad actions of an individual, just like we wouldn't target- target other communities in the United States for the bad actions of one individual.NANCY CORDES: Something tells me this is going to be a big topic of Congress- of conversation rather, in Congress--SEN. KAINE: --It will--NANCY CORDES: --this week. Senator Kaine, I really appreciate you being with us, and Happy Thanksgiving.SEN. KAINE: So glad we could do it. Thanks.\u00a0NANCY CORDES: And we'll be right back.",

      "REP. MIKE TURNER: Thank you, Nancy. Happy Thanksgiving to you also.",
      "NANCY CORDES: So, you heard what Sam Vinograd just had to say about the vetting process. You've also heard what administration officials are saying about it. Do you believe that this was a failure of vetting, or do you believe this is someone who just became radicalized or became mentally disturbed here in the United States?",
      "REP. TURNER: This is very difficult, because, I mean, this is classic terrorism. And this is where an individual who tries to break the heart of a nation who doesn't enact a murderous act right before Thanksgiving and the- I think what Samantha is missing in all of this is that we didn't go to Afghanistan to bring Afghanis here. We went to Afghanistan to kill Osama bin Laden, to dismantle and destroy al-Qaeda, to avenge 9//11, to dismantle and to overthrow the Taliban and to ensure that Afghanistan was no longer a safe haven for terrorism. What occurred is that the Biden administration allowed Afghanistan to fall and fled, and in doing so, then found itself in a situation where those who had been aiding us were then at risk, and in doing so made the decision--",
      "NANCY CORDES:-- You don't think they would have been at risk either way?",
      "REP. TURNER: No, they were- their intention was that they would be still there. That Afghanistan would no longer be a safe haven for terrorists, that it would not be a return to the Taliban, and there would not be a need for those people to be evacuated. You wouldn't see American planes on the tarmac, as you showed with people running to try to get on them. By the way, those planes wouldn't be being chased by people if they were on their way to China or Russia, they were on their way to America, and those people were fleeing what the Biden administration was allowing to unfold, which is that it would once again be a nation that would be at risk to us. And so, you know, that's how you get to the situation where those individuals are at risk. Now, obviously the vetting was flawed. By your own report, you showed that individuals who were on our known terrorist watch list made it into this country through that process. So obviously that the vetting process\u2013",
      "NANCY CORDES:-- But then- then they were identified--",
      "REP. TURNER:-- but they made it in. They made it in, right? They made it into this country. So obviously the process was flawed, and it was also a process that should have been unnecessary, if there hadn't been this hasty fall of Afghanistan. In which the Biden administration had promised us all that they were not going to run for the exits. And they not only ran for the exits, they did so at night. You know, Congress was, you know, after hearing, after hearing, you know, raised the issues of the manner in which the Biden administration fled and what the consequences would be. And we're all living with this consequence now, the investigation is underway.",
      "NANCY CORDES: Weren't their hands tied in part by the fact that Trump had cut a deal with the Taliban promising to leave by a certain date?",
      "REP. TURNER: No, their hands were not tied. The manner in which they did so, and Congress did a number of investigations, at a number of hearings, and filed a number of reports that showed that it was the actions of the Biden administration, a manner in which they completely withdrew. But that investigation is underway. It's going to be underway as to this individual, and I think we all need to wait for that investigation to be concluded.",
      "NANCY CORDES: The President has called for 500 more National Guard troops to be sent to the nation's capital. Your state has already contributed 150. Do you believe that more troops being deployed is the answer, or do you think it's time to wind this deployment down?",
      "REP. TURNER: When you ask this, is that the answer? You have to first talk about what the question is, and the question is, is there a national issue of- of crime and safety? And certainly the American people, by all polls, indicate that people are experiencing it and report that there is. And certainly in the nation's capital, there has been- there has been unbelievable reports of just the- the criminal activity, though, the- those individuals who have succumbed to, you know, violent crime. And certainly, there's been a reporting that the National Guard presence has made a difference.",
      "NANCY CORDES: Right. No question, I think crime is down 30% something like that in DC in the last four months. I want to turn to Ukraine now, another issue very important to you. A team of Ukrainian negotiators is meeting right now in Miami with Secretary of State Marco Rubio, Special Envoy Steve Witkoff. What's your understanding of where the negotiations stand right now. There were concerns initially that the White House plan was too pro-Russia. Do you still have those concerns?",
      "REP. TURNER: Well, I think we all have those concerns. The- the- you know, the President's goal of peace is incredibly important, and we saw today with Secretary Rubio his statement of, you know, we have to have a strong and sovereign Ukraine, and I- and that's everyone's goal, and the- and certainly a prosperous Ukraine. And we saw the Ukrainian representative there, who is, you know, committed. And we certainly think, and I think everyone thinks that President Zelenskyy is committed to peace. But you know, one thing that I think everybody understands is that you can't have- you can't be America first and pro-Russia, because Russia has- is a self declared adversary of the United States. It's fielding new, advanced nuclear weapons that are specifically targeting the United States. It's constantly attacking the United States with offensive cyber. It continuously identifies both NATO and the West, the United States as its adversary. So in this and of course, when it identifies Ukraine as its adversary, it does so in identifying the West and the United States as its adversary. You have to understand that the balance of this- this peace arrangement has to be one where you have to look at Russia as a skeptical adversary.",
      "NANCY CORDES: Speaking of the question of being pro-Russian, this week, Bloomberg got a hold of this transcript of a call between Steve Witkoff, the special envoy, and a Putin advisor, in which Witkoff appeared to be coaching the Russian on how to win over President Trump. And there are several Republicans that have great concerns about that. Brian Fitzpatrick of Pennsylvania called it a major problem. Don Bacon of Nebraska said Witkoff fully favors the Russians and should be fired. What do you think?",
      "REP. TURNER: Well, the part that concerned me most is that there appeared to be an orchestration of giving Putin an opportunity to speak to Trump before President Zelensky was on his way to the White House. And I wouldn't want any orchestration of lessening President Zelenskyy's relationship with Trump, because it's very important when you have negotiations that, especially as you have, you know- in this instance Russia is being, you know, obviously, unbelievably murderous of the Ukrainian people. It is an aggressive authoritarian regime in this it's killing civilians. It is- it is not just this. Is not a military against military action. They are bombing into Ukraine and murderously killing civilians in Ukraine. The- the Ukrainian people are being subjected to this, and the President Trump needs to be able to hear Zelenskyy's voice clearly, and not just the authoritarian murderous Putin.",
      "NANCY CORDES: So given your concerns, should Witkoff continue to serve as one of the main US negotiators here and should he be sent by President Trump to Moscow this week to meet with Putin?",
      "REP. TURNER: I think you can't take just one slice of someone's conversation during a long, stretched out aspect of negotiations as reflective, but I think it's certainly important that when we do get that opportunity, that our voices are heard of caution and concern. And the orchestration of inserting Putin's voice before Zelenskyy is very concerning, and I think the White House should be very concerned about any efforts to orchestrate Putin's voice at the White House before Zelenskyy's because Ukraine's sovereignty and security needs to be preeminent. And we heard that this morning from Rubio, and that needs to be the focus.",
      "NANCY CORDES: President Trump said this was just regular deal making. I want to turn to Venezuela, because you're on the House Armed Services Committee. We've all been watching the military buildup in the waters around Venezuela. Just yesterday, the President said airlines should consider Venezuelan airspace closed. Do you take that to mean that a military operation is imminent?",
      "REP. TURNER: Well, the President did not say that, and the President certainly has not given Congress any notice that that is going to occur. And he certainly has not made the case. There is a buildup that the President has not explained in a way that relates solely to the actions that are currently going down in the Caribbean, and with respect to the drug trade that the President has been discussing with Congress, it is certainly a significant concern in Congress.",
      "NANCY CORDES: The Washington Post is reporting that before the strike on the very first suspected drug vote in September, Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth ordered that everyone on board be killed, and then when two of the 11 people on board survived, a follow-on strike was ordered to finish them off in the water. Now some law of war experts are saying that that was illegal, that killing people who are no longer able to fight is a war crime. What is your view and what questions do you have for the Pentagon?",
      "REP. TURNER: Congress does not have information that that had occurred. Both the chairman of the Senate Armed Services Committee, Chairman of the House Armed Services Committee, and ranking members have opened investigations. Obviously, if that occurred, that would be- be very serious, and I agree that- that- that would- would be an illegal act. That is not the legal opinion or the information or the legal justification, the acts that have been described to Congress that are being undertaken in- in this. There are very serious concerns in Congress about the attacks on the so-called drug boats down in the Caribbean and the Pacific, and the legal justification has been provided. But this is- is completely outside of anything that has been discussed with Congress, and there is an ongoing investigation.",
      "NANCY CORDES: Very interesting to hear you say that this might be an illegal act. I know your committee is asking more questions. We'd love to learn what you find out. Congressman Mike Turner of Ohio, thank you so much for being with us.",
      "REP. TURNER: I appreciate it.",
      "NANCY CORDES: And we'll be right back with a lot more Face the Nation. Stay with us.",

    "published": "Sun, 30 Nov 2025 14:39:41 -0500",
    "summary": "The \"Zero Units\" were considered by the U.S. and its international partners to be among Afghanistan's most trusted domestic forces.",
    "story": [
      "An image of an ID badge circulating widely online that shows the suspect in the shooting of the National Guard members says he was assigned to the \"Kandahar Strike Force\" or \"03\" unit, one of a number of so-called \"Zero Units\" that worked closely with U.S. and other foreign forces during the war in Afghanistan. A former senior Afghan military source confirmed to CBS News that the ID badge is authentic.",
      "A U.S. official briefed on the shooting investigation and a former senior Afghan National Defense and Security Forces member told CBS News that the suspect, Rahmanullah Lakanwal, had been part of a \"Zero Unit,\" an Afghan intelligence unit and paramilitary force that worked with the CIA. The units were exclusively composed of\u00a0Afghan nationals\u00a0and operated under the umbrella of the National Directorate of Security, or NDS, the intelligence agency established with CIA backing for Afghanistan's previous, U.S.-backed government. They were considered by the U.S. and its international partners to be among the most trusted domestic forces in Afghanistan.",
      "Those units are often labeled \"death squads\" by human rights groups. The units were known in Afghanistan for their secrecy and alleged brutality, and members were implicated in numerous extrajudicial killings of civilians, particularly during night raids.",
      "The U.S. official briefed on the investigation confirmed the suspect had been disturbed by the casualties in this unit and, more recently, deeply troubled by the killing of his close friend overseas.",
      "The image of the ID badge also carries the words \"Firebase Gecko,\" which was the name of a base used by the CIA and special forces in Kandahar, in southern Afghanistan, inside what was previously the compound of the Taliban's founding leader, Mullah Mohammad Omar.",
      "CIA Director John Ratcliffe said Thursday the suspect had previously worked \"with the U.S. Government, including CIA, as a member of a partner force in Kandahar.\"",
      "Lt. Gen. Sami Sadat, a former commanding general of the Afghan National Special Operations Corps, told CBS News that Lakanwal worked for the \"03\" unit for eight years. A former senior Afghan general under the U.S.-backed government told CBS News on Thursday that \"03 unit, also known as The Kandahar Strike Force (KSF), was under special forces directorate of NDS. They were the most active and professional forces, trained and equipped by the CIA. All their operations were conducted under the CIA command.\" Lakanwal was part of the unit's operations team, Sadat said.",
      "\"He was known for being responsible and professional within his team and had strong anti-Taliban views,\" Sadat said.",
      "\"While we could not establish any connection between him and any terrorist organization, we also cannot completely rule it out,\" Sadat said. \"However, we can confirm that his background does not show any links to terrorists.\"",
      "Lakanwal's family faced serious threats from the Taliban, which led him to relocate them from their native Khost province to Kabul, Sadat said. In the U.S., Sadat said Lakanwal was \"generally calm and maintained a clean record, though he suffered from PTSD.\"",
      "As a member of a Zero Unit, the suspect would have been virtually guaranteed a route to asylum in the U.S. because members of these elite units were high on the list for\u00a0Taliban retaliation\u00a0after the group retook control of the country. Many members of these units played key roles in the August 2021\u00a0evacuation from Kabul, in return for a guarantee of space on a flight for themselves and their families out of Afghanistan.",
      "Samantha Vinograd, a CBS News contributor and former Department of Homeland Security counterterrorism official who worked under the Obama administration, said on \"Face the Nation with Margaret Brennan\" that Afghan evacuees were thoroughly vetted prior to arriving in the U.S. after its withdrawal.",
      "In Lakanwal's case, the suspect would have been vetted by the CIA prior to joining the Zero Unit, Vinograd said, before referencing comments from national security leaders that suggested he became radicalized after coming to the U.S.",
      "\"This horrific tragedy could be the result of an individual that quickly mobilized to violence without any ties to foreign terrorism,\" said Vinograd. \"And, as we have discussed in other cases, trying to find lone actors before they initiate an attack is harder than trying to find a needle in a haystack.\"",
      "There was no immediate reaction from Afghanistan's current Taliban government, and officials in Kabul did not respond to CBS News' requests for comment on the arrest in Washington.",

    "summary": "Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said the request would help unify the country at a time of momentous changes in the region.",
    "story": [
      "Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu on Sunday asked the country's president to grant him a pardon from corruption charges \u2014 seeking to end a long-running trial that has bitterly divided the nation.",
      "Netanyahu, who has been battling the country's legal system over the charges, said the request would help unify the country at a time of momentous changes in the region. But it immediately triggered denunciations from his opponents, who said it would weaken Israel's democratic institutions and send a dangerous message that he is above the rule of law.",
      "In a statement Sunday the prime minister's office said that Netanyahu had submitted a request for a pardon to the legal department of the Office of the President. The president's office called it an \"extraordinary request,\" carrying with it \"significant implications.\"",
      "\"After receiving all of the relevant opinions, the President will responsibly and sincerely consider the request,\" said the office of Israel's president, Isaac Herzog, in a statement.",
      "Netanyahu is the only sitting prime minister in Israeli history to stand trial, after being charged with fraud, breach of trust and accepting bribes in three separate cases accusing him of exchanging favors with wealthy political supporters. He has not yet been convicted of anything.",
      "Netanyahu rejects the allegations, and has condemned the case as a witch hunt orchestrated by the media, police and judiciary.",
      "The request comes weeks after U.S. President Trump urged Israel to pardon Netanyahu. Earlier this month Mr. Trump also sent a letter to Herzog calling the corruption case \"political, unjustified prosecution.\"",
      "In a videotaped statement, Netanyahu said the trial has divided the country and that a pardon would help restore national unity. He also said the requirement that he appear in court three times a week is a distraction that makes it difficult for him to lead the country.",
      "\"The continuation of the trial tears us apart from within, stirs up this division, and deepens rifts. I am sure, like many others in the nation, that an immediate conclusion of the trial would greatly help to lower the flames and promote the broad reconciliation that our country so desperately needs,\" he said.",
      "Netanyahu has taken the stand multiple times over the past year, but the case has been repeatedly delayed as he has dealt with wars and unrest stemming from the Hamas-led militant attacks of October 2023.",
      "Netanyahu's pardon request consisted of two documents \u2014 a detailed letter signed by his lawyer and a letter signed by Netanyahu. They'll be sent to the justice ministry for opinions and will then be transferred to the Legal Advisor in the Office of the President, which will formulate additional opinions for the president.",
      "Many legal experts say the pardon request is not able to stop the trial.",
      "\"It's impossible,\" said Emi Palmor, former director general of the justice ministry.",
      "\"You cannot claim that you're innocent while the trial is going on and come to the president and ask him to intervene,\" she said. The only way to stop the trial is to ask the attorney general to withhold the proceedings, she said.",
      "Netanyahu's request sparked an immediate response from the opposition, which urged the president not to give in to his request.",
      "\"You cannot grant him a pardon without an admission of guilt, an expression of remorse and an immediate retirement from political life,\" said opposition leader Yair Lapid.",

    "story": [
      "The death toll in Hong Kong's apartment complex blaze rose to 146 on Sunday as investigators discovered more bodies in the burned-out buildings. A steady stream of people placed bouquets of flowers at an ever-growing makeshift memorial at the scene of the disaster, among the worst in the city's history.",
      "The Hong Kong police Disaster Victim Identification Unit has been going through the buildings of the Wang Fuk Court complex meticulously and has found bodies both in apartment units and on the roofs, said the officer in charge, Cheng Ka-chun.",
      "The buildings remain structurally sound, but the search has been slow, he told reporters, still wearing his white coveralls with his hard hat and respiratory mask at his side. \"It is so dark inside, and because of the low light, it is very difficult to do the work, especially in places away from the windows.\"",
      "So far the team has examined four of the seven blocks, Cheng said.",
      "The latest searches turned up another 30 bodies, including 12 that had already been discovered by firefighters but hadn't been recovered, said Tsang Shuk-yin, the head of the Hong Kong police casualty unit.",
      "Another 100 people are unaccounted for and 79 have been injured, Tsang said.",
      "At the scene, well-wishers bowed and said short prayers, or left handwritten notes among the flowers.",
      "\"This really serves as a wake-up call for everyone, especially with these super high-rise buildings,\" said Lian Shuzheng, who waited in a line of hundreds of people to add her flowers to the growing cluster.",
      "People have also donated supplies to those who lost everything in the blaze, which started Wednesday and took until Friday to fully extinguish.",
      "The eight buildings of the Wang Fuk Court complex in the suburb of Tai Po had all been clad in bamboo scaffolding draped with nylon netting for renovations, with windows covered by polystyrene panels. Authorities were investigating whether fire codes were violated.",
      "Other constructions by the same builder are halted",
      "Hong Kong officials announced late Saturday they had ordered the immediate suspension of work on 28 building projects undertaken by the same contractor, the Prestige Construction & Engineering Company, for safety audits.",
      "\"The five alarm fire at Wang Fuk Court, Tai Po, exposed serious deficiencies of PC&E in site safety management, including the extensive use of foam boards to block up windows during building repairs,\" the government said in a statement.",
      "The company did not answer calls Sunday for comment.",
      "Three men \u2014 the directors and an engineering consultant of a construction company \u2014 were arrested the day after the fire broke out on suspicion of manslaughter, and police said company leaders were suspected of gross negligence. Police did not identify the firm by name.",
      "Those three were released on bail but then rearrested by Hong Kong's anti-corruption authorities, who have also arrested a further eight suspects including scaffolding subcontractors, directors of an engineering consulting company and the renovation project managers.",
      "Faulty fire alarms and foam panels under investigation",
      "The apartment complex of eight, 31-story buildings in Tai Po, a suburb near Hong Kong's border with mainland China, was built in the 1980s. It had almost 2,000 apartments and more than 4,600 residents.",
      "Many are now housed in short-term emergency shelters or city hotels, and authorities are working on longer-term solutions.",
      "\"It's heartbreaking,\" said Jeffery Chan, a civil servant who came to pay his respects on Sunday.",
      "\"As a Hong Konger, seeing people in the place where we live lose their families, lose everything in just one night \u2014 if you put yourself in their shoes, it is unbearable. They need encouragement, support and help from the people of Hong Kong,\" he said.",
      "Preliminary investigations showed the fire started Wednesday afternoon on a lower-level scaffolding net of one of the buildings, and then spread rapidly inside as the foam panels caught fire and blew out windows, according to Chris Tang, Hong Kong's secretary for security. Winds helped the flames jump from building to building and soon seven of the eight were engulfed.",
      "First responders found that some fire alarms in the complex, which housed many older people, did not sound when tested, according to Andy Yeung, the director of Hong Kong Fire Services.",
      "The dead included seven Indonesian migrant workers, and several dozen are still unaccounted for, the Indonesian Foreign Ministry said. One Filipina domestic helper was also killed and 12 others remain unaccounted for, according to the Philippines Consulate General in Hong Kong.",
      "On Sunday afternoon, several hundred Filipinos packed a pedestrian street in central Hong Kong, saying prayers and singing hymns in tribute to the fire victims.",

    "published": "Sat, 29 Nov 2025 21:53:04 -0500",
    "summary": "The U.K. this week extended its sugar tax to some coffee drinks and milkshakes in an ongoing effort to fight obesity.",
    "story": [
      "London\u00a0\u2014 In British supermarkets these days, there's a war being waged against sugar, with the U.K. this week extending its sugar tax to some coffee drinks and milkshakes in an ongoing effort to fight obesity.",
      "\"Actually, in the U.K., it's the main reason why children would be admitted to hospital,\" Dr. Kawther Hashem, a nutritionist who lobbied the U.K. government to levy a tax on sugary drinks, told CBS News of the sugar crisis.",
      "\"If you want to look at making a big impact on the population, well, where is it coming from?\" Hashem said. \"It was quite clear, the biggest contributor was soft drinks, so let's start with soft drinks.\"",
      "The British tax went into effect in 2018, up to 30 cents per liter for 8 grams or more of sugar per 100 milliliters, depending on the drink's sugar content. But instead of passing that cost on to the consumer, many manufacturers instead lowered their product's sugar content to avoid the tax altogether.",
      "As a result, the British version of some drinks are now very different to products with the same label in the U.S. In many cases, the sugar has been replaced with aspartame, an artificial sweetener.",
      "This week, the U.K. Department of Health and Social Care\u00a0announced\u00a0that it was expanding its levy to include milk-based drinks, including milkshakes, flavored milks, sweetened yogurt drinks, chocolate milk and certain coffees. Companies have until January 2028 to comply with the new requirements.",
      "\"This is a levy on manufacturers and importers, which has led to companies acting by halving sugar content in popular drinks to avoid the tax,\" the U.K. government said in its announcement Tuesday. \"The government expects companies to do the same with the extension.\"",
      "The levy has applied to drinks with a sugar content of 5 grams per 100 milliliters. However, the new guidance will lower that threshold to 4.5 grams.",
      "Among 10- and 11-year-old girls alone, the tax prevents 5,000 cases of obesity a year, according to a 2023 study from University of Cambridge researchers.",
      "Jules Dunlop is an American mother who lives in the British countryside. She and her family love food, often posting about it on social media. They say they are definitely not health nuts.\u00a0\"If we're comparing junk food to junk food, automatically in the U.K. you're going to get a healthier version of what's available to you in the United States,\" Dunlop said.",
      "Dunlop says that it when it comes to taste, she \"would never know the difference\" between the same drink in the U.S. and U.K. She says eating less sugar has given her more energy and clearer skin.",
      "\"Just being able to have that baseline of less sugar here has made such a difference,\" she says of living in Europe compared to the U.S. \"And I just think an overall healthier lifestyle here.\"",
      "Some U.S. cities have also introduced a sugar tax, but without a national policy, it is unlikely that manufacturers in the U.S. will change the formulas of their drinks.",

European leaders, fearing for their own future in the face of Russian aggression, scrambled to steer the negotiations toward accommodating their concerns.",
      "Trump said Tuesday that his plan to end the war had been \"fine-tuned\" and that he's sending envoy Steve Witkoff to Russia to meet with Putin and Army Secretary Dan Driscoll to meet with Ukrainian officials. He suggested he could eventually meet with Putin and Zelenskyy, but not until further progress has been made in negotiations.",
      "Zelenskyy announced Friday the resignation of his powerful chief of staff, Andrii Yermak, who was also the country's lead negotiator in talks with the U.S, after anti-corruption investigators searched Yermak's residence. The unprecedented search at the heart of Ukraine's government was a blow to the Ukrainian leader, risking the disruption of his negotiating strategy at a time when Kyiv is under intense U.S. pressure to sign a peace deal.",

    "published": "Sat, 29 Nov 2025 21:30:46 -0500",
    "summary": "Pope Leo toured the 17th-century mosque, but did not pray there.",
    "story": [
      "Pope Leo XIV\u00a0visited Istanbul's Blue Mosque on Saturday on the second day of\u00a0his trip\u00a0to Turkey and stressed the need for Christian unity in meetings and liturgies with the country's Christian leaders.",
      "Leo was following in the footsteps of his recent predecessors, who all made high-profile visits to the mosque in a gesture of respect to Turkey's Muslim majority. Leo did not pray at the mosque despite an invitation by an imam. Speaking to reporters after the visit, Asgin Tunca said he had told the pope that the mosque was \"Allah's house.\"",
      "\"It's not my house, not your house, (it's the) house of Allah,\" he said. He said he told Leo: \"'If you want, you can worship here,' I said. But he said, 'That's OK.'\"",
      "\"He wanted to see the mosque, wanted to feel (the) atmosphere of the mosque, I think. And was very pleased,\" he said.",
      "After the mosque visit, Leo met with Turkey's Christian leaders at the Syriac Orthodox Church of Mor Ephrem.",
      "This is the pope's first foreign trip. He will also visit Lebanon.",
      "Leo, history's first American pope, is expected to speak in broader terms about peace in the Middle East.",
      "Papal visits to Blue Mosque often raise questions",
      "Other visits have always raised questions about whether the pope would pray in the Muslim house of worship, or at the very least pause to gather thoughts in a meditative silence.",
      "When Pope Benedict XVI visited Turkey in 2006, tensions were high because Benedict had offended many in the Muslim world a few months earlier with a speech in Regensburg, Germany that was widely interpreted as linking Islam and violence.",
      "The Vatican added a visit to the Blue Mosque at the last minute in a bid to reach out to Muslims, and Benedict was warmly welcomed. He observed a moment of silent prayer, head bowed, as the imam prayed next to him, facing east.",
      "Benedict later thanked him \"for this moment of prayer\" for what was only the second time a pope had visited a mosque, after St. John Paul II visited one briefly in Syria in 2001.",
      "There were no doubts in 2014 when Pope Francis visited the Blue Mosque: He stood for two minutes of silent prayer facing east, his head bowed, eyes closed and hands clasped in front of him. The Grand Mufti of Istanbul, Rahmi Yaran, told the pope afterwards, \"May God accept it.\"",
      "The pope's planned itinerary and the Vatican spokesman had said in advance of the trip that Leo would pause for a prayer as his predecessors had done in the towering 17th-century mosque. But Leo merely toured the mosque.",
      "The Vatican had initially reported the visit went ahead as foreseen. But it subsequently revised the record to say he visited \"in a spirit of contemplation and listening, with deep respect for the place and the faith of those who gather there in prayer.\"",
      "There were other changes to the mosque visit, as well.",
      "The Vatican had initially said the head of the Diyanet religious affairs directorate would welcome Leo at the mosque. But the director, Safi Arpagus, wasn't there, and a spokesman for the Diyanet said Arpagus hadn't been expected, noting that he met with Leo upon his arrival Thursday in Ankara.",
      "The Vatican didn't explain the discrepancy. Leo was welcomed instead by the Turkish culture and tourism minister and several imams.",
      "Pope Leo prays at the church of the leader of Orthodox Christians",
      "Pope Leo XIV did pray at the patriarchal church in Istanbul of the spiritual leader of the world's Orthodox Christians in another gesture of unity.",
      "In the elaborate Church of St. George, Leo attended the doxology alongside Ecumenical Patriarch Bartholomew. The doxology is a short hymn of praise and glory to God that is sung by Christians.",
      "Leo said he was certain the \"encounter will also help to strengthen the bonds of our friendship.\"",
      "Eastern and Western churches split in the Great Schism of 1054, a divide precipitated largely by disagreements over the primacy of the pope. Leo and popes before him have vowed to work to unite Christians again.",
      "Bartholomew, for his part, noted the significance that Leo chose to open his pontificate with his visit to Turkey.",
      "The main reason of the visit was to mark the 1,700th anniversary of the Council of Nicaea, the unprecedented gathering of bishops that produced a creed, or proclamation of faith, that is still recited by millions of Christians today.",
      "Hagia Sophia left off itinerary",
      "Past popes have also visited the nearby Hagia Sophia landmark, once one of the most important historic cathedrals in Christianity and a United Nations-designated world heritage site.",
      "But Leo left that visit off his itinerary on his first trip as pope. In July 2020, Turkey converted Hagia Sophia from a museum back into a mosque, a move that drew widespread international criticism, including from the Vatican.",
      "After the mosque visit, Leo held a private meeting with Turkey's Christian leaders at the Syriac Orthodox Church of Mor Ephrem. In the afternoon, he was expected to pray with the spiritual leader of the world's Orthodox Christians, Patriarch Bartholomew, at the patriarchal church of Saint George.",
      "There, they were to sign a joint statement. The Vatican said in his remarks to the patriarchs gathered, Leo reminded them \"that division among Christians is an obstacle to their witness.\"",
      "He pointed to the next Holy Year to be celebrated by Christians, in 2033 on the anniversary of Christ's crucifixion, and invited them to go to Jerusalem on \"a journey that leads to full unity.\"",
      "Leo will end the day with a Catholic Mass in Istanbul's Volkswagen Arena for the country's Catholic community, who number 33,000 in a country of more than 85 million people, most of whom are Sunni Muslim. Crowds of devout Catholics braved pouring rain and tight security measures for the event.",
      "Maria Banasik waited for her friends at a cafe near the arena, four hours ahead of the scheduled Mass, saying they were excited to be part of Leo's first overseas visit.",
      "\"In the global situation now, his visit is of great importance,\" said Banasik, a Polish national who lives in Ankara.",
      "The Airbus software update doesn't spare pope",
      "While Leo was focusing on bolstering relations with Orthodox Christians and Muslims, trip organizers were dealing with more mundane issues.",
      "Leo's ITA Airways Airbus A320neo charter was among those caught up in the worldwide Airbus software update, ordered by the European Union Aviation Safety Agency. The order came after an analysis found the computer code may have contributed to a sudden drop in the altitude of a JetBlue plane last month.",
      "The Vatican spokesman, Matteo Bruni, said Saturday that ITA was working on the issue. He said the necessary component to update the aircraft was on its way to Istanbul along with the technician who would install it.",
      "Leo is scheduled to fly from Istanbul to Beirut, Lebanon, on Sunday afternoon for the second leg of his inaugural trip as pope.",
      "Lebanon increased security measures ahead of his visit. The Interior Ministry said in a statement Saturday that trucks will be banned from entering the capital, Beirut, and the governorate of Mount Lebanon as of Sunday morning until Tuesday night. Trucks delivering food, water and fuel tankers as well as garbage trucks, will be excluded from the ban. Meanwhile, Defense Minister Michel Menassa issued an order banning anyone from carrying weapons in the same areas as of midnight Saturday for three days.",
      "In a statement Saturday, Lebanon's militant group Hezbollah welcomed the pontiff's trip to the crisis-hit nation, saying the group is committed to the country's religious coexistence, democratic accord and preserving its security. Hezbollah is allied with several Christian groups in the country, including the Free Patriotic Movement and Marada Movement.",

    "story": [
      "Hong Kong's deadliest fire in decades has raised questions about corruption and negligence in the renovations of the apartment complex where at least 128 people died.",
      "An intense fire broke out at Wang Fuk Court complex in Hong Kong's northern suburbs Wednesday afternoon, with flames covering seven of the eight towers. The complex was home to some 4,800 residents, some of whom had raised safety concerns about the renovations more than year before the fire.",
      "Police on Wednesday arrested three men from a construction company on suspicion of manslaughter and gross negligence. They were released on bail but then arrested by the Independent Commission Against Corruption, the authority said Saturday night, pointing to their leadership role in the renovations. ICAC had\u00a0also previously arrested\u00a0previously arrested seven men and one woman associated with the project.",
      "Police have not identified the company where the suspects worked, but documents posted to the homeowners association's website showed that the Prestige Construction & Engineering Company was in charge of renovations. Police have seized boxes of documents from the company, where phones rang unanswered Thursday.",
      "Officials also said they were investigating the materials used, both the netting on the scaffolding and the foam panels covering windows, and their role in the blaze.",
      "Residents highlighted safety issues a year before fire",
      "For almost a year, some residents at the Wang Fuk Court complex had been raising safety concerns to Hong Kong authorities about the scaffolding materials being used in the renovation project, according to documents reviewed by the AP, specifically about the netting that covered the scaffolding.",
      "Hong Kong's labor department in a statement on Saturday confirmed it had received such complaints, adding that officials had carried out 16 inspections of Wang Fuk Court's renovation project since July 2024, and had warned contractors multiple times in writing that they must ensure they met fire safety requirements. The city even carried out an inspection as late as one week before the fire.",
      "The labor department said it had reviewed the product quality certificate of the netting and that it was in line with standards, but that the safety netting had not been the previous target of inspections.",
      "Preliminary investigations showed the fire started on a lower-level scaffolding net of one of the buildings. It then spread rapidly as the foam panels caught fire, said Chris Tang, the city's secretary for security. Police also said they had been looking at the highly flammable foam panels.",
      "\"The blaze ignited the foam panels, causing the glass to shatter and leading to a swift intensification of the fire and its spread into the interior spaces,\" Tang said.",
      "The labor department said later on Saturday that three prosecutions were brought against the company over breaches of safety regulations for working at height in the construction and convictions in two of the cases resulted in fines of totaling 30,000 Hong Kong dollars, or $3,850. The company also was fined three times in 2023 for separate violations unrelated to the Tai Po project.",
      "First responders also found that some fire alarms in the complex, which housed many older people, did not sound when tested, said Andy Yeung, the director of Hong Kong Fire Services. He did not specify how many were not working or if any of the others were.",
      "Intense blaze took days to put out",
      "It took firefighters a day to bring the fire under control, and it was not fully extinguished until Friday morning \u2014 some 40 hours after it started.",
      "Crews prioritized apartments from which they had received emergency calls during the blaze but were unable to reach in the hours that the fire burned out of control, Derek Armstrong Chan, a deputy director of Hong Kong Fire Services, told reporters.",
      "Twelve firefighters were among the 79 people injured in the blaze, and one firefighter was killed.",
      "Even two days after the fire began, smoke continued to drift out of the charred skeletons of the buildings from the occasional flare-up.",
      "More bodies may be found",
      "While more bodies might be recovered, authorities said, crews have finished their search for anyone living trapped inside.",
      "Authorities said Saturday they need to identify 44 more bodies out of the 128 recovered. About 150 people remain unaccounted for.",

      "A telescope in Chile has captured a stunning new picture of a grand and graceful cosmic butterfly.",
      "The National Science Foundation's NoirLab released the picture on Wednesday. The glowing \"wings\" appear to be bursting in the image. While the bipolar nebula goes by the monikers Butterfly Nebula, Bug Nebula or Caldwell 69, its official name is NGC 6302.",
      "Snapped last month by the Gemini South telescope \u2014 half of the International Gemini Observatory on Cerro Pach\u00f3n, a mountain in Central Chile \u2014 the aptly named Butterfly Nebula is 2,500 to 3,800 light-years away in the constellation Scorpius. A single light-year is 6 trillion miles.",
      "At the heart of this bipolar nebula is a white dwarf star that cast aside its outer layers of gas long ago. The discarded gas forms the butterfly-like wings billowing from the aging star, whose heat causes the gas to glow.",
      "Students in Chile chose this astronomical target to celebrate 25 years of operation by the International Gemini Observatory.",
      "\"This picturesque object was chosen as a target for the 8.1-meter [26.5-foot] telescope by students in Chile as part of the Gemini First Light Anniversary Image Contest,\" NoirLab wrote on its website. \"The contest engaged students in the host locations of the Gemini telescopes to celebrate the legacy that the International Gemini Observatory has built since its completion, marked by Gemini South's First Light in November 2000.\"",
      "It's not known exactly when NGC 6302 was discovered, NoirLab says, but a 1907 study by American astronomer Edward E. Barnard is often credited. Scottish astronomer James Dunlop could also have discovered it in 1826.",

    "summary": "Researchers have documented 55 instances of \"mini lightning\" over two Martian years by eavesdropping on the whirling wind recorded by NASA's Perseverance rover.",
    "story": [
      "Scientists have detected what they believe to be lightning on Mars by eavesdropping on the whirling wind recorded by NASA's Perseverance rover.",
      "The crackling of electrical discharges was captured by a microphone on the rover, a French-led team reported Wednesday.",
      "The researchers documented 55 instances of \"mini lightning\" over two Martian years, primarily during dust storms and dust devils. Almost all occurred on the windiest Martian sols, or days, during dust storms and dust devils.",
      "Just inches in size, the electrical arcs occurred within 6 feet of the microphone perched atop the rover's tall mast, part of a system for examining Martian rocks via camera and lasers. Sparks from the electrical discharges \u2014 akin to static electricity here on Earth \u2014 are clearly audible amid the noisy wind gusts and dust particles smacking the microphone.",
      "Scientists have been looking for electrical activity and lightning at Mars for half a century, said the study's lead author Baptiste Chide, of the Institute for Research in Astrophysics and Planetology in Toulouse.",
      "\"It opens a completely new field of investigation for Mars science,\" Chide said, citing the possible chemical effects from electrical discharges. \"It's like finding a missing piece of the puzzle.\"",
      "The evidence is strong and persuasive, but it's based on a single instrument that was meant to record the rover zapping rocks with lasers, not lightning blasts, said Cardiff University's Daniel Mitchard, who was not involved in the study. What's more, he noted in an article accompanying the study in the journal Nature, the electrical discharges were heard \u2014 not seen.",
      "\"It really is a chance discovery to hear something else going on nearby, and everything points to this being Martian lightning,\" Mitchard said in an email. But until new instruments are sent to verify the findings, \"I think there will still be a debate from some scientists as to whether this really was lightning,\" he said.",
      "\"Like a thunderstorm on Earth, but barely visible with a naked eye\"",
      "Lightning has already been confirmed on Jupiter and Saturn, and Mars has long been suspected of having it too.",
      "To find it, Chide and his team analyzed 28 hours of Perseverance recordings, documenting episodes of \"mini lightning\" based on acoustic and electric signals.",
      "Electrical discharges generated by the fast-moving dust devils lasted just a few seconds, while those spawned by dust storms lingered as long as 30 minutes.",
      "\"It's like a thunderstorm on Earth, but barely visible with a naked eye and with plenty of faint zaps,\" Chide said in an email. He noted that the thin, carbon dioxide-rich Martian atmosphere absorbs much of the sound, making some of the zaps barely perceptible.",
      "Mars' atmosphere is more prone than Earth's to electrical discharging and sparking through contact among grains of dust and sand, according to Chide.",
      "\"The current evidence suggests it is extremely unlikely that the first person to walk on Mars could, as they plant a flag on the surface, be struck down by a bolt of lightning,\" Mitchard wrote in Nature. But the \"small and frequent static-like discharges could prove problematic for sensitive equipment.\"",
      "These aren't the first Mars sounds transmitted by Perseverance. Earthlings have listened in to the rover's wheels crunching over the Martian surface and the whirring blades of its no-longer-flying helicopter sidekick, Ingenuity.",
      "Perseverance has been scouring a dry river delta at Mars since 2021, collecting samples of rock for possible signs of ancient microscopic life. NASA plans to return these core samples to Earth for laboratory analysis, but the delivery is on indefinite hold as the space agency pursues cheaper options.",
      "Blue Origin's Blue and Gold NASA satellites en route to study Mars",
      "Earlier this month, Blue Origin launched its second heavy-lift New Glenn rocket that put two small NASA satellites onto a long, looping course to Mars. The satellites are aiming to learn more about how the sun has slowly blown away the red planet's once-thick atmosphere.",
      "The NASA-sponsored payload, managed by the University of California, Berkeley Space Sciences Laboratory, is made up of two small, low-budget satellites known as Blue and Gold that make up the heart of the ESCAPADE mission \u2014 Escape, Plasma Acceleration and Dynamics Explorers. Mars launch windows typically open every two years when Earth and the red planet reach favorable positions in their orbits to permit direct flights using current rockets. The next such window opens in 2026.",
      "Passing within 600 miles of Earth in November 2027, the ESCAPADE probes will make velocity-boosting gravity-assist flybys, augmented by onboard propulsion, to finally head for Mars. In all, the twin spacecraft will spend a full year in that initial kidney bean-shaped orbit out past the moon and back, and another 10 months in transit to Mars. The probes won't reach the red planet until September 2027.",
      "While the ESCAPADE mission is modest compared to Mars rovers and more sophisticated orbiters, the probes are designed to answer key questions about the evolution of the Martian atmosphere.",
      "Mars once had a global magnetic field like Earth's, but its molten core, which powered that field, mostly froze in place long ago, leaving only patchy, isolated remnants of that once-protective field in magnetized deposits.",
      "Without a protective global field like Earth's, the Martian atmosphere faces a constant barrage of high-speed electrons and protons blown away from the sun and from dense clouds of charged particles erupting from powerful solar storms.",

      "Experts say a shark rarely attacks more than one person.",
      "The attack occurred at Crowdy Bay National Park, which is known for beach camping, fishing spots and hiking tracks 224 miles north of Sydney. The incident occurred just weeks after a shark\u00a0fatally mauled a surfer\u00a0at a beach off Sydney.",
      "Beaches in the area and to the north of the attack were closed to swimmers indefinitely, Police Chief Insp. Timothy Bayly said.",

A camera for the surf media website swellnet.com captured the moment that the shark seemingly came out of nowhere and knocked 61-year-old Andy McDonald off his board.",

      "GUT IMBALANCE MAY BE DRIVING AMERICA\u2019S FOOD ALLERGY EPIDEMIC, EXPERTS WARN",

      "Portion control is key to not only maintaining a healthy weight, but also preventing heartburn. (iStock)",

      "\"A gentle walk after meals helps digestion and reduces reflux,\" he said.",
      "CLICK HERE TO SIGN UP FOR OUR HEALTH NEWSLETTER",
      "Even light activity helps the stomach process food and reduces the pressure that leads to heartburn. No matter how appealing it may seem, Shachner recommends avoiding the post-feast nap.",
      "4. Not knowing your triggers",
      "Some foods and drinks are more likely to cause trouble. Common triggers include fatty or fried dishes, tomato sauces, citrus, chocolate, peppermint, alcohol, coffee and carbonated drinks, according to the doctor.",
      "\"Everyone\u2019s triggers are a little different, so paying attention to which foods cause discomfort is important,\" he added.",
      "Staying upright for at least two to three hours after eating helps the stomach empty more efficiently and prevents acid reflux. (iStock)",
      "5. Ignoring symptoms",
      "An occasional bout of heartburn isn\u2019t usually cause for concern, but if you\u2019re having symptoms two or more times a week, or if over-the-counter remedies stop working, the doctor said it's important to pay attention.",
      "CLICK HERE TO DOWNLOAD THE FOX NEWS APP",
      "\"That\u2019s when it\u2019s time to see a doctor for a full evaluation,\" he said.",
      "Chronic reflux can signal gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD), which can cause long-term damage if left untreated.",
      "Frequent heartburn can signal something more serious, but it\u2019s often treatable. (iStock)",
      "The doctor also cautioned about relying too heavily on antacids or acid reducers. \"It\u2019s best to use them under the guidance of a healthcare professional who can identify and treat the root cause rather than just the symptoms,\" he advised.",

    "story": [
      "Fox News correspondent Madison Scarpino reports on the latest in the Tennessee special election on 'The Big Weekend Show.'",
      "We\u2019ll know Wednesday morning if a special election in Tennessee is truly a referendum on country music, pedal taverns and bachelorettes.",
      "Or, if we can divine a deeper political meaning from the results of the special election in Tennessee\u2019s 7th Congressional District.",
      "Democrat Aftyn Behn is trying to tip the scales in favor of her party in a district which President Trump carried by about 20 points and former Rep. Mark Green, R-Tenn., won by a similar percentage last fall.",
      "Behn faces GOPer Matt Van Epps. It\u2019s a Republican district. But political observers are watching the race to gauge potential weakness by President Trump, a softness in the Trump coalition, issues with the Republican brand or early indications of a possible blue wave in the 2026 midterms.",
      "DEMOCRATS, REPUBLICANS GO ALL IN ON FINAL 2025 CONGRESSIONAL BALLOT BOX SHOWDOWN",
      "Depending on who you ask, the race for Tennessee's 7th congressional district \u2013 between Republican nominee Matt Van Epps, former state Department of General Services, and Aftyn Behn, a Democratic state representative \u2013 may be headed for a photo finish. (George Walker IV/AP Photo)",
      "It was Behn who proclaimed that she abhorred Nashville several years ago. \"I hate the bachelorettes, I hate the pedal taverns, I hate country music. I hate all the things that make Nashville apparently an \u2018it city,\u2019\" complained Behn.",
      "About all Behn left out in her animus toward Music City was dissing The Grand Ole Opry, hot chicken and Goo Goo Clusters. But if voters go goo goo over Behn Tuesday, Republicans face a cluster of another sort. A Behn victory may signal major problems for Republicans and President Trump heading into the midterms.",
      "Behn is characterized as the \"AOC of Tennessee,\" a reference to progressive Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, D-N.Y. Republicans have been sure to boomerang that against Behn, suggesting she\u2019s not in tune with the district, leans too far to the left and is closer to the liberal values of New York or Los Angeles than Nashville. Republicans believe Behn is just a bad fit for Nashville. Kind of like having Bad Bunny perform at the Ryman Auditorium.",
      "\"It shouldn\u2019t even be close. But it is,\" mused Rep. Tim Burchett, R-Tenn., on Fox.",
      "So Republicans are pouring in money to protect the seat. Democrats are pouring in money to steal the seat. If Democrats pull off the upset, the party should uproot the goalposts at FirstBank Stadium in downtown Nashville and dump it in the Cumberland River. Kind of what Vanderbilt fans did last year when the Commodores upset number one-ranked Alabama.",
      "Let\u2019s explore what a Behn win might mean for Republicans. It could indicate that voters are tiring of President Trump. Or that the GOP brand is toxic. Or perhaps it\u2019s the continuation of a trend which Democrats enjoyed this fall: near blowout wins by New Jersey Gov.-elect Mikie Sherrill and\u00a0Virginia Gov.-elect Abigail Spanberger.",
      "But there\u2019s a downside for Democrats. Yes. They may flip the seat. But a win may also show that the party is tilting more to the left. It would be hard to argue with success if Behn prevails, regardless of her progressive streak. But this may give other liberals ideas that they can win in other red or purple districts. That may work against Democrats \u2013 especially since every Republican, except President Trump \u2013 has highlighted the left-wing politics of New York City Mayor-elect Zohran Mamdani.",
      "TRUMP MAKES 11TH-HOUR PLEA FOR MATT VAN EPPS OVER AFTYN BEHN, WHOM HE CLAIMS 'HATES CHRISTIANITY'",
      "Democrats probably need to run more centrist candidates in purple areas to regain control of the House. A Behn victory could open the floodgates for a host of progressive candidates in competitive House districts nationwide. Behn\u2019s message \u2013 or that of Ocasio-Cortez or Mamdani \u2013 won\u2019t work in most places where Democrats need to be successful to seize control of the House.",
      "But what if Republicans hold the seat and Van Epps wins?",
      "It probably depends by how much.",
      "Yes, there were five special elections in 2017 \u2013 the first year President Trump was originally in office \u2013 which Democrats made competitive. All were closer than they should have been. But Democrats didn\u2019t win any of them. Still, astute political observers suggested there was unpopularity with the president and the GOP agenda. Democrats won 41 seats and gained control of the House in the 2018 midterms.",
      "So, even if Van Epps wins, examine the margin. And if Behn wins, see if Republicans downplay it because it was a special election and the customary electorate just doesn\u2019t turn out for special elections. Especially one wedged between Thanksgiving and Christmas.",
      "If Republicans hold the seat, the GOP will argue this was a repudiation of a leftist like Behn and someone who was out of step. They will also suggest that it\u2019s a GOP seat and Republicans should win anyway. That\u2019s what happened earlier this year when there was consternation before two Florida special elections. But Reps. Randy Fine, R-Fla., and Jimmy Patronis, R-Fla., both won in March.",
      "If Van Epps wins, one must still pay attention to the margin. The seat, last held by former Rep. Mark Green, broke for President Trump by over 20% in 2024. (Nicole Hester/The Tennessean/USA TODAY NETWORK via Imagn Images)",
      "Here\u2019s another factor which bears watching: the message the press corps and political observers glean from the election results. After all, special elections are always special. It\u2019s natural for analysts and journalists to search for particular meanings or signposts in these contests. Such was the case with the off-year elections in New Jersey, Virginia and New York City. Sometimes these observations are spot-on. Other times, they mean nothing. If anything, there is a tendency to over-illuminate the outcomes of these contests. They are moments in time. Kind of like listening to a few bars of a song. Maybe it tells you a lot about the song. Maybe not.",
      "House Republicans could well freak out if Behn is victorious. There\u2019s lots of grumbling among Republicans. Some are frustrated by how their leadership handled the government shutdown. And others could follow Mark Green and Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene, R-Ga., and hit the exits early.",
      "This is a fragile time for House Republicans. That\u2019s one reason why a flip of this seat could mean a little bit more.",
      "DEM HOUSE HOPEFUL GETTING YANKED FROM GOVERNOR'S OFFICE DURING ATTEMPTED SIT-IN GOES VIRAL AHEAD OF ELECTION",
      "Still, it\u2019s rare to flip seats in House special elections. Former Rep. Don Cazayoux, D-La., won a special election in a red district in Louisiana in 2008 after former Rep. Richard Baker, R-La., resigned. But current Sen. Bill Cassidy, R-La., then won that seat in the general election and served in the House before moving to the Senate.",
      "Former Rep. Mayra Flores, R-Texas, flipped the seat held by former Rep. Filemon Vela, D-Texas, in 2022. But she lost reelection that fall.",
      "Former Rep. Mike Garcia, R-Calif., won a special election in 2020 after former Rep. Katie Hill, D-Calif., resigned just months into office. Garcia held the seat until Rep. George Whitesides, D-Calif., defeated him a year ago.",
      "Former Rep. Charles Djou, R-Hawaii, won a special election in Hawaii in 2010 against two Democrats \u2013 former Rep. Colleen Hanabusa, D-Hawaii, and Rep. Ed Case, D-Hawaii. But Democrats got the seat back in 2012.",
      "Former Rep. Mary Peltola, D-Alaska, won a special election in 2022 to flip Alaska\u2019s at-large district from red to blue following the death of late Rep. Don Young, R-Alaska. Young held the seat for nearly 50 years. But Rep. Nick Begich III, R-Alaska, defeated Peltola last year.",
      "Just because seats are won in special election upsets, doesn't mean they've permanently fallen to the other party. Rep. Nick Begich III, R-Alaska, who unseated his Democratic predecessor, former Rep. Mary Peltola \u2013 herself a special election victor \u2013 is a prime example. (Bill Clark/CQ-Roll Call, Inc via Getty Images)",
      "In short, even if someone flips a seat, it\u2019s rare that they have the seat for long. Often, only through the next regular election.",
      "So a word of caution as you evaluate the election results on Tuesday night. If Republicans hold the seat, that may be expected. If Democrats flip the seat, some will proclaim it\u2019s the second coming of the Music City Miracle.",

      "While much of the focus turns to Santa tracking, the real work continues in the background \u2014 scanning radar feeds, monitoring satellite data and staying ready to respond to any threat that might appear.

For a few hours, a command built for high-stakes warning and response turns into a small slice of holiday normalcy, even as the mission carries on.",

    "story": [
      "FOX Business correspondent Darren Botelho reports on growing concerns about the misuse of artificial intelligence after a major U.S. company, Anthropic, detected a cyberattack using AI by Chinese-sponsored hackers.",
      "Cybersecurity has been reshaped by the rapid rise of advanced artificial intelligence tools, and recent incidents show just how quickly the threat landscape is shifting.",
      "Over the past year, we've seen a surge in attacks powered by AI models that can write code, scan networks and automate complex tasks. This capability has helped defenders, but it has also enabled attackers to move faster than before.",
      "The latest example is a major cyberespionage campaign conducted by a Chinese state-linked group that used Anthropic's Claude to carry out large parts of an attack with very little human involvement.",
      "HACKER EXPLOITS AI CHATBOT IN CYBERCRIME SPREE",
      "Sign up for my FREE CyberGuy Report\u00a0Get my best tech tips, urgent security alerts and exclusive deals delivered straight to your inbox. Plus, you\u2019ll get instant access to my Ultimate Scam Survival Guide \u2014 free when you join my CYBERGUY.COM newsletter",
      "How Chinese hackers turned Claude into an automated attack machine",
      "In mid-September 2025, Anthropic investigators spotted unusual behavior that eventually revealed a coordinated and well-resourced campaign. The threat actor, assessed with high confidence as a Chinese state-sponsored group, had used Claude Code to target roughly 30 organizations worldwide. The list included major tech firms, financial institutions, chemical manufacturers and government bodies. A small number of those attempts resulted in successful breaches.",
      "Claude handled most of the operation autonomously, triggering thousands of requests and generating detailed documentation of the attack for future use. (Kurt \"CyberGuy\" Knutsson)",
      "This was not a typical intrusion. The attackers built a framework that let Claude act as an autonomous operator. Instead of asking the model to help, they tasked it with executing most of the attack. Claude inspected systems, mapped out internal infrastructure and flagged databases worth targeting. The speed was unlike anything a human team could replicate.",
      "To get around Claude's safety rules, the attackers broke their plan into tiny, innocent-looking steps. They also told the model it was part of a legitimate cybersecurity team performing defensive testing. Anthropic later noted that the attackers didn't simply hand tasks to Claude; they engineered the operation to make the model believe it was performing authorized pentesting work, splitting the attack into harmless-looking pieces and using multiple jailbreak techniques to push past its safeguards. Once inside, Claude researched vulnerabilities, wrote custom exploits, harvested credentials and expanded access. It worked through these steps with little supervision and reported back only when it needed human approval for major decisions.",
      "The model also handled the data extraction. It collected sensitive information, sorted it by value and identified high-privilege accounts. It even created backdoors for future use. In the final stage, Claude generated detailed documentation of what it had done. This included stolen credentials, systems analyzed and notes that could guide future operations.",
      "Across the entire campaign, investigators estimate that Claude performed around 80-90% of the work. Human operators stepped in only a handful of times. At its peak, the AI triggered thousands of requests, often multiple per second, a pace still far beyond what any human team could achieve. Although it occasionally hallucinated credentials or misread public data as secret, those errors underscored that fully autonomous cyberattacks still face limitations, even when an AI model handles the majority of the work.",
      "Why this AI-powered Claude attack is a turning point for cybersecurity",
      "This campaign shows how much the barrier to high-end cyberattacks has dropped. A group with far fewer resources could now attempt something similar by leaning on an autonomous AI agent to do the heavy lifting. Tasks that once required years of expertise can now be automated by a model that understands context, writes code and uses external tools without direct oversight.",
      "Earlier incidents documented AI misuse, but humans were still steering every step. This case is different. The attackers needed very little involvement once the system was in motion. And while the investigation focused on usage within Claude, researchers believe similar activity is happening across other advanced models, which might include Google Gemini, OpenAI's ChatGPT or Musk's Grok.",
      "This raises a difficult question. If these systems can be misused so easily, why continue building them? According to researchers, the same capabilities that make AI dangerous are also what make it essential for defense. During this incident, Anthropic's own team used Claude to analyze the flood of logs, signals and data its investigation uncovered. That level of support will matter even more as threats grow.",
      "We reached out to Anthropic for comment but did not hear back before our deadline.",
      "Hackers used Claude to map networks, scan systems and identify high-value databases in a fraction of the time human attackers would need. (Kurt \"CyberGuy\" Knutsson)",

      "7 ways you can protect yourself from AI-driven cyberattacks",
      "You may not be the direct target of a state-sponsored campaign, but many of the same techniques trickle down to everyday scams, credential theft and account takeovers. Here are seven detailed steps you can take to stay safer.",
      "Strong antivirus software does more than scan for known malware. It looks for suspicious patterns, blocked connections and abnormal system behavior. This is important because AI-driven attacks can generate new code quickly, which means traditional signature-based detection is no longer enough.",
      "The best way to safeguard yourself from malicious links that install malware, potentially accessing your private information, is to have strong antivirus software installed on all your devices. This protection can also alert you to phishing emails and ransomware scams, keeping your personal information and digital assets safe.",
      "Get my picks for the best 2025 antivirus protection winners for your Windows, Mac, Android and iOS devices at Cyberguy.com",
      "A good password manager helps you create long, random passwords for every service you use. This matters because AI can generate and test password variations at high speed. Using the same password across accounts can turn a single leak into a full compromise.",
      "Next, see if your email has been exposed in past breaches. Our No. 1 password manager (see Cyberguy.com) pick includes a built-in breach scanner that checks whether your email address or passwords have appeared in known leaks. If you discover a match, immediately change any reused passwords and secure those accounts with new, unique credentials.",
      "Check out the best expert-reviewed password managers of 2025 at Cyberguy.com",
      "A large part of modern cyberattacks begins with publicly available information. Attackers often gather email addresses, phone numbers, old passwords and personal details from data broker sites. AI tools make this even easier, since they can scrape and analyze huge datasets in seconds. A personal data removal service helps clear your information from these broker sites so you are harder to profile or target.",
      "FAKE CHATGPT APPS ARE HIJACKING YOUR PHONE WITHOUT YOU KNOWING",
      "While no service can guarantee the complete removal of your data from the internet, a data removal service is really a smart choice. They aren't cheap, and neither is your privacy. These services do all the work for you by actively monitoring and systematically erasing your personal information from hundreds of websites. It's what gives me peace of mind and has proven to be the most effective way to erase your personal data from the internet. By limiting the information available, you reduce the risk of scammers cross-referencing data from breaches with information they might find on the dark web, making it harder for them to target you.",

      "Get a free scan to find out if your personal information is already out on the web: Cyberguy.com",
      "Strong passwords alone are not enough when attackers can steal credentials through malware, phishing pages or automated scripts. Two-factor authentication adds a serious roadblock. Use app-based codes or hardware keys instead of SMS. While no method is perfect, this extra layer often stops unauthorized logins even when attackers have your password.",
      "Attackers rely heavily on known vulnerabilities that people forget or ignore. System updates patch these flaws and close off entry points that attackers use to break in. Enable automatic updates on your phone, laptop, router and the apps you use most. If an update looks optional, treat it as important anyway, because many companies downplay security fixes in their release notes.",
      "Malicious apps are one of the easiest ways attackers get inside your device. Stick to official app stores and avoid APK sites, shady download portals and random links shared on messaging apps. Even on official stores, check reviews, download counts and the developer name before installing anything. Grant the minimum permissions required and avoid apps that ask for full access for no clear reason.",
      "AI tools have made phishing more convincing. Attackers can generate clean messages, imitate writing styles and craft perfect fake websites that match the real ones. Slow down when a message feels urgent or unexpected. Never click links from unknown senders, and verify requests from known contacts through a separate channel. If a pop-up claims your device is infected or your bank account is locked, close it and check directly through the official website.",
      "By breaking tasks into small, harmless-looking steps, the threat actors tricked Claude into writing exploits, harvesting credentials and expanding access.\u00a0 (Kurt \"CyberGuy\" Knutsson)",
      "Kurt's key takeaway",
      "The attack carried out through Claude signals a major shift in how cyber threats will evolve. Autonomous AI agents can already perform complex tasks at speeds no human team can match, and this gap will only widen as models improve. Security teams now need to treat AI as a core part of their defensive toolkit, not a future add-on. Better threat detection, stronger safeguards and more sharing across the industry are going to be crucial. Because if attackers are already using AI at this scale, the window to prepare is shrinking fast.",

    "story": [
      "Safeguarding your phone and personal data has never been more crucial.",
      "Android users have been dealing with a steady rise in financial malware for years. Threats like Hydra, Anatsa and Octo have shown how attackers can take over a phone, read everything on the screen and drain accounts before you even notice anything wrong. Security updates have helped slow some of these strains, but malware authors keep adapting with new tricks.",
      "The latest variant spotted in circulation is one of the most capable yet. It can silence your phone, take screenshots of banking apps, read clipboard entries, and even automate crypto wallet transactions. This threat is now known as Android BankBot YNRK, and it is far more advanced than typical mobile malware.",
      "Sign up for my FREE CyberGuy ReportGet my best tech tips, urgent security alerts and exclusive deals delivered straight to your inbox. Plus, you\u2019ll get instant access to my Ultimate Scam Survival Guide \u2014 free when you join my CYBERGUY.COM newsletter",

      "HOW ANDROID MALWARE LETS THIEVES ACCESS YOUR ATM CASH",
      "Android banking malware is getting harder to spot as attackers use new tricks to take over phones and drain accounts. (Thomas Trutschel/Photothek via Getty Images)",
      "BankBot YNRK hides inside fake Android apps that appear legitimate when installed. In the samples analyzed by researchers at Cyfirma, the attackers used apps that impersonated official digital ID tools. Once installed, the malware begins profiling the device by collecting details such as brand, model and installed apps. It checks whether the device is an emulator to avoid automated security analysis. It also maps known models to screen resolutions, which helps it tailor its behavior to specific phones.",
      "To blend in, the malware can disguise itself as Google News. It does this by changing its app name and icon, then loading the real news.google.com site inside a WebView. While the victim believes the app is genuine, the malware quietly runs its background services.",
      "One of its first actions is to mute audio and notification alerts. This prevents victims from hearing incoming messages, alarms or calls that could signal unusual account activity. It then requests access to Accessibility Services. If granted, this allows the malware to interact with the device interface just like a user. From that point onward, it can press buttons, scroll through screens and read everything displayed on the device.",
      "BankBot YNRK also adds itself as a Device Administrator app. This makes it harder to remove and helps it restart itself after a reboot. To maintain long-term access, it schedules recurring background jobs that relaunch the malware every few seconds as long as the phone is connected to the internet.",
      "What does the malware steal",
      "Once the malware receives commands from its remote server, it gains near-complete control of the phone. It sends device information and installed app lists to the attackers, then receives a list of financial apps it should target. This list includes major banking apps used in Vietnam, Malaysia, Indonesia and India, along with several global cryptocurrency wallets.",
      "With Accessibility permissions enabled, the malware can read everything shown on the screen. It captures UI metadata such as text, view IDs and button positions. This helps it reconstruct a simplified version of any app's interface. Using this data, it can enter login details, swipe through menus or confirm transfers. It can also set text inside fields, install or remove apps, take photos, send SMS, turn call forwarding on and open banking apps in the background while the screen appears inactive.",
      "In cryptocurrency wallets, the malware acts like an automated bot. It can open apps such as Exodus or MetaMask, read balances and seed phrases, dismiss biometric prompts, and carry out transactions. Because all actions happen through Accessibility, the attacker never needs your passwords or PINs. Anything visible on the screen is enough.",
      "The malware also monitors the clipboard, so if users copy OTPs, account numbers or crypto keys, the data is immediately sent to the attackers. With call forwarding enabled, incoming bank verification calls can be silently redirected. All of these actions happen within seconds of the malware activating.",

      "Strong antivirus software helps catch trouble early by spotting suspicious behavior before it harms your Android device or exposes your data. It checks apps as you install them, alerts you to risky permissions and blocks known malware threats. Many top antivirus options also scan links and messages for danger, which adds an important layer of protection when scams move fast.",
      "The best way to safeguard yourself from malicious links that install malware, potentially accessing your private information, is to have strong antivirus software installed on all your devices.

These services do all the work for you by actively monitoring and systematically erasing your personal information from hundreds of websites. It's what gives me peace of mind and has proven to be the most effective way to erase your personal data from the internet.

      "Avoid downloading APKs from random websites, forwarded messages or social media posts. Most banking malware spreads through sideloaded apps that look official but contain hidden code. The Play Store is not perfect, but it offers scanning, app verification and regular take-downs that greatly reduce the risk of installing infected apps.",
      "System updates often patch security issues that attackers exploit to bypass protections. Updating your apps is just as important, since outdated versions may contain weaknesses. Turn on automatic updates so that your device stays protected without you having to check manually.",
      "A password manager helps you create long, unique passwords for every account. It also saves you from typing passwords directly into apps, which reduces the chance of malware capturing them from your clipboard or keystrokes. If one password gets exposed, the rest of your accounts remain safe.",
      "Next, see if your email has been exposed in past breaches. Our No. 1 password manager (see Cyberguy.com) pick includes a built-in breach scanner that checks whether your email address or passwords have appeared in known leaks. If you discover a match, immediately change any reused passwords and secure those accounts with new, unique credentials.",

Also, look through your installed apps and uninstall any tool or service you do not remember adding. Regular reviews help you spot threats early before they can steal data.",
      "Kurt's key takeaway",
      "BankBot YNRK is one of the most capable Android banking threats discovered recently. It combines device profiling, strong persistence, UI automation and data theft to gain full control over a victim's financial apps. Because much of its activity relies on Accessibility permissions, a single tap from the user can give attackers complete access. Staying safe means avoiding unofficial APKs, reviewing installed apps regularly and being cautious of any sudden request to enable special permissions.",

    "story": [
      "Paradromics is shifting from research to clinical trials.",
      "A U.S. neurotechnology startup called Paradromics is gaining momentum in the fast-growing field of brain-computer interfaces. The FDA has approved its first human trial built to test whether its fully implantable device can restore speech for people with paralysis. This milestone gives the Austin company a strong position in a competitive space, shaping the future of neural technology.",
      "Paradromics received Investigational Device Exemption status for the Connect-One Early Feasibility Study using its Connexus BCI. It is the first approved study to explore speech restoration with a fully implantable system. The research team wants to evaluate safety and see how well the device converts neural activity into text or a synthesized voice.",

      "BRAIN IMPLANT TURNS THOUGHTS INTO DIGITAL COMMANDS",
      "How the brain implant works",
      "The implant uses hundreds of tiny electrodes to capture detailed signals from the motor cortex where the brain forms sounds and shapes words. (Paradromics)",
      "Paradromics developed a fully implantable speech-focused brain device called the Connexus BCI. The company designed it to capture detailed neural signals that support real-time communication for people who cannot speak. This system uses high-resolution electrodes and an implanted wireless setup to record activity from individual neurons involved in forming speech.",
      "The Connexus BCI has a titanium body with more than 400 platinum-iridium electrodes placed just below the brain's surface. Each electrode is thinner than a human hair. These electrodes record neural firing patterns in the motor cortex, where the brain controls the lips, tongue and larynx.",
      "Surgeons place the implant under the skin and connect it with a thin cable to a wireless transceiver in the chest. That transceiver sends data through a secure optical link to a second transceiver worn on the body. The external unit powers the system with inductive charging similar to wireless phone chargers.",
      "The collected signals then move to a compact computer that runs advanced language models. It analyzes the neural activity and converts it into text or into a synthetic voice based on the user's past recordings.",
      "Inside the Paradromics BCI human trial",
      "The trial begins with two participants. Each person will receive one 7.5-millimeter-wide electrode array placed 1.5 millimeters into the part of the motor cortex that controls the lips, tongue and larynx. During training sessions, the volunteers will imagine speaking sentences while the device learns the neural signatures of each sound.",
      "This is the first BCI trial that formally targets real-time synthetic voice generation. The study will also test whether the system can detect imagined hand movements and translate those signals into cursor control.",
      "If early results meet expectations, the trial could expand to ten people. Some participants may receive two implants to capture a richer set of signals.",
      "HOW A TINY RETINAL IMPLANT IS HELPING PEOPLE REGAIN THEIR SIGHT",
      "Cyberguy reached out to Paradromics for comment and received the following statement:",
      "Researchers are testing whether Paradromics\u2019 fully implantable brain device can turn neural activity into real-time speech for people with paralysis. (Synchron)",
      "\"Communication is a fundamental human need. For people with severe motor impairment, the inability to express themselves with family and friends or request basic needs makes living difficult. The FDA approved clinical study for the Connexus Brain-Computer Interface is the first step toward a future where commercially available neurotech can restore the ability to naturally speak and seamlessly use a computer.",
      "The fully implanted Connexus BCI is designed to record brain signals from individual neurons, capturing the massive amounts of data required for high performance applications like speech restoration and complex mouse and keyboard hand actions. Built from proven medical-grade materials, Connexus BCI is engineered for daily long-term use, backed by more than three years of stable pre-clinical recordings.",
      "How Paradromics compares to other BCI companies",
      "Paradromics joins Synchron and Neuralink at the front of the implanted BCI race. Synchron uses a stent-like device placed in a blood vessel to record broad neural patterns. Neuralink uses flexible threads with many recording sites to capture high-bandwidth signals from individual neurons.",
      "Paradromics sits in the middle of these two approaches by using a fully implantable system that still captures single-neuron detail. Researchers believe this design may offer long-term stability for everyday communication.",
      "What this means for you",
      "This breakthrough could make a major difference for people who have lost their ability to speak after ALS, stroke or spinal cord injury. A system that converts thought into speech could help them talk in real time and regain independence. It may also allow hands-free computer control, which can improve daily living.",
      "If the trial succeeds, the tech could change how assistive communication devices work and speed up patient access to advanced tools.",
      "During the trial, volunteers imagine speaking while advanced AI models learn their neural patterns and convert those signals into text or a synthetic voice. (Paradromics)",

      "BRAIN IMPLANT FOR EPILEPSY TESTED IN 20-MINUTE SURGERY",
      "Kurt's key takeaways",
      "Paradromics is taking a careful but bold path toward practical BCI communication. The first stage is small but meaningful. It sets the foundation for devices that may restore speech with natural flow and faster response times. As more trials move forward, this field could shift from experimental to everyday use faster than many expect.",

      "Attackers have a new tool that targets Microsoft 365 users at a massive scale.",
      "Security researchers say a phishing platform called Quantum Route Redirect, or QRR, is behind a growing wave of fake login pages hosted on nearly 1,000 domains. These pages look real enough to fool many users while also slipping past some automated scanners.",
      "QRR runs realistic email lures that mimic DocuSign requests, payment notices, voicemail alerts or QR-code prompts. Each message routes victims to a fake Microsoft 365 login page built to harvest usernames and passwords. The kit often lives on parked or compromised legitimate domains that add a false sense of safety for anyone who clicks.",

      "A fast follow to other major Microsoft credential attacks",
      "QRR appeared soon after Microsoft disrupted a major phishing network known as RaccoonO365. That service sold ready-made Microsoft login copies used to steal more than 5,000 sets of credentials, including accounts tied to over 20 US healthcare organizations. Subscribers paid as little as $12 a day to send thousands of phishing emails.",
      "Microsoft's Digital Crimes Unit later shut down 338 related websites and identified Joshua Ogundipe from Nigeria as the operator. Investigators tied him to the phishing code and a crypto wallet that earned more than $100,000. Microsoft and Health-ISAC have since filed a lawsuit in New York that accuses him of multiple cybercrime violations.",
      "Other recent examples include kits like VoidProxy, Darcula, Morphing Meerkat and Tycoon2FA. QRR builds on these tools with automation, bot filtering and a dashboard that helps attackers run large campaigns fast.",
      "What makes QRR so effective",
      "QRR uses about 1,000 domains. Many are real sites that were parked or compromised, which helps the pages pass as legitimate. The URLs also follow a predictable pattern that can look normal to users at a glance.",
      "The kit includes automated filtering that detects bots. It sends scanners to harmless pages and sends real people to the credential-harvesting site. Attackers can manage campaigns inside a control panel that logs traffic and activity. These features let them scale up quickly without technical skill.",
      "Security analysts say organizations can no longer depend on URL scanning alone. Layered defenses and behavioral analysis have become essential for spotting threats that use domain rotation and automated evasion.",

      "HACKERS FIND A WAY AROUND BUILT-IN WINDOWS PROTECTIONS",
      "Why this matters for Microsoft 365 users",
      "When attackers get your Microsoft 365 login, they can see your email, grab files and even send new phishing messages that look like they came from you. That can create a chain reaction that spreads fast. This is why the steps below all work together to block these threats before they turn into something bigger.",
      "Steps to stay safe from QRR and other Microsoft 365 phishing attacks",
      "Use these simple actions to shrink the risk from fake Microsoft 365 pages and look-alike emails.",
      "Take a second to look at who the email is really from. A slight misspelling, an unexpected attachment or wording that feels off is a big clue the message may be fake.",

      "The AI tags pull from reservation and POS data to highlight patterns like drink choices, spending ranges and dining habits across visits. (Jeffrey Greenberg/UCG/Universal Images Group via Getty Images)",
      "How OpenTable gathers this information",
      "OpenTable integrates with POS (Point of Sale) platforms such as Toast or Epos. These systems handle orders, payments and timing during a meal. When your contact details match your OpenTable account, the platform can connect your visit to your profile.",
      "This can include arrival time, general order details, time spent and bill totals. Reporting shows that these items help OpenTable generate AI summaries of non-identifiable guest data when the restaurant uses a supported POS system and has enabled data sharing. You do not need to book through OpenTable for this to happen. You only need an account and matching contact information.",
      "Some users who pulled their data through OpenTable's privacy request form saw very limited information. Basic contact details and a list of past reservations were the main items. That suggests the insight level depends on which restaurants use POS integrations and how long they have used them.",
      "Why restaurants want these insights",
      "Restaurants have tracked guest preferences for years. Staff may note favorite dishes or preferred seating. They may watch for frequent lateness or recurring celebrations. This helps them shape a smooth visit.",
      "OpenTable's AI-summarized guest insights aim to offer a simplified version of these notes. They highlight drink categories, spending ranges or behavior patterns. However, Menter notes the tags can be off base. A single business dinner can mark someone as a high spender. Eating with friends who order cocktails can make a person look like a cocktail lover. Because of this, Menter treats the tags as loose suggestions rather than reliable signals.",
      "THAT'S NOT A HUMAN TALKING TO YOU IN THE FAST FOOD DRIVE-THRU",
      "How the AI works",
      "OpenTable says the AI does not process personal guest data. Instead, it is employed for high-level classification and categorization of large, anonymized data sets. For instance, the AI analyzes various point-of-sale descriptions (like \"glass of cabernet\") to consistently categorize them as \"red wine,\" \"white wine,\" etc., without ever interacting with specific guest profiles.",
      "The platform says these insights can help staff suggest dishes or set a relaxed pace. OpenTable also says the use of POS information depends on the privacy settings you choose, and you can review, adjust or opt out of data sharing at any time. Still, the privacy policy uses broad terms like dining preferences.",
      "A TikTok video from a Michelin-starred restaurant host first revealed the AI-assisted diner tags now being tested in OpenTable\u2019s Pro tools. (iStock)",
      "\"Guest insights are the engine of personalization, allowing restaurants to optimize their service and deliver the kind of thoughtful hospitality that both benefits the business and offers a special experience for the diner,\" an OpenTable representative told CyberGuy. \"These insights come from a mix of sources \u2014 including OpenTable, our restaurant partners, and POS partners \u2014 and are limited to non-confidential information.\"",
      "\"They might help a server suggest a dish you\u2019ll love or recognize that you prefer a more relaxed dining pace,\" the representative said. \"We also share these insights across our network so restaurants can learn and improve the hospitality experience for everyone, not just individual guests. You\u2019re in charge of what data you share. Through your OpenTable preferences and settings, you can review, adjust, or opt out of data sharing at any time. What we share with restaurants is guided by the choices you\u2019ve made in your privacy preferences.\"",
      "What data gets shared and how to limit it",
      "If a diner is opted in, OpenTable shares your name, contact details, party size and special requests with the restaurant you book. The company also confirms that participating restaurants share POS data with OpenTable. This can include items ordered, bill totals and how long you stayed. OpenTable then turns this into aggregated insights.",

      "Security researcher Cody Kociemba uncovered this quiet data flow after digging into the backend as part of a repair bounty challenge run by FULU, a right-to-repair group cofounded by electronics repair expert and YouTuber Louis Rossmann. The challenge asked developers to restore lost smart features for unsupported Nest devices. Kociemba teamed up with the open-source community and created No Longer Evil, software that brings smart functionality back to these aging thermostats.",

      "Motion activity",
      "Ambient light data",
      "Kociemba says the volume of logs was extensive. He turned off the incoming data because he never expected the devices to remain connected to Google after the shutdown.",
      "Google previously said unsupported models will \"continue to report logs for issue diagnostics.\" However, Kociemba points out that Google cannot use that data to help customers anymore because support is fully discontinued. That makes the continued data flow even more puzzling.",

      "CyberGuy contacted Google for comment, and a spokesperson provided us with the statement,",
      "\"The Nest Learning Thermostat (1st and 2nd Gen) is no longer supported in the Nest and Home apps, but temperature and scheduling adjustments can still be made directly on the unit. These devices will soon be unpaired and removed from all user accounts. Diagnostic logs, which are not tied to a specific user account, will continue to be sent to Google for service and issue tracking. Users who prefer to stop providing these logs can simply disconnect their device from Wi-Fi via the on-device settings menu.\"",
      "The thermostats continue reporting temperature, motion and light data even though official support has ended.",
      "Why this discovery matters",
      "Google cut access to remote control, security updates, software updates and status checks through the Nest and Google Home apps. Owners can no longer rely on the devices for key smart features. Yet the thermostats still push data to Google, creating a one-way connection that helps the company more than the customer.",
      "Users do not benefit from the logs because support has been discontinued. Google cannot use these logs to diagnose problems or offer help. That raises questions about transparency and user choice for people who assumed the connection ended.",

After reviewing submissions, FULU awarded Kociemba and another developer known as Team Dinosaur the top bounty of $14,772 for bringing smart features back to early Nest models.",

      "Start by checking what Google has linked to your home devices. Visit myactivity.google.com and look for thermostat logs or events you do not expect.",
      "A guest network keeps the thermostat away from your main devices. This limits what the thermostat can reach and helps prevent broader access.",
      "Some routers let you stop individual devices from sending data to the internet. This cuts off log uploads while still letting the thermostat control heating and cooling.",
      "If the device menu still offers cloud settings, turn off anything related to remote access or online diagnostics. Even partial controls help reduce data flow.",
      "Check your connected devices in your Google settings. Remove any old Nest entries that no longer serve a purpose. This stops leftover links that may still send data.",
      "Some routers send analytics back to the router maker. Turn off cloud diagnostics to reduce the footprint of unsupported smart products.",
      "Unsupported devices lose security updates. If you cannot isolate the thermostat on your network, consider upgrading to a model that still receives patches.",
      "Pro Tip: Reduce your footprint with a data removal service",
      "A data removal service can help you cut down on the amount of personal information available to data brokers. This adds another layer of privacy that supports your smart home security.",
      "While no service can guarantee the complete removal of your data from the internet, a data removal service is really a smart choice. They aren't cheap, and neither is your privacy. These services do all the work for you by actively monitoring and systematically erasing your personal information from hundreds of websites. It's what gives me peace of mind and has proven to be the most effective way to erase your personal data from the internet.

    "story": [
      "Fox News Flash top headlines are here. Check out what's clicking on Foxnews.com.",
      "Smartphone banking has made life easier, but it has also opened new opportunities for cybercriminals.",
      "Over the past few years, we have seen Android malware steal passwords, intercept OTPs and even take remote control of phones to drain accounts. Some scams focus on fake banking apps, while others rely on phishing messages that trick you into entering sensitive details.",
      "Security researchers have now discovered a new threat that goes a step further. Instead of simply stealing login information, this malware gives thieves the ability to walk up to an ATM and withdraw your money in real time.",
      "Sign up for my FREE CyberGuy Report\u00a0Get my best tech tips, urgent security alerts and exclusive deals delivered straight to your inbox. Plus, you\u2019ll get instant access to my Ultimate Scam Survival Guide \u2014 free when you join my CYBERGUY.COM newsletter.",
      "Android malware like NGate tricks users into downloading fake banking apps that steal sensitive data. (Kurt \"CyberGuy\" Knutsson)",
      "How the NGate malware works",
      "The Polish Computer Emergency Response Team (CERT Polska) discovered a new Android malware called NGate that uses NFC activity to access a victim's bank account. This malware monitors contactless payment actions on the victim's phone and forwards all transaction data, including the PIN, directly to a server controlled by attackers. It does not just copy card details. Instead, it waits until the victim taps to pay or performs a verification step, then captures the fresh, one-time authentication codes that modern Visa and Mastercard chips generate.",
      "To pull this off, attackers need to infect the phone first. They typically send phishing messages claiming there is a security problem with the victim's bank account. These messages often push people to download a fake banking app from a non-official source. Once the victim installs it, the app walks them through fake verification prompts and requests permissions that allow it to read NFC activity. As soon as the victim taps their phone or enters their PIN, the malware captures everything the ATM needs to validate a withdrawal.",
      "MANAGE ANDROID APPS WITH THE NEW 'UNINSTALL' BUTTON",
      "Once installed, the malware captures NFC tap-to-pay codes and PINs the moment the victim uses their phone. (Kurt \"CyberGuy\" Knutsson)",
      "What attackers do with the stolen data at the ATM",
      "The attackers rely on speed. The one-time codes generated during an NFC transaction are valid for only a short period. As soon as the infected phone captures the data, the information is uploaded to the attacker's server. An accomplice waits near an ATM, holding a device capable of emulating a contactless card. This could be another phone, a smartwatch or custom NFC hardware.",
      "When the data arrives, the accomplice presents the card-emulating device at the ATM. Since the information contains fresh, valid authentication codes and the correct PIN, the machine treats it like a real card. The ATM authorizes the withdrawal because everything appears to match a legitimate transaction. All of this happens without the criminal ever touching the victim's physical card. Everything depends on timing, planning and getting the victim to unknowingly complete the transaction on their own phone.",
      "Criminals use the stolen, time-limited codes at an ATM to make real withdrawals without the victim\u2019s card. (Kurt \"CyberGuy\" Knutsson)",
      "7 steps you can take to stay safe from Android NGate malware",
      "As attacks like NGate become more sophisticated, staying safe comes down to a mix of good digital habits and a few simple tools that protect your phone and your financial data.",
      "Most malicious banking apps spread through direct links sent in texts or emails. These links lead to APK files hosted on random servers. When you install apps only from the Play Store, you get Google's built-in security checks. Play Protect regularly scans apps for malware and removes harmful ones from your device. However, it is important to note that Google Play Protect may not be enough. Historically, it isn't 100% foolproof at removing all known malware from Android devices. Even if attackers send convincing messages, avoid installing anything from outside the official store. If your bank wants you to update an app, you will always find it on the Play Store.",
      "One careless tap on a fake bank alert can hand criminals everything they need. Strong antivirus software can stop most threats before they cause damage. It scans new downloads, blocks unsafe links and alerts you when an app behaves in ways that could expose your financial data. Many threats like NGate rely on fake banking apps, so having real-time scanning turned on gives you an early warning if something suspicious tries to install itself.",

      "ATM \u2018JACKPOTTING\u2019 CRIME WAVE GROWS AFTER THIEVES WALK AWAY WITH HUNDREDS OF THOUSANDS IN CASH",
      "Security patches fix vulnerabilities that attackers use to hijack permission settings or read sensitive data. Updates also improve how Android monitors NFC and payment activity. Turn on automatic updates for both the operating system and apps, especially banking and payment apps. A fully updated device closes many of the holes that malware tries to exploit.",
      "Phishing attacks often direct you to fake websites or fake app login pages that look identical to the real thing. A password manager saves your credentials and fills them in only when the website or app is authentic. If it refuses to autofill, it is a clear sign that you are on a fake page. Consider using a password manager to generate and store complex passwords.",
      "Next, see if your email has been exposed in past breaches. Our No. 1 password manager pick includes a built-in breach scanner that checks whether your email address or passwords have appeared in known leaks. If you discover a match, immediately change any reused passwords and secure those accounts with new, unique credentials.",
      "Check out the best expert-reviewed password managers of 2025 at Cyberguy.com.",
      "Two-factor authentication gives you a second layer of protection, even if your password is compromised. App-based authenticators are more secure than SMS codes because they cannot be intercepted as easily. For banking apps, enabling 2FA adds friction for attackers trying to perform unauthorized actions. Combined with strong passwords from a password manager, it significantly reduces the chance of account takeover.",
      "Attackers rely on urgency to trick you. They often claim that your card is blocked, your account is frozen or a payment needs verification. These messages push you to act fast and install a fake app. Always pause and check your bank's official channels. Contact the bank through verified customer care numbers or the official app. Never click links or open attachments in unsolicited messages, even if they look legitimate.",
      "Most people install apps and forget about them. Over time, unused apps pile up with unnecessary permissions that increase risk. Open your phone's permission settings and check what each app can access. If a simple tool asks for access to NFC, messages or accessibility features, uninstall it. Attackers exploit these excessive permissions to monitor your activity or capture data without your knowledge.",
      "Kurt's key takeaway",
      "Cybercriminals are now combining social engineering with the secure hardware features inside modern payment systems. The malware does not break NFC security. Instead, it tricks you into performing a real transaction and steals the one-time codes at that moment. This makes the attack difficult to spot and even harder to reverse once the withdrawal goes through. The best defense is simple awareness. If a bank ever urges you to download an app from outside the Play Store, treat it as an immediate warning sign. Keeping your phone clean is now as important as keeping your physical card safe.",

      "\"They may start in South Florida,\" Braun said. \"From South Florida, they go to Atlanta. From Atlanta, they pass through Charlotte. Oftentimes, they may put victims in safe houses there.\"",

      "\"They move people and are trafficking to other locations very quickly,\" Braun told Fox News Digital. \"So, a lot of times when law enforcement gets tips or information, by the time they respond, the victim is already in a completely different place.

      "\"The FBI and Homeland Security are the two primary agencies in the United States that handle trafficking cases, largely due to the fact that they're federal cases because they're crossing state lines,\" Braun said. \"There has to be more collaboration between the federal partners and local partners, and more emphasis on the local partners having dedicated resources for human trafficking.\"",
      "The DOT\u2019s report echoes this sentiment, stating that the Department of Justice has \"little to no data related to human trafficking offenses\" involving commercial transit, while calling on officials to establish more robust data collection between federal and state law enforcement.",

      "However, Braun acknowledges that the difficulty of tracking down victims often falls on public awareness of the issue wreaking havoc throughout the country\u2019s most populous areas.",
      "\"I think because there's just not enough information out there to make people understand the real issue that's out there, and to really highlight this epidemic that we're facing as a country with human trafficking. I think more people need to know that this is a real problem for our country. It's a real plague.\"",

Is this peace-pilgrimage trip to the Middle East just pie in the sky?",
      "We certainly had pies in the sky on the flight from Rome. I was seated next to a colleague who brought a pecan pie (which smelled divine, no pun intended) and behind two who gifted our Chicago-born pope home-baked pumpkin pies. Pope Leo was over the moon! Our Thanksgiving meal was less exciting but appreciated, served with a menu, real silverware and cloth napkins.",

      "Pope Leo XIV arrived in Lebanon on Sunday, opening the second half of his first international trip as pontiff after three days in Turkey marked by calls for unity, peace and renewed ties among Christian communities.",
      "His stop in Lebanon places him in a nation where Christians have long-faced war, instability and a wave of emigration that has reshaped the country\u2019s demographics.",
      "Lebanon was once a Christian-majority country, a balance reflected in the 1932 census that recorded Christians as just over half the population. No official count has been conducted since, but demographic studies and independent estimates show a significant shift over the past century. As Reuters reported, Christians are now \"believed to make up roughly a third of Lebanon\u2019s population,\" a decline driven by emigration, conflict, and changing birth rates.",

      "JP De Gance, founder and president of Communio, told Fox News Digital that the choice of Turkey and Lebanon as the pope\u2019s first destinations is intentional. \"Pope Leo chose to make Turkey and Lebanon the site of his first trip very likely to emphasize two major themes of his pontificate. Coming out of the conclave that elected him, he has placed a great emphasis on both unity and on peace.\"",
      "Lebanon marks the most emotionally charged part of the trip. The last papal visit came in 2012. Pope Francis had hoped to travel there but was unable to make the journey because of health concerns. Lebanon is often described as having the highest proportion of Christians in the Middle East, yet these communities have been devastated by economic collapse, political paralysis and mass migration over the last decade.",

      "The Associated Press reported that the pope\u2019s schedule includes meetings with political leaders, Christian and Muslim clerics, and families affected by overlapping national crises. A key moment will come on Dec. 2 when he visits the Port of Beirut, the site of the 2020 explosion that killed more than 200 people and wounded thousands. His presence there is expected to draw significant attention in a country where many still demand accountability for the blast.",
      "Local media outlets report that large crowds are expected despite deep infrastructure problems and ongoing security challenges.",
      "The pope arrives amid one of Lebanon\u2019s most volatile periods in years, with repeated exchanges of fire along the southern border throughout 2024 and 2025 between Hezbollah and Israeli forces. The clashes displaced residents and raised fears of a wider conflict, prompting questions about whether the situation might force last-minute changes to the papal itinerary.",

He added that \"the situation was already well known even a few months ago, and all necessary precautionary measures have been taken.\"",
      "De Gance said the Lebanon leg underscores the pope\u2019s focus on Christians in the most vulnerable regions. \"In terms of peace, I believe the pope has added Lebanon to this trip because a great many Christian communities \u2014 both those in full communion with Rome and those who are Eastern Orthodox \u2014 are suffering in a war-torn region.\"",
      "He added that the trip also aims to draw international attention to communities often overlooked. \"Leo likely wants to bring the bully pulpit of the papacy to the region to bring a message of peace that also advocates for those often forgotten in the West \u2014 our Eastern Christian brothers and sisters.\"",

      "De Gance highlighted the significance of the commemoration. \"Pope Leo chose to commemorate the 1,700th anniversary of the Council of Nicea, which has such historic significance because this council helped define the reality \u2014 now still accepted by Protestants, Catholics and Orthodox \u2014 that Jesus Christ is truly God and truly man.\" He added, \"At the time of the council, a great many Christians had begun to reject this central apostolic truth.

      "Matthew R. Petrusek, Ph.D., senior director of the Word on Fire Institute, told Fox News Digital that the trip sends a clear signal about the priorities of the new pontiff. \"Pope Leo has signaled early in his papacy that one of his primary objectives is to give hope to Christians who live in regions where they face persecution or other difficulties living out their faith.

      "These members of \u201cZero Units,\u201d also known as National Strike Units, were among the most extensively vetted of any Afghans who worked with American forces. CIA officers hailed their bravery, skill and loyalty, and the agency prioritized their evacuation from Afghanistan following the fall of Kabul in 2021 because they were prime targets for the Taliban.",

You never know what\u2019s going on in someone\u2019s head, or why their mindset shifts.\u201d",

      "During the war, multiple human rights organizations alleged the Zero Units troops committed abuses and possible war crimes, including extrajudicial executions, partly due to flawed intelligence. A Human Rights Watch report alleged 14 incidents of serious abuses from 2017 to 2019.",
      "Former members of the strike force and former CIA officers who worked with them reject the allegations. They say that the Zero Units were trained in the laws of armed conflict and that each operation was carefully reviewed in advance.",

      "Proposed bipartisan legislation, the Afghan Adjustment Act, would have put an end to the legal uncertainty for the Zero Units veterans and all other Afghans who worked for the U.S. government during the war. The bill, which was endorsed by military veterans in Congress, also called for additional security vetting for Afghan refugees seeking permanent legal status. But despite several attempts over the past four years, Congress never adopted the proposal.",

Returning to Afghanistan is not an option for them, advocates say, because of the threat of being hunted down by the Taliban for working with Americans.",
      "During his first term, Trump agreed to a deal that called for the departure of all American troops from Afghanistan, and Biden decided to carry out the accord after delaying the exit day by several months. Since then, Trump has repeatedly criticized his predecessor for the way the U.S. withdrawal from Afghanistan was handled.",

      "The Defense Department conducted a second strike on a boat the Trump administration says was carrying drugs from Venezuela after the first strike on the boat failed to kill all of its occupants, one U.S. official and a source familiar with the Pentagon\u2019s actions that day told NBC News.",
      "The first of the two strikes conducted on Sept. 2 left at least two survivors, the officials said. The second strike killed the remaining survivors, according to the officials.",
      "\u200bThe boat was carrying 11 people, the Pentagon said at the time.",
      "Both strikes that day were the first of several known U.S. strikes on vessels in the Caribbean Sea that the administration alleges carry drugs to the U.S. Since then, the Pentagon has conducted more than 20 strikes on vessels it says were transporting drugs from Venezuela, killing more than 80 people.",
      "The Washington Post was the first to report about the second strike in the Sept. 2 boat attack. The Post reported that the second strike was ordered by the Joint Special Operations commander overseeing the strike who was complying with a previous order from Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth to \"kill everybody.\"",
      "NBC News has not confirmed that detail.",
      "The second strike is significant as some legal experts say that if it was ordered to kill people who would be otherwise incapacitated, it amounts to a war crime.",
      "Sen. Mark Kelly, D-Ariz., said Sunday on CNN that if the reporting on the second strike is true, \u201cit seems to\u201d constitute a war crime.",
      "\u201cIf what has been reported is accurate, I\u2019ve got serious concerns about anybody in that, you know, chain of command stepping over a line that they should never step over,\u201d Kelly said. \u201cWe are not Russia. We\u2019re not Iraq. We hold ourselves to a very high standard of professionalism.\u201d",
      "Speaking to reporters Sunday, President Donald Trump said he didn't know anything about the reported second strike, adding that Hegseth \"said he did not say that, and I believe him 100%.\"",
      "Asked whether he thought it would be legal if a second strike had taken place to kill those wounded in the first, Trump said, \"I don't know that that happened. And Pete said he did not want that \u2014 he didn't even know what people were talking about.",
      "\"We'll look into it. But no, I wouldn't have wanted that. Not a second strike. The first strike was very lethal. It was fine, and if there were two people around, but Pete said that didn't happen. I have great confidence,\" he added.",
      "\u201cPete said he did not order the death of those two men,\u201d Trump said.",
      "The top Republican and Democrat on the GOP-led Senate Armed Services Committee said in a statement Friday that the committee was aware of recent reports.",
      "\u201cThe Committee has directed inquiries to the [Department of Defense], and we will be conducting vigorous oversight to determine the facts related to these circumstances,\u201d Sens. Roger Wicker, R-Miss., and Jack Reed, D-R.I., said in the statement.",
      "The Republican-led House Armed Services Committee followed suit Saturday, with Reps. Mike Rogers, R-Ala., and Adam Smith, D-Wash., saying in a joint statement that the House committee is \u201ccommitted to providing rigorous oversight of the Department of Defense\u2019s military operations in the Caribbean.\u201d",
      "\u201cWe take seriously the reports of follow-on strikes on boats alleged to be ferrying narcotics in the SOUTHCOM region and are taking bipartisan action to gather a full accounting of the operation in question,\u201d Rogers and Smith wrote.",
      "Chief Pentagon spokesperson Sean Parnell told the Post in a statement that \u201cthis entire narrative is completely false.\u201d He told the newspaper that the \u201congoing operations to dismantle narcoterrorism and to protect the Homeland from deadly drugs have been a resounding success.\u201d",
      "Hegseth posted Friday evening on X that the strikes were intended to be \u201clethal, kinetic strikes.\u201d",
      "\u201cThe declared intent is to stop lethal drugs, destroy narco-boats, and kill the narco-terrorists who are poisoning the American people. Every trafficker we kill is affiliated with a Designated Terrorist Organization,\u201d he wrote.",

Trump is weighing military action against the country following nearly two dozen known U.S. strikes on vessels in the region, which have killed at least 82 people. Trump said Saturday morning that Venezuela\u2019s airspace should be considered \u201cclosed.\u201d",

    "story": [
      "President Donald Trump said Saturday morning that Venezuela\u2019s airspace should be considered \u201cclosed\u201d as he weighs military action against the South American nation.",
      "\u201cTo all Airlines, Pilots, Drug Dealers, and Human Traffickers, please consider THE AIRSPACE ABOVE AND SURROUNDING VENEZUELA TO BE CLOSED IN ITS ENTIRETY,\u201d Trump said in a post on Truth Social.",
      "Venezuela\u2019s government said it \u201cforcefully rejects\u201d Trump\u2019s claim about closing the airspace and that it was a \u201ccolonial threat\u201d intended to undermine the country\u2019s \u201cterritorial integrity, aeronautical security and full sovereignty.\u201d",
      "The Foreign Ministry said \u201csuch declarations constitute a hostile, unilateral and arbitrary act.\u201d",
      "Flight-tracking data appeared to show a handful of planes still above the country on Saturday morning.",
      "A number of airlines began rerouting flights away from Venezuela\u2019s airspace earlier this month, and the U.S. Federal Aviation Administration has issued a warning of \u201cheightened military activity\u201d in the area.",
      "On Wednesday, Venezuela\u2019s civil aviation authority stripped takeoff and landing rights from six commercial carriers it accused of \u201cjoining the actions of state terrorism promoted by the United States government and unilaterally suspending air commercial operations.\u201d",
      "On Thursday, Trump said the U.S. could \u201cvery soon\u201d begin targeting alleged Venezuelan drug traffickers on land, expanding operations that have so far focused on vessels in the Caribbean Sea.",
      "In Thanksgiving remarks to U.S. troops around the world, Trump thanked the Air Force\u2019s 7th Bomb Wing for its work to \u201cdeter Venezuelan drug traffickers\u201d and said \u201cit\u2019s about 85% stopped by sea \u2026 and we\u2019ll be starting to stop them by land.\u201d",
      "\u201cAlso, the land is easier, but that\u2019s going to start very soon,\u201d the president added, speaking from his Mar-a-Lago estate.",
      "For months, the president has intensified the United States\u2019 military presence in the region, ramping up pressure on Venezuela with strikes on alleged drug boats since early September. The military has carried out nearly two dozen known strikes on vessels that officials said were carrying drugs, killing at least 82 people.",
      "The USS Gerald R. Ford, a major aircraft carrier, arrived in the Caribbean last week, rounding out a buildup of U.S. military forces in the region that has not been seen for decades.",
      "The U.S. last week also designated the Cartel de los Soles, a group Washington alleges is run by Venezuelan President Nicol\u00e1s Maduro, as a foreign terrorist organization.",
      "Maduro has denied having any ties to the drug trade and has accused the U.S. of \u201cfabricating\u201d a war against him."

    "summary": "Surveying the state of America\u2019s artificial intelligence landscape earlier this year, Misha Laskin was concerned",
    "story": [
      "Surveying the state of America\u2019s artificial intelligence landscape earlier this year, Misha Laskin was concerned.",
      "Laskin, a theoretical physicist and machine learning engineer who helped create some of Google\u2019s most powerful AI models, saw a growing embrace among American AI companies of free, customizable and increasingly powerful \u201copen\u201d AI models.",
      "But most of these models were being made in China, and these systems were quickly gaining ground on their U.S. competitors.",
      "\u201cThese models were not that far behind the frontier. In fact, they were surprisingly close to the frontier. The ones that are coming now,\u201d Laskin said, pausing slightly, \u201cwell they\u2019re palpably close to the frontier.\u201d",
      "Laskin founded a startup called Reflection AI, recently valued at $8 billion, to provide an open-source American alternative to these increasingly capable Chinese models that have gained traction in Silicon Valley.",
      "\u201cYou\u2019re starting to see glimpses of open-model companies actually driving the frontier of intelligence in China, and overall, the frontier of intelligence,\u201d Laskin said.",
      "Over the past year, a growing share of America\u2019s hottest AI startups have turned to open Chinese AI models that increasingly rival, and sometimes replace, expensive U.S. systems as the foundation for American AI products.",
      "NBC News spoke to over 15 AI startup founders, machine-learning engineers, industry experts and investors, who said that while models from American companies continue to set the pace of progress at the frontier of AI capabilities, many Chinese systems are cheaper to access, more customizable and have become sufficiently capable for many uses over the past year.",
      "The growing embrace could pose a problem for the U.S. AI industry. Investors have staked tens of billions on OpenAI and Anthropic, wagering that leading American artificial intelligence companies will dominate the world\u2019s AI market. But the increasing use of free Chinese models by American companies raises questions about how exceptional those models actually are \u2014 and whether America\u2019s pursuit of closed models might be misguided altogether.",
      "Michael Fine, head machine learning at Exa, an AI-focused search company valued at $700 million and supported by Silicon Valley mainstays like Lightspeed Venture Partners and Nvidia, said running Chinese models on Exa\u2019s own hardware has proved to be significantly faster and less expensive than using bigger models, like OpenAI\u2019s GPT-5 or Google\u2019s Gemini, in many cases.",
      "\u201cWhat often happens is we\u2019ll get a feature working with a closed model and realize it\u2019s too expensive or too slow, and we ask, \u2018What levers do we have to make this faster and cheaper?\u2019\u201d",
      "\u201cThat usually means replacing the closed model with the equivalent open model and then running it on our own infrastructure,\u201d Fine said.",
      "Chinese models, like DeepSeek\u2019s R1 and Alibaba\u2019s Qwen, are free to use and considered \u201copen-source\u201d or \u201copen-weight\u201d because anyone can download, copy, modify and operate them. They differ from leading American systems like Anthropic\u2019s Claude or OpenAI\u2019s most popular GPT models, which are \u201cclosed,\u201d or proprietary, and accessed through data centers and pipelines controlled by the big tech giants.",
      "For years, American closed-source models from OpenAI and Anthropic vastly outperformed both American and Chinese open alternatives. Even well-resourced in-house efforts to use open-source models struggled: Bloomberg tried to create an internal tool, BloombergGPT, using open-source models trained on its expansive collection of financial news and documents, only to see it trail OpenAI\u2019s closed models on financial knowledge.",
      "Yet in the past year, Chinese companies like DeepSeek and Alibaba have made huge technological advancements. Their open-source products now closely approach or even match the performance of leading closed American models in many domains, according to metrics tracked by Artificial Analysis, an independent AI benchmarking company.",
      "\u201cThe gap is really shrinking,\u201d Lin Qiao, CEO of Fireworks AI and co-creator of PyTorch, the dominant framework for training AI models, said of the capability differences between American closed-source and Chinese open-source models."

      "Ariana Grande is addressing online criticism about her appearance following the \u201cWicked: For Good\u201d premiere and press cycle.",
      "On Nov. 29, Grande posted an Instagram story that featured a clip from a December 2024 interview with co-star Cynthia Erivo, calling it a \"loving reminder to all.\"",
      "The resurfaced clip comes amid conversation online about the appearance of several members of the \u201cWicked: For Good\u201d cast.",
      "During the interview with journalist Salima Jeanne Poumbga, known professionally as Sally, Grande was asked about how she copes with societal beauty standards and critics.",
      "The singer took the opportunity to address commentary about her appearance and defend herself, noting she\u2019d been part of the discourse since she was a teenager in the public eye.",
      "Grande posted the video Saturday and captioned it, \u201cre-sharing this from last year as a loving reminder to all. I always love and appreciate our talks so much @sally !!!\u201d",
      "In the full clip, the interviewer pointed out that Glinda, Grande\u2019s character in \u201cWicked,\u201d subscribes to beauty standards both for herself, but also to please others. When asked how she navigates beauty expectations and the pressure to look perfect, Grande appeared emotional, calling it a \u201cgood question.\u201d",
      "\u201cI\u2019ve been kind of doing this in front of the public and a specimen in a petri dish really since I was 16 or 17,\u201d she explained. \u201cI have heard it all. I\u2019ve heard every version of it, of what\u2019s wrong with me. And then you fix it, and then it\u2019s wrong for different reasons.\u201d",
      "Grande said that she would be picked apart for \u201ceven just the simplest thing,\u201d including her appearance. She also reflected on hearing those comments at a young age, adding, \u201cIt\u2019s hard to protect yourself from that noise.\u201d",
      "However, Grande also noted that the criticism is \u201csomething that is uncomfortable no matter what scale you\u2019re experiencing it on,\u201d whether it's directed at a celebrity or not.",
      "\u201cEven if you go to Thanksgiving dinner and someone\u2019s Granny says, \u2018Oh my god, you look skinnier! What happened?\u2019 or \u2018You look heavier, what happened?\u2019\u201d she said. \u201cThat is something that is uncomfortable and horrible no matter where it\u2019s happening.\u201d",
      "Grande said that in society, \u201cthere\u2019s a comfortability that we shouldn\u2019t have at all,\u201d including commenting on how other people look, speculation about what\u2019s happening behind closed doors and what people wear.",
      "\u201cThere\u2019s a comfortability that people have commenting on that that I think is really dangerous,\u201d Grande said. \u201cI think that I\u2019m really lucky to have the support system that I have to just know and trust that I\u2019m beautiful. But I do know what the pressure of that noise feels like. It\u2019s been a resident in my life since I was 17 and I just don\u2019t invite it in anymore. It\u2019s not welcome.\u201d",
      "Grande also offered advice to those experiencing a similar situation, adding, \u201cAnd however you all can protect yourself from that noise, whether it\u2019s at a family reunion or online, if you have to block people, I don\u2019t care. If you delete the app entirely. You keep yourself safe because no one has the right to say s---.\u201d",
      "The singer has previously addressed commentary about her body and appearance, including responding to \u201cconcerns\u201d about her weight in April 2023.",
      "Grande shared a TikTok video at the time, noting in the clip that she didn\u2019t tend to speak about rumors but made an exception given the sensitivity of the topic.",
      "\u201cI just wanted to address your concerns about my body and talk a little bit about what it means to a person with a body and to be seen \u2026 to be paid this close attention to,\u201d she said. \u201cI think we should be gentler and less comfortable commenting on people\u2019s bodies, no matter what.\u201d",
      "Grande later added, \u201cThere are ways to compliment someone or to ignore something that you see that you don\u2019t like that I think we should help each other work towards.\u201d"

      "William gave the shoutout in a Nov. 29 video honoring Irwin's dad, late conservationist and \"Crocodile Hunter\" franchise star Steve Irwin, ahead of the 2025 Steve Irwin Gala in Brisbane.",
      "William noted that the elder Irwin's mission was \"to safeguard life on our planet\" and to protect the natural world from the growing dangers of climate change. He then saluted Robert Irwin, 21, for carrying on his father's legacy and acting as a Global Ambassador for William's environmental award, the Earthshot Prize.",

      "The same night, Robert Irwin dedicated an emotional dance to Bindi Irwin, 27.",
      "During a challenge that asked couples to perform a routine from an earlier season of the show, Robert Irwin and Carson opted to perform the same foxtrot to \u201cFootprints in the Sand\u201d by Leona Lewis that his sister and Hough once performed.",
      "When she originally performed the dance, Bindi Irwin dedicated it to the sibling's late father.",
      "Robert Irwin and Carson performed the foxtrot flawlessly. When they finished, Bindi Irwin joined them on the dance floor as images of Steve Irwin holding Robert, who was only 2 when his father died, appeared before them.",
      "Robert Irwin then broke into tears, kneeling down on the floor as his sister and Carson embraced him."

      "\"Maxton Hall\" finished its season on a major cliffhanger \u2014 but this time it's Ruby who's left in a heartbreaking lurch.",
      "The Prime Video German teen drama is beloved for its soapy plots, angsty relationship dynamics and powerful chemistry between leads James Beaufort (Damian Hardung) and Ruby Bell (Harriet Herbig-Matten).",
      "But their enemies-to-lovers romance has brought plenty of strife to their lives due to the class difference between them (hence the subtitle, \"The World Between Us.\")",
      "If it wasn't clear from Season 1, Season 2 has firmly established that James' father, Mortimer (Fedja van Hu\u00eat), is the show's big bad. In the wake of the death of his wife \u2014 which was revealed in the last minutes of the Season 1 finale \u2014 his efforts to control his children, James and Lydia (Sonja Wei\u00dfer), only intensified.",
      "He circumvents their efforts to modernize the family's company, seemingly removes them from their mother's will and of course, tries force James and Ruby apart. First, by getting Ruby's scholarship rescinded, and then, by forcibly taking over the Bell family's bakery.",

Since Season 1, he's had on-again, off-again trysts with Lydia Beaufort, who's now pregnant with twins. He's summoned before school leaders, including Mortimer, to explain what happened.",
      "During that meeting, it's revealed the affair was discovered via a photo. (Remember: In Episode 5, Elaine (Eli Riccardi), who's in love with James, and Cyril (Ben Felipe), who's long pined for Lydia, discovered Lydia and Graham embracing in the woods during a school function and took a photo as evidence.)",
      "But when Graham sees the photo that started the inquest, it turns out to be a picture not of him and Lydia, but of him and Ruby from a school gala in Season 1.",
      "The scene then cuts to a meeting with Ruby, her mother and the headmaster. He tells her she's been suspended from Maxton Hall and will never attend Oxford.",
      "The final minutes of the show feature no dialogue, just an acoustic rendition of \"Chasing Cars.\"",

      "It's made more emotional because \" a moment before, everything was perfect,\" Hardung adds. After his character cheated on Ruby in Episode 1, James pursued therapy and finally, the couple seemed on a healthier, more secure relationship path.",
      "Herbig-Matten says throughout the season her character was \"in conflict with herself.\"",
      "\"She knows that she has to let him go, and that he has to fix himself and she's not responsible for his feelings and loss, and that he's getting back in these toxic behaviors or character traits,\" she says. (\"What do you mean?\" Hardung jokingly interjects.)",
      "She identifies the turning point for her character as James' speech in Episode 3. Filling in as a last minute speaker for Ruby's gala, James opened up about his mother's death and his mental health \u2014 even at the risk of his father's ire.",
      "\"She's deciding to give him a second chance, and I think I love that about her,\" Herbig-Matten says.",
      "But true to form, it all could fall apart after that finale.",
      "\"I think that's this roller coaster of 'Maxton Hall,'\" Hardung says. \"And a part of the reason why this show is so successful is because we just have such a dense high and low-point structure throughout the entire episodes.\"",

    "summary": "The members of 5 Seconds of Summer discuss their new album, \"Everyone's a Star!\", the inspiration and 15 years together.",
    "story": [
      "For the first time, when the members of Australian band 5 Seconds of Summer started to create their sixth album, they already knew what they wanted it to look and feel like.",
      "\"When you can see something in your head, it's more inspiring to get there,\" guitarist Michael Clifford says. \"You're not shooting in the dark like, 'I wonder what this is gonna be like?' You have an idea, and you can drive the ship there.\"",
      "The result was \"Everyone's A Star,\" which dropped Nov. 14. Arguably their most meta album yet, the 12 tracks \u2014 plus four bonus tracks on a deluxe edition that dropped Nov. 17 \u2014 discuss fame, self-destruction and the \"boyband\" culture they've at times rejected and embraced since the group formed in 2011.",
      "The album is less about the personal inspirations that defined their previous hits and more about a \"togetherness,\" says bassist Calum Hood\u00a0\u2014 fitting for a band that is still standing after each member has released at least one solo album.",
      "Below, 5 Seconds of Summer discuss new aspects to their sound, preparing for the \"Everyone\u2019s a Star! World Tour\" and the \"larger-than-life\" characters featured on their latest album \u2014 the band's first in three years.",
      "This interview has been lightly edited for clarity.",
      "Calum Hood: It's definitely not a singular conversation that we have at the start of every album. We don't all sit down together and be like, \"OK, what have we accomplished?\"",
      "I feel like we've lived so much life in this band, we intuitively know the different paths that we've taken. And it's very much an intuition-lead thing, moving into a new album process, examining what's happening in everyone's lives, and seeing where that collectively wants to go.",
      "Luke Hemmings: \"No. 1 Obsession\" was the first one. And that was like, \"OK, this feels like it's ticking all the boxes.\" It felt very 5SOS, reclaiming back a bit of that punk rock, garage spirit, but had lyrics that felt very eye catching, even though it's ear catching, I guess.",
      "And that was the one to beat for a while. It felt like a nice blueprint to go from there, because it takes a minute to figure out what the next album's sounds going to be like. You're sort of stabbing in the dark for a while \u2014 especially after the last album had a very specific sound and feeling to it. We love challenging that on the next album, trying to totally 180-flip ... (and saying) what does it feel like if we did the opposite?",
      "LH: Sonically, it has a lot of dance elements in it, like New York and London, Cassius, Prodigy, those dancier acts that still feel like they have a rawness to them. And it's mixed (with a sound) only 5SOS could do; ironic, tongue-in-cheek lyrics, but with lots of wisdom behind it. There's a little bit of social satire and self- deprecating humor in it. The sound is a mix of the pop rock, punk, garage band we started as, but mixed in with more dance element roots.",
      "That kind of sounds confusing as f---. (Laughs.) So I don't know.",
      "Michael Clifford: I don't think so.",
      "I think we're finally old enough \u2014\u00a0we're not old, sorry \u2014 we're young enough. We've been doing this for a minute, not too long, but we've been doing it for a little bit and we are able to understand a little bit more, just get perspective on things. I think that it was crucial for us to be able to have that perspective in order to make an album that has those types of themes in it.",
      "And like Luke said, trying to flip it on its head and trying to do the opposite of the last thing that we did, I think, was what we found so exciting about this.",
      "This has been the first time that we've really made an album knowing what we wanted it to look like and feel like in mind. We sort of had an idea of the theme and the feeling that we wanted this to evoke. So it made making it a lot easier and more inspiring. When you can see something in your head, sometimes it's more inspiring to get there because you're not shooting in the dark and like, \"I wonder what this is gonna be like?\" You kind of have an idea and you can drive the ship there.",
      "CH: It's definitely a cool feeling. These guys are kind of the only other three that can really resonate with my life's journey the last 15 years. I gain a lot of comfort from that. And it differs within our last albums, where a lot of the songs thematically come very personally. It's very personal-led, that's how we start songs. But this album felt more \u2014 there was a togetherness of the theme of the album and conceptually that felt really fresh and new. And there's definitely, subconsciously, a lot of healing from that, too.",
      "LH: I feel good. The last show we did, the \"Five Seconds of Summer Show,\" it felt like we unlocked our full evolution, or almost full evolution, as a band with mixing in the 10-year anniversary skits. It was more of treating it as an entertainment piece, as opposed to just ... (getting) out there and crank(ing) out some songs and play as a band. But it had multimedia and it was blurring the lines between the video and then the on-screen and onstage. It was really fun to do and it felt like the most \"us\" a show has been.",
      "So this time, because the characters that we have in this album, their egos are a bit more inflated, the show will reflect that. The people that have the big heads in \"Telephone Busy\" \u2014 those guys are making the show. They're behind the wheel and they're kind of crazy.",
      "MC: They've got some damage.",
      "LH: (Laughs.) It'll be like the 5SOS show we did but on steroids.",
      "MC: Not even steroids.",
      "LH: What's crazier than steroids?",
      "MC: Nothing that's appropriate to say on the TODAY show.",
      "CH: No, no, it's like Green Goblin-esque.",
      "LH: So if the Green Goblin was the fifth. Does that make any sense? (Laughs.)",
      "MC: I don't know. It's not as heady and narrative as that, but it sometimes made approaching concepts \u2014 and like Calum was saying \u2014 instead of going into the meaning of a song and being like, \"Do I personally resonate with this?\" It was more about like, \"Does my place within this story we're trying to tell, how do I embody that?\" Rather than trying to do anything that's too narratively driven. We always are going to be ourselves. We're just  ourselves in an alternate universe.",
      "LH: It's like the larger than life version of ourselves and we're back together. Especially after doing separate solo things, now together \u2014 we are like super, super 5SOS, I guess.",
      "CH: SuperSOS.",
      "MC: The conversation that we had behind it was like, we're our best, biggest versions of ourselves \u2014 well I'm the best, biggest version of myself when I'm doing my solo music \u2014\u00a0but also when I do the band's music. So they're the best versions of themselves when they're in the band.",
      "LH: This is a confusing read. (Laughs).",
      "CH: I agree, you're not your best version.",
      "MC: No, I said I am.",
      "LH: You're not your best version right now. (Laughs.)",
      "LH: We were telling people when we first started that we're going to be a band for 10, 15, 20, 30 years. And everyone, when you're 16 and 17, they're like, \"OK, cool,\" because usually the life cycle of a boy band is short. It's like a butterfly or something.",
      "MC: I think Ash has something to say as well.",
      "Ashton Irwin (mid-hair and makeup): What? ... Don't talk to me while I'm getting my makeup done.",
      "LH: You can legitimately quote that.",
      "I don't know if I'd tell (my younger self) anything. I'd just maybe, I'd just give him a soft drink. Maybe a cheeky pat on the back would be nice.",
      "CH: Maybe a foot-long Subway sandwich. Call it a day.",
      "LH: We've been telling people we're going to be a band for this long and I'm really happy that we stuck it out. We have a f------ amazing fan base that let us change and evolve and experiment with new sounds and looks and everything, and I still feel the same. And that's crazy to be some people's No. 1 obsession still. Sometimes I just feel like I'm a walking ghost.",
      "MC: Can I get a drink on the rocks?"

      "Elizabeth Taylor seemed larger-than-life on screen, and according to Neil Zevnik, her personal chef for nearly a decade in the \u201890s, she also threw larger-than-life parties at home.",
      "\u201cWe always did an enormous single table,\u201d Zevnik tells TODAY.com of her Thanksgiving dinners, attended by 40-plus guests at her ranch-style home in Bel Air, California. Formerly an actor, he worked as Taylor\u2019s chef from 1991 until 1999.",
      "Zevnik says, while he would typically only cook for her, holidays were a special case. As he prepared the feast, movers would remove all her furniture from her living and trophy rooms to make space for a square of banquet tables, which he says he also decorated.",
      "\u201cI would literally take off my shoes and have to get up there on the table,\u201d he says. \u201cI would do these very elaborate centerpieces with fabrics and vases of flowers and tchotchkes and candles.\u201d",
      "Taylor liked to seat all at the same table, he says, adding that kids, adults, celebrities and noncelebs all sat together, \u201cbecause then who gets to sit with her?\u201d",
      "For turkey day, Zevnik would prepare traditional fare: turkey, mashed potatoes, classic bread stuffing, cornbread sausage stuffing, sweet potato casserole, green beans, creamed pearl onions, fresh cranberry peach relish and a mince meat pie.",
      "\u201cYou know, she liked cranberry jelly out of the can, sliced,\u201d he says.",
      "\u201cHer two favorite things for Thanksgiving would be turkey wings and gravy, and the turkey wings needed to be crispy and crunchy and salty, and she wanted several of them,\u201d Zevnik recalls. \u201cLots of gravy.\u201d",
      "Scroll to the bottom for his crispy turkey wing recipe.",
      "Taylor required her chef to make extra portions of those two dishes so there would be plenty to pile on her plate as well as leftovers.",
      "On days when she wasn\u2019t entertaining, Taylor\u2019s solo meals were casual \u2014 but never boring.",
      "\u201cGenerally, we wouldn\u2019t make a whole lot of plans in advance,\u201d Zevnik says. He would arrive to cook during the day and provide her options \u201cprepped to a certain point,\u201d as well as her favorites that he could easily whip up.",
      "\u201cAt some point, she\u2019d say, \u2018Okay, what do we got today?\u2019\u201d he says. He would ask her what she was in the mood for: salty, crunchy, creamy, healthy, etc. \u201cThen we would go from there.\u201d",
      "Every afternoon, Zevnik says Taylor would have him cook for everyone working at the house. \u201cAll the staff would gather and sit down together in the kitchen.\u201d",
      "Taylor was very open to trying new cuisines, but since she was brough up in the U.K., she especially loved British foods, like roast beef with Yorkshire pudding and Marmite.",
      "She was also a fan of sweets \u2014 in fact, she loved Zevnik\u2019s \u201ctoffee fudgies\u201d so much, she had a fridge stocked with them in her bedroom.",
      "Zevnik has since worked for a long list of celebrities \u2014 Reese Witherspoom, Jennifer Garner, Pierce Brosanan and Charlize Theron, to name a few \u2014 but those years with Taylor still inspire him.",
      "\u201cShe was one of the most loyal and giving people I\u2019ve ever known,\u201d he says. She began her AIDS advocacy in the \u201880s, when most celebrities refused to help, and eventually established the Elizabeth Taylor AIDS Foundation. \u201cShe didn\u2019t give a f--- what people thought. She did what she thought was the right thing to do.\u201d",
      "When she disliked a stew he made, he recalls, she \u201ckind of ate a little bit of it, and then was kind of done.\u201d",

      "Brendan Fraser's new film, \u201cRental Family,\u201d explores belonging, authenticity\u00a0and one unconventional business model.",
      "The Oscar winner portrays Phillip, a struggling middle-aged American living in Tokyo taking a number of small gigs in hopes of getting another big break. He then gets an opportunity with a business that forever changes his life: a \"rental family\" agency.",
      "Essentially, actors like Philip get paid to play stand-in roles in strangers' lives. They can get hired to pose as family members, friends, partners, people whom they've had affairs with and now must apologize to their spouses, or whomever the client needs.",
      "\u201cRental Family\u201d is not based on a true story. However, it does bring to light the very real family rental businesses in Japan.",
      "Director Hikari tells TODAY.com that upon learning of the services, she discovered \u201cthat people are really longing for connection\u201d amid feelings of isolation.",
      "The film shows an initially hesitant Phillip after he gets hired as a stand-in-fianc\u00e9 for a woman who wants to stage a wedding so she can move to a different country with her female partner.",
      "He is also \u201cbooked\u201d to fill in the role of a long-lost father for a young girl named Mia (Shannon Mahina Gorman). Her, mother Hitomi (Shino Shinozaki), believes if her daughter has a complete family, her chances at being accepted into a prestigious school will be better.",
      "Then, the daughter of an aging Japanese actor, Kikuo (Akira Emoto), hires Philip to pose as a journalist and interview him before he loses his memory. While he pretends to write a story about the former star, they begin to form a friendship.",
      "In 2018, director Hikari began exploring the \u201crent-a-family industry\u201d and discovered that it started in the \u201880s.",
      "\u201cCurrently there are about 300 companies that exist in Japan,\u201d the director said in press notes. \u201cIn a big city like Tokyo, or even a countryside town, you can feel so isolated. \u2026 Every single person I spoke to was looking for connection. Even though they\u2019re paying for the service, they find a friendship within that two or three hours they spend together. And the actors who become the surrogates, they are also 100% invested in the relationship and find their own connection in the community. The roles may seem fake but the emotion is real.\u201d",
      "Speaking with TODAY.com, Hikari recalls the moment she knew rental services were \u201creally doing something very important to people\u2019s lives.\u201d",
      "There was a man that couldn\u2019t get in touch with his daughter for a long time, she says, \u201cand before he passed away, he really wanted to reconnect, but he couldn\u2019t.\u201d",
      "\u201cSo he hired somebody who looked like his daughter and asked her to come to the hospital so that he (could) apologize and say how much he loved her before he passed away,\u201d she says.",
      "Actor Mari Yamamoto, who portrays rental family agency employee Aiko, believes that people are looking for \u201ca temporary solution\u201d when they rent somebody.",
      "Telling TODAY.com, \u201cWhat starts out as a transactional relationship turns into something genuine. And I think that\u2019s the beauty of this service. The people that we\u2019ve spoken to who actually work in this industry have told us stories of how they get so much out of providing this service.\u201d",
      "Ryuichi Ichinokawa, founder of real life Heart Project business in Japan, told the Associated Press that he\u2019s hired dozens of people to pretend to be journalists for vacant events and people to pose as significant others and accompany them for special events or appointments, as well as pretend family members.",
      "\u201cI am being of service to people. I hope they will be happy,\u201d Ichinokawa told the publication, stressing that clients find the service comforting and healing. \u201cI don\u2019t feel I am acting. I really get angry if that\u2019s what the situation requires.\u201d",
      "Actor Takehiro Hira, who portrays Shinji, the owner of the rental family, calls the services a step to healing in an interview with TODAY.com.",
      "\u201cSometimes it becomes too much. Sometimes (they) just can\u2019t take it anymore. So rather than going to seek professional help... and you might be shy, then you can rent and use services like this to do the patchwork on the wound.\u201d",
      "Hira also spoke to someone who works at an agency and got a request from an older lady seeking the services of a younger person.",
      "\u201cJust to sleep in the next room so that she would feel safe and comfortable,\u201d the actor says. \u201cI have an 80-year-old some mother living by herself in Tokyo and she doesn\u2019t ask me to come back home. But maybe on some lonely night she might feel (scared), so that sort of puts everything in context.\u201d",
      "Miwa Yasui, a University of Chicago professor who also researches how culture influences mental health, told AP that Japan has grappled with loneliness, high suicide rates and mental illness stigma. Yasui noted that Japan as a collective culture tends to hide mental health challenges and adults are pressured to maintain harmony and take care of the family.",
      "Additionally, Chikako Ozawa-de Silva, author of \u201cThe Anatomy of Loneliness: Suicide, Social Connection and the Search for Relational Meaning in Contemporary Japan\u201d and a professor at Emory University, also told AP that the rental family business puts a \"band-aid\" on a deeper problem.",
      "\u201cI\u2019m not against that,\u201d Ozawa-de Silva said. \u201cIf people can buy time by renting a family, while pursuing much better long-term solutions, I think the rental family could be a very, very beneficial thing.\u201d",
      "Hikari's goal was to make audiences ask themselves the role they would hire someone to play in their lives, as well as share a reminder to connect with real people.",
      "\u201cI just wanted to make a movie that connects the audience,\u201d she shares with TODAY.com. \u201cAnd have them look within themselves or pick up the phone and say, \u2018Hey, what are you doing?\u2019\u201d",
      "She also wanted people to understand the nuances of the business and how it could be interpreted in different countries.",
      "\u201cHere in America too, there are people who volunteer to be beside somebody who\u2019s elderly, who wants somebody to hold their hand and watch them go to the next journey,\u201d she says. \u201cIt\u2019s very different but I think every culture has certain things that are (similar).\u201d",
      "What Hikari says is most \u201cbeautiful\u201d is that people just want \u201cto be there for each other.\u201d"

      "Netanyahu is facing charges of fraud, breach of trust and accepting bribes in three separate cases. Prosecutors have alleged that he exchanged regulatory favors with media owners in Israel seeking positive press coverage.",
      "He has also been accused of accepting gifts \u2014 including cigars and champagne \u2014 in exchange for advancing the personal interests of Hollywood producer Arnon Milchan and Australian billionaire James Packer.

      "Under Israel\u2019s Basic Law, the country\u2019s president has the power to pardon criminals or reduce their sentence. Pardons before a court verdict are extremely rare but not unheard of in Israel. Netanyahu made no admission of guilt in seeking a pardon, and continued to deny the charges as he made the request.",

      "Defense Minister Israel Katz and National Security Minister Itamar Ben-Gvir both immediately backed the proposed pardon on Sunday, with Katz citing the \u201ccomplex security reality\u201d in Israel.",
      "Netanyahu has previously cited the war in Gaza and security concerns while seeking delays in the court proceedings.",
      "Opposition leader Yair Lapid said that there should be no pardon without \"an admission of guilt, an expression of remorse, and an immediate withdrawal from political life.\"",
      "Benny Gantz, another political rival of Netanyahu\u2019s, said that the pardon request was \u201cfake\u201d and urged the leader: \u201cInstead of fanning the flames, extinguish the fire you created within Israeli society.\u201d",
      "In an unrelated case, the International Criminal Court last year issued a warrant for Netanyahu\u2019s arrest over alleged war crimes committed in Gaza.",
      "Both Israel and the U.S. do not recognize the jurisdiction of the ICC. The warrant theoretically puts Netanyahu at risk of arrest if he steps foot in an ICC member country, though the body has no police force and is reliant on international cooperation.",
      "Israel responded furiously to the warrants, with Netanyahu\u2019s office branding the decision as \u201cantisemitic\u201d and rejecting the charges as \u201cabsurd and false.\u201d"

    "summary": "The surging number of measles cases around the world is a stark warning sign that outbreaks of other vaccine-preventable diseases could be next, the World Health Organization warned Friday.\u201cIt\u2019s crucial to understand why measles matters,\u201d said Dr.",
    "story": [
      "The surging number of measles cases around the world is a stark warning sign that outbreaks of other vaccine-preventable diseases could be next, the World Health Organization warned Friday.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s crucial to understand why measles matters,\u201d said Dr. Kate O\u2019Brien, director of the WHO\u2019s Department of Immunization, Vaccines and Biologicals. \u201cIts high transmissibility means that even small drops in vaccine coverage can trigger outbreaks, like a fire alarm going off when smoke is detected first.\u201d",
      "That is, measles is often the first disease to pop up when vaccination rates overall drop.",
      "\"When we see measles cases, it signals that gaps are almost certainly likely for other vaccine-preventable diseases like diphtheria or whooping cough or polio, even though they may not be setting off the fire alarm just yet,\" O'Brien said at a media briefing Monday, ahead of the release of the WHO's Progress Toward Measles Elimination report, published Friday in its Weekly Epidemiological Record.",
      "Indeed, whooping cough cases are also rising in the United States and are on track to be the most in a decade. More than 20,000 whooping cough cases have been reported so far in 2025, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.",
      "In 2024, there were an estimated 11 million measles infections worldwide, according to the report, nearly 800,000 more than were recorded in 2019.",
      "Last year, 59 countries reported large measles outbreaks. In 2025, the United States joined the list of countries.",
      "Elimination status threatened",
      "The ongoing outbreaks threaten the so-called measles elimination statuses of some countries.",
      "Elimination means a virus has stopped spreading in a specific country or region. (Only one virus \u2014 smallpox \u2014 has been eradicated, or wiped out permanently, worldwide.)",
      "In total, 81 countries had reached elimination status in 2024, according to the WHO. Canada eliminated measles in 1998. Two years later, the United States did the same.",
      "Elimination status means a country has the capacity to stop an outbreak when measles cases arrive from abroad, O'Brien said. If vaccination rates are high enough, the virus won't have enough unvaccinated people to infect, halting an outbreak in its tracks.",
      "But vaccination rates in the United States are falling: An NBC News investigation revealed that since 2019, 77% of counties and jurisdictions have reported declines in the number of kids getting routine childhood vaccinations like the measles-mumps-rubella shots.",
      "The key determining factor for a country to lose its measles elimination status is the ongoing spread of the same strain of the virus for a full year.",
      "Canada met that threshold this month. The United States could be next if scientists can trace current cases to a Texas outbreak that began in January.",
      "Nearly all of the samples analyzed from those early cases were identified as a genotype of measles called D8, according to a CDC report published in April.",
      "The D8 genotype was recently detected in a South Carolina outbreak.",
      "Preliminary results from specimens sent from South Carolina to CDC labs \"are the same type, D8, that is seen in other settings in the United States,\" Dr. Linda Bell, state epidemiologist for the South Carolina Department of Public Health, said at a news briefing Tuesday.",
      "Additional genetic sequencing is needed to make a definitive link between the Texas outbreak and the one in South Carolina, as well as outbreaks in Utah and Arizona. A South Carolina Department of Public Health spokesman said the agency \"expects those results in the next few weeks.\"",
      "Bell said that as of Tuesday, 58 cases had been reported in South Carolina, mostly in Spartanburg County in the northwest part of the state.",
      "An outbreak along the border of Arizona and Utah continues to grow. The Arizona Department of Health Services reported 153 cases this week, nearly all in Mohave County.",
      "Cases in Utah have reached 102, according to the state Department of Health and Human Services. While the bulk of those cases are linked to the cluster at the Utah-Arizona border, case numbers are also rising near Salt Lake City. NBC affiliate KSL reported that eight students at a high school in Wasatch County had been diagnosed.",
      "As of Wednesday, the CDC had reported 1,798 confirmed measles cases in 42 states in 2025. Three people, an adult in New Mexico and two little girls in Texas, have died."

    "story": [
      "In the latest twist in human evolution, scientists have discovered that a mysterious foot found in Ethiopia belonged to a previously unknown ancient relative.",
      "Dated to around 3.4 million years ago, the species was likely similar to Lucy, an ancient human relative who lived in the area at around the same time, according to a study published Wednesday in the scientific journal Nature.",
      "But researchers found that the Burtele foot \u2014 named after the place in northeastern Ethiopia where it was discovered in 2009 \u2014  was unmistakably different.",
      "With an opposable big toe resembling a human thumb, the fossilized Burtele foot suggests its owner was a skilled climber, spending more time in the trees than Lucy, the study said.",
      "For decades, Lucy\u2019s species was considered the ancestor of all later hominids \u2014 an ancient relative more closely related to humans, including Homo sapiens, than to chimpanzees.",
      "Scientists were unable to confirm the foot belonged to a new species until they were able to study new fossils, including a jawbone with 12 teeth, that were found at the same site.",
      "After identifying them as Australopithecus deyiremeda, they found the Burtele foot belonged to the same species.",
      "John Rowan, an assistant professor in human evolution at Britain\u2019s University of Cambridge, said their conclusion was \u201cvery reasonable.\u201d",
      "\u201cNow we have much stronger evidence that, at the same time, there lived a closely related but adaptively distinct species,\u201d Rowan, who was not associated with the study, told NBC News in an email Thursday.",
      "The study also looked at how these species shared the same environment. The research team, led by Yohannes Haile-Selassie from Arizona State University, concluded that the new species spent much of its time in the forest.",
      "Lucy, or Australopithecus afarensis, likely roamed the ground, the study said, before going on to suggest that the two species likely had different diets and used the landscape in different ways.",
      "Multiple examinations of the newly found teeth indicated that A. deyiremeda was more primitive than Lucy and likely relied on a diet of leaves, fruit and nuts, the study said.",
      "\u201cThese differences meant that they were unlikely to be directly competing for the same resources,\u201d said Ashleigh L.A. Wiseman, an assistant research professor at the McDonald Institute for Archaeological Research, which is also based at the U.K.\u2019s University of Cambridge.",
      "Highlighting the broader impact of this discovery on our understanding of evolution, Wiseman said in an email Thursday that the findings reminded us \u201cthat human evolution wasn\u2019t a straight ladder with one species turning into the next.\u201d",
      "Instead, she said, it should be viewed as a family tree with several so-called \u201ccousins\u201d alive at the same time, and each having a different way of surviving. \u201cDid they interact? We will likely never know the answer to that question,\u201d she added.",
      "Rowan also contended that as the number of well-documented human-related species grows, so do our questions about our ancestry. \u201cWhich species were our direct ancestors? Which were close relatives? That\u2019s the tricky part,\u201d he said. \u201cAs species diversity grows, so do the number of plausible reconstructions for how human evolution played out.\u201d",
      "And Wiseman cautioned against making definitive species assignments, as those should rest on well-preserved parts of skull and fossils that belong to multiple associated individuals. While the new research strengthens the case for A. deyiremeda\u2019s existence, she said, it \u201cdoesn\u2019t remove all other alternative interpretations.\u201d"

    "story": [
      "HONG KONG \u2014 President Donald Trump has spoken with the leaders of U.S. ally Japan and rival superpower China amid the pair\u2019s escalating dispute over Taiwan.",
      "Trump\u2019s surprise call Monday with his Chinese counterpart, Xi Jinping, was followed by a call with Japanese Prime Minister Sanae Takaichi, who angered China earlier this month with comments on the Beijing-claimed island democracy.",
      "Both China and Japan said Trump initiated the calls, which the White House has not confirmed.",
      "The dispute began when Takaichi, who was elected last month, told lawmakers that a hypothetical Chinese attack on self-ruling Taiwan, which at its closest point is about 70 miles from Japanese territory, could threaten Japan\u2019s survival and trigger a military response from Tokyo.",
      "It was the first time such an explicit remark had been made by a sitting prime minister of Japan, which like the United States has long been deliberately vague as to whether it would intervene militarily in the event of an attack on Taiwan.",
      "China, which describes Taiwan as its \u201ccore of core interests,\u201d has responded with outrage, taking the dispute to the United Nations, advising its citizens against traveling to Japan and seeking economic retaliation against Japanese seafood, movies, concerts and more.",
      "On Monday, China criticized Japan\u2019s plan to deploy missiles on an island near Taiwan as a deliberate attempt to \u201ccreate regional tension and provoke military confrontation,\u201d while Japan scrambled a fighter jet after it detected a Chinese drone flying between Taiwan and the Japanese island of Yonaguni.",
      "Though Takaichi has refused Beijing\u2019s demands that she retract her \u201cerroneous\u201d remarks, her government says Japan\u2019s policy on Taiwan has not changed and it continues to favor a peaceful resolution to the issue.",
      "Trump has not publicly commented on the dispute, though his ambassador to Japan, George Glass, has said Tokyo can count on U.S. support in the face of Chinese \u201ccoercion.\u201d",
      "Takaichi said Tuesday that she reaffirmed Japan\u2019s close cooperation with the U.S. in her call with Trump, which she said he initiated.",
      "\u201cPresident Trump mentioned that he and I are extremely good friends, and that I should call him any time,\u201d she told reporters, according to Reuters.",
      "Trump seemingly hit it off with Takaichi during a visit to Japan last month, which was followed by a meeting with Xi in South Korea to address tensions between the world\u2019s two biggest economies over trade and other issues.",
      "Trump said he had a \u201cvery good\u201d call with Xi, their first since that meeting, and that U.S.-China relations were \u201cextremely strong.\u201d",
      "\u201cThere has been significant progress on both sides in keeping our agreements current and accurate,\u201d Trump said in a social media post. \u201cNow we can set our sights on the big picture.\u201d",
      "Trump reaffirmed plans announced last month for him to visit Beijing in April, followed by a U.S. visit by Xi later in the year. He said he and Xi discussed Chinese purchases of U.S. soybeans, Russia\u2019s war against Ukraine and the illicit international flow of fentanyl ingredients. Taiwan was not mentioned in Trump\u2019s post.",
      "That is good news for Taiwan amid growing pressure from China and questions about Trump\u2019s commitment to its security, suggesting that \u201cfrom the U.S.\u2019 perspective, there is nothing about Taiwan that has changed,\u201d said Lev Nachman, a professor of political science at National Taiwan University.",
      "Xi also said the U.S. and China had \u201cgenerally maintained a steady and positive trajectory,\u201d according to a readout of the call published by Xinhua, China\u2019s state-run news agency. A Chinese Foreign Ministry spokesperson said Tuesday that the call was initiated by the U.S. side.",
      "Unlike Trump\u2019s post, the Chinese readout of the call heavily emphasized Taiwan, whose \u201creturn to China\u201d Xi said was an important part of the post-World War II international order.",
      "Taiwan, a former Japanese colony, was handed to the Republic of China government after Japan\u2019s defeat in 1945, only for that government to retreat to Taiwan a few years later after losing a civil war to Mao Zedong\u2019s communist forces. The island has never been ruled by the Chinese Communist Party.",
      "Taiwan Premier Cho Jung-tai said Tuesday that for the 23 million people of Taiwan, there was \u201cno option of returning\u201d to China.",
      "\u201cWe must once again emphasize that the Republic of China is a fully sovereign and independent nation,\u201d he told reporters in Taipei, using Taiwan\u2019s formal name.",
      "The Trump-Xi call is a \u201cvery good signal\u201d that the strategic competition between the U.S. and China is under control, said Zhu Feng, dean of the School of International Studies at Nanjing University in China, though a \u201cdramatic breakthrough is hard to imagine.\u201d",
      "Taiwan has not been a major focus of U.S.-China relations in recent months, with Trump saying it \u201cnever came up\u201d during his meeting with Xi. The Chinese readout of their Oct. 30 meeting also failed to mention Taiwan, which is unusual.",
      "The Trump-Xi call comes after the U.S. announced two arms sales to Taiwan in the space of a week, the first since Trump returned to office in January. They include an advanced missile system worth almost $700 million and $330 million in fighter jet and other aircraft parts.",
      "China objects to such sales by the U.S., which has no official relations with Taiwan but is legally bound to provide the island with weapons for its defense.",
      "What China is seeking from Trump, Nachman said, is assurance that the U.S. is not going to loudly weigh in on the Taiwan dispute on Takaichi\u2019s behalf.",
      "\u201cFrom Beijing\u2019s perspective, it\u2019s important that other countries realize that there will be punishments for countries that take this pro-Taiwan stance,\u201d he said.",
      "The lack of comments from Trump on the issue, Nachman said, \u201ctells me that the U.S. has no desire to publicly make this about Taiwan more than it\u2019s already become.\u201d"

      "As his fellow countrymen celebrate Thanksgiving, the first American pontiff\u2019s plate will be full on a six-day tour of Turkey and Lebanon that will be closely scrutinized. He plans to meet with religious and political leaders, lead Mass in both countries and try to provide a boost to long-suffering Christian communities throughout the region.",
      "Ahead of his trip, Leo shared a Thanksgiving message with NBC News in which he encouraged all people \u201cto say \u2018thank you\u2019 to someone\u201d and \u201cto recognize that we have all received so many gifts, first and foremost the gift of life.\u201d",

Leo told journalists that along with other church leaders, he hoped \u201cto announce, transmit, proclaim how important peace is throughout the world and to invite all people to come together to search for greater unity.\u201d",
      "Later, in his first overseas speech since his election in May to lead the 1.4 billion-member church, Leo told Turkish political leaders that the world was experiencing \u201ca heightened level of conflict on the global level, fueled by prevailing strategies of economic and military power.\u201d",

      "But for Miles Pattenden, a Catholic Church historian at the U.K.\u2019s University of Oxford, the choice of the Middle East was \u201cnot such a surprise,\u201d and it was sending out a message that the region \u201cis the heart of Christianity.\u201d",
      "Turkey, where Leo will stay until Sunday, was the \u201cobvious choice\u201d because it was the 1,700th anniversary of the Council of Nicaea, Christianity\u2019s first ecumenical council, Pattenden told NBC News in a telephone interview Wednesday.",
      "Convened by Emperor Constantine, who made Christianity the official religion of the Roman Empire, the meeting of bishops and church leaders \u201cproduced the Nicaean creed, which is the standard statement of what Christians believe,\u201d including the affirmation that Jesus was the son of God, Pattenden said.",
      "He added that it was \u201cabsolutely foundational\u201d to what Christians, including Catholics, believe today.",
      "Leo will pray with the spiritual leader of the world\u2019s Orthodox Christians, Ecumenical Patriarch Bartholomew, at the site of the 325 A.D. gathering in what is known today as Iznik, before they sign a joint declaration in a sign of Christian unity.",
      "\u201cWe all understand that 1,000 years of division has inflicted a deep wound that cannot be healed easily,\u201d Bartholomew told the respected Greek daily Kathimerini recently, according to The Associated Press."

      "Residents of Wang Fuk Court said they had repeatedly complained to the city\u2019s Labor Department about the flammability of the protective green mesh used to cover the bamboo scaffolding around the buildings, only to be told the fire risk was relatively low, Reuters reported Friday.",
      "Hong Kong\u2019s Secretary for Security Chris Tang told reporters Friday that preliminary findings suggested the fire started in netting surrounding the lower floors of Wang Cheong House, one of the seven affected towers in the Wang Fuk Court complex.",
      "Styrofoam on the windows, which was \u201chighly flammable,\u201d fueled the blaze and caused it to spread rapidly upward, extending to six more buildings. The flames shattered glass and penetrated interiors, burning both inside and outside the structures simultaneously, he said.",
      "The intense heat then ignited the bamboo scaffolding, which sparked secondary fires when it collapsed, he added.",
      "The cause of the fire remains under investigation, officials said."

      "Just as peace talks were gaining traction, Ukraine has lost its lead negotiator.",
      "Andriy Yermak, an ever-present figure at President Volodymyr Zelenskyy\u2019s side throughout the war with Russia, resigned as chief of staff on Friday after an anti-corruption raid at his home, injecting fresh uncertainty for Ukraine\u2019s leadership.",
      "The exit leaves a vacuum around Zelenskyy as talks accelerate, isolating the Ukrainian president at a critical moment and creating an opening Moscow may try to exploit, analysts say.",
      "The development capped a dramatic week, which began with Kyiv under intense pressure from President Donald Trump to endorse a plan that aligned with Moscow\u2019s hard-line demands. An initial deadline of Thursday, imposed by the White House, passed without any announcement as Ukraine and its allies pushed back against calls for the country to cede territory.",
      "Ukrainian negotiators, led by Yermak, secured changes, and Trump\u2019s special envoy Steve Witkoff will now head to Moscow for talks next week with Russian President Vladimir Putin.",
      "Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov said Friday that Russia still wants to move toward peace despite its belief that Zelenskyy was not a legitimate leader.",
      "But analysts warn that Yermak\u2019s departure leaves Kyiv navigating unfamiliar waters, as Zelenskyy is forced to steer Ukraine through high-stakes negotiations without his most trusted aide.",
      "Yermak\u2019s resignation comes at a \u201cvery bad time, because we\u2019re really at a possible tipping point where you know what Ukraine is demanding may not be granted or taken into consideration,\u201d Michael Bociurkiw, a nonresident senior fellow at the Atlantic Council\u2019s Eurasia Center, told NBC News by phone on Saturday.",
      "\u201cNone of us really know what Zelenskyy is like operating solo, because he never has,\u201d he said, adding that Yermak has \u201cbasically stood in\u201d for Zelenskyy at times.",
      "Rustem Umerov, the secretary of the National Security and Defense Council, will lead Ukraine\u2019s delegation for a round of talks in the U.S. on Sunday, Zelenskyy said in a post on X. Umerov has also been mentioned by anti-corruption investigators. Neither he nor Yermak have faced charges.",
      "Bociurkiw added that Yermak\u2019s departure would be unlikely to change Ukraine\u2019s firm stance on territorial concessions, but that Russia \u201cwill try to manipulate and take advantage of this vacuum.\u201d",
      "Secretary of State Marco Rubio, Witkoff and the president\u2019s son-in-law, Jared Kushner, were due to attend Sunday\u2019s talks, a U.S. official told NBC News.",
      "Michael A. Horowitz, a Jerusalem-based geopolitical consultant, echoed Bociurkiw\u2019s concerns, saying that Yermak\u2019s resignation, just days before major U.S.-Ukraine-Russia talks and a potential Trump-Putin summit, \u201cdisrupts Kyiv\u2019s preparations and invites counterparts to probe whether Ukraine\u2019s red lines on territory and NATO can be eased during the transition.\u201d",
      "But in the long term, Horowitz told NBC News on Saturday, Yermak\u2019s departure could even be a positive.",
      "Critics have said for years that Yermak had accumulated too much power and wielded excessive influence over Zelenskyy. A constant presence by the president\u2019s side through the ups and downs of the war, Yermak had emerged as one of the few men that the Ukrainian leader appeared to really trust.",
      "Zelenskyy has previously railed against corrupt officials, but signs that a corruption scandal may have stretched into his inner circle may provide more ammunition to critics of further support for Ukraine. Trump-aligned figures, including Vice President JD Vance, have previously criticized Ukraine for its issues with corruption.",
      "Yermak\u2019s departure may \u201creinforce skepticism within the Trump administration\u201d about Zelenskyy\u2019s inner circle, giving them further reasons to push for concessions, said Natia Seskuria, an associate fellow at the Royal United Services Institute, a London-based think tank.",
      "But Horowitz said the resignation \u201cremoves a lightning rod for controversy and gives Kyiv a cleaner, more collective mandate to say no to an unfair and unsustainable peace,\u201d adding: \u201cZelenskyy is getting his house in order.\u201d",
      "When it comes to how the rule of law is being enforced in Ukraine, \u201cgenerally this is a good sign,\u201d said Moritz Brake, a senior fellow at the Center for Advanced Security, Strategic and Integration Studies.",
      "\u201cOf course, it\u2019s bad enough that these accusations existed in the first place,\u201d he added, but \u201ceven those in the highest places are prosecuted when suspicions arise.\u201d",
      "Zelenskyy said in a video statement on Friday that he was looking for Yermak\u2019s replacement. \u201cRussia really wants Ukraine to make mistakes,\u201d he said. \u201cThere will be no mistakes on our part.\u201d",
      "Losing unity could mean losing the country and its future, he added.",
      "But Bociurkiw said time is \u201cnot on Ukraine\u2019s side right now.\u201d",
      "If you\u2019re Ukraine at the moment, he added, \u201cyou need not only a physical army, but an army of diplomats and advocates.\u201d"

      "\u201cAlso, the land is easier, but that\u2019s going to start very soon,\u201d the president added, speaking from his Mar-a-Lago estate.",
      "For months, the president has intensified the United States\u2019 military presence in the region, ramping up pressure on Venezuela with strikes on alleged drug boats since early September. The military has carried out nearly two dozen known strikes on vessels that officials said were carrying drugs, killing at least 82 people.",

      "The rolling plains of Kenya\u2019s Maasai Mara and the millions of animals that live there face a shiny new intrusion: a gleaming Ritz-Carlton safari camp.",
      "With private plunge pools, butler service and panoramic views commanding more than $5,000 a night, the 20-hectare lodge has become a luxury lightning rod for controversy.",
      "Leaders of the Maasai \u2014 an ethnic group of traditionally nomadic herders with ancestral ties to the area \u2014 and conservationists warn the new tourist destination threatens a migration corridor vital to the movement of vast numbers of animals and have filed a lawsuit to halt its operations.",
      "What's at stake, they argue, is not just a new lodge, but the accelerating pressures of tourism on wildlife, biodiversity and the very spectacle that draws these tourists in the first place.",
      "The camp opened on Aug. 15 during the height of the Great Migration, where millions of wildebeest, zebras and other grazing animals move back and forth between the Serengeti plains in Tanzania and the Maasai Mara National Reserve (MMNR) in Kenya, a process that researchers say allows animals to find food and water and maintain genetic diversity among herds.",
      "Tourists have long flocked to the savannah by the hundreds of thousands, hoping to witness one of the largest movements of mammals in the world, as herds cross rivers and plains teeming with predators.",
      "But the new camp, which boasts \u201cfront-row seats to one of the world's greatest natural wonders\u201d on its website, may threaten the migration that visitors come to witness, conservations and Maasai leaders say.",
      "The Ritz-Carlton camp, on a bend in the Sand River, sits on \u201cone of the most favored corridors for these animals,\u201d Maasai elder Meitamei Olol Dapash told NBC News in an interview Sunday.",
      "\u201cAny guide will tell you, that is the crossing they use,\u201d said Dapash, who filed a lawsuit in August in a Kenyan court against Ritz-Carlton's owner, Marriott International, the world\u2019s largest hotel chain, as well as the project\u2019s local owner and operator, Lazizi Mara Limited, and Kenyan authorities.",
      "Dapash, executive director of the Institute for Maasai Education, Research and Conservation (MERC), who has a PhD in Sustainability Education from Prescott College in Arizona, alleges in the lawsuit that the 20-suite camp obstructs the crucial migration corridor and is asking the court to restore the land to its original condition.",
      "He told NBC News in an interview there had been instances of wildebeest turning back to avoid the camp and that an elephant was seen struggling to find a path across the river after using the location for more than a decade.",
      "\u201cAttachment to the land and to the wildlife exists up to this very day,\u201d Dapash said, adding that the Maasai had seen populations dwindling. The new camp, he added, \u201cwas the last straw for us, we just didn\u2019t want to let this happen.\u201d",
      "The Kenya Wildlife Service government agency pushed back at claims the lodge has impacted wildebeest migration, citing monitoring data that it says shows it does not \u201cfall within, obstruct, or interfere with any wildebeest migration corridors\u201d and adding that migrating wildebeest \u201care using the entire breadth of the Kenya-Tanzania border.\u201d",
      "It said that \"all ecological, environmental and regulatory requirements were thoroughly met and validated.\"",
      "Marriott International told NBC News that the development underwent an environmental impact assessment (EIA) \u201cin full compliance with\u201d Kenya's environmental protections.",
      "The company said it is committed to \u201cthe principles of responsible tourism\u201d but declined to comment on Dapash's claims that the Ritz-Carlton blocked a key route for local wildlife or its own steps to mitigate the construction's impact, saying these were matters for Narok County, which manages the reserve on the Maasai\u2019s behalf.",
      "Narok County did not respond to NBC News' request for comment. In court documents seen by NBC News, the county claims that the safari camp complies with the Maasai Mara Management Plan, which imposes a moratorium on new developments amid concerns that poorly regulated tourism was stifling wildlife migration and threatening the reserve\u2019s ecosystem.",
      "Lazizi Mara Limited said the moratorium is part of the case before the court, adding: \u201cWe wouldn\u2019t\u202fwant to comment on\u202fissues\u202fthat are pending determination.\u201d",
      "Dapash told NBC News that he had \"no issue with business, but this is not just about hotel, it is about the long-term survival of the game reserve.\u201d",
      "\u201cWe feel like we are losing the land, we are losing the wildlife,\u201d he said.",
      "The lawsuit comes amid mounting concerns about the health of the 580-square-mile reserve, where tourist numbers have nearly tripled in recent decades. The Maasai Mara National Reserve reported over 300,000 tourists in 2023. In 1980, total visitor entry was 114,000.",
      "Tourism in the Mara generates an estimated $20 million annually and thousands more indirectly, according to the reserve. In 2023, tourism across the country contributed around 7% of Kenya's gross domestic product, according to the World Travel and Tourism Council.",
      "But the rapid growth in lodges and camps has sometimes clashed with conservation efforts.",
      "\u201cA hotel is never just a hotel,\u201d Dr. Chloe Buiting, a vet and wildlife researcher working in the Maasai Mara, said in an interview. \u201cIt\u2019s infrastructure, it\u2019s roads, it\u2019s changes to the water and the resources and the use of land.\u201d",
      "Seasonal variation in the availability and quality of food forces animals to move around, said Joseph Ogutu, a Kenyan researcher at the University of Hohenheim in Germany. But he said developments like the Ritz-Carlton are having \u201ca negative effect on migration, because most of these facilities are close to rivers where animals either drink water or breed or seek refuge.\u201d",
      "Dapash's cause has also found support among experts and tourism groups.",
      "Grant Hopcraft, a professor of conservation ecology at the University of Glasgow, who has been collaring migratory wildebeest in the Serengeti-Mara since 1999, presented maps and data to the court in October showing \u201cregular cross-border movement of wildebeest\u201d at the location of the lodge, according to his affidavit.",
      "RIDE International, a U.S.-based nonprofit providing cultural exchanges and immersive tours in East Africa, has also thrown its support behind Dapash's lawsuit.",
      "The Mara has been suffering for a long time, said Riley Jon Blackwell, the company's executive director, with \u201clarge hotel chains coming in and trying to service the luxury guests who command to see the best of the best for wildlife.\u201d",

    "published": "Thu, 27 Nov 2025 20:12:14 GMT",
    "summary": "The announcement comes a day after an attack on National Guard troops near the White House. Authorities have identified the suspect as an Afghan national.",
    "story": [
      "President Donald Trump has directed the federal agency that oversees legal immigration to the U.S. to conduct a sweeping review of green card holders from what the administration calls countries of concern, the head of U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services said Thursday.",
      "\u201cAt the direction of @POTUS, I have directed a full scale, rigorous reexamination of every Green Card for every alien from every country of concern,\u201d USCIS Director Joseph Edlow said Thursday afternoon in a statement on X.",
      "Edlow said that protecting the country \u201cremains paramount\u201d and that \u201cthe American people will not bear the cost of the prior administration\u2019s reckless resettlement policies.\u201d",
      "Asked for details on which countries are considered \u201cof concern,\u201d USCIS pointed to a June presidential proclamation listing 19 countries \"considered deficient with regards to screening and vetting.\" Afghanistan is one of the countries on the list, which also includes Haiti, Iran and Venezuela.",
      "The USCIS announcement comes a day after two National Guard members were shot near the White House. Sarah Beckstrom, 20, died of her wounds, Trump said Thursday night, while 24-year-old Andrew Wolfe remained hospitalized in critical condition. They were in Washington as part of Trump\u2019s deployment of federal troops to several U.S. cities.",
      "Federal prosecutors say the suspect, an Afghan national who once assisted American forces, was resettled in the U.S. under a program called Operation Allies Welcome during the Biden administration following the U.S. withdrawal from Afghanistan in 2021.",
      "Jeanine Pirro, the U.S. attorney for the District of Columbia, said Thursday morning that her office is reviewing the suspect\u2019s immigration history and the vetting process that allowed his entry into the country.",
      "In a long post on X Friday, Director of the National Counterterrorism Center Joe Kent claimed that 85,000 Afghans were admitted to the U.S. under Biden without the \u201crigorous vetting that has protected us in the past.\u201d",
      "He continued, saying that the suspect was \"only vetted to serve as a soldier to fight against the Taliban, AQ, & ISIS IN Afghanistan, he was NOT vetted for his suitability to come to America and live among us as a neighbor, integrate into our communities, or eventually become an American citizen.\"",
      "Those admitted under the Operation Allies Welcome program were required to undergo \"biometric and biographic screenings\" by law enforcement and counterterrorism authorities, according to a fact sheet prepared by the Biden administration.",
      "The suspect's immigration process continued into the Trump administration. He was granted asylum in April of this year, which typically occurs two weeks after a final interview with immigration authorities.",
      "In a video released by the White House, Trump called the attack in Washington, D.C., an \u201cact of terror\u201d and said additional National Guard troops would be deployed to the nation's capital.",
      "The administration said shortly after Trump's remarks that all immigration requests relating to Afghan nationals will be halted indefinitely.",
      "Authorities have not provided a motive, but D.C. Mayor Muriel Bowser said \u201cthis is a targeted shooting,\u201d and that the suspect appeared to target the guard members.",
      "Four senior law enforcement sources briefed on the investigation said the suspect has been identified as 29-year-old Rahmanullah Lakanwal.",
      "Speaking with NBC News on Wednesday, a relative of Lakanwal said he arrived in the U.S. in September 2021 after serving in the Afghan Army for 10 years, alongside U.S. Special Forces. Lakanwal was living in Bellingham, Washington, with his wife and five children, the relative said.",
      "\u201cWe were the ones that were targeted by the Taliban in Afghanistan,\u201d said the relative. \u201cI cannot believe it that he might do this.\u201d",
      "A CIA spokesperson said Thursday that the alleged shooter \u201cpreviously worked with the USG (U.S. government), including CIA, as a member of a partner force in Kandahar that ended in 2021 following the withdrawal from Afghanistan.\u201d",
      "Asked Thursday night about Lakanwal's vetting and the fact that he worked with the CIA, Trump responded: \"He went cuckoo. I mean, he went nuts. And that happens too, it happens too often with these people,\" an apparent reference to Afghans who came to the U.S. around the time of the 2021 withdrawal."

      "Ever since, they have documented daily life at the former convent on Instagram, with videos capturing a few of their favorite things, from candlemaking to boxing lessons.",
      "Church officials accused the nuns of breaking their vow of obedience during a standoff over their future, but on Friday a statement said they would be offered a chance to remain at the former convent \u201cuntil further notice.\u201d",

      "But a post on the nuns\u2019 Instagram page said they would not immediately agree to the proposal.",
      "The stipulation that the sisters would be allowed to remain in the convent \u201cuntil further notice\u201d made the plan \u201clegally worthless,\u201d a statement issued on their behalf said.",

      "Their legal representatives did not immediately respond to a request for comment from NBC News.",
      "The provost\u2019s spokesman, Harald Schiffl, told Austria\u2019s public broadcaster ORF that a deal would be good for all parties. He said that \u201cwhat is conveyed on social media is not truly the reality of monastic life.\u201d"

      "Firefighters combing each apartment in the Wang Fuk Court tower complex found dozens more bodies, officials said at a news conference Friday as smoke from the blaze was still drifting in the air well over 48 hours since it broke out.",
      "Hong Kong\u2019s Secretary for Security Chris Tang told reporters Friday that 89 bodies could not yet be identified. Seventy-nine people were injured, he said. Tang declined to identify the genders and ages of the deceased, saying the investigation was ongoing and the data incomplete.",

The 48-year-old said her family had managed to escape, adding, \u201cI really hope there are survivors. I\u2019m wishing for a miracle to happen.\u201d",
      "Tang said preliminary findings suggested the fire started in netting surrounding the lower floors at Wang Cheong House, one of the seven affected towers at the Wang Fuk Court building complex.",
      "Styrofoam on the windows, which was \u201chighly flammable,\u201d fueled the blaze to spread rapidly upward and extend to six more buildings, he said, adding that the flames shattered glass and penetrated interiors, burning both inside and outside the buildings simultaneously.",
      "The intense heat then ignited the bamboo scaffolding, which also sparked secondary fires when it fell down, he said.",
      "\u201cAlthough the mesh netting met certain flame-retardant requirements, they could still catch fire when exposed to high temperatures,\u201d Tang said. \u201cBamboo scaffolding could also catch fire,\u201d he added. \u201cThey are only flame-retardant. And this is our initial assessment of the situation.\u201d",
      "Within hours, Hong Kong\u2019s Independent Commission Against Corruption said in a statement that it had set up a \u201ctask force to launch a full investigation into possible corruption\u201d and eight people had been arrested including \u201cconsultants, scaffolding subcontractors and middleman.\u201d",
      "It came after police on Thursday searched the offices of Prestige Construction and Engineering Co., the registered contractor hired to carry out the renovations. Officers also arrested two directors and an engineering consultant on suspicion of manslaughter.",
      "Calls to the company by NBC News went unanswered.",
      "The cause of the fire also remains under investigation, which may take three to four weeks to complete, officials said at the Friday news briefing. Rescuers faced significant difficulties during operations due to the extremely high ambient temperatures reaching or sometimes exceeding 500 degrees Celsius, they added.",
      "Additionally, the fire alarms in all eight blocks didn\u2019t sound off when the blaze broke out, Andy Yeung, the director of Hong Kong\u2019s Fire Services, told reporters.",
      "Yeung\u2019s department said Wednesday that Ho Wai-ho, one of the first firefighters on the scene, died in the hospital after he was found collapsed at the scene. The 37-year-old had suffered burns to his face.",
      "Another 12 firefighters were injured and one was in critical condition after suffering a heat stroke, Hong Kong\u2019s Fire Services added Friday."
