      "Eric Puchner is a well-regarded fiction writer whose new novel, \u201cDream State,\u201d tells a story about life\u2019s unexpected and improbable plot twists",
      "NEW YORK -- NEW YORK (AP) \u2014 Eric Puchner is a well-regarded fiction writer whose new novel, \u201cDream State,\u201d tells a story about life's unexpected and improbable twists.",
      "Weeks before the book's release, Puchner himself received some very surprising news, from Oprah Winfrey, who told him that she had chosen \u201cDream State\u201d for her book club.",
      "\u201cI got a phone call from a number I didn't recognize,\" the author said during a recent interview. \u201cWhen the caller said she was Oprah Winfrey I nearly dropped the phone I was so baffled. I was expecting to talk to my publicist, and at first, I didn't believe her. But then she started to talk in that inimitable way.\u201d",
      "The 54-year-old author is an associate professor at Johns Hopkins University who hopes the Winfrey endorsement might mark a shift from years \u201ctoiling in obscurity,\u201d wishing only that he could attract enough readers to keep writing. \u201cDream State\u201d is the fourth book from Puchner, whose previous works include the story collections \u201cMusic Through the Floor\u201d and \u201cLast Day on Earth\u201d and the novel \u201cModel Home,\u201d a finalist for the PEN/Faulkner Award in 2011.",
      "Puchner's latest work, published Tuesday, is a love triangle among two old college friends and the woman they both have wished to marry. Set mostly in Montana and California, the 432-page narrative extends half a century from his characters' early years to approaching old age as all contend with their feelings for each other and how they imagine they might otherwise have turned out.",
      "\u201cThis is the kind of book you won\u2019t want to put down written by a brilliant storyteller,\u201d Winfrey said in a statement. \u201cSpanning fifty years, \u2018Dream State\u2019 is an exquisite examination of the important relationships we have in our lives \u2014 love, marriage, friendship \u2014 and how life can turn out so differently than we expected.\u201d",
      "Puchner is a Baltimore resident who says the book was inspired in part by a disastrous wedding he once attended that he re-imagined for \u201cDream State\u201d and by a house in Montana that he and his wife and two children stay at in the summer. The book touches upon the damages caused by climate change that he has witnessed over the years in Montana, whether drought or hotter temperatures.",
      "\u201cI know that I wanted to write about this place that I love and what was happening to it,\u201d he says.",
      "Winfrey established her book club in 1996 and currently presents it in partnership with Starbucks. Her conversation with Puchner took place in a Starbucks in the Empire State Building and the video podcast can be seen on Winfrey's YouTube channel."

      "The trial of the only suspect ever charged in the 1996 killing of rap icon Tupac Shakur has been postponed",
      "LAS VEGAS -- A Nevada judge on Tuesday postponed the murder trial of the only suspect ever charged in the 1996 killing of rap icon Tupac Shakur for nearly a year, saying she had little choice given new developments presented by his defense attorneys and the need to ensure a fair trial.",
      "The trial of Duane \u201cKeffe D\u201d Davis, previously set for next month in Las Vegas, has been rescheduled for Feb. 9, 2026. The judge ordered prosecutors and the defense to return to court over the summer for a status hearing.",
      "\u201cIt looks like there are quite a few things that are left to be done to get this case prepared so that Mr. Davis can have effective assistance of counsel,\u201d Clark County District Court Judge Carli Kierny said during a short hearing.",
      "When asked by the judge if he was OK with moving the trial that far out, Davis agreed.",
      "Davis' defense team filed a motion Friday seeking more time, saying critical investigative work had to be done and witnesses needed to be interviewed to ensure he gets a fair trial. The lawyers said a private investigator identified witnesses who can testify that Davis was not at the scene of the shooting.",
      "Attorney Carl Arnold, who is leading the defense, said the case involves decades-old allegations and critical facts have yet to be fully examined.",
      "On the night of Sept. 7, 1996, Shakur was in a BMW being driven by Death Row Records founder Marion \u201cSuge\u201d Knight. They were waiting at a red light when a white Cadillac pulled up next to them and gunfire erupted.",
      "Davis, an ex-gang leader who is accused of orchestrating Shakur\u2019s killing near the Las Vegas Strip, has pleaded not guilty to first-degree murder and has been jailed since his September 2023 arrest.",
      "Davis has acknowledged in interviews and in his tell-all memoir that he provided the gun used in the drive-by shooting and that he was in the car. But his court filings say his descriptions in recent years of orchestrating the shooting were \u201cdone for entertainment purposes and to make money.\u201d",
      "Arnold has argued that Davis never should have been charged because of immunity agreements that Davis says he reached years ago with federal and local prosecutors while living in California.",
      "Prosecutors disagree, saying they have strong evidence against Davis and any immunity agreement was limited.",
      "Defense attorneys also are raising questions about the manner of Shakur's death, saying they have witness information indicating that he was in stable condition after the shooting and died suddenly after being hospitalized for a week. They want to consult medical and forensic experts to evaluate potential alternative causes of death."

      "Yura Borisov does not have a flashy entrance in \u201cAnora.\u201d His character Igor isn\u2019t even introduced until the movie\u2019s nearly halfway through. He\u2019s just the hired muscle, quietly observing and reacting to the quickly devolving situation around him. And yet you can\u2019t take your eyes off of this stranger.",
      "Up until that point it\u2019s been the Mikey Madison show, a chronicle of her character Ani\u2019s whirlwind romance with the spendy, wild son of a Russian oligarch. Igor arrives at the turning point, the end of the honeymoon and the beginning of a swift descent into a chaotic, all-night manhunt. And soon he establishes himself not just as an intriguing outsider, but the soul of the film: The henchman with a heart.",
      "It\u2019s a performance that has caught many off guard: An introduction to a fresh face with an undeniable star quality that has earned him nominations from the Oscars, the Screen Actors Guild and the BAFTAs. But Borisov, 32, is only a newcomer in some parts of the world. Already a star in Russia, Borisov broke through on the international scene in the Cannes title \u201cCompartment No. 6\u201d as the uncouth miner sharing a cramped room with a Finnish student on a long train ride through Russia.",
      "That was the performance that made filmmaker Sean Baker take note and give him a call about participating in what would become \u201cAnora.\u201d Baker has described his secret weapon, who quickly becomes the beating heart and soul of the film, as the \u201cRussian Ryan Gosling.\" Borisov is flattered, but also little confused by the comparison.",
      "\u201cI love Ryan Gosling and very interested to work with him one day. I\u2019ve seen his films. He plays very, very cool. But I don\u2019t know what he means,\u201d Borisov laughed. \u201cLet\u2019s ask Sean.\u201d",
      "Baker, for his part, knew he had a ringer in Borisov but doesn\u2019t show his hand from the top. He strings the audience along, letting them feel like they\u2019re discovering something too. The 28-minute real-time home invasion scene where we meet Igor was actually Borisov\u2019s first to film. It was rehearsed and discussed in detail before the cameras started rolling. In all, it took about eight days to film and three months to edit.",
      "\u201cWe discussed everything trying to find the balance humor and scares and drama and comedy because it\u2019s important for this scene to,\" Borisov said. \u201cBut for me I\u2019m just thinking about a real person named Igor and a real person named Anora.\u201d",
      "He and Baker spoke a lot about Igor\u2019s past, his story, his dreams and his clothes. The white Nike sneakers as contrast to Igor\u2019s all black outfit, he thought, were particularly poignant \u2014 a symbol of Igor\u2019s soul. He liked that his director would ask him if he thought Igor might do this or that instead of just telling him to do something.",
      "But Borisov is not the kind of actor who thinks that he has much interesting to say or explain about his performance. If he could, he said, he\u2019d be a writer. For him, it\u2019s the work that does the talking.",
      "\u201cThe most important is what do you feel when you see the film,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s not so important what we were discussing.\u201d",
      "The week that Borisov spoke to the AP was the week \u201cAnora\u201d had emerged as the frontrunner in an awards race that had previously been wide open. The supporting actor category however, competitive as it may be with nominees like Edward Norton, Guy Pearce and Jeremy Strong, has been considered Kieran Culkin\u2019s to lose for some time now. But it\u2019s still significant: Borisov is the first Russian actor to get an Oscar nomination since Mikhail Baryshnikov\u2019s nod in 1977 for \u201cThe Turning Point.\u201d",
      "\u201cI\u2019m happy that it means something for a lot of people and that\u2019s why it means a lot for me,\u201d he said. \u201cPeople could feel some hope maybe inside them, maybe proud inside them, you know? \u201c",
      "It\u2019s been a wild ride since Cannes and the end is now in sight. Soon he\u2019d be leaving for London, to attend the BAFTAs, and in two weeks Los Angeles for the Oscars. The accolades and nominations have been exciting, though the impulse to keep the conversations going with all the interesting people he\u2019s met along the way has led to more than few late nights.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s kind of a crazy, crazy time,\u201d he said.",
      "It\u2019s too early for him to talk publicly about how much the raised profile has impacted his career, but, he teased \u201clife is changing.\u201d And if he\u2019s being completely honest, he\u2019s happiest about simply getting to spend more time with the people he made the film with.",
      "\u201cMaybe it looks like kind of stupid because you could say that \u2018man, it\u2019s awards, it\u2019s big opportunities for you, why are you talking about spend time with your friends?\u2019\u201d Borisov said. \u201cMaybe it\u2019s kind of stupid, but for me, it\u2019s still important to spend this time with them together. Because without this stuff, we will go to live our life separately. And it will be one day, of course, and I\u2019m kind of sad about this but it just will come. Now we\u2019re still together and I\u2019m happy about this.\u201d",

      "\"I\u2019ve absolutely talked to Tom about it because I want him to do the project,\" Gordon said. \u201cWe want to be a part of it if it were to happen.\u201d",
      "The Hollywood Reporter reported in November that Cruise had talked to Paramount about a follow-up to his 1990 NASCAR racing film. The original was a critically panned summer blockbuster that was largely lampooned throughout the NASCAR industry for its exaggeration and overindulgence.",
      "Over the decades, the film has since become a cult favorite in NASCAR circles and is still quoted by race fans to this day.",

      "Riding high from his \u201cTop Gun\u201d fame, Cruise had an idea for a movie based on fast cars and the characters who raced them. And so began the making of \u201cDays of Thunder.\"",
      "Gordon could inspired have Cruise's Cole Trickle back in the day, though the character was loosely based on the late Tim Richmond. Gordon, now vice chairman at Hendrick Motorsports, won the Daytona 500 on Sunday with team owner Rick Hendrick and driver William Byron. Gordon and Cruise have remained friendly \u2014 Cruise showed up at a 2015 NASCAR banquet to honor the retiring Gordon \u2014 which could boost the prospect of Gordon and Hendrick Motorsports' involvement in a sequel.",
      "\"He seems to like to tease it, so I don\u2019t know,\" Gordon said Sunday night. \u201cWe\u2019ll see what happens. If that doesn\u2019t happen, I feel pretty confident there\u2019s a project out there that will get NASCAR back on the big screen, if not just a really cool docuseries or something beyond even what we\u2019re already seeing right now.\u201d",
      "The movie ultimately introduced NASCAR to a wider audience that had very limited exposure to stock-car racing before that summer. There had been racing movies before \u2014 think \u201cThunder Road,\u201d \u201cGrand Prix,\u201d \u201cStroker Ace,\u201d or even \u201cSmokey and the Bandit\u201d \u2014 but none that had depicted NASCAR in such a mainstream style.",
      "\u201cHard to imagine how you pull that off today because they actually had race cars with cameras in the race, and the cameras were big,\u201d Gordon said. \u201cCameras have gotten a lot smaller so maybe you could pull it off, but how do you do it and make it realistic and really authentic?\u201d",
      "NASCAR has seen more swings and misses than checkered flags when it comes to its portrayal on the big or small screen since \u201cDays of Thunder.\u201d For every \u201cTalladega Nights,\u201d there are 10 more bombs such as comedian Kevin James' ill-fated Netflix\u2019s comedy series, \u201c The Crew.\" Gordon said he was encouraged that better days are ahead for NASCAR in the entertainment industry.",
      "\u201cI am seeing just a lot more momentum in projects like coming through NASCAR and coming to Hendrick Motorsports and just more interest,\u201d he said. \u201cSo that\u2019s good, right?

      "\u201cCaptain America: Brave New World\u201d infused some blockbuster cash into the North American box office, bringing in $88.5 million in ticket sales over the weekend, according to studio estimates Sunday. The Walt Disney Co. release is by far the biggest opener of 2025 and the company predicts it will hit $100 million domestically and $192.4 globally by the end of Monday's Presidents' Day holiday.",
      "It\u2019s Marvel's first major release since \u201cDeadpool & Wolverine\u201dbroke records last summer and re-energized a Marvel fanbase that some worried was weakening after the poor showing for \u201cThe Marvels.\u201d",
      "Playing in 4,105 locations in the U.S. and Canada, \u201cBrave New World\u201d is also a major transition for the \u201cCaptain America\u201d brand: Anointing Anthony Mackie\u2019s Sam Wilson as the new Cap, officially taking over from Chris Evans, who played the character for almost a decade. Harrison Ford co-stars as the U.S. President who transforms into the Red Hulk.",
      "But \u201cBrave New World,\u201d directed by Julius Onah, had a bit of a handicap going into the weekend: Poor reviews, though superhero movies can soar without the stamp of approval from critics. The film is currently sitting at 51% \u201crotten\u201d on Rotten Tomatoes. It's not the worst in the Marvel Cinematic Universe \u2014 \u201cEternals\u201d has a 47% rating and \u201cAnt-Man and The Wasp: Quantumania\u201d has a 46% \u2014 but the latest film is definitely on the very low end of the spectrum.",
      "In his review for The Associated Press, Mark Kennedy wrote that it is, \u201ca highly processed, empty calorie, regret-later candy of a movie.\u201d",
      "Audiences were more generous in their opinions. The \u201cverified audience score\u201d from Rotten Tomatoes was 80% and its CinemaScore was a B-. Exit polls showed that men made up 63% of the opening weekend audience.",
      "The bar for biggest opening of the year wasn\u2019t terribly high: \u201cDog Man\u201d held the title for two weeks with its $36 million launch.",
      "And \u201cBrave New World's\u201d showing is the middle range for an MCU film. Not accounting for inflation, it sits between \u201cGuardians of the Galaxy\u201d and \u201cThor: The Dark World.\u201d",
      "It also cost significantly less than many of the big budget Marvel movies, with a reported production price tag of $180 million, excluding the millions spent on marketing and promotion.",
      "After only one Marvel movie in 2024, \u201cBrave New World\u201d is the first of three major theatrical releases set for 2025. It is to be followed by \u201cThunderbolts(asterisk)\u201d in May and \u201cThe Fantastic Four: First Steps\u201d in July.",
      "\u201cThe superhero genre has taken a hit over the past few years, but audiences still have a huge interest in seeing them on the big screen,\u201d said Paul Dergarabedian, the senior media analyst for Comscore.",
      "Second place at this week's box office went to \u201cPaddington in Peru,\u201d the third installment in the beloved franchise, which finally opened in North America this weekend. Released by Sony, it earned an estimated $13 million and should hit $16 million by Monday. The StudioCanal film opened in the United Kingdom in early November 2024 and went into the weekend with $104 million from its international run.",
      "Dougal Wilson took over directing duties for Paul King for this film, which also recast Emily Mortimer as Mrs. Brown, originally played by Sally Hawkins. The other main cast, including Ben Whishaw as Paddinton's voice, remained intact.",

Or Ryan Gosling\u2019s wink at Emma Stone last year that had internet shippers in a tizzy?",
      "The worst part is that for some parts of the world, including the U.S., they\u2019re also not the easiest to watch \u2014 or at least a little harder than just turning on ABC (and soon Hulu) to watch the Oscars.",
      "The Associated Press is here to help those without a BritBox subscription with a rundown of the best and most memorable moments of the night, where \u201cAnora\u201d did not sweep (though Mikey Madison did triumph over best actress front-runner Demi Moore), \u201cConclave\u201d won big and \u201cEmilia P\u00e9rez\u201d proved it\u2019s still a contender.",
      "Host David Tennant got the ceremony off to an amusing start with a pre-recorded bit where various actors give him a little pep talk, appearing in his dressing room mirror \u2014 including fellow Scot Brian Cox, who kicked off a rousing rendition of The Proclaimers song \u201cI\u2019m Gonna Be (500 Miles).\u201d Tennant took over and brought the anthem into the room, where Selena Gomez seemed genuinely surprised when he tapped her shoulder and inserted her name into the song. There were the celebrity participants of course, James McAvoy, Camila Cabello and Colman Domingo among them. But even some not \u201cin the show\u201d sang along happily as well, Saoirse Ronan and Jack Lowden included. Others, like Adrien Brody and Demi Moore, did not seem to be part of the chorus.",
      "No presenter wants a John Travolta \u201cAdele Dazeem\u201d moment or, worse, a Faye Dunaway \u201cLa La Land\u201d flap, and you could see the wheels turning in Gomez\u2019s head as she looked at the card for the debut by a British writer, director or producer award. \u201cI don\u2019t know how to say,\u201d she said quietly from stage, looking at her co-star and co-presenter, Zoe Salda\u00f1a, before looking further down on the card. \u201cOh, \u2018Kneecap,\u2019\u201d she said, quietly adding, \u201cRich\u201d and simply avoiding the writer-director\u2019s last name, Peppiatt.",
      "Jesse Eisenberg started off his best screenplay win for \u201cA Real Pain\u201d with some signature, self-deprecating jokes about how neither he, his wife nor the person who sat him thought he was going to win. The audience laughed loudly when he said that\u2019s why his wife didn\u2019t attend the ceremony. But he quickly turned sincere, offering a touching tribute to his wife, Anna Strout, whom he credited with helping him learn about the world around him. \u201cYou\u2019ve put every worthwhile thought into my head over the last 20 years,\u201d Eisenberg said. \u201cI love you so much.\u201d",
      "Perhaps Salda\u00f1a was feeling the pressure of \u201cEmilia P\u00e9rez\u2019s\u201d diminished Oscar dreams two days before voting closes. Or maybe she was just really overwhelmed to win the best supporting actress BAFTA. Regardless, she let her emotions show in a teary and intense speech, in which she poked fun at her own inability to do a good British accent, shouted out her makeup artist as her closest confidant and made a case for the film.",
      "\u201cFilms are supposed to change hearts and challenge minds, and I hope, I hope that \u2018Emilia P\u00e9rez\u2019 did something like this,\u201d she said. \u201cVoices need to be heard, just not my English accent. Bye, guys.\u201d",
      "In memoriam segments don\u2019t need to be flashy. All you need is a thoughtful reel, Jeff Goldblum and a piano, it turns out. He played \u201cAs Time Goes By.\u201d",
      "Warwick Davis joked that he\u2019d keep his BAFTA Fellowship acceptance speech \u201cshort,\u201d telling the audience that it\u2019s OK, they can laugh. \u201cThis is probably the best thing that has ever happened to me, and I\u2019ve been in \u2018Star Wars,\u2019\u201d he said. Davis also got emotional, speaking about his wife who died last year.",
      "\u201cShe was always so supportive of my career, encouraging me to grab every opportunity with both hands,\u201d he said. \u201cSince then, life has been pretty tough for me. Thanks to the support of our wonderful children, I\u2019ve been able to continue working and engaging in life.\u201d",

      "LOS ANGELES -- The Golden State Warriors are known for their electrifying plays and superstar Stephen Curry, but now the team is pioneering a fresh gameplan: blending sports and entertainment in a way no NBA franchise has before.",
      "As the first and only NBA team with its own record label, Golden State Entertainment, the Warriors are expanding their reach with \u201cFor the Soil,\u201d a new album released this week. The project featuring the Bay Area\u2019s top music artists \u2014 from E-40, Too Short, Saweetie, G-Eazy, Goapele, LaRussell and Larry June \u2014 arrives just in time for the league's All-Star Game weekend in San Francisco.",
      "\u201cA basketball team with a record label is unheard of until now, which is a testament to the Warriors and the Bay,\u201d said P-Lo, a Filipino-American rapper who produced \u201cFor the Soil,\u201d a collaborative release between Golden State Entertainment and EMPIRE, a distribution and publishing company. He will perform live during an NBA All-Star tipoff party on Thursday at Thrive City, a 11-acre community gathering space surrounding the Chase Center.",
      "\u201cThis is about innovation, bringing a new idea to the table,\u201d said P-Lo, a lifelong Warriors fan who has worked with artists such as Yo Gotti, Saweetie and Kehlani. He's no stranger to the franchise, riding his convertible car as part of the Warriors championship parade, celebrating the team's title in 2022.",
      "\u201cWe're here to break barriers while I'm trying to process it all,\" he added. \"I'm grateful for this opportunity.\u201d",
      "Warriors guard Gary Payton II said he plans on listening to the album.",
      "\u201cFor me, to be the first team to have a music company, or production company, it\u2019s kinda cool,\u201d Payton said. \u201cP-Lo is running it, and getting it done. I know there\u2019s a lot of talented Bay Area artists behind it, so it\u2019s something to look forward to and be excited about.\u201d",
      "P-Lo played a key role in bringing together the Bay Area\u2019s top artists, contributing to all nine tracks on the album. He began the process late last summer, collaborating with local talent to craft a well-rounded project.",
      "\u201cP-Lo can produce, rap and bring all these artists who are like family to him,\u201d said David Kelly, an executive with the Warriors. He spearheaded the launch of Golden State Entertainment in 2022 before the team won the championship that year.",
      "Several NBA teams have partnered with artists over the years: Drake as the Toronto Raptors\u2019 global ambassador, Jay-Z as a former minority owner of the Brooklyn Nets, and the Miami Heat collaborating with DJ Khaled, who performed at games. The Atlanta Hawks have also embraced their city\u2019s rap scene, working with T.I., 2 Chainz, and Quavo.",
      "But an NBA team with its own record label and entertainment division? That\u2019s where Kelly saw an opportunity for the Warriors to break new ground. He said creating a label, intersecting hip-hop and basketball made sense.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s just kind of authentic and natural to the culture,\u201d said Kelly, who joined the organization in 2011 and currently is the chief business officer of Golden State Entertainment. \u201cIt seems like a lot of times people try to force them apart or mesh them together that don\u2019t make sense. But if you grew up a part of both, they naturally intertwine.\u201d",
      "Kelly first pitched the idea of the Warriors having a record label to then-president Rick Welts before bringing it to the team\u2019s owner, Joe Lacob, and co-executive chairman Peter Guber. He said the Warriors' leadership embraced his vision, and he hopes more pro teams will follow suit.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s seeing the culture being presented in a way that\u2019s true and reflective on a grand international scale,\u201d said Kelly, a former Chicago-based rapper, whose stage name was Capital D. \u201cHopefully this is the first of many for Golden State and the culture.\u201d",

      "Lawyers will give their closing arguments at the trial of rapper A$AP Rocky, who is accused of two felony counts of assault with a semi-automatic firearm",
      "LOS ANGELES -- There's one essential difference between arguments at rapper A$AP Rocky 's trial: Prosecutors will say Thursday that the hip-hop star fired two shots at a former friend from a handgun, while defense lawyers will say he fired blanks from a gun that wasn't real.",
      "Jurors should begin deliberations by the afternoon on two felony counts of assault with a semiautomatic firearm for the 2021 shooting. If they convict Rocky of both, he could get up to 24 years in prison.",
      "The Grammy-nominated music star, fashion mogul and actor is the longtime partner of singing superstar Rihanna, with whom he has two toddler sons. She may appear in court for closing arguments after showing up sporadically \u2014 most recently last week, when they left the courthouse together for the first time, walking arm-in-arm.",
      "Testimony at the trial ended Tuesday, when Rocky and his lawyers told a judge he would not take the stand.",
      "The prosecution's case rests largely on the credibility of the man Rocky is alleged to have fired on. A$AP Relli, whose legal name is Terell Ephron, became friends with Rocky, born Rakim Mayers, in high school in New York, where both were members of a crew of creative types called the A$AP Mob.",
      "Their friendship continued after Rocky first gained global fame with a pair of No. 1 albums in 2012 and 2013, but by Nov. 6, 2021 their bond had become a beef.",
      "They met up outside a Hollywood hotel, and scuffled as soon as they saw each other. In a second confrontation moments later, Rocky fired the shots. Relli said his knuckles were grazed by one of them. The fights were partially captured on surveillance videos that are not clear enough for easy interpretation.",
      "A$AP Twelvyy, another member of the crew who was with Rocky, testified that Relli had been the aggressor, and that Rocky fired the shots as a warning to stop him from attacking another member of their crew.",
      "Twelvyy testified that Rocky fired blanks from a starter pistol that the rapper had been carrying for security since a music video shoot months earlier, and that everyone involved in the incident knew it. Rocky's tour manager also testified that he carried the phony gun.",
      "Neither gun was found or presented as evidence.",
      "Police who searched the area after a report of a shooting found no physical evidence, but Relli himself went to a police department two days later with two shell casings he said he'd picked up after returning to the scene.",
      "In closing arguments, the defense will contend that video evidence and text messages can't be trusted, nor can Relli. He also filed a civil suit in the case, and Rocky's attorneys will cast him as a jealous opportunist out for the money of a former friend who became famous. Relli vowed to do just that in text messages and in phone calls recorded by a mutual friend who gave the recordings to Rocky. Relli said in his testimony that the calls were faked.",
      "The prosecution will argue that Relli is justly seeking money after a genuine wrong was done to him. They point out that Relli's communications around the incident tell a consistent story \u2014 and never does he mention making anything up or knowing Rocky carried a prop gun. Prosecutors are likely to argue that the whole idea of the starter pistol \u2014 which only fires blanks \u2014 is a preposterous lie coordinated by Rocky's inner circle.",
      "In one of a series of arguments between lawyers that grew so nasty and personal during the trial that the judge began threatening fines, Deputy District Attorney John Lewin called the prop gun argument \u201cgarbage.\u201d",

      "At 100 years old, the Goodyear Blimp is an ageless star in the sky",
      "DAYTONA BEACH, Fla. -- Flying a few hundred feet above the streets and shores of Daytona Beach, the Goodyear Blimp draws a crowd.",
      "Onlookers stare and point. Drivers pull over for better looks, snapping pictures, recording videos and trying to line up the perfect selfie. For some, it\u2019s nostalgic. For others, it\u2019s a glimpse at a larger-than-life advertising icon.",
      "At 100 years old, the blimp is an ageless star in the sky. And the 246-foot-long airship will be in the background of the Daytona 500 on Sunday \u2014 roughly 1,500 feet above Daytona International Speedway, actually \u2014 to celebrate its latest and greatest anniversary tour.",
      "Even though remote camera technologies \u2014 drones, mostly \u2014 are improving regularly and changing the landscape of aerial footage, the blimp continues to carve out a niche. At Daytona, with the usual 40-car field racing around a 2\u00bd-mile superspeedway, views from the blimp aptly provide the scope of the event.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s great to show the pack racing,\u201d Fox Sports director Artie Kempner said, adding that he expected to use aerial shots from the blimp about 50 times during Sunday\u2019s race.",
      "The Goodyear Blimp has been a regular at major sporting events since flying above the 1955 Rose Bowl. A few years later, it became a service vehicle for television coverage while simultaneously functioning as a highly visible advertising platform. It\u2019s been at every Daytona 500 since 1962.",
      "During that streak, blimps have undergone wholesale changes and improved dramatically: steering technology, safety innovations, high-definition cameras, gyro-stabilized aerial views and much quieter rides thanks to relocated engines and propellers.",
      "Nowadays, riding on the blimp isn\u2019t much different from traveling on a small plane. The 12-seater comes with reclining seats, tray tables, seatbelts, a safety briefing and a bathroom with amazing views. A few windows serve as the only air conditioning onboard. The blimp offers a smooth ride even at top speed, creeping along at 73 mph \u2014 well below the cars pushing 200 mph on the track.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s an iconic symbol for our nation, a floating piece of Americana,\u201d blimp pilot Jensen Kervern said. \u201cThere\u2019s nothing like it in the world.\u201d",
      "The blimp has covered more than 2,500 events and taken more than 500,000 passengers for rides, according to Goodyear. Former President Ronald Reagan might be the most famous passenger, and rapper Ice Cube raised the blimp\u2019s street cred when he included a line about it in his 1992 song titled \u201cIt Was A Good Day.\u201d",
      "But not just anyone can climb aboard. Rides are invitation only even though phones at blimp headquarters \u2014 the three U.S.-based airships are housed in California, Florida and Ohio \u2014 ring off the hook with people inquiring about buying a ride.",
      "As part of the blimp\u2019s 100-year anniversary celebration, however, Goodyear is giving three U.S. residents a chance to join the exclusive club and win a ride. The sweepstakes will provide each winner a certificate for two to fly on the blimp. The prize also includes $3,000 for travel expenses to one of Goodyear\u2019s airship hangars.",
      "It would be a once-in-a-lifetime experience, no doubt.",
      "The blimp flies low enough to spot pods of dolphins or flotillas of sea turtles in the Atlantic Ocean. The view over Daytona International Speedway is equally stunning, with the ability to see every inch of the famed track while watching (and hearing) race cars turning laps.",
      "Already in 2025, the Goodyear fleet has flown over the Rose Bowl, the Orange Bowl, the Pro Bowl and Pebble Beach. Its upcoming schedule includes the Academy Awards, Coachella and WrestleMania.",
      "But will the blimp survive another 100 years?",
      "Drone imagery and resolution continue to improve along with maneuverability, stability and flight longevity. And where drones can be flown by one person, the Goodyear Blimp crew at Daytona tops 20 staffers.",
      "But given the blimp\u2019s longevity, adaptability and celebrity, no one should bet against it sticking around for generations to come.",
      "\u201cDespite changes in technology and our environment, people still get so excited to see the blimp,\" Kervern said. \u201cIt's just an iconic symbol for our nation.\u201d",

    "story": [
      "The discovery of hundreds of unmarked graves at an Indian residential school in Canada in 2021 was just the catalyst for \u201cSugarcane.\"",
      "The discovery of hundreds of unmarked graves at an Indian residential school in Canada in 2021 was just the catalyst for \u201cSugarcane.\u201d",
      "Julian Brave NoiseCat and Emily Kassie, the filmmakers behind the Oscar-nominated documentary, spent years investigating the truth behind just one of the institutions. \u201cSugarcane,\u201d now streaming on Hulu, paints a horrifying picture of the systemic abuses inflicted by the state-funded school and exposes for the first time a pattern of infanticide and babies born to Indigenous girls and fathered by priests.",
      "In the year since it debuted at the Sundance Film Festival, \u201cSugarcane\u201d has screened at the White House, for Canadian Parliament and for over a dozen indigenous communities in North America, sparking a grassroots movement and reckoning to find the truth about the other schools. It also marks the first time that an Indigenous North American filmmaker has received an Oscar nomination.",
      "From the 19th century until the 1970s, more than 150,000 First Nations children were required to attend state-funded Christian schools as part of a program to assimilate them into Canadian society. They were forced to convert to Christianity and not allowed to speak their native languages. Many were beaten and verbally abused, and up to 6,000 are said to have died. Nearly three-quarters of the 130 residential schools were run by Roman Catholic missionary congregations",
      "Canada\u2019s residential schools were based on similar facilities in the United States, where Catholic and Protestant denominations operated more than 150 boarding schools between the 19th and 20th centuries, according to researchers, that also were home to rampant abuse.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s too often that we look everywhere else in the world to horrors and abuses happening, and that\u2019s important, but Native issues are rarely the issue of the day, and we believe that they deserve to be,\u201d Kassie said. \u201cThis story is the genocide that happened across North America, and we\u2019ve never grappled with it. Native people have rarely been the focal point of that kind of countrywide dialogue. We hope that \u2019Sugarcane\u201d helps to change that.\u201d",
      "As an investigative journalist and documentarian, Kassie had spent a decade making films about human rights abuses all over the world, from Afghanistan to Niger, but she\u2019d never turned her lens to her own country. When the news broke about the unmarked graves, she felt drawn to the story and reached out to NoiseCat to see if he\u2019d want to help. They became friends as cub reporters in New York who just happened to share neighboring desks.",
      "\u201cIn the years since, Julian had gone on to become an incredible writer and thinker and journalist focusing on indigenous life in North America. It felt like the natural fit,\u201d she said.",
      "While he was mulling it over, she went looking for a group to focus on and landed on St. Joseph\u2019s Mission near the Sugarcane Reservation of Williams Lake in British Columbia. Unbeknownst to her, that was the school NoiseCat's family attended. He\u2019d heard stories about his father being born nearby and found in a dumpster. Over the course of making the film they\u2019d discover that he was actually born in a dormitory and found in the school\u2019s incinerator.",
      "\u201cIt was a process for me to ultimately decide to tell the story in a personal and familial way,\u201d said NoiseCat, who during the making of the film lived with his father for the first time since he was around 6 years old.",
      "\u201cIt became very clear that he had these unaddressed questions from his birth and upbringing, and that I was in a position to help him ask those questions and in so doing, to address some of my own enduring pains and complications from his abandonment of me,\u201d NoiseCat said. \u201cThe big thing, though, was going to the Vatican with the late Chief Rick Gilbert and witnessing his incredible bravery.\u201d",
      "\u201cWe\u2019ve just been incredibly fortunate that this film has had real impact,\u201d NoiseCat said. \u201cI was really scared that telling such a personal and sometimes painful story might be a harmful thing. But really, thankfully, it\u2019s been a healing thing, not just for my family and our participants, but for Indian Country more broadly.\u201d",
      "Over the last year as the film has played at various festivals and for Indigenous communities on reservations, Kassie said that more survivors have been coming forward with their stories.",
      "In October, former President Joe Biden also formally apologized to Native Americans for the \u201csin\u201d of a government-run boarding school system that for decades forcibly separated children from their parents, calling it a \u201cblot on American history.\"",
      "\u201cThis is the origin story of North America,\u201d Kassie said. \u201cIt\u2019s the story of how the land was taken by separating six generations of kids, indigenous kids from their families... (and) most people don\u2019t know.\u201d",
      "Kassie noted that while \u201cSugarcane\u201d is inspiring conversations within communities, it comes at a political moment where governments are not actively supporting continued investigation and accountability.",
      "In a film industry with deep roots in the Western genre and problematic, racist depictions of Native Americans as impediments to westward expansion, authentic representation of indigenous stories on screen is still in the early days. In 97 years of the Oscars, no Native American person has ever won a competitive acting prize. Lily Gladstone, who is an executive producer on \u201cSugarcane,\u201d was passed over last year for best actress.",

      "A federal appeals court has upheld singer R. Kelly's racketeering convictions and a 30-year prison sentence, finding he exploited his fame for over a quarter century to sexually abuse girls and young women",
      "NEW YORK -- R. Kelly\u2019s racketeering and sex trafficking convictions, along with a 30-year prison sentence, were upheld Wednesday by a federal appeals court that concluded the singer exploited his fame for over a quarter century to sexually abuse girls and young women.",
      "The 2nd U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals in Manhattan ruled Wednesday after hearing arguments last March.",
      "The Grammy-winning, multiplatinum-selling R&B songwriter was convicted in 2021 in Brooklyn federal court of multiple charges, including racketeering and sex trafficking.",
      "Attorney Jennifer Bonjean, representing R. Kelly, said in a statement that she believed the Supreme Court will agree to hear an appeal. She called the 2nd Circuit ruling \u201cunprecedented,\" saying it gives prosecutors limitless discretion to apply the racketeering law \u201cto situations absurdly remote\u201d from the statute's intent.",
      "Last year, the high court declined to hear an appeal of a 20-year sentence Kelly received after he was convicted in 2022 of child sex charges including charges of producing images of child sexual abuse in Chicago.",
      "The 2nd Circuit rejected Kelly's arguments that the trial evidence was inadequate, the constitutionality of some state laws used against him were questionable, four jurors were biased, the trial judge made some improper rulings and a racketeering charge more commonly used in organized crime cases was improper.",
      "\u201cEnabled by a constellation of managers, assistants, and other staff for over twenty-five years, Kelly exploited his fame to lure girls and young women into his grasp,\u201d the appeals court said, noting members of his entourage helped introduce him to underage girls.",
      "\u201cEvidence at trial showed that he would isolate them from friends and family, control nearly every aspect of their lives, and abuse them verbally, physically, and sexually,\u201d the three-judge panel said.",
      "The appeals court said it was \u201cneither arbitrary nor irrational\u201d that several accusers were permitted to testify at trial that Kelly gave them herpes without disclosing he had an STD, and it was not unduly prejudicial or cumulative that seven witnesses who were not yet adults when Kelly began to abuse them were allowed to testify.",
      "\u201cNone of the testimony was more inflammatory than the charged acts,\u201d the appeals court said.",
      "The 2nd Circuit also said it was not unfairly prejudicial for the trial judge to let jurors view graphic videos. The videos, the appeals court said, \u201cwere properly admitted to show the means and methods of the enterprise, including the level of control and dominance Kelly had over his victims.\u201d",
      "Bonjean, in her statement on R. Kelly's behalf, also cited a partial dissent in which one 2nd Circuit judge, Richard J. Sullivan, concurred with what he described as the majority's \u201cexcellent opinion,\u201d but dissented in part over a restitution award given one victim for a lifetime supply of a suppressive regime of herpes medication. The award was based on the cost of the brand-name drug when a generic drug is available.",
      "\u201cThis was not restitution. This was an effort by the government to unfairly enrich government witnesses for their testimony,\u201d Bonjean said.",
      "Kelly, born Robert Sylvester Kelly, is known for work including the 1996 hit \u201cI Believe I Can Fly\u201d and the cult classic \u201cTrapped in the Closet,\u201d a multipart tale of sexual betrayal and intrigue.",
      "Kelly sold millions of albums and remained in demand even after allegations about his abuse of young girls began circulating publicly in the 1990s. He was acquitted of child sexual abuse image charges in Chicago in 2008, but a second trial in Chicago in 2022 ended with his conviction on charges of producing images of child sexual abuse and enticing girls for sex.",
      "Widespread outrage over Kelly\u2019s sexual misconduct did not emerge until the #MeToo reckoning, reaching a crescendo after the release of the documentary \u201cSurviving R. Kelly.\u201d",

      "Measles is a highly contagious disease. Here's what you should know about how to protect yourself against measles, as well as what's happening in Texas and New Mexico.",
      "The West Texas cases are concentrated in Gaines County, which has 45 infections. Terry County to the north has nine confirmed cases, while Lubbock and Lynn counties have a case each and Yoakum County has two.",
      "The Texas Department of State Health Services said Monday that 13 people are hospitalized with measles.",
      "State health officials say this outbreak is Texas' largest in nearly 30 years. Health department spokeswoman Lara Anton said last week that cases have been concentrated in a \u201cclose-knit, undervaccinated\u201d Mennonite community \u2014 especially among families who attend small private religious schools or are homeschooled.",
      "At least three of the New Mexico cases are in Lea County, which borders Gaines County in Texas. The state health department has said people may have been exposed at a grocery store, an elementary school, a church, Nor-Lea Hospital and a Walgreens in Hobbs, New Mexico.",
      "Measles a respiratory virus that can survive in the air for up to two hours. Up to 9 out of 10 people who are susceptible will get the virus if exposed, according to the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.",

      "The first shot is recommended for children between 12 and 15 months old and the second between 4 and 6 years old. The vaccine series is required for kids before entering kindergarten in public schools nationwide.",
      "Before the vaccine was introduced in 1963, the U.S. saw some 3 million to 4 million cases per year. Now, it\u2019s usually fewer than 200 in a normal year.",
      "There is no link between the vaccine and autism, despite a now-discredited study and health disinformation.",
      "In communities with high vaccination rates \u2014 above 95% \u2014 diseases like measles have a harder time spreading through communities. This is called \u201cherd immunity.\u201d",
      "But childhood vaccination rates have declined nationwide since the pandemic and more parents are claiming religious or personal conscience waivers to exempt their kids from required shots.",
      "The U.S. saw a rise in measles cases in 2024, including an outbreak in Chicago that sickened more than 60. Five years earlier, measles cases were the worst in almost three decades in 2019.",
      "Gaines County has one of the highest rates in Texas of school-aged children who opt out of at least one required vaccine, with nearly 14% of K-12 children in the 2023-24 school year. Health officials say that number is likely higher because it doesn\u2019t include many children who are homeschooled and whose data would not be reported.",

    "summary": "More adults have sought insight on whether they have autism in the last decade",
    "story": [
      "More adults have sought insight on whether they have autism in the last decade",
      "ATLANTA -- Natasha Nelson, a 35-year old entrepreneur in Stone Mountain, Georgia, didn't have an innate sense of social norms. She didn't know why people meeting for the first time would choose to engage in small talk instead of deep conversations, or why people like to make their beds.",
      "Then, a few years ago, she was diagnosed with autism, just after her youngest daughter received the same.",
      "\u201cIf your life has always felt like it was in chaos and you don\u2019t feel comfortable and you don\u2019t feel like you thrive and you just feel like you\u2019re constantly surviving and going from one thing to the next, what you got to lose?\u201d Nelson said, encouraging people to seek a diagnosis.",
      "Common signs of autism include trouble with social communication and a fixation on certain routines or topics \u2014 Nelson says \u201cpeople have become my special interest now\u201d \u2014 and may go unnoticed during someone\u2019s childhood.",
      "But it can be costly and difficult to obtain an autism diagnosis later in life due to a shortage of medical professionals trained to work specifically with adults. Here's more information on what you should know about adult autism diagnoses.",
      "Autism spectrum disorder is a range of intellectual, language and social difficulties, like rigidly following routines, having fixed or obsessive interests and struggling to hold eye contact or understand nonverbal communication. Autism is typically diagnosed during childhood, and the American Academy of Pediatrics recommends all children be screened as early as 18 months.",
      "More adults have sought insight on their own neurodiversity in the last decade \u2014 often after their children are diagnosed or after seeing social media posts. A study published last year in JAMA Network Open showed a 452% increase in autism diagnoses among adults age 26 to 34 from 2011 to 2022.",
      "Some traits of autism can go unnoticed until adulthood, when there are new social demands. Others may have learned how to hide certain behaviors, known as masking.",
      "\u201cAdults have learned to compensate over time,\u201d said Whitney Ence, a psychologist at the University of California San Francisco who works with autistic adults. \u201cThey may have learned like \u2018I can\u2019t display that in public, and so I do that in private.\u2019\"",
      "There's also an overlap of symptoms between various disorders like ADHD and OCD that can complicate an autism diagnosis due to difficulties with nonverbal social cues or executive functions like attention span, working memory and problem-solving.",
      "Symptoms present differently for everyone, and many of the traits are common for people without autism, like enjoying routines or enjoying going down rabbit holes of information.",
      "But to meet the diagnostic definition of autism, the symptoms must cause significant impairment, said Dr. Arthur Westover, a psychiatrist who specializes in autism at the University of Texas Southwestern Medical Center.",
      "\u201cWe\u2019re human beings in general. We like routines ... just having a bit of pleasure and feeling better with routines does not mean you\u2019re autistic,\" Westover said. \"It goes a little bit deeper than that.\u201d",
      "Russell Lehmann, 34, has lived with his autism diagnosis for more than 20 years. The motivational speaker has routines that he describes as both comfortable and stressful. Eating the same food and buying the same groceries, he said, brings him comfort. But if he skips going to the gym for an hour and a half every day, he becomes overwhelmed with feelings of depression and failure.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s like no gym, no day,\u201d he said. \u201c... My routine is an incredibly existential burden, because every night I go to bed knowing I have to do a routine I do not like simply to function.\u201d",
      "While there are various online screening tools, autism is a complex diagnosis, so experts recommend talking to your primary care physician for a psychiatry referral.",
      "That psychiatrist might want to interview people who were present in your early childhood, like family and friends, who can attest to symptoms being present at that time.",
      "Some psychiatrists may refer you to a psychologist, who can give you a standardized diagnostic autism test or will use their own clinical judgement. There is no brain scan or blood test for autism.",
      "Getting an autism diagnosis as an adult can be costly and take some time. Westover said there's a major shortage of specialists who work with autistic adults. Nelson's diagnosis took three years and she paid more than $3,000 out-of-pocket.",
      "Ence also suggests that you ask yourself a few questions when considering getting a professional diagnosis, and to know that you may run into a waitlist: \u201cWhat is leading me down this pathway to think that I need a professional diagnosis? Do I need access to services? Are there services I don\u2019t have available to me?\u201d",

    "published": "Tue, 18 Feb 2025 04:40:21 -0500",
    "summary": "At least 29 recruits have died during basic training at law enforcement academies nationwide in the last decade",
    "story": [
      "At least 29 recruits have died during basic training at law enforcement academies nationwide in the last decade",
      "Ronald Donat\u2019s longtime dream of becoming a police officer was in jeopardy.",
      "The 41-year-old struggled to stand after completing a flurry of pushups, sprints and pullups in the notoriously grueling start of physical training that recruits call \u201cHell Day.\u201d",
      "\u201cYou are dead!\u201d classmates recall a sergeant berating Donat, ordering him to sit on concrete at the suburban Atlanta police academy.",
      "Donat, a Haitian immigrant on his third attempt to land a law enforcement job, assured instructors he wasn\u2019t giving up. He managed to get off the ground and rejoin recruits in a bear crawl exercise. But he soon went limp.",
      "One hundred minutes after training began that October 2021 morning, he was dead, according to records obtained by The Associated Press.",
      "Donat is among at least 29 recruits who died during basic training at law enforcement academies around the country in the last decade, an AP investigation found. Most died of exertion, dehydration, heat stroke and other conditions tied to intense exercise \u2014 often on the first day of training, like Donat. Others died several weeks in, sometimes after suffering trauma during boxing or use-of-force drills or collapsing during high-stakes timed runs on hot days.",
      "Experts and police advocates were surprised by AP\u2019s findings \u2014 based on an extensive review of lists of law enforcement deaths in every state, workplace safety records and news reports \u2014 and said many of the deaths were preventable. No federal agency or outside organization comprehensively tracks recruit deaths, unlike officers who die in the line of duty.",
      "\u201cTraining shouldn't have one death, much less 29,\" said David Jude, a retired Kentucky State Police academy commander and instructor. \u201cTo hear that number, it is shocking.\"",
      "Black recruits represented nearly 60% of those who died, a striking disparity given that federal data show Black officers make up 12% of local police forces. Many carried sickle cell trait, a condition most prevalent among Black Americans that increases the risk of serious injury following extreme exertion.",
      "Overall, the deaths amount to a tiny percentage of the nation\u2019s 800,000 sworn officers but highlight another hazard in a profession where shootings, car accidents and other dangers are part of the job.",
      "AP\u2019s tally shows the deaths have grown at a time when departments are tapping an older and more diverse pool of applicants to address officer shortages. More than two-thirds of the deaths occurred since 2020.",
      "A Texas recruit collapsed minutes after instructors denied his request for water, saying: \u201cYou can\u2019t get water in a fight,\u201d video obtained by AP shows.",
      "An Arkansas cadet died after he was forced to run wearing long pants in the scorching midday sun. A North Carolina trainee\u2019s temperature was 106 degrees an hour after his death, when he had no water breaks during an hourlong obstacle course.",
      "Citing similar cases, one expert warned in a medical journal in mid-2023 of a \u201ctroubling spate of exertional collapse and death\u201d of police trainees.",
      "\u201cThis sad tragedy is preventable, but will not become so until our police chiefs begin to heed the message,\u201d wrote Dr. Randy Eichner, a retired University of Oklahoma professor who has long studied exertion-related deaths.",
      "But deaths have only continued to mount. At least five were recorded in 2024, including a New York City recruit who died of heat stroke, a Kentucky man who exerted himself during water-based survival training and a Massachusetts cadet who became unresponsive during defensive tactics training.",
      "Police leaders say some deaths can be prevented through improved awareness and practices, acknowledging that the field needs to better screen for and accommodate health conditions that put recruits at risk and to rein in unnecessarily harsh drills.",
      "\u201cNot only are we potentially putting students in danger, but we\u2019re also putting instructors in precarious situations where they may not know about the risks,\u201d said Jude, an expert witness in the 2022 death of 38-year-old Jonesboro, Arkansas, recruit Vincent Parks.",
      "Jude cited a law passed in Arkansas, amid outrage over video showing Parks collapsing while training on a hot afternoon, as a positive step. It requires trainers be educated on heat exhaustion, dehydration and symptoms of sudden cardiac arrest, and mandates that instructors remove cadets from physical activities if they faint or lose consciousness.",
      "AP's investigation found instances in which recruits who were in serious medical distress were pushed to continue training before they died. In addition to calling off drills in such cases, academy leaders must ensure adequate hydration and breaks and limit training when heat makes it unsafe, experts said.",
      "Bill Alexander, CEO of the National Law Enforcement Memorial in Washington, said the number of deaths could be reduced but probably not eliminated given the nature of policing, which can require chasing and arresting combative suspects.",
      "\u201cIf you\u2019re training people physically and if you\u2019re training them hard, you\u2019re going to have these very rare medical events,\u201d said Alexander, who previously led an academy in Maryland.",
      "Still, some leaders say the field needs urgent action to better protect recruits.",
      "\u201cIt was just heartbreaking. I\u2019ll never forget it. And I\u2019ll do anything at all to get this message out,\u201d said Sheriff Charmaine McGuffey of Hamilton County, Ohio, who witnessed the 2023 death of 36-year-old Marcus Zeigler after he collapsed during a training run. \u201cWe\u2019re talking about life or death.\u201d",
      "When Ronald Donat arrived at the Gwinnett County Police Department Academy in Lawrenceville, Georgia, he thought he\u2019d finally found his place in law enforcement.",
      "He always wanted to become an officer, but his wife, Sharline Volcy, said she initially discouraged him due to safety concerns when their children were young. Both immigrated from Haiti in the 1990s to New Jersey, where they met at church.",
      "Donat earned a college degree and worked various jobs, including installing satellites and cable, but longed for the responsibility and community service that policing would bring.",
      "He finally applied but was initially passed over. When Gwinnett County recruited applicants from New Jersey, Donat applied because he already had a sister living in Georgia, Volcy said.",
      "Georgia's second-largest police agency, Gwinnett County has held hiring events around the country as it struggles to fill hundreds of vacancies. It\u2019s offered bonuses to combat the officer shortage, which grew during the coronavirus pandemic and 2020 protests against police brutality.",
      "A physician who evaluated Donat for the department concluded he was healthy, with no concerning conditions, according to a form the doctor submitted to the state's police standards agency. Following the normal process for the county and most U.S. police departments, the doctor didn\u2019t screen Donat for sickle cell trait.",
      "Donat began working out with other recruits, passed a state-mandated physical fitness test and was given badge 2423. He smiled for a selfie in a squad car. He shared advice with a classmate: \u201cNever give up.\u201d",
      "Up to 3 million Black citizens in the U.S. have sickle cell trait, yet many adults with the genetic condition don't know their status, researchers say. Unlike people with sickle cell disease, they carry only one gene for sickle cell, and one normal gene.",
      "The condition, which is diagnosed through a blood test, doesn\u2019t usually affect their daily lives. But it can cause decreased blood flow and muscle breakdown after intense exertion, dehydration or high body temperatures. In very rare cases, that can result in collapse and death.",
      "The NCAA and U.S. military now screen recruits for the condition, which has contributed to some deaths during football practices and boot camps. Researchers say exertional deaths among college athletes plummeted after NCAA-mandated testing and precautions went into effect in 2010, while the impact of the military programs is under review. Slowly building intensity, resting between drills, remaining hydrated during workouts and responding quickly to signs of distress are recommended.",
      "Most police departments have no such screening programs. Many longtime law enforcement trainers say they\u2019ve never heard of the condition, which AP found was cited as a contributing factor in several deaths and serious injuries of recruits.",
      "McGuffey, the Ohio sheriff, said the cause of Marcus Zeigler\u2019s death was initially a mystery. Before his collapse in May 2023, Zeigler was in peak condition and a top recruit, she said.",
      "The sheriff said she learned about sickle cell trait afterward from another employee, who himself had been seriously injured during academy training. She asked the coroner to investigate whether Zeigler had the condition. After ruling that Zeigler died of exertional heatstroke, the coroner's office added sickle cell trait as a contributing factor.",
      "Since the death, Hamilton County has started screening recruits for the condition, which costs $75 per test.",
      "For Donat and his 27 classmates, academy staffers planned an intense hourlong workout -- a first-day ritual designed to test physical and mental fitness.",
      "Pushups. Flutter kicks. More pushups. Hill sprints. Burpees. Pullups. Bear crawls.",
      "Trainers say the exercises set the tone for the monthslong academy, which seeks to instill a never-quit mindset and prepare recruits for the most dangerous aspects of policing. But the military-style drills have long led to allegations of harsh treatment that cross the line into hazing.",
      "The risks were so well-known that an ambulance usually sat nearby on the first day at the Gwinnett County academy. But that year, a major declined the staff\u2019s request, saying an ambulance would create the perception of danger, according to statements in an internal investigation report.",
      "Donat kept up with classmates for 45 minutes but became exhausted during a set of pullups and couldn\u2019t complete the next exercise, air squats.",
      "An instructor ordered Donat to sit: \u201cYou are dead!\u201d six recruits recalled him screaming, according to the investigation.",
      "The instructor insisted that he told Donat \u201cYou are done!\u201d Either way, it was intended as a reminder, the investigation found, that giving up on police work could lead to death.",
      "Donat didn\u2019t want to quit. Three minutes later, he got up with the help of another recruit and got in formation for a 25-foot bear crawl. \u201cEverything is all right, Donat,\u201d a recruit assured him. But Donat collapsed and stopped breathing.",
      "A paramedic on scene quickly treated Donat with oxygen and chest compressions. An ambulance arrived 10 minutes later.",
      "After Donat was pronounced dead at a hospital, instructors wondered whether his life could have been saved with an ambulance on site.",
      "Hours after Donat died, Gwinnett County released a statement saying Donat had been \u201cinstructed by supervising staff to rest\u201d after becoming lethargic.",
      "A fellow recruit who saw that statement on the news questioned the claim, texting classmates, \u201cas far as I know I never heard that or saw that.\u201d One responded that Donat was last seen in the planking position before his collapse.",
      "A county medical examiner ruled Donat died of natural causes, saying he had an enlarged heart prone to abnormal rhythms. That shocked his wife, Volcy, who said her husband was a fit soccer player with no known heart issues.",
      "The autopsy report didn\u2019t mention sickle cell trait. Volcy believes her husband had it \u2013 she\u2019s learned their daughters do, she said, and she has tested negative. Today, Gwinnett County still doesn\u2019t screen recruits for the condition, spokesperson Sgt. Collin Flynn said.",
      "The department\u2019s investigation, completed weeks after Donat\u2019s death, found no policy violations and resulted in no disciplinary action. A major who led the investigation concluded, \u201cI cannot imagine a scenario, had different actions been taken, that would have changed the tragic death of Recruit Donat.\u201d",
      "Still, the department now requires an ambulance with emergency responders on scene during the first day of physical training, Flynn said. Changes to the workout allow instructors to keep a closer eye on those who are struggling, he said.",
      "The Occupational Safety and Health Administration didn\u2019t investigate because local government agencies aren\u2019t under its jurisdiction. That\u2019s the case in many states, which have not extended workplace safety protections to municipal employees such as police officers.",
      "Because most of the recruits in AP\u2019s investigation hadn\u2019t been sworn in as officers before they died, their names don't appear on the national memorial for deceased officers or some state memorials. And many of their families can\u2019t qualify for death benefits.",
      "Aware of those stakes last year, the police chief in Knoxville, Tennessee, summoned a judge to the hospital room of unconscious recruit Wisbens Antoine.",
      "On that February night, a fellow recruit took the oath on behalf of Antoine, who\u2019d collapsed during training a week before graduation.",

      "Republicans are weighing billions of dollars in cuts to Medicaid, jeopardizing health care coverage for some of the 80 million U.S. adults and children enrolled in the safety net program",
      "WASHINGTON -- Republicans are weighing billions of dollars in cuts to Medicaid, threatening health care coverage for some of the 80 million U.S. adults and children enrolled in the safety net program.",
      "The signing up of millions of additional Americans for taxpayer-funded health care coverage like Medicaid and the Affordable Care Act's marketplace during the Biden administration was lauded by Democrats as a success. But Republicans, who are looking to slash federal spending and offer lucrative tax cuts to corporations and wealthier Americans, now see a big target ripe for trimming. The $880 billion Medicaid program is financed mostly by federal taxpayers, who pick up as much as 80% of the tab in some states. And states, too, have said they're having trouble financing years of growth and sicker patients who enrolled in Medicaid.",
      "To whittle down the budget, the GOP-controlled Congress is eyeing work requirements for Medicaid. It's also considering paying a shrunken, fixed rate to states. All told, over the next decade, Republican lawmakers could try to siphon billions of dollars from the nearly-free health care coverage offered to the poorest Americans.",
      "Weeks before Congress began debating those changes, Republican governors in Arkansas, Ohio and South Dakota were making moves to implement Medicaid work rules of their own, likely to be approved by President Donald Trump's administration.",
      "And other cuts could be on the way. Already on Friday, the Republican administration announced it would shrink the Affordable Care Act's navigator program annual budget by 90% to $10 million. Navigators are stationed throughout the country to help people enrolled in ACA and Medicaid coverage and have helped boost enrollment in health care programs.",
      "Speaker Mike Johnson of Louisiana has floated the idea of tying work to Medicaid.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s common sense,\u201d Johnson said. \u201cLittle things like that make a big difference not only in the budgeting process but in the morale of the people. You know, work is good for you. You find dignity in work.\u201d",
      "But about 92% of Medicaid enrollees are already working, attending school or caregiving, according to an analysis by KFF, a health policy research firm.",
      "Republicans have suggested a work requirement similar to the conditions for the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program, commonly called food stamps. Those ages 16 to 59 must work or volunteer at least 80 hours a month if they are not in school, caring for a child under age 6, disabled, pregnant or homeless. On average, a SNAP enrollee's monthly household income is $852, and the enrollee typically receives $239 in benefits.",
      "During a GOP House retreat last month at Trump's golf resort in Doral, Florida, Republicans said the requirement could motivate people to find employment \u2014 maybe even a job that comes with health insurance.",
      "Rep. Darrell Issa, R-Calif., said the spending cuts should not be \u201con the back of the poor and needy\" but instead target those who shouldn't be getting the benefit.",
      "\u201cWhy should somebody literally sit on the beach and surf, buy their sandwiches from the food truck with their food stamps and then pick up low-cost housing and so on, while writing a book,\" Issa said, noting that he was describing a constituent from more than a decade ago.",
      "Other cuts on the table include a proposal to change the federal government's reimbursement to a per-person limit.",
      "That would shift the costs to states, which might be forced to make tough choices about who or what they cover, said Joan Alker, executive director of the Georgetown Center for Children and Families.",
      "\u201cPeople still have health care needs even if you cut their coverage,\u201d Alker said. \u201cTheir health care needs are not going to go away.\u201d",
      "Cuts to the program could also prompt upset, with just over half of U.S. adults saying the government spends \u201ctoo little\u201d on Medicaid. Only 15% say it\u2019s spending \u201ctoo much,\u201d according to a January Associated Press-NORC Center for Public Affairs Research poll.",
      "President Joe Biden's administration largely blocked states from enacting work rules of their own and required 10 states to remove the requirement for Medicaid coverage.",
      "With Trump now back in charge, some Republican-led states are pressing ahead of Congress to add work rules again. Governors in Arkansas, Iowa and Ohio have announced they'd pursue approval from the federal Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services to introduce work requirements again. And last fall, South Dakota voters signed off on a plan to add a work rule.",
      "When Arkansas enacted a work requirement during the Trump years, about 18,000 people lost coverage. The rule was later blocked by a federal judge and Biden's Democratic administration.",
      "Some people lost coverage because they had trouble accessing the state's website to log their hours or had other procedural problems, said Trevor Hawkins, an attorney with Legal Aid of Arkansas. The organization sued on behalf of Medicaid beneficiaries who were dropped from coverage.",
      "\u201cThese hoops, these things are very consequential,\u201d Hawkins said \u201cThere were a lot of people having hard times.\u201d",
      "In Georgia, 47-year-old Paul Mikell is all too familiar with those hoops.",
      "He's enrolled in Georgia's Pathways to Coverage plan, which offers Medicaid for a slice of impoverished people who make just too much to qualify for traditional Medicaid. Georgia, which has not expanded Medicaid like most other states, requires that people work, volunteer or go to school for 80 hours a month in exchange for accessing the expanded health coverage.",
      "Mikell makes 15-mile (24-kilometer) monthly drives to a government office where he reports his work hours. Sometimes, he said, when he goes online to check whether his hours were logged, they\u2019re not there.",
      "He likened navigating the online system to a battle \u2014 one fought on a computer at the library or borrowed from a friend.",
      "In Idaho, where lawmakers are considering a state work rule and a three-year limit for Medicaid benefits, family physician Peter Crane estimates about two-thirds of his patients are enrolled in the program.",
      "Many work on farms, on ranches or in the local phosphate mines. Before the state expanded Medicaid to cover those with incomes of up to 138% of the poverty level, many of his uninsured patients avoided the doctor entirely. One ignored abdominal pain for months, to the point of needing hospitalization for a severe gallbladder infection, he said.",
      "\u201cThey\u2019re not outliers,\" Crane said of those enrolled in Medicaid during a state hearing last week. \u201cThey\u2019re hardworking citizens of our state who are employed and running small businesses.\u201d",
      "Democrats are warning of the side effects for health care facilities, including rural hospitals and nursing homes. Hospitals have benefited from increased enrollment in health insurance programs such as Medicaid because it guarantees payment for a patient's treatment.",
      "\u201cHospitals will close, including in rural America and urban America and the heartland of America,\u201d House Democratic leader Hakeem Jeffries of New York warned during a recent speech on the House floor. \u201cNursing homes will be shut down, and everyday Americans, children, seniors, those who are suffering with disabilities, will be hurt.\u201d",

      "KANSAS CITY, Mo. -- Abortions are set to resume in Missouri after a judge blocked regulations that had restricted providers even after voters approved enshrining abortion rights into the state\u2019s constitution.",
      "Friday's ruling came after a Kansas City judge ruled last year that abortions were now legal in the state but kept certain regulations on the books while a lawsuit by abortion-rights advocates played out.",
      "One regulation required abortion facilities to be licensed by the Missouri Department of Health and Senior Services. Planned Parenthood said most of its facilities could not comply with some of the licensing rules, including \u201cmedically irrelevant\u201d size requirements for hallways, rooms and doors.",
      "Planned Parenthood argued that the licensing law required providers to give \u201cmedically unnecessary and invasive\u201d pelvic exams to anyone receiving an abortion, including medication abortions, according to court documents. The plaintiffs also said some of the regulations on Planned Parenthood centers were so strict, \u201cmost health centers or doctors\u2019 office simply do not meet\u201d them.",
      "Jackson County Circuit Judge Jerri Zhang said in her ruling that the licensing requirement is \u201cfacially discriminatory because it does not treat services provided in abortion facilities the same as other types of similarly situated health care, including miscarriage care.\u201d",
      "Voters approved the measure adding abortion rights to the constitution in November. That amendment did not legalize abortion in the state outright but instead required judges to reconsider laws that had almost completely banned the procedure.",
      "Margot Riphagen, president and CEO of Planned Parenthood Great Rivers, said the group is working quickly to start providing the procedure again in the coming days.",
      "\u201cToday\u2019s decision affirms what we\u2019ve already long known \u2014 the state\u2019s abortion facility licensing requirements were not about patient safety, but rather another politically motivated barrier to prevent patients seeking abortion from getting the care they need,\u201d she said in a statement.",
      "The ruling is a temporary order pending the outcome of the lawsuit by abortion-rights advocates.",
      "Planned Parenthood and other advocates sued to overturn Missouri\u2019s near-total abortion ban almost immediately after voters amended the constitution to protect reproductive rights. Republican Attorney General Andrew Bailey is fighting the lawsuit.",
      "There was no immediate response to a voice message seeking comment from a spokesperson for the attorney general.",
      "Mallory Schwarz, executive director of Abortion Action Missouri, said clinic partners are ready to start providing abortions as soon as next week.",
      "\u201cWith this change the landscape for Missourians and the entire Midwest region will be transformed, as patients will have greater access to abortion care than they have had in years,\u201d she said in a statement.",
      "Missouri is one of five states where voters approved ballot measures in 2024 to enshrining abortion rights in their constitutions. Nevada voters also approved an amendment but will need to pass it again in 2026 for it to take effect.",
      "Another measure banning discrimination on the basis of \u201cpregnancy outcomes\u201d prevailed in New York.",
      "Missouri\u2019s constitutional amendment allows lawmakers to restrict abortion after viability with exceptions to \u201cprotect the life or physical or mental health of the pregnant person.\u201d",
      "The term \u201cviability\u201d is used by health care providers to describe whether a pregnancy is expected to continue developing normally or whether a fetus might survive outside the uterus. While there is no defined time frame, doctors say it is generally sometime after the 21st week of pregnancy.",

      "In the rural villages of South Africa, U.S. President Donald Trump\u2019s sudden freeze on foreign aid impacts hundreds of thousands of HIV patients",
      "UMZIMKHULU, South Africa -- At a rural village in South Africa's KwaZulu-Natal province, unemployed 19-year-old Nozuko Majola is trying to figure out if she has enough money for the one-hour ride to collect her much-needed HIV medication, usually delivered to her home that can't be easily reached due to rough, untarred roads.",
      "Majola is one of millions of patients in South Africa affected by U.S. President Donald Trump\u2019s global foreign aid freeze, raising worries about HIV patients defaulting on treatment, infection rates going up and eventually a rise in deaths.",
      "In 2024, think tank Human Sciences Research Council released figures showing that Majola's province recorded the second-highest HIV prevalence in the country, at 16%, with at least 1,300 young people estimated to contract the disease every week.",
      "KwaZulu-Natal also had the highest number of people living with HIV in South Africa in 2022, about 1,980,000. The country counts more than 7.5 million people infected with the virus that causes AIDS \u2014 more than any other nation.",
      "There are 5.5 million South Africans receiving antiretroviral treatment, whose funding is now in question after Trump suspended the President\u2019s Emergency Plan for AIDS Relief, or PEPFAR. It contributes more than $400 million a year to South Africa's HIV programs and nongovernmental organizations, about 17% of the total funding, according to the Health Ministry.",
      "Globally, PEPFAR is credited with saving at least 26 million lives since its inception in 2003, according to the U.N. AIDS agency.",
      "Last week, a federal judge ordered the Trump administration to temporarily lift the funding freeze, while the U.S. Embassy in South Africa said PEPFAR projects would resume under a limited waiver. However, aid groups dealing with HIV have already shuttered with closure notices hanging at the entrances and PEPFAR-branded vehicles standing idle, with patients diverted to struggling health facilities.",
      "Most of the PEPFAR funding is channeled through non-governmental organizations, which run programs that compliment health care services provided by the government.",
      "For Majola and other HIV patients in the Umzimkhulu region, where unemployment is rife and most people rely on subsistence farming and government welfare grants, the aid freeze has disrupted their lives.",
      "\u201cThings will be tough around here, and a lot of people will default on their treatment because we really struggle with transport,\" she said. \u201cThe mobile clinics hardly come here.\u201d",
      "The freeze has hurt various groups that can no longer provide treatment, causing an influx of patients to already overstretched public facilities. Along with the medication, these programs also allowed health personnel to test HIV patients in far-flung villages, which has been a lifeline for many, especially those afraid to visit public facilities due to the social stigma attached to HIV.",
      "In addition, nearly 15,000 health workers whose salaries are funded through PEPFAR are left wondering if they have lost their livelihoods.",
      "About an hour away in the district of Umgungundlovu, which the think tank says has the highest number of HIV cases in South Africa, HIV counselors gathered in a small office discussing how best to assist patients like Majola. A manager at a nearby health clinic wondered how to handle the administrative work that is piling up after PEPFAR-funded workers withdrew.",
      "\u201cPeople who were doing administration and data capturing, whose salaries were funded by PEPFAR, have left. We are a small facility and we cannot handle such a workload,\u201d said the manager, who spoke on condition of anonymity because they were not authorized to speak to the press.",
      "Nozuko Ngcaweni has been on HIV treatment for about 30 years. One of her children was also infected and died at age 17. She said the aid suspension already impacted her community and many missed their treatment.",
      "\u201cNot long ago, we said by 2030, we want to see an HIV-free generation. But if things remain as is, we will not achieve that. We will have to deal with deaths,\u201d she said.",

      "Utah students as early as kindergarten would be required to learn about firearm safety in the classroom under a bill that passed the state House",
      "SALT LAKE CITY -- Utah students in as early as kindergarten would be required to learn about firearm safety in the classroom under a bill that passed the state House with overwhelming support Friday.",
      "The Republican-controlled chamber approved the measure in a 59-10 vote and sent it to the Senate, despite concerns from some gun violence prevention advocates that it places an unnecessary burden on children.",
      "Under the proposal, public school students would receive mandatory instruction throughout their K-12 years on how to respond if they encounter a gun. The lessons, which could be presented in a video or by an instructor displaying an actual firearm, would demonstrate best practices for safely handling and storing a gun to prevent accidents.",
      "Elementary age children would learn about gun safety on at least three occasions by the time they reach sixth grade, with the possibility for that instruction to begin in kindergarten, when kids are around five years old.",
      "The bill\u2019s Republican sponsor, Rep. Rex Shipp of Cedar City, said it's aimed at preventing accidental shootings by and of young children. The lessons, he said, will be age-appropriate for each grade level, with younger students learning to avoid touching a gun and alert an adult immediately.",
      "\u201cA lot of times when they don't have any firearms in their homes or don't do any hunting and shooting, then these kids are not taught what to do when they come in contact with a firearm,\u201d Shipp said.",
      "One other state, Tennessee, has a law on the books requiring firearm safety training in public schools, but it lets education officials determine in which grade they think it's appropriate for students to start receiving that instruction. The lessons, set to begin next school year, will be annual and cannot include live firearms or ammunition.",

      "\u201cGetting the number to zero is a goal and should be our goal,\u201d Kevin Brosseau, a former member of the Royal Canadian Mounted Police and a former national security and intelligence adviser, said Wednesday.",
      "\u201cIf it\u2019s one pound, 10 pounds, we all know the amount of deaths that possibly could represent. We should be focused on eliminating the scourge that is fentanyl in this country and in the United States,\u201d he said.",

      "The move was partly in response to President Donald Trump saying the flow of fentanyl and illegal immigrants into the U.S. was a reason for threatening to impose a 25% tariff on all Canadian goods \u2013 with an exception of 10% on energy.",
      "Trump has paused the implementation of those tariffs until at least March 4.",
      "\u201cThis is a clear demonstration of how serious Canada is taking the fentanyl crisis in his country and how important our relationship is with our American counterparts,\u201d said Brosseau, who was speaking after touring a Canada Border Services Agency port of entry facility in Lansdowne, Ontario.",

      "Lawyers for South Carolina and Planned Parenthood are returning to the state\u2019s highest court to argue how restrictive the state's abortion ban should be",
      "COLUMBIA, S.C. -- With a heartbeat abortion ban solidly in place in South Carolina, lawyers for the state and Planned Parenthood return to the state's highest court Wednesday to argue how restrictive the ban should be.",
      "The law is being enforced in South Carolina as a ban on almost all abortions around six weeks after conception, setting that mark as the time cardiac activity starts.",
      "But Planned Parenthood and other abortion rights groups are arguing the 2023 law includes alternative definitions about the timing of a fetal heart forming and a \u201cheartbeat\u201d starting and the true ban should start around nine or 10 weeks.",
      "Both sides are set to argue for just over an hour at the South Carolina Supreme Court in Columbia. The justices likely will take several months to decide the case. In the meantime, the abortion ban around six weeks likely will remain in place after a lower court upheld it.",
      "The 2023 law says abortions cannot be performed after an ultrasound can detect \u201ccardiac activity, or the steady and repetitive rhythmic contraction of the fetal heart, within the gestational sac.\u201d",
      "South Carolina and several other states place that at six weeks into development. But what follows the \u201cor\u201d in the sentence could require that a heart has formed, and medical experts say that doesn\u2019t happen until around nine weeks.",
      "The legal fight has been brewing since the state Supreme Court reversed itself after overturning a similar ban in 2021. The Republican-dominated General Assembly then made small changes and a justice who voted in the majority in the 3-2 decision to overturn the ban reached retirement age and was replaced.",
      "In the decision upholding the new ban, the state Supreme Court itself noted the different definitions saying resolving them would be a question \u201cfor another day.\u201d",
      "That day is Wednesday. Since then, more inconsistencies in the law\u2019s language have been brought up. The law refers to a fetal heartbeat, but most experts consider a fertilized egg to be an embryo for about 10 weeks after conception before transitioning into a fetus.",
      "Lawyers for the state said the parsing of the language ignores the intent of the Legislature. Both supporters and opponents of the bill called it nearly exclusively a six-week ban during debate in the House and Senate.",
      "Since the U.S. Supreme Court overturned Roe v. Wade in 2022 and ended a nationwide right to abortion, most Republican-controlled states have started enforcing new bans or restrictions and most Democrat-dominated ones have sought to protect abortion access.",
      "Currently, 13 states are enforcing bans on abortion at all stages of pregnancy, with limited exceptions, and South Carolina and three others have bans that kick in at or about six weeks into pregnancy -- often before women realize they\u2019re pregnant.",
      "The latest lawsuit was filed by South Carolina resident Taylor Shelton, who said she had sought medical attention for pain from her intrauterine device and was stunned to find out, just two days after missing her regularly-tracked period, that she was pregnant.",
      "She ended up in North Carolina, driving for hours to several appointments to undergo an abortion because doctors in South Carolina were unsure how to define a heartbeat. Shelton couldn\u2019t be completely sure she was within six weeks.",
      "Some Republicans in South Carolina are also pushing for an outright abortion ban, but while legislation was introduced this January when the General Assembly started its two-year session, no hearings have been held."

      "A new study suggests that medications that have transformed the treatment of obesity may also help people drink less alcohol",
      "Medications that have transformed the treatment of obesity may also help people drink less alcohol, according to new government-funded research.",
      "The study was small \u2014 just 48 adults \u2014 and lasted just over two months, so it\u2019s not the final word. Experts say it\u2019s not yet clear how safe these drugs are for people who don\u2019t need to lose weight.",
      "But the results add to evidence from animal studies and reports that people are finding drugs like Ozempic and Wegovy helpful to manage cravings, not just for food, but also for tobacco and alcohol. Scientists are studying these drugs in smokers, people with opioid addiction and cocaine users.",
      "\u201cThis is such promising data. And we need more of it,\u201d said study co-author Dr. Klara Klein, of the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill, who treats patients with diabetes and obesity. \u201cWe frequently will hear that once people start these medications that their desire to drink is very reduced, if not completely abolished.\"",
      "The drugs, known as GLP-1 receptor agonists, work by mimicking hormones in the gut and the brain to regulate appetite and feelings of fullness. The new study looked at one of these drugs, semaglutide, which is the drug in Ozempic and Wegovy.",
      "The research, published Wednesday in the journal JAMA Psychiatry, was funded by the National Institute on Alcohol Abuse and Alcoholism, part of the National Institutes of Health.",
      "There are already three medications approved to treat alcohol use disorder, so until larger studies can confirm the findings, people should talk to their doctor about what's already available, said lead author Christian Hendershot, an addiction researcher at University of Southern California.",
      "For the new study, researchers recruited people who reported symptoms of alcohol use disorder, such as difficulty controlling their drinking, but weren\u2019t actively seeking treatment for it.",
      "First, each person came to a lab where they were served their favorite alcoholic beverage and could drink as much as they wanted over two hours.",
      "Then, researchers randomly assigned half the people to get a weekly injection of semaglutide. The other half got sham injections.",
      "For nine weeks, everyone kept track of their drinking habits and their desire for alcohol. A lab visit with their favorite alcohol was repeated at the end of the study.",
      "During the last weeks of the study, nearly 40% in the semaglutide group reported no heavy drinking days compared with 20% in the placebo group. And in the final lab test, the semaglutide group drank roughly half the amount, on average, compared to those who got the placebo.",
      "Everyone in the study was overweight. It's unclear how safe the drugs would be for a person of normal weight, Klein said.",
      "Smokers in the study who got the semaglutide also cut back on cigarettes, noted Luba Yammine of UTHealth Houston, who is leading other research on GLP-1 drugs for people who want to quit smoking. The finding is promising but more data is needed, Yammine said.",
      "The study \u201cprovides additional important information on the potential role of this new class of medications\u201d in treating certain addictions, said Dr. Lorenzo Leggio, an NIH researcher who is leading a 20-week trial of semaglutide for alcohol use disorder now underway in Baltimore.",
      "\u201cIt is important to keep in mind that we need larger randomized clinical trials to confirm these findings,\u201d Leggio said.",

      "Arsenal manager Mikel Arteta believes the accumulation of long-term injuries experienced by some clubs is an \u201caccident waiting to happen\u201d because of the increased demands on players in a busy soccer calendar",
      "LONDON -- Arsenal manager Mikel Arteta believes the accumulation of long-term injuries experienced by some clubs is an \u201caccident waiting to happen\u201d because of the increased demands on players in a congested soccer calendar.",
      "Arteta said he felt a \u201cbig pain in the tummy\u201d after seeing Kai Havertz pick up a serious hamstring injury at the end of a light training session in Dubai that will rule the Germany forward out for the rest of the season.",
      "It further stretches Arsenal\u2019s resources up front, with Gabriel Jesus having ruptured his ACL, winger Bukayo Saka having not played since December because of a hamstring issue and another wide player, Gabriel Martinelli, set to miss the next month also with a hamstring injury.",
      "Two more games per team were added to the first stage of this season's Champions League, while Arsenal also went deep in the English League Cup \u2014 it was eliminated by Newcastle in the two-legged semifinals \u2014 and is in a title race with Liverpool in the Premier League.",
      "An expanded and revamped Club World Cup, which takes place in the United States at the end of the season and lasts a month, also extends the schedule for many teams, though not Arsenal this year. Some players have openly complained that it is detrimental to their performance and health and the busy match schedule is facing legal challenges and the possibility of strike action.",
      "For Arteta, it\u2019s no surprise to see injury rates soar at Arsenal because of the extra load on players and what he perceives to be an increased intensity in modern-day soccer.",
      "\u201cYou cannot prove it and the evidence we can provide is very limited in many aspects and every case is very different but already some of them (injuries) we know are based on load and minutes. It's inevitable,\u201d Arteta said Friday. \u201cWe have players who have been injured who have played 130 games over the last two seasons. In the end, it\u2019s an accident waiting to happen if you continue to load and load and load.",
      "\u201cIs this season an accumulation of that? Is it the stress of that? Is it luck? Is it preparation? Is it methodology? There are a lot of factors. It\u2019s very difficult to point at something but the schedule that's planned is super-demanding and for certain players, especially explosive players, it\u2019s a real issue.\u201d",
      "Havertz appears to have been unlucky in picking up his injury, with Arteta explaining how the German stretched his leg to stop a shot at a set-piece and \u201cfelt his hamstring go.\u201d",

      "\u201cWhen you have to load that muscle for two or three or six or eight weeks that you haven\u2019t in training, the risk of injury is much bigger \u2014 one, because the tendon is not recovered, and then it\u2019s not prepared to absorb the load and stress you are going to put it under every three days.\u201d",

      "The Senate is expected to vote Thursday on the confirmation of Robert F",
      "WASHINGTON -- The Senate is expected to vote Thursday on the confirmation of Robert F. Kennedy Jr., a prominent lawyer and vocal vaccine critic, as the nation's health secretary, controlling $1.7 trillion in spending for vaccines, food safety and health insurance programs for roughly half the country.",
      "Despite several Republicans expressing deep skepticism about his views on vaccines, Kennedy is expected to win confirmation, absent any last-minute changes.",
      "Kennedy, 71, whose famous name and family tragedies have put him in the national spotlight since he was a child, has earned a formidable following with his populist \u2014 and sometimes extreme \u2014 views on food, chemicals and vaccines.",
      "His audience only grew during the COVID-19 pandemic, when Kennedy devoted much of his time to a nonprofit that sued vaccine makers and harnessed social media campaigns to erode trust in vaccines as well as the government agencies that promote them.",
      "With the backing of Republican President Donald Trump, Kennedy believes he is \u201cuniquely positioned\u201d to revive trust in those public health agencies, which include the Food and Drug Administration, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, and the National Institutes for Health.",
      "Republican senators have largely embraced Kennedy's vision, reciting his newly hatched slogan to \u201cMake America Healthy Again\u201d in speeches.",
      "Last week, North Carolina GOP Sen. Thom Tillis said he hopes Kennedy \u201cgoes wild\u201d on reigning in health care costs and improving Americans' health. But one holdout \u2014 GOP Sen. Bill Cassidy, a Louisiana doctor \u2014 required assurances that Kennedy would not make changes to existing vaccine recommendations before agreeing to back him.",
      "Democrats have remained skeptical, unsuccessfully prodding Kennedy during hearings to deny a long discredited theory that vaccines cause autism. And some have raised alarms about Kennedy financially benefiting from changing vaccine guidelines or weakening federal lawsuit protections against vaccine makers.",
      "Kennedy made more than $850,000 last year from an arrangement referring clients to a law firm that has sued the makers of Gardasil, a human papillomavirus vaccine that protects against cervical cancer. While serving as health secretary, he has promised to reroute fees collected from the arrangement to his son.",
      "Kennedy is expected to take over the agency in the midst of a massive federal government shakeup, led by billionaire Elon Musk, that has shut off \u2014 even if temporarily \u2014 billions of taxpayer dollars in public health funding and left thousands of federal workers unsure about their jobs.",
      "On Friday, the NIH announced it would cap billions of dollars in medical research given to universities and cancer being used to develop treatments for diseases like cancer and Alzheimer's.",
      "Kennedy, too, has called for a staffing overhaul at the NIH, FDA and CDC. Last year, he vowed to fire 600 employees at the NIH, the nation's largest funder of biomedical research."

      "PARIS -- Those Valentine flowers might come with a bit more than vivid colors and a nice scent. France\u2019s oldest consumer group is reminding people that any imported cut flower likely also contains pesticides -- even those banned in Europe.",
      "The flower industry points to studies saying that cut flowers pose no health risk to consumers, though some advocates say there hasn't been enough study on whether the contamination could endanger florists who touch them daily.",
      "Paris-based UFC-Que Choisir chose Valentine\u2019s Day to release results of what it said were tests of roses, gerberas and chrysanthemums sold at florists, shops, supermarkets and online. It said it found potentially harmful residues of pesticides in every bouquet.",
      "In the Netherlands \u2014 which produces roughly 60% of the global trade \u2014 a similar study came to similar conclusions.",
      "Unlike for produce that is consumed, regulations in Europe on cut flowers place no limits on the level of pesticides, UFC-Que Choisir notes.",
      "The group is calling on authorities to introduce maximum levels of pesticide residues, a ban on imports of flowers treated with pesticides that are banned in Europe, and mandatory labelling of the origin and treatment of flowers.",
      "The group bought 15 bouquets of flowers. In each one, between seven and up to 46 different pesticide residues were identified, of which an average of almost 12 were deemed hazardous because they are possibly carcinogenic or endocrine disrupting, the group said. Residues of pesticides banned in the EU were found in two-thirds of the bouquets.",
      "Valhor, the French inter-trade organization for horticulture, floristry and landscaping, however pointed to a study in Germany that concluded there were no risks for consumers who buy cut flowers.",

      "Pierre Lebailly, a pesticide expert at University of Caen, regrets that there have been only a small number of studies on the impact of pesticides on florists\u2019 health. Among those, a study in Belgium showed that pesticides could be absorbed through the skin when handling contaminated flowers, with a potential damaging effect on health.",
      "The Dutch branch of the Pesticide Action Network \u2014 a network of European NGOs promoting sustainable alternatives to pesticides \u2014- tested 13 bouquets of tulips, roses, and mixed bouquets in a certified laboratory. Residues of pesticides were found in all bouquets.",
      "According to PAN, Valentine\u2019s roses are typically sourced from Dutch growers with greenhouses or fields in Kenya and Ethiopia.",
      "A total of 71 different active substances were found in the bouquets, of which 28 are banned in the EU. The study found that, on average, each bouquet contained 25 toxic substances."

      "This is what it looks like after the Trump administration halted U.S. foreign assistance last month. The U.S. Agency for International Development, USAID, issued stop-work orders during a 90-day review for what the administration has alleged is wasteful spending.",
      "Fares had been working in three clinics run by M\u00e9decins du Monde, or Doctors of the World, offering free health care to the displaced population in northern Syria, which until the fall of former President Bashar Assad in December had been the country's main rebel-held enclave. It sheltered millions of people who had fled years of civil war.",
      "Their already grim camps swelled again in 2023 after a deadly magnitude 7.8 earthquake hit Turkey and northern Syria. Since the fall of Assad, some displaced Syrians have begun to return home, but many have no homes left.",
      "Fares\u2019 clinic in Sarmada used to support 16 camps in the region, assisting approximately 35,000 people. Since the aid freeze, 10 such clinics receiving USAID funding had to close, and Doctors of the World had to lay off 184 people, officials with the organization said.",
      "\u201cIf the support is not resumed, there will be a major disaster and serious harm to vulnerable groups,\u201d said Fares, who heads the organization\u2019s medical programs. \u201cOperating costs of clinics are much lower than those of hospitals. The cessation of work in these clinics will put increased pressure on emergency hospitals and other healthcare facilities\"",
      "This part of Syria lacks centralized government healthcare, leaving people reliant on nonprofit providers and making the impact of the sudden U.S. cuts especially dire, aid workers and experts said.",
      "\"Our analysis shows that withdrawing all of USAID\u2019s support in Syria would be equivalent to a devastating shock of 5% to its already struggling economy. This is among the largest impacts on any recipient.\" said Ian Mitchell, senior policy fellow at the Washington based Center for Global Development.",
      "The U.S. had been providing 25 cents in foreign aid for every $100 of U.S. income, Mitchell said, but that relatively small contribution had outsized impact: \u201cWithout U.S. support in places like Gaza and Syria, the world will become a more dangerous place.\"",
      "In one camp that had been served by a Doctors of the World clinic, near Kawkaba village, children played among the crowded tents.",

      "Secretary of State Marco Rubio has issued a waiver to exempt emergency food aid and \u201clife-saving\u201d programs. But Hamadeh and others said funding has not resumed to a point that would allow them to fully restore services.",
      "\u201cWe\u2019re going to have to shut down some of these hospitals and shrink,\u201d Hamadeh said. \u201cWe can\u2019t be providing free services anymore.\"",
      "Some programs, such as mental health support for refugees in Turkey and an autism center for children, may not be deemed life-saving.",
      "\u201cWe have a grant that supports survivors of torture and sexual assault,\u201d Hamadeh said. \u201cAre these services life-saving or not? Likely they will be shut down.\u201d",
      "USAID and the U.S. government did not respond to questions. Elsewhere, USAID workers and aid officials have said funding hasn't resumed despite waivers, or USAID staffers who would process them are now gone.",
      "SAMS relies on USAID for about 25 to 30% of its funds. It's significant, but some other organizations working in Syria receive much more.",
      "Doctors of the World's Istanbul office, which oversees operations in northern Syria, was receiving 60% of its funding from USAID.",
      "Sitting in a new, downsized office, Turkish branch director Hakan Bilgin recalled the day they were told to halt services.",
      "\u201cWe just received the stop-work order suddenly. Nobody was expecting it,\u201d he said. \u201cAs a medical organization providing life-saving services, you\u2019re basically telling us: Close all the clinics, stop all your doctors, and you\u2019re not providing services to women, children, and the elderly.\u201d",
      "Bilgin said his group has cut its daily consultations across northern Syria from 5,000 to 500. The organization has applied for a waiver from the U.S. but has received no response.",

    "published": "Mon, 17 Feb 2025 12:16:48 -0500",
    "summary": "The Vatican says Pope Francis&rsquo; respiratory tract infection is presenting a &ldquo;complex clinical picture&rdquo; that will require further hospitalization",
    "story": [
      "The Vatican says Pope Francis\u2019 respiratory tract infection is presenting a \u201ccomplex clinical picture\u201d that will require further hospitalization",
      "ROME -- Pope Francis\u2019 respiratory tract infection is presenting a \u201ccomplex clinical picture\u201d that will require further hospitalization, the Vatican said Monday, as concerns grew about the increasingly frail health of the 88-year-old pontiff.",
      "Vatican spokesman Matteo Bruni said the results of tests conducted in recent days and Monday indicate the pope is suffering from a polymicrobial respiratory tract infection that has necessitated a further change in his drug therapy. Scientists say polymicrobial diseases are caused by a mix of viruses, bacteria, fungi and parasites.",
      "There was no timeframe given for his hospitalization, which at Day 4 has already sidelined Francis for longer than a 2023 hospitalization for pneumonia. Bruni said the complexity of his symptoms \u201cwill require an appropriate hospital stay.\u201d",
      "Francis had part of one lung removed after a pulmonary infection as a young man and is prone to bouts of bronchitis in winter. He was admitted to Rome\u2019s Gemelli hospital in a \u201cfair\u201d condition on Friday after a weeklong bout of bronchitis worsened. Doctors confirmed a respiratory tract infection and prescribed \u201cabsolute rest\u201d alongside unspecified drug therapies. Subsequent updates said his slight fever had gone away and that he was in \u201cstable\u201d condition.",
      "Bruni said Francis ate breakfast and read the newspapers Monday morning after a third peaceful night. And in a sign Francis was still keeping up with some of the essentials of his routine, the parish priest of the Catholic Church in Gaza, the Rev. Gabriel Romanelli, reported that Francis had maintained his daily video call to the church on Friday and Saturday night. He sent a text message on Sunday.",
      "\u201cWe heard his voice. It's true, it was more tired,\u201d Romanelli told Vatican News. \u201cBut we heard his voice clearly and he listened to us,\u201d said the Argentine priest, whom Francis has phoned every day of the Gaza war.",
      "Bronchitis, or an inflammation of the airwaves, can be relatively mild in a healthy person but can become much more severe in someone who is older or has existing lung problems, especially when they are unable to cough up and expel the accumulating mucus. Bacteria and other organisms can colonize, leading to further infection that may be harder to treat.",
      "Dr. Maor Sauler, who specializes in adult pulmonary medicine and critical care at Yale School of Medicine, said it's not uncommon for people suffering from bronchitis to develop an infection with more than one organism in their lungs. The concern, however, is that antibiotics and other drug therapies don't work in isolation and require the body to respond, which given Francis' other problems may make recovery more challenging.",
      "\"Being older, wheelchair-bound, all those are risk factors for a situation in which we can\u2019t treat it despite our best efforts,\u201d said Sauler, who is not involved in Francis' care.",
      "As people get older, their immune systems don\u2019t work as well, making doctors especially concerned when elderly patients develop multiple problems. A decline in lung function and muscle strength can also impair the body's ability to effectively clear respiratory secretions, increasing susceptibility to infections like pneumonia, a deeper and far more serious infection of the lungs\u2019 air sacs.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s in the public record that he\u2019s had chest problems in the past, he\u2019s been admitted to hospital with pneumonia (in 2023), he's had part of one lung removed,\" noted Dr. Nick Hopkinson, clinical director of the Asthma+Lung UK foundation, who is not involved in Francis' treatment. \u201cAll of that makes him a little bit more vulnerable potentially, but we just have to wait and see.\u201d",
      "He said that after doctors have identified clinically what is wrong, they can start treating the underlying infection with the correct therapies.",
      "The Argentine pope is a known workaholic who keeps up a grueling pace despite his increasingly precarious health.",
      "In addition to his frequent bouts of respiratory infections in winter, he uses a wheelchair, walker or cane because of bad knees and suffers from sciatica nerve pain. In 2021 he had 33 centimeters (13 inches) of his colon removed because of a narrowing, and then had a further surgery in 2023 to remove intestinal scar tissue and repair an abdominal hernia.",
      "When he had a bad case of pneumonia in 2023, he left the hospital after three days and only acknowledged after the fact that he had been admitted urgently after feeling faint and having a sharp pain in his chest. This time around, Francis insisted on finishing his morning audiences Friday before leaving the Vatican, even though he was having trouble speaking at length because he was so short of breath.",
      "Francis\u2019 continued hospitalization has already forced the cancellation of some events connected to the Vatican\u2019s Holy Year and put others in question. The official Vatican calendar online has no more papal appointments or activities for February, and picks up only on March 5, Ash Wednesday. This week\u2019s weekly general audience was canceled.",
      "Outside the Gemelli hospital, people were praying for the pope, including Nigerian nuns in front of a giant statue of St. John Paul II. He had so many hospitalizations at Gemelli that the main entry way is decorated with a permanent photo exhibition of his ailments over the course of his quarter-century pontificate.",
      "Sister Mary Beatrice Nnenji said prayers were necessary \u201cbecause no one is strong enough on their own.\u201d",
      "\u201cWith age also you feel your health and especially with his workload and all the efforts he makes,\u201d she said. \u201cSo if God wants he will go on. Let\u2019s hope in God, we cannot go against it, whatever comes.\u201d",

      "WARSAW, Poland -- Marian Turski, a Holocaust survivor who became a journalist and historian in postwar Poland and co-founded Warsaw's landmark Jewish history museum, died on Tuesday. He was 98.",
      "The POLIN Museum of the History of Polish Jews announced his death, describing him as a person of exceptional moral and intellectual qualities who always stood on the side \u201cof minorities, the excluded, the wronged.\u201d",
      "\u201cAn authority of global importance, an advocate of Polish-Jewish understanding, a publicist, a historian. A Polish Jew. A person without whom our museum would not exist,\u201d the museum director, Zygmunt St\u0119pi\u0144ski, wrote in a statement.",
      "Turski survived the Lodz ghetto, where he and his family were forced to live, two death marches and imprisonment at the Nazi German concentration camps Buchenwald and Auschwitz-Birkenau, which was in German-occupied Poland. In all, he lost 39 relatives in the Holocaust.",
      "Unlike many Jewish survivors who left postwar Poland, Turski chose to remain. He was on the political left his entire life, and was a member of the communist party.",
      "He was among a dwindling number of Holocaust survivors and spoke during observances last month marking the 80th anniversary of the liberation of the Auschwitz-Birkenau death camp.",
      "However, it was a stark warning about the dangers of indifference at the anniversary five years earlier that brought him international attention and raised his moral profile among his supporters. Turski said at the time that the Holocaust did not \u201cfall from the sky\u201d all at once but took hold step by step as society\u2019s acceptance of small acts of discrimination eventually led to ghettos and extermination camps.",
      "He also called on people to not remain indifferent when minorities are discriminated against, when history is distorted and when \u201cany authority violates the existing social contract.\u201d",
      "Many in Poland interpreted his words as a critique of the right-wing government in power at the time. However, those on the political right criticized him for using the Auschwitz anniversary to comment on the political situation, and some even suggested that Turski lacked the moral authority for such a warning because he belonged to Poland\u2019s communist party before 1989.",
      "Citing the words of another survivor, Roman Kent, Turski described what should be the Eleventh Commandment of the Bible: \u201cThough shalt not be indifferent.\u201d",
      "Poland\u2019s conservative President Andrzej Duda paid tribute to Turski, saying: \u201cHe consistently spoke about the need to cultivate sensitivity to evil. May his memory be honored!\u201d",
      "Turski was born on June 26, 1926, as Mosze Turbowicz, and spent his childhood and teenage years in Lodz, where he attended a Hebrew language school.",
      "In 1944, his parents and brother were deported to the German Nazi camp Auschwitz, and he arrived there two weeks later in one of the last transports.",
      "His father and brother died in the gas chambers, while his mother was sent to work at the Bergen Belsen camp in northern Germany, and Turski was dispatched to work on roads in the Auschwitz-Birkenau area before being sent on two death marches. He was liberated at Terezin close to death from exhaustion and typhus.",
      "In September 1945, he returned to Poland, a committed communist who rejected an offer to go to the West and wanted to help build a socialist Poland.",
      "He used his last time on the stage at last month's Auschwitz anniversary observance to warn of the dangers of hatred and to recall that the number of those murdered was always far greater than the smaller group of survivors.",

      "KURRAM, Pakistan -- Militants in northwestern Pakistan killed a driver and a security official Monday when they ambushed a convoy of trucks carrying food, medicine and other supplies for thousands of residents trapped by sectarian violence, authorities said.",
      "It was the third such assault since January in Kurram, a district in the restive Khyber Pakhtunkhwa province, where at least 130 people have died in recent months in clashes between rival Shiite and Sunni tribes.",

      "PALMYRA, Syria -- Experts are returning to Syria\u2019s war-ravaged heritage sites, hoping to lay the groundwork for restoring them and reviving tourism, which they say could provide a much-needed boost to the country\u2019s decimated economy after nearly 14 years of war.",
      "Once-thriving landmarks like the ancient city of Palmyra and the medieval Crusader castle of Crac des Chevaliers remain scarred by years of conflict, but local tourists are returning to the sites, and conservationists hope their historical and cultural significance will eventually draw international visitors back.",
      "One of Syria\u2019s six UNESCO World Heritage sites, Palmyra was once a key hub to the ancient Silk Road network linking the Roman and Parthian empires to Asia. Located in the Syrian desert, it is renowned for its 2,000-year-old Roman-era ruins. It is now marked by shattered columns and damaged temples.",
      "Before the Syrian uprising that began in 2011 and soon escalated into a brutal civil war, Palmyra was Syria\u2019s main tourist destination, attracting around 150,000 visitors monthly, Ayman Nabu, a researcher and expert in ruins told The Associated Press. Dubbed the \u201cBride of the Desert,\u201d he said \u201cPalmyra revitalized the steppe and used to be a global tourist magnet.\u201d",
      "The ancient city was the capital of an Arab client state of the Roman Empire that briefly rebelled and carved out its own kingdom in the third century, led by Queen Zenobia.",
      "In more recent times, the area had darker associations. It was home to Tadmur prison, where thousands of opponents of the Assad family\u2019s rule in Syria were reportedly tortured. The Islamic State group demolished the prison after capturing the town.",
      "IS militants later destroyed Palmyra\u2019s historic temples of Bel and Baalshamin and the Arch of Triumph, viewing them as monuments to idolatry, and beheaded an elderly antiquities scholar who had dedicated his life to overseeing the ruins.",
      "Between 2015 and 2017, control of Palmyra shifted between IS and the Syrian army before Assad\u2019s forces, backed by Russia and Iran-aligned militias, recaptured it. They established military bases in the neighboring town, which was left heavily damaged and largely abandoned. Fakhr al-Din al-Ma\u2019ani Castle, a 16th-century fortress overlooking the city, was repurposed by Russian troops as a military barracks.",
      "Nabu, the researcher, visited Palmyra five days after the fall of the former government.",
      "\u201cWe saw extensive excavation within the tombs,\u201d he said, noting significant destruction by both IS and Assad government forces. \u201cThe (Palmyra) museum was in a deplorable state, with missing documents and artifacts \u2014 we have no idea what happened to them.\u201d",
      "At the theater, the Tetrapylon, and other ruins along the main colonnaded street, Nabu said they documented many illegal drillings revealing sculptures, as well as theft and smuggling of funerary or tomb-related sculptures in 2015 when IS had control of the site. While seven of the stolen sculptures were retrieved and put in a museum in Idlib, 22 others were smuggled out, Nabu added. Many pieces likely ended up in underground markets or private collections.",
      "Inside the city\u2019s underground tombs, Islamic verses are scrawled on the walls, while plaster covers wall paintings, some depicting mythological themes that highlight Palmyra\u2019s deep cultural ties to the Greco-Roman world.",
      "\u201cSyria has a treasure of ruins,\u201d Nabu said, emphasizing the need for preservation efforts. He said Syria\u2019s interim administration, led by the Islamist former insurgent group Hayat Tahrir al-Sham, has decided to wait until after the transition phase to develop a strategic plan to restore heritage sites.",
      "The U.N.\u2019s scientific, educational and cultural organization UNESCO, said in a statement that the agency had since 2015, \u201cremotely supported the protection of Syrian cultural heritage\" through satellite analyses, reports and documentation and recommendations to local experts, but it did not conduct any work on site.",
      "It added that UNESCO has explored possibilities for technical assistance if security conditions improve. In 2019, international experts convened by UNESCO said detailed studies would need to be done before starting major restorations.",
      "Beyond Palmyra, other historical sites bear the scars of war.",
      "Perched on a hill near the town of Al-Husn, with sweeping views, Crac des Chevaliers, a medieval castle originally built by the Romans and later expanded by the Crusaders, was heavily bombarded during the Syrian civil war.",
      "On a recent day, armed fighters in military uniform roamed the castle grounds alongside local tourists, taking selfies among the ruins.",
      "Hazem Hanna, an architect and head of the antiquities department of Crac des Chevaliers, pointed to the collapsed columns and an entrance staircase obliterated by airstrikes. Damage from government airstrikes in 2014 destroyed much of the central courtyard and the arabesque-adorned columns, Hanna said.",
      "\u201cRelying on the cultural background of Syria\u2019s historical sites and their archaeological and historical significance to enthusiasts worldwide, I hope and expect that when the opportunity arises for tourists to visit Syria, we will witness a significant tourism revival,\" he said.",
      "Some sections of Crac des Chevaliers were renovated after airstrikes and the deadly 7.8 magnitude earthquake in 2023 that struck a wide area of neighboring Turkey and also Syria, Hanna said. However, much of the castle remains in ruins.",
      "Both Nabu and Hanna believe restoration will take time. \u201cWe need trained technical teams to evaluate the current condition of the ruin sites,\u201d Nabu said.",
      "In Northwest Syria, more than 700 abandoned Byzantine settlements called Dead Cities, stretch across rocky hills and plains, their weathered limestone ruins featuring remnants of stone houses, basilicas, tombs and colonnaded streets. Despite partial collapse, arched doorways, intricate carvings and towering church facades endure, surrounded by olive trees that root deep into history.",
      "Dating back to the first century, these villages once thrived on trade and agriculture. Today, some sites now shelter displaced Syrians, with stone houses repurposed as homes and barns, their walls blackened by fire and smoke. Crumbling structures suffer from poor maintenance and careless repurposing.",
      "Looters have ravaged the ancient sites, Nabu said, leaving gaping holes in search of artifacts. Local visitors carve names and messages into centuries-old walls. Sheep enclosures dot the ruins, plastic debris blending with ancient stone.",
      "Moustafa Al-Kaddour, a local resident, returned after eight years. Touring the ruins with family members he brought from Quneitra, he reflected on childhood memories.",
      "\u201cThis is where we went to school,\u201d he said, pointing in the distance. \u201cIn the middle of class, we used to leave and come here to see the ruins.\u201d",
      "\u201cMy feelings are indescribable,\u201d al-Kaddour, who also saw his father for the first time in years, told the AP. \u201cMy brain still cannot comprehend that after eight years, by God\u2019s will, we made it back home.\u201d",
      "He said the Assad forces had established a military position in the village, subjecting the ruins to heavy shelling and gunfire. The area was then controlled by rebels, who made the area off-limits to most Syrians and international tourists, unlike Palmyra, which still saw some visitors during the war.",
      "The Dead Cities were added to UNESCO\u2019s World Heritage List in 2011 as an open-air museum, said Nabu. Idlib province alone hosts \u201cover 1,000 heritage sites spanning different time periods \u2014 about a third of Syria\u2019s total ruins,\u201d he added.",
      "Beyond the bombings and air raids, looting and unauthorized digging have caused significant damage, Nabu said, adding that new construction near the ruins lacks planning and threatens preservation.",
      "\u201cTens of thousands\u201d of looted artifacts remain undocumented, he said. For those documented, authorities are compiling case files for international circulation in coordination with the Directorate of Antiquities and Museums to locate them and hopefully retrieve them.",

      "\u201cThere are no concerns that the U.S. would reduce the level of its presence in our country, that the U.S. would in any way withdraw from its responsibility or co-responsibility for the security of this part of Europe,\" Duda told reporters in Warsaw after a meeting with Gen. Keith Kellogg, the U.S. special envoy for Ukraine and Russia. \u201cOn the contrary, I hope that thanks to the efforts that President Trump is currently making, the war in Ukraine will end.\u201d",
      "\u201cI will say that in my personal opinion, America has entered the game very strongly when it comes to ending the war in Ukraine. I know President Donald Trump, I know that he is an extremely decisive man and when he acts, he acts in a very determined and usually effective way,\u201d Duda said.",
      "The U.S. deployed troops to Poland after Russia\u2019s annexation of Crimea in 2014, but increased the deployment and created a long-term presence there after Russia\u2019s full-scale invasion of Ukraine in 2022. There are now about 10,000 U.S. troops based in Poland.",
      "Duda said his assessment was based on conversations he had in recent days, both with Kellogg on Tuesday and with U.S. Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth, whom he hosted in Warsaw last week.",
      "Duda said Hegseth told him \u201cthat we can rather expect a strengthening of the American presence here. We even talked about the fact that I hope that Fort Trump, which we talked about during the first term of President Donald Trump, will really be established.\u201d",
      "Fort Trump was a Polish proposal for a permanent U.S. base in Poland, which Duda spoke of publicly during a visit to the White House in 2018. The base was never created.",
      "Polish officials hope to preserve the U.S. commitment to NATO and its longstanding commitment to security in the region, with fears of Russia growing.",
      "They are convinced that Warsaw's strong alliance with the U.S. and its high level of spending on defense will help its cause. They also hope that their position will allow it to advocate for Ukraine.",
      "\u201cWe have told both the Secretary of Defense and General Kellogg clearly and distinctly that it is obvious to us that this war cannot end in a victory for Russia,\u201d Duda said.",
      "He also sought to allay growing concerns in the population in light of shifting priorities under Trump.",
      "\u201cPlease don\u2019t be alarmed, the situation is under control,\u201d Duda said, words he said he was directing to Polish society. \u201cLet me assure you that everything is being done in a way that favors the building of peace in our region.\u201d"

      "Vatican authorities said Monday that Pope Francis has a complex infection in his respiratory system and will require more targeted drug treatment",
      "LONDON -- Vatican authorities said Monday that Pope Francis has a complex infection in his respiratory system and will require more targeted drug treatment. Officials said the 88-year-old pope is suffering from a \u201cpolymicrobial respiratory tract infection,\u201d but gave no further details on the severity of his illness or what would change in his treatment. Here\u2019s a look at the Pope\u2019s latest diagnosis and what his treatment could involve.",
      "Essentially, it means there\u2019s a mix of bacteria, viruses, fungi or parasites growing in someone\u2019s lungs.",
      "\u201cOften times, people will get a bronchitis or an airway infection and that can often start a cascade of multiple problems, including infections in the lungs,\u201d said Dr. Maor Sauler, who specializes in adult pulmonary and critical care medicine at Yale University's School of Medicine. He said such issues were common in older people whose immune systems might be weaker or had complex health issues.",
      "\u201cIt likely means he has more than one organism in his lungs,\u201d Sauler said, explaining that the pope\u2019s doctors might have to adjust his treatment to make sure the antibiotics attack all the various organisms.",
      "For someone with the pope\u2019s medical history \u2014 he lost part of his right lung decades ago and has previously had pneumonia \u2014 it\u2019s worrying that he\u2019s been hospitalized.",
      "Dr. Nick Hopkinson, medical director of Britain\u2019s Asthma and Lung Foundation, said most healthy people would likely recover quickly from bronchitis.",
      "But in people whose lungs are already damaged, \u201cbacteria can come and colonize the airways \u2026 and you start to see infections which makes it more difficult to treat.\u201d In people with lungs that have been previously compromised, they might need help breathing, including oxygen support or chest physiotherapy to help them clear fluids building up in their lungs.",
      "Still, Hopkinson said that getting the pope on the right medications should help.",
      "\u201cIf they\u2019ve identified particular things to treat, they can treat those and he\u2019ll start to recover.\u201d",
      "That depends. Antibiotic treatments typically take from a few days up to about two weeks. Hopkinson said the pope might be given various medicines, including ones that people typically take for asthma or conditions like chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, in addition to getting physiotherapy to help keep his chest as clear as possible.",
      "\u201cSome infections require prolonged treatment because they\u2019re just harder to clear from the system,\u201d Hopkinson said. \u201cIt sounds like they\u2019ve identified the bugs that are responsible and they\u2019ll be able to treat those\u2026but we\u2019ll just have to wait and see.\u201d",
      "Dr. Peter Openshaw, a lung expert at Imperial College London, said the presence of multiple organisms wasn\u2019t unusual in people with complex medical histories but could be hard to manage.",
      "Pneumonia is a likely worry.",
      "\u201cEven though we can treat pneumonias with antibiotics, pneumonias are also one of the leading causes of death,\u201d said Sauler of Yale University. He said antibiotics don\u2019t work in isolation and that a person\u2019s immune system is also critical to fighting off pneumonia, pointing out that the immune systems in older people aren\u2019t usually as resilient.",
      "\u201cWhen you\u2019re 88 years old, the age of the pope, then all of a sudden you have risk factors that makes the situation tougher than just a routine pneumonia.\u201d",
      "Sauler said the biggest thing to watch out for in the coming days is any sign that the pope is getting worse.",
      "\u201cI\u2019d be most interested in making sure he\u2019s not worsening despite the best efforts (of his doctors). That\u2019s usually a bad prognostic sign,\u201d he said, adding that they would likely review his condition in a few days to see whether or not the prescribed drugs are working.",
      "\u201cI have optimism and hope that he can pull through with the right antibiotic.\u201d",

He claimed that a leading opposition lawmaker suggested that some of the evidence of Khmer Rouge atrocities was fabricated by Vietnam. That law prescribed prison terms of six months to two years and fines of up to $1,000.",

      "The latest National Assembly statement said the draft law is designed to punish individuals who do not recognize, or deny or object to the recognition of crimes that were proven in legal proceedings held by a U.N.-backed tribunal to have been committed under the Khmer Rouge.",
      "The tribunal, which held a series of trials starting in 2009, found that the Khmer Rouge government committed genocide, crimes against humanity and grave breaches of the 1949 Geneva Conventions, in addition to severe violations of Cambodian criminal law, international humanitarian law and various international conventions recognized by Cambodia.",

      "The Khmer Rouge, under the leadership of the late Pol Pot, stayed in power until 1979 when it was ousted by an invasion from neighboring Vietnam. Its radical policies while in power are thought to have been responsible for an estimated 1.7 million deaths from starvation, execution, and illness.",

      "WARSAW, Poland -- Prosecutors in Poland said Tuesday they are considering whether to open a criminal investigation into an open-air exhibition in 2022 of damaged Russian military vehicles after one of them was found to contain live explosives.",
      "The exhibits \u2014 a damaged T-72 tank, a self-propelled howitzer and elements of Russian missile systems \u2014 were brought to Poland from the battlefields in Ukraine a few months after the full-scale Russian invasion in February 2022.",
      "Live grenades and ammunition were found inside one of the exhibits during stocktaking and had apparently been there ever since their battles in Ukraine. Since the exhibition, the military vehicles have been held in secure storage.",
      "The vehicles were brought to Poland by the previous government, which was voted out at the end of 2023. The stocktaking was ordered by the new management of the Government Agency of Strategic Reserves appointed by the current government.",

It was shown in Warsaw, Poznan, Gdansk and during a military equipment fair in Kielce. There were plans to show it in Brussels.",
      "The prosecutors are also checking allegations that under the previous management the agency wrongly spent some 700 million zlotys ($176 million) on having the vehicles transported across Poland, while transport is not within its mandate."

      "JERUSALEM -- Israel's military says its forces will remain in five strategic locations in southern Lebanon after Tuesday's deadline for their withdrawal under a ceasefire with the Hezbollah militant group, as Lebanon\u2019s government expressed frustration over another delay.",
      "A separate ceasefire in Gaza was also in doubt as the region marked 500 days of Israel's war with Hamas, while Israel and the United States send conflicting signals over whether they want the truce to continue. Talks on the ceasefire's second phase are yet to start.",
      "Military spokesperson Lt. Col. Nadav Shoshani said the five locations in Lebanon provide vantage points or are located across from communities in northern Israel, where about 60,000 Israelis are still displaced. He said the \u201ctemporary measure\u201d was approved by the U.S.-led body monitoring the truce, which earlier was extended by three weeks.",
      "Under the agreement, Israeli forces should withdraw from a buffer zone in southern Lebanon that would be patrolled by the Lebanese army and U.N. peacekeepers. The ceasefire has held since taking effect in November.",
      "Israel is committed to a withdrawal in \u201cthe right way, in a gradual way, and in a way that the security of our civilians is kept,\u201d Shoshani told reporters.",
      "Lebanese President Joseph Aoun told reporters the ceasefire \u201cmust be respected,\u201d saying \u201cthe Israeli enemy cannot be trusted.\u201d He said Lebanese officials were working diplomatically to achieve the Israeli withdrawal, \"and I will not accept that a single Israeli remains on Lebanese territory.\u201d",
      "Hezbollah began firing rockets, drones and missiles into Israel the day after Hamas\u2019 Oct. 7, 2023, attack out of Gaza ignited the war there. The Israel-Hezbollah conflict boiled over into all-out war in September as Israel carried out massive waves of airstrikes and killed most of the militant group\u2019s senior leaders.",
      "Earlier on Monday, an Israeli drone targeted a car in Lebanon\u2019s southern port city of Sidon, the deepest strike inside Lebanese territory since the ceasefire took effect. Israel said it targeted Muhammad Shaheen, the head of Hamas\u2019 operations in Lebanon. AP video there showed a charred vehicle.",
      "\u201cNow the fear has come back to people,\" said Ahmed Sleim, a Sidon resident, who worried about a return to war.",
      "Israelis held protests across the country calling for the Gaza ceasefire to be extended so that more hostages abducted in the Oct. 7 attack can be freed.",
      "The ceasefire's first phase ends in less than two weeks, and negotiations on the more difficult second phase \u2014 which would release more hostages and see the withdrawal of Israeli forces from Gaza \u2014 should have started two weeks ago.",
      "\u201cAll I care about, all I want, is for my friends to return. There were six of us living in unbearable conditions\" Ohad Ben Ami, a hostage released a week and a half ago, told Israeli President Isaac Herzog. Families have wept as they described hungry loved ones barefoot or in chains.",
      "Hamas is gradually releasing 33 hostages in the current phase in exchange for nearly 2,000 Palestinian prisoners. Israeli forces have pulled back from most parts of Gaza and allowed a surge of humanitarian aid.",
      "In the second phase, Hamas would release over 70 remaining hostages \u2014 around half believed to be dead \u2014 in exchange for more Palestinian prisoners and a lasting ceasefire.",
      "Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and U.S. President Donald Trump 's administration say they are committed to the eradication of Hamas and the return of all hostages. Those goals are widely seen as incompatible.",
      "The militant group, though weakened, remains in control of Gaza. Hamas has said it is willing to relinquish power to other Palestinians but will not accept any occupying force.",
      "Now Trump has called for Gaza\u2019s population of over 2 million to be permanently relocated to other countries and for the United States to take ownership of the territory. Israel has welcomed the plan, while Palestinians and Arab nations have rejected it. Rights groups and experts say the proposal, if implemented, would likely violate international law.",
      "Hamas-led militants in their Oct. 7 attack killed some 1,200 people, mostly civilians, and abducted around 250. More than half of the hostages have been returned, while eight have been rescued in military operations.",
      "Israel's air and ground war has killed over 48,000 Palestinians, more than half of them women and children, according to Gaza's Health Ministry, which does not say how many were combatants. The war destroyed vast areas of Gaza and at its height had displaced around 90% of the population.",
      "\u201cEverything is destroyed, nothing is left in Gaza, Gaza is not fit for life,\u201d one resident, Mohammed Barash, said while reflecting on 500 days of war.",
      "A watchdog opposed to Jewish settlements on Palestinian territory said Israel has issued a tender for the construction of nearly 1,000 additional settler homes in the occupied West Bank.",
      "The anti-settlement group Peace Now said the 974 new settler housing units would allow the population of the Efrat settlement to expand by 40% and further block the development of the nearby Palestinian city of Bethlehem.",
      "Hagit Ofran, who leads the group\u2019s settlement monitoring, said construction can begin after the contracting process and issuing of permits, which could take another year at least.",
      "There was no immediate Israeli government comment.",
      "Israel has built well over 100 settlements across the West Bank, ranging from hilltop outposts to fully developed suburban communities. Over 500,000 settlers live in the West Bank, home to about 3 million Palestinians.",
      "The settlers have Israeli citizenship. Palestinians live under military rule, with the Western-backed Palestinian Authority administering population centers.",
      "Israel captured the West Bank, along with the Gaza Strip and east Jerusalem, in the 1967 Mideast war. The Palestinians want them for their future state and view the settlements as a major obstacle to peace, a position with wide international support.",

      "President Claudia Sheinbaum shared a letter addressed to her government from Cris Turner, Google\u2019s vice president of government affairs and public policy.

      "\u201cWe will wait for Google\u2019s response and if not, we will proceed to court,\u201d Sheinbaum said Monday during a morning press briefing.",
      "As it stands, the gulf appears in Google Maps as Gulf of America within the United States, as Gulf of Mexico within Mexico and Gulf of Mexico (Gulf of America) elsewhere. Turner in his letter said the company was using Gulf of America to follow \u201clongstanding maps policies impartially and consistently across all regions\" and that the company was willing to meet in person with the Mexican government.",
      "\u201cWhile international treaties and conventions are not intended to regulate how private mapping providers represent geographic features, it is our consistent policy to consult multiple authoritative sources to provide the most up to date and accurate representation of the world,\" he wrote.",
      "Mexico has argued that the mapping policy violates Mexican sovereignty because the U.S. only has jurisdiction over around 46% of the Gulf. The rest is controlled by Mexico, which controls 49% and Cuba, which controls around 5%. The name Gulf of Mexico dates back to 1607 and is recognized by the United Nations.",
      "In response to Google's letter, Mexican authorities said they would take legal action, writing that \u201cunder no circumstance will Mexico accept the renaming of a geographic zone within its own territory and under its jurisdiction.\"",
      "The renaming of the body of water by Trump has flared tensions between Mexico and the U.S. at a pivotal time for the neighboring allies.",
      "Sheinbaum has had to walk a fine line with Trump amid threats of tariffs and Mexico and other Latin American countries have braced themselves for promised mass deportations, the brunt of which has still not been felt.",
      "Along with the legal threat to Google, the Mexican president also announced Monday that Mexico and the U.S. would hold high-level meetings this week on trade and security in an effort to maintain a \u201clong-term plan of collaboration\" between the two countries.",
      "It's the latest round of talks between the two countries in which Mexico hopes to hold off a larger geopolitical crisis.",
      "The renaming of the water body has fueled strife within the U.S. as well.",
      "Last week, the White House barred Associated Press reporters from several events, including some in the Oval Office, saying it was because of the news agency\u2019s policy on the name. The AP is using Gulf of Mexico to ensure that names of geographical features are recognizable around the world but also acknowledging Trump\u2019s renaming of it as well.",
      "Other journalistic organizations such as the White House Correspondents' Organization and the New York Times have echoed the AP in raising alarm about press freedom violations.",

      "Egypt is developing a plan to rebuild Gaza without forcing Palestinians out of the strip in a counter to President Donald Trump\u2019s proposal to depopulate the territory so the U.S. can take it over",
      "CAIRO -- Egypt is developing a plan to rebuild Gaza without forcing Palestinians out of the strip in a counter to President Donald Trump\u2019s proposal to depopulate the territory so the U.S. can take it over.",
      "Egypt\u2019s state-run Al-Ahram newspaper said the proposal calls for establishing \u201csecure areas\u201d within Gaza where Palestinians can live initially while Egyptian and international construction firms remove and rehabilitate the strip\u2019s infrastructure.",
      "Egyptian officials have been discussing the plan with European diplomats as well as with Saudi Arabia, Qatar and the United Arab Emirates, according to two Egyptian officials and Arab and Western diplomats. They are also discussing ways to fund the reconstruction, including an international conference on Gaza reconstruction, said one of the Egyptian officials and an Arab diplomat.",
      "The officials and diplomats spoke on condition of anonymity because the proposal is still being negotiated.",
      "The proposal comes after an international uproar over Trump\u2019s call for the removal of Gaza\u2019s population of some 2 million Palestinians. Trump said the United States would take over the Gaza Strip and rebuild it into a \u201cRiviera of the Middle East,\u201d though Palestinians would not be allowed back.",
      "Palestinians have widely said they will not leave their homeland, while Egypt, Jordan \u2013 backed by Saudi Arabia \u2013 have refused Trump\u2019s calls for them to take in Gaza\u2019s population. Rights groups have widely said the plan amounts to forced expulsion, a potential war crime. European countries have also largely denounced Trump\u2019s plan. Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu has praised the idea and says Israel is preparing to implement it.",
      "U.S. Secretary of State Marco Rubio, who was in Saudi Arabia on Monday in a tour of the region, has said the United States was up to hearing alternative proposals. \u201cIf the Arab countries have a better plan, then that\u2019s great,\u201d Rubio said Thursday on the U.S. radio program \u201cClay and Buck Show.\u201d",
      "Egypt\u2019s Al-Ahram newspaper said the proposal is designed to \u201crefute American President Trump\u2019s logic\u201d and counter \u201cany other visions or plans that aim to change the geographic and demographic structure of Gaza Strip.\u201d",
      "Gaza is nearing a critical juncture with the first phase of a ceasefire due to run out in early March. Israel and Hamas must still negotiate a second phase meant to bring a release of all remaining hostages held by the militants, a full Israeli withdrawal from Gaza and a long-term halt to the war.",
      "Any reconstruction plan will be impossible to implement without a deal on the second phase, including an agreement on who will govern Gaza in the long term. Israel demands the elimination of Hamas as a political or military force in the territory, and international donors are unlikely to contribute to any rebuilding if Hamas is in charge.",
      "Central in Egypt\u2019s proposal is the establishment of a Palestinian administration that is not aligned with either Hamas or the Palestinian Authority to run the strip and oversee the reconstruction efforts, according to the two Egyptian officials involved in the efforts.",
      "It also calls for a Palestinian police force mainly made up of former Palestinian Authority policemen who remained in Gaza after Hamas took over the enclave in 2007, with reinforcement from Egyptian- and Western-trained forces.",
      "Asked about the possibility of deploying an Arab force in Gaza one Egyptian official and the Arab diplomat said Arab countries would only agree if there were a \u201cclear path\u201d for the establishment of an independent Palestinian state. Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu has rejected any Palestinian state as well as any role for Hamas or the Western-backed Palestinian Authority in governing Gaza, though he has not put forward any clear alternative.",
      "Hamas has said it is willing to give up power in Gaza. Hamas spokesman Abdul Latif al-Qanou told The Associated Press on Sunday that the group has accepted either a Palestinian unity government without Hamas\u2019 participation or a committee of technocrats to run the territory. The Palestinian Authority, which governs pockets of the West Bank, has so far opposed any plans for Gaza that exclude it.",
      "The Western diplomat said France and Germany have backed the idea of Arab countries developing a counterproposal to Trump\u2019s plan, and that Egyptian President Abdel Fattah el-Sissi discussed his government's efforts with the French president in a phone call earlier this month.",
      "Egyptian Foreign Minister Badr Abdelatty also briefed the German foreign minister and other EU officials on the sidelines of last week\u2019s Munich security conference, one of the Egyptian officials said.",
      "Officials from Egypt, Saudi Arabia, Qatar, the United Arab Emirates and Jordan will discuss Egypt\u2019s proposal at a gathering in Riyadh this week, before introducing it to the Arab summit later this month, according to the two Egyptian officials and the Arab diplomat.",
      "Isarel\u2019s 16-month campaign in Gaza, triggered by Hamas\u2019 Oct. 7, 2023 attack, devastated the territory. Around a quarter million housing units have been destroyed or damaged, according to U.N. estimates. More than 90% of the roads and more than 80% of health facilities have been damaged or destroyed. Damage to infrastructure has been estimated at some $30 billion, along with an estimated $16 billion in damaged to housing.",
      "Egypt\u2019s plan calls for a three-phase reconstruction process that will take up to five years without removing Palestinians from Gaza, the Egyptian officials said.",
      "It designates three \u201csafe zones\u201d within Gaza to relocate Palestinians during an initial six-month \u201cearly recovery period.\u201d The zones will be equipped with mobile houses and shelters, with humanitarian aid streaming in.",
      "More than two dozen Egyptian and international firms would take part in removing the rubble and rebuilding the strip\u2019s infrastructure. The reconstruction would provide tens of thousands of jobs to Gaza\u2019s population, the officials said."

      "MANILA, Philippines -- Former Philippine President Rodrigo Duterte is facing a criminal complaint Monday over comments he made during a campaign rally when he said 15 senators should be killed in a bomb attack to allow more vacant seats for his political party\u2019s candidates to contest.",
      "The alleged illegal utterances and inciting to sedition were contained in a complaint filed by police Maj. Gen. Nicolas Torre III to the Department of Justice. They are the latest legal trouble to face the former president and his family under President Ferdinand Marcos Jr.",
      "Campaigning is underway for half of the 24 Senate seats for the May 12 mid-term elections in the Philippines. The former president\u2019s camp said his remarks were just a joke uttered to liven up a political rally on Thursday for the nine senatorial candidates of his PDP-Laban party.",
      "\u201cLet\u2019s kill senators now so there will be vacancies,\u201d Duterte said at the proclamation rally of his party\u2019s senatorial candidates. \u201cIf we can kill about 15 senators, we\u2019re in...the only way to do it is, let\u2019s just stage an explosion.\u201d",
      "Torre said the tumultuous era during Duterte\u2019s six-year presidency, when he could just publicly threaten to kill anybody, was over.",
      "\u201cOur country went through a lot of troubles in those past six years,\u201d Torre told reporters. \u201cDo we want those troubles to continue, the constant threats of killings that they will dismiss later by just saying that these were just a joke?\u201d",
      "The danger with such remarks, Torre added, was that followers may take Duterte\u2019s remarks seriously and carry them out.",
      "Duterte's daughter, Vice President Sara Duterte, is facing an impeachment trial partly for publicly threatening to have Marcos, his wife and House Speaker Martin Romualdez assassinated if she herself were fatally attacked amid an escalating political rivalry between the two highest leaders of one of Asia\u2019s most unwieldy democracies.",
      "The vice president has denied that her remarks in an online news conference in November amounted to a threat to kill Marcos although that was what she literally said.",
      "The International Criminal Court has been investigating the large number of killings that happened under the former president\u2019s crackdowns against illegal drugs, which left thousands of mostly poor suspect dead, as a possible crime against humanity.",
      "Duterte has denied he authorized extrajudicial killings under his anti-drugs crackdowns while he was in office, but he has openly and repeatedly threatened to kill suspected drug dealers while in power.",

      "MELBOURNE, Australia -- Australia\u2019s central bank on Tuesday reduced its benchmark interest rate for the first time since October 2020 as the nation\u2019s inflation cools.",
      "The Reserve Bank of Australia reduced the cash rate by a quarter percentage point from 4.35% to 4.1% at its first board meeting for the year.",
      "The cut was widely anticipated after inflation rose only 0.2% in the December quarter and 2.4% for calendar 2024. Annual inflation peaked at 7.8% two years earlier.",
      "The bank manipulates interest rates to keep inflation within a target band of between 2% and 3%.",
      "\u201cInflation has fallen substantially since the peak in 2022, as higher interest rates have been working to bring aggregate demand and supply closer towards balance,\u201d the board said in a statement.",
      "Bank Governor Michele Bullock later advised against believing economic forecasts that several more rate cuts were expected this year. The board will next consider changing interest rates at its meeting on April 1.",
      "\u201cSome other central banks have cut interest rates quite sharply over the past year, but we have taken a different strategy to most,\u201d Bullock told reporters.",
      "\u201cOur policy rate was not raised as much as many countries overseas. We judged that while inflation expectations remained anchored, we could take a bit longer to bring inflation back to the target band, but we could keep unemployment lower,\u201d she added.",
      "Unemployment in Australia remained at near-record low levels of 4% in December, up from 3.9% in November.",
      "Bullock said U.S. plans to increase tariffs on trading partners had the potential to be bad for economic activity around the world.",
      "\u201cThe tariff threats and what\u2019s going on overseas is very uncertain and probably even worse, it\u2019s unpredictable,\u201d Bullock said.",
      "The rate shift is a welcome development for Prime Minister Anthony Albanese\u2019s center-left Labor Party government which will seek reelection at elections due by May 17.",
      "Treasurer Jim Chalmers welcomed the independent board's decision.",
      "\u201cThis is the rate relief Australians need and deserve,\u201d Chalmers said in a statement. \u201cIt won't solve every problem in our economy or in household budgets but it will help.\"",
      "Chalmers said his government had curbed inflation without the negative consequences experienced in other countries including of high unemployment, a shrinking economy and recession.",
      "Twelve of the last 13 rate increases have taken place since the government was elected for its first three-year term on May 21, 2022.",
      "The cycle began in the final days of the previous government\u2019s tenure when the rate rose from a record low 0.1% to 0.35% on May 4, 2022.",
      "The high cost of living and a shortage of housing around Australia are expected to be major issues in the upcoming election campaign.",
      "The central bank had held the cash rate at 4.35% since November 2023. That was the highest rate since it fell from 4.5% to 4.25% in December 2011."

      "A judge has approved an emergency plan to keep Britain\u2019s largest water company afloat and averted a possible temporary government takeover",
      "LONDON -- A judge approved an emergency plan Tuesday to keep Britain\u2019s largest water company afloat, averting the possibility of a temporary government takeover.",
      "Thames Water, which serves 16 million customers in and around London, was seeking court approval for about 3 billion pounds ($3.8 billion) in rescue loans to prevent it from being nationalized when it runs out of cash next month.",
      "Justice Thomas Leech ruled in the High Court in London that the company's restructuring proposal was a better alternative for the public than having Thames Water become insolvent and come under government administration, or a competing plan by a small group of investors.",
      "\u201cThere is a public policy in favor of rescuing the Thames Water Group and giving the market a chance to agree a permanent restructuring plan before the government is forced to fund a special administrator,\" Leech said.",
      "Leech gave permission to appeal to the smaller group of creditors who had proposed a plan that they said would be cheaper and a member of Parliament pushing for a government takeover.",
      "Without the funding, Thames Water would run out of money next month, which could force the government to temporarily take the reins. Both the government and Thames Water said water would continue flowing to customers regardless of what happens.",
      "The decision was applauded by Thames Water Chairman Adrian Montague as a \u201csignificant milestone\u201d to strengthen the company's finances.",
      "Thames Water has been the focus of criticism from consumers and politicians who say the company was the author of its own misfortune, paying overly generous dividends to investors and high salaries and bonuses to executives while failing to invest in pipelines, pumps and reservoirs.",
      "Company executives say the fault lies with regulators who kept bills too low for too long, starving the company of the cash it needed to fund improvements.",
      "Thames Water and the industry that manages water and wastewater services have been the subject of nationwide disgust and outrage over rampant sewage spills in rivers and along the coast.",
      "\u201cThis national scandal is a disaster for Thames Water billpayers and the environment,\" said Charles Watson, chairman of River Action, an environmental group. \u201cInstead of recognizing now is the time for a special administration of Thames Water, the decision saddles customers with the responsibility for funding billions of junk-rated debt while its executives, investors and shareholders escape responsibility.\"",
      "Ofwat, which regulates water companies in England and Wales, in December approved a 35% increase in Thames Water\u2019s consumer charges over the next five years. The company argued that bills needed to rise by 53% in order to finance needed projects and provide the financial returns necessary to attract investors.",
      "The company faces massive penalties for sewage discharges, including a fine of more than 100 million pounds ($126 million) by Ofwat in August for failing to manage its wastewater treatment.",
      "Leech had been considering competing proposals to provide credit to the cash-strapped utility \u2014 one from Thames Water and a second supported by a smaller group that claimed the company's plan was too expensive and favored bigger investors. Creditors holding most of the company\u2019s debt backed the company deal.",
      "Critics of the plan said the high interest rate \u2014 9.75% \u2014 would enrich creditors who are making the loans, a point noted by the judge.",
      "\u201cThe costs of finance and adviser fees in the present case are very high. Indeed, they might be described as eye-watering,\u201d Leech said. \u201c50% of the scheduled loans go round in a circle and back into the pockets of the plan creditors.\u201d",
      "Still, Leech said the alternative of government administration, which he said was preferable to the so-called Plan B, wasn't as attractive as the company plan.",
      "Charlie Maynard, a member of Parliament from the Liberal Democrat party who had argued in court for the government takeover, said he planned to appeal the ruling, insisting that the short-term bailout wasn't in the long-term interest.",
      "\u201cThis restructuring is simply throwing good money after bad,\" Maynard said. \u201cThe money from our bills which is being spent on interest repayments is desperately needed to repair water infrastructure, improve customer service and clean up our rivers.\u201d"

      "President Donald Trump's billionaire top lieutenant, Elon Musk, is the focus for thousands of Democratic activists launching a massive protest campaign this week",
      "NEW YORK -- NEW YORK (AP) \u2014 Donald Trump is the president, but billionaire Elon Musk is the focus for thousands of Democratic activists launching a protest campaign this week to fight the Trump administration's push to gut federal health, education and human services agencies.",
      "Hundreds of protests are scheduled outside congressional offices and Tesla dealerships, with organizers hoping to send a pointed message to members of Congress who are on recess this week.",
      "The backlash still hasn't approached the intensity of protests during and after Trump's first inauguration eight years ago. But a loose coalition of Democrats and progressives is coalescing around Musk's rise as Trump's top lieutenant and his purge of the federal bureaucracy.",
      "\u201cHe\u2019s a major weak link in the MAGA coalition,\u201d Ezra Levin, co-founder of the progressive group Indivisible, said of Musk. \u201cI can\u2019t think of something that polls worse than the richest man in the world is coming after your Social Security check or your Meals on Wheels or your Head Start.\u201d",
      "Indivisible, which claims more than 1,300 local chapters nationwide, is encouraging members to protest at the offices of their members of Congress, regardless of political party. The group also offered a step-by-step guide for protesting at dealerships for Tesla, Musk's electric vehicle company.",
      "The memo encourages protesters to stay on sidewalks and public spaces and to avoid any actions that might directly interfere with business operations, such as blocking entrances or trespassing on private property. It also calls for Tesla protesters to stay on message: \u201cThis is about Musk\u2019s political takeover, not Tesla, SpaceX, or X as companies.\u201d",
      "Vermont Sen. Bernie Sanders is launching what he\u2019s calling \u201ca national tour to fight oligarchy\u201d with stops in working-class districts of Iowa and Nebraska this week.",
      "Democratic National Committee Chair Ken Martin will hit the road for the first time as party leader as well. The newly elected DNC chair will travel to Pennsylvania, Texas, Illinois, Wisconsin and Missouri in the coming days to meet with local Democratic officials and labor leaders, spokesperson Hannah Muldavin said.",
      "Like the protesters, Martin is expected to seize on Musk\u2019s role. During a meeting with labor leaders in Pittsburgh, for example, he plans to highlight Musk\u2019s recent focus on the Department of Labor, which could put \u201cthe integrity of data like the unemployment rate and inflation rate at risk, which is important for a stable U.S. economy and, by extension, working people,\u201d Muldavin said.",
      "Aware of the intense displeasure from their party\u2019s base, many House Democrats plan to be proactive.",
      "The House Democratic Policy and Communications Committee issued a memo ahead of the recess instructing Democrats to embrace \u201cnine days of visibility\u201d and said it was essential for members to host one town hall, in-person or via telephone, and at least one community event that highlights the \"devastating impacts\u201d of Trump and Musk\u2019s actions.",
      "The wave of protests comes at a critical moment as fractured Democrats struggle to stop the Republican president\u2019s purge of the federal bureaucracy, which features thousands of layoffs inside departments focused on public health, education, veterans affairs and human services, among others.",
      "Firings in recent days at the Department of Veterans Affairs include researchers working on cancer treatment, opioid addiction, prosthetics and burn pit exposure, according to U.S. Sen. Patty Murray, a Democrat from Washington state. The cuts also include more than 5,000 employees at the Department of Health and Human Services and roughly one-tenth of the workforce at the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.",
      "In some cases, Musk\u2019s team is trying \u2014 with Trump's blessing but without congressional approval \u2014 to shutter entire agencies, including the U.S. Agency for International Development, the Department of Education and the U.S. Consumer Financial Protection Bureau.",
      "Trump has defended the cuts as necessary to eliminate waste and fraud. And he has praised Musk\u2019s work with his Department of Government Efficiency, or DOGE, saying it has found \u201cshocking\u201d evidence of wasteful spending. He signed an executive order expanding Musk\u2019s influence.",
      "Musk, meanwhile, has defended the swift and extensive cuts he\u2019s pushing across the federal government while acknowledging there have been mistakes.",
      "Democrats in Congress condemn the moves as dangerous, but without control of either chamber of Congress, there is little they can do to stop the Trump administration aside from turning to the courts. Still, three of the nation's largest progressive groups \u2014 Indivisible, MoveOn and the Working Families Party \u2014 are coordinating this week's protests to send a clear message to elected officials in both major political parties that they must do more.",
      "Still, Democratic members of Congress may face their own voters' fury.",
      "MoveOn, which boasts a membership of nearly 10 million, is hosting dozens of rallies outside town halls and congressional offices for those members who do not host public events. The group will focus on \u201cpersuadable House Republicans whose votes will be crucial to opposing the Trump-Musk agenda,\u201d according to a preview of its recess week plan. But there will also be rallies targeting House Democratic Leader Hakeem Jeffries and Senate Democratic Leader Chuck Schumer, both of New York, among other Democrats.",
      "\u201cWe are seeing a true resurgence in energy opposing what Trump, Musk and Republicans are doing to our country,\u201d MoveOn executive director Rahna Epting said, adding that \u201cpeople are mad as hell.\u201d",
      "The Working Families Party is focusing protests in the districts of vulnerable Republicans in states such as California, New Jersey, New York, Pennsylvania and Wisconsin. The actions will feature people directly impacted by the Trump administration's cuts, including special education teachers, nurses and Head Start workers, according to Working Families spokesman Ravi Mangla.",

      "Efforts to shut down online scam centers in Myanmar appear to gain momentum with a visit by a top Chinese official to the border zone ahead of expected large-scale repatriations of workers in the illicit industry",
      "BANGKOK -- Efforts to shut down online scam centers in Myanmar appeared to gain momentum on Monday as a top Chinese security official visited both sides of the Thai-Myanmar border ahead of expected large-scale repatriations of workers in the illicit industry.",
      "The visit by Liu Zhongyi, China\u2019s vice minister of public security and commissioner of the Criminal Investigation Bureau, was part of a stepped-up effort by the three countries to address the online scam problem, Thailand\u2019s Deputy Prime Minister Phumtham Wechayachai told reporters.",
      "Areas of Myanmar bordering Thailand have been serving as havens for criminal syndicates employing an estimated hundreds of thousands of people from Southeast Asia and elsewhere who help carry out online scams including false romantic ploys, bogus investment pitches and illegal gambling schemes.",
      "Such scams have cost victims around the world tens of billions of dollars, while the people recruited to carry them out have often been tricked into taking the jobs under false pretenses and find themselves trapped in virtual slavery.",
      "Last week, some 260 people from 20 nations, including many from Africa, crossed from Myanmar into Thailand after they were reportedly rescued from scam centers.",
      "On a visit to China in early February, Thai Prime Minister Paetongtarn Shinawatra vowed along with China\u2019s leader Xi Jinping to crack down on the scam networks. Just ahead of her visit, Thailand cut off electricity, internet and gas supplies to several areas in Myanmar along the border, citing national security and severe damage that Thailand has suffered from scam operations.",
      "The repatriations of foreign workers from Myanmar have been organized by the Border Guard Force in Myawaddy, a militia of the Karen ethnic minority that exercises control over the area. However, critics have accused it of being involved in the criminal activities, at least to the extent of providing protection to the scam centers.",
      "The group's leader, Saw Chit Thu, denied in a news conference on Monday that his group was involved in scam activities, but acknowledged business links to some properties hosting the centers, which he said initially operated simply as resorts.",
      "Thai media reported last week that Thailand's Department of Special Investigation was considering seeking arrest warrants for Chit Thu and others for alleged human trafficking.",
      "Thai officials have said as many as 7,000-10,000 more people may be repatriated, but Phumtham cautioned that Thailand would only receive those that are ready to be taken back right away by their home countries.",
      "The Bangkok Post newspaper reported that an initial batch of about 600 Chinese nationals from scam centers are expected to be flown back to China on chartered flights when Liu concludes his visit.",
      "Liu visited the border areas in Thailand\u2019s Tak province on Monday and appeared in Myawaddy in Myanmar, apparently at a location where hundreds of people believed to have been rounded up from several scam centers are being held awaiting repatriation.",
      "Video of Liu\u2019s visit showed hundreds of people there sitting on the ground with their belongings in a large open-walled hall.",
      "\u201c China is actively conducting bilateral and multilateral cooperation with Thailand, Myanmar, and other countries, taking comprehensive measures to address both the symptoms and root causes, and working together to block criminals from committing crimes in relevant countries,\u201d Chinese Foreign Ministry spokesperson Guo Jiakun said in Beijing.",
      "\u201cThis is part of our joint efforts to eradicate the scourge of online gambling and telecom fraud, and to maintain the safety of people\u2019s lives and property and the order of exchanges and cooperation among regional countries.\u201d",
      "Dramatic stories of Chinese people being lured to work in Thailand only to be trafficked into a scam compound in Myanmar spread widely on social media in China, causing alarm and denting Thailand's reputation as a safe destination for Chinese visitors.",
      "Among those trapped was Chinese actor Wang Xing, who arrived in Thailand on a promise of getting a job and was abducted to Myanmar. He was quickly rescued after the incident circulated on social media.",
      "An earlier crackdown on scam centers in Myanmar was initiated in late 2023, after China expressed embarrassment and concern over illegal casinos and scam operations along its border in Myanmar\u2019s northern Shan state.",
      "Ethnic guerrilla groups with close ties to Beijing shut down many operations, and an estimated 45,000 Chinese nationals suspected of involvement were repatriated."

      "Once a skeptic of cryptocurrencies, Trump has made a complete reversal and embraced digital currencies in a way no other elected official has done. He\u2019s promised to enact crypto-friendly policies and make the U.S. \u201cthe world capital\u201d of digital assets.",
      "He\u2019s also attached the Trump name to a crypto token and other crypto-themed products. The cryptocurrency industry, which spent heavily to help Trump win last year\u2019s election, has expressed mixed feelings about some of his crypto ventures.",
      "Critics have said the ventures are ripe for abuse by people seeking Trump\u2019s influence. Trump put his investments and assets in a trust managed by his children and has pledged not to play any role in managing his companies while president.",
      "Here\u2019s a by-the-numbers look at Trump\u2019s crypto ties:",
      "That\u2019s how much a watch company is charging for a new \u201cCrypto President Tourbillon\u201d watch from the Trump-themed online watch store, which pays a licensing fee for using the Trump name. Trump has a long history of melding his political and business interests. He first promoted Trump watches in September of last year. The online store has recently started selling crypto-themed watches at various price levels.",
      "The gettrumpwatches.com website says only 10 \u201cCrypto President Tourbillon\u201d watches will be made, and payments are only accepted in bitcoin. For their $100,000, buyers receive a watch with 229 \u201cbitcoin orange sapphires\u201d and a signed letter of authenticity from Trump.",

      "That\u2019s roughly how much market cap, or overall value, of the president's meme coin has been erased since it peaked at about $15 billion on Jan. 19, two days after it was launched and a day before Trump took office.",
      "Some in the crypto industry hailed the launch of Trump\u2019s meme coin, which was quickly followed by the launch of First Lady Melania Trump\u2019s meme coin, as a sign of his enthusiasm and commitment to digital assets.",
      "Critics said it reflected poorly on the crypto industry\u2019s reputation at a time when it is hoping to become more mainstream. Meme coins are a strange and highly volatile corner of the crypto industry that often start as a joke with no real value but can surge in price if enough people are willing to buy them.",
      "That\u2019s the price for a new pair of crypto-themed sneakers sold by another website that pays a licensing fee to sell Trump-themed products, which the president has promoted. The low-top orange shoes are set to start shipping in April, with a planned limited run of just 400 pairs.",
      "That\u2019s how much Chinese crypto mogul Justin Sun has said his company has invested in World Liberty Financial, a decentralized finance cryptocurrency platform that Trump and his sons helped launch last year. Sun founded the decentralized blockchain platform TRON and is also known for his recent purchase of a banana for $6.2 million.",
      "Sun and his companies were sued by the SEC in 2023 for allegedly artificially inflating the price of TRON, and the U.S. has also accused his company of facilitating transfers tied to groups designated as terrorist organizations. World Liberty Financial announced it had bought $4.7 million of TRON\u2019s token, TRX, on Inauguration Day.",
      "That\u2019s how much the parent company of Trump\u2019s Truth Social has said it will spend on new investment products and decentralized finance services that could include buying bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies.",
      "Truth Social just applied to trademark \u201cTruth.fi Bitcoin Plus ETF\u201d and \u201cTruth.fi Bitcoin Plus SMA,\u201d a sign they plan to launch crypto exchange traded funds and separately managed accounts.",
      "Despite modest revenues and significant losses, Trump\u2019s supporters have helped boost Trump Media & Technology Group\u2019s stock price and raise funds since it went public last year. The parent company announced late last month that the possible move into crypto was an effort to diversify its $700 million cash reserves.",
      "TMTG says Trump has no decision-making role at the company. He is its largest shareholder, with a 53% stake, according to the company's most recent quarterly report. That's currently worth more than $3 billion."

      "The National Council for Energy Policy's approval came in response to an official invitation in 2023. The group includes the 12 members of OPEC, the longstanding group set up to coordinate oil production to stabilize markets, plus 10 more significant oil-producing nations with Russia by far the largest.",
      "Though non-OPEC members agree to cooperate with OPEC nations, Brazil won't have any binding obligation such as production cuts, Mines and Energy Minister Alexandre Silveira said at a news conference. The participation will be limited to the Charter of Cooperation, a permanent forum for OPEC and OPEC+ countries to discuss industry-related issues. The South American country will not participate in decisions.",
      "Silveira called the charter merely \u201ca forum for discussing strategies among oil-producing countries. We should not be ashamed of being oil producers. Brazil needs to grow, develop and create income and jobs.\u201d",
      "President Luiz In\u00e1cio Lula da Silva began his third term in 2023 touting himself as an environmental defender, and has worked to reduce deforestation in the Amazon rainforest and to protect Indigenous rights.

      "Sacks\u2019 defensiveness highlights a new reality in Washington: After spending heavily to help elect Trump and other crypto-friendly lawmakers, the industry is emboldened, impatient and eager to cement its influence in politics and mainstream financial systems.",

Securities generally face stricter regulations.",
      "Similar legislation has stalled in past years but many in the crypto industry expect broad, bipartisan support for passage this time. That\u2019s due in part to the heavy political spending by the crypto industry. Fairshake, the crypto super PAC that was one of the biggest spenders in last year\u2019s election, said recently it has already amassed a huge war chest for next year\u2019s midterms. One of the crypto industry's biggest wins last year was helping knock off former Sen. Sherrod Brown, a Democrat from Ohio and crypto critic who led the Senate's banking committee.",

      "Germany needs a new business model to get its stalled economy going again",
      "MULFINGEN, Germany -- Germany needs a new business model. The old one, fueled by cheap natural gas from Russia and lucrative exports to China, is broken, leaving Europe's biggest economy mired in stagnation and angst about the future.",
      "Delivering that fresh growth strategy is going to be the biggest challenge for the government that takes office after a national election set for Feb. 23, seven months ahead of schedule. The nation that became known for the quality of its products has not seen real economic growth for five years.",
      "Multiple factors conspired to take Germany from industrial powerhouse to post-pandemic straggler: too much bureaucracy, a shortage of skilled workers, slow deployment of technology and a lack of clear direction from the outgoing coalition government are among them. Rising competition from China and high energy prices due to Russia's war in Ukraine were additional hits.",
      "\u201cWe really need a more company- and enterprise-friendly politics,\" said Klaus Geissdoerfer, CEO of industrial fan manufacturer EBM-Papst. \u201cWe have bright talent in Germany. We have good companies, but at the moment we don\u2019t have the awareness on the political level.\u201d",
      "With 2.5 billion euros ($2.6 billion) in annual revenue and plants on three continents, EBM-Papst describes itself as the global leader in its field. The company reported last year that it was \u201csuffering in Germany in particular\u201d and experienced a 4.1% revenue decline in its home market.",
      "Geissdoerfer said EBM-Papst\u2019s heating technology division lost 18.7% of its sales through a clumsily handled push to get property owners to replace gas furnaces with less polluting electric heat pumps.",
      "The requirements of the Building Energy Act put forward by Chancellor Olaf Scholz\u2019 three-party coalition were so confusing, people put off the upgrades to their heating systems or rushed to buy new gas devices before the law took effect, he said. That sapped demand for the ultra-quiet heat pump fans EBM-Papst makes.",
      "Consumers wondered, \u201cWhat is the right technology for my house?\u201d Geissdoerfer said. \u201cAnd so everybody said, 'If I don't have to, I better wait.'\u201d",
      "Geissdoerfer made a complaint heard across industry: Germany's bureaucracy is excessive. A 2023 law that requires public and private entities to combat climate change by reducing their energy use means EBM-Papst must assign employees to detail what the company is doing to comply, he said.",
      "\u201cSo now, instead of implementing measures, they write and report,\u201d the CEO said, adding that the documentation work is a poor use of time at a company whose core business is energy-saving equipment. \u201cI really hope with the new government we can get this solved, because at the moment it\u2019s too much.\u201d",
      "EBM-Papst is moving in the direction where economists say Germany as a whole should put its industrial resources: into green and digital technology. The company, headquartered in Mulfingen, a town of 3,700 residents in rural southwest Germany, is equipping energy-hungry artificial intelligence data centers with efficient cooling systems for their servers. It also is working on incorporating AI features to help tech companies optimize their power use and to predict when equipment needs to be replaced.",
      "In the meantime, EBM-Papst is coping with Germany\u2019s economic malaise by shifting its investment focus to Asia and the United States. The company now supplies U.S. customers, for instance, from plants in Farmington, Connecticut,and Telford, Tennessee. Its moves to localize production abroad predate the coronavirus pandemic but give EBM-Papst a shield against any new import taxes imposed by U.S. President Donald Trump.",
      "On top of the homegrown issues, international relations have dealt another blow. Russia cut off most of the country's natural gas supplies over the German government's wartime support for Ukraine. Electricity prices, a key cost for industry, have risen to 2 1/2 times higher than in the U.S. and China.",
      "Metalworking firm Mecanindus-Vogelsang Group, which makes precision parts for automakers and other manufacturers, says it pays twice as much per kilowatt hour for the electricity its German plants use as it does for its U.S. sites in Mt. Sterling, Kentucky, and Lakewood, New Jersey. That's 100,000 euros in added costs and \u201ca gigantic competitive disadvantage\" CEO Ulrich Flatken said.",
      "\u201cTo avoid deindustrialization, which is already taking place, we urgently need internationally competitive energy prices,\u201d Flatken said.",
      "Another shock came from China, which throughout the 2010s served as a lucrative market for German-made machinery and automobiles. Once Chinese companies started making those same products, backed by government subsidies, German exports suffered.",
      "Germany's economy contracted in each of the last two years. By the end of 2024, it was only 0.3% bigger than it was in 2019, before the pandemic. The U.S. economy grew by 11.4% during over the same period, while China's expanded by 25.8%, according to Germany's Federal Statistical Office.",
      "Marcel Fratzscher, president of the German Institute for Economic Research, thinks complacency set in during the boom years of exports to China. German companies weren\u2019t quick enough to respond to technological trends, such as the move to electric cars, he said.",
      "\u201cThey enjoyed the success of the 2010s and they have been too slow in understanding that they need to change and adapt,\u201d Fratzscher said.",
      "As the economic woes drag on, \u201cmental depression\u201d has set in, he said. \u201cThe pessimism is enormous among companies and citizens, and that\u2019s an important explanation why companies are not investing.\u201d",
      "Many business executives and economists argue that Germany's next government should work to loosen constitutional limits on debt so it can increase public spending on infrastructure and education. Fratzscher wonders if political leaders, like the economy, will falter in adopting new ways of doing things.",
      "\u201cFor the past 75 years, Germany has been built very much on consensus, stability oriented, lots of checks and balances in the political system, and that makes rapid change very difficult,\u201d he said. \u201cWe need to change the mindset, to understand we need to be much faster on economic transformations.\u201d"

      "It enjoyed a brief spike in value above $4 billion in market capitalization, although its value began to decline amid comments of critics that it could be a scam. Milei deleted the post a few hours later as the value of the cryptocurrency was collapsing in a downturn that caused millions of dollars in losses to many of its new investors.",

      "The president's office said in a statement that Milei was not involved in any stage of the cryptocurrency\u2019s development and decided to remove his post to avoid speculation and limit further exposure, following the public reaction to the project\u2019s launch.",

    "published": "Tue, 18 Feb 2025 12:50:42 -0500",
    "summary": "For people who already have high-interest-rate debt, having an emergency fund can help guard against resorting to additional high-cost financing in a pinch",
    "story": [
      "For people who already have high-interest-rate debt, having an emergency fund can help guard against resorting to additional high-cost financing in a pinch",
      "Emergency funds are an absolutely crucial aspect of any financial plan, regardless of the life stage or situation.",
      "For people who already have high-interest-rate debt, having an emergency fund can help guard against resorting to additional high-cost financing in a pinch. It also helps you defray unexpected expenses without needing to raid your retirement accounts.",
      "Finally, the big reason to have an emergency fund is to cover your basic costs in case of job loss.",
      "Tally up your essential monthly outlays: housing costs, utilities, food expenses, servicing debt, insurance, and taxes. Don\u2019t include nonessential items that you could live without in a pinch.",
      "Multiply your essential living expenses by three months. This is your absolute minimum savings target for your emergency fund.",
      "From there, you can customize your own emergency-fund amount upward. One of the biggest determinants of emergency-fund size is your career path. Contractors or other workers with lumpy income streams should obviously have bigger cash buffers.",
      "Finally, factor in how much flexibility you have to adjust your expenses downward in a pinch. New graduates who could readily relocate or get roommates can get away with a smaller emergency fund. But if you\u2019re carrying a mortgage, have two car payments, and have children, your emergency fund should be much larger.",
      "Add up the aggregate investments that you hold in your checking and savings accounts, money market accounts and funds, and certificate of deposit accounts, or CDs. Exclude any assets that you have earmarked for other purposes, such as money that you\u2019re saving for a car down payment. Also exclude any cash holdings in your stock or bond mutual funds. This is your current emergency fund.",
      "Subtract the figure from Step 2 (your current emergency fund) from the figure in Step 1 (your target emergency fund). This is how much you need to save at a bare minimum\u2014double this level or more. Setting money aside to hit this savings target should be your main savings priority in the months ahead.",
      "My advice is to use plain-vanilla cash investments: checking and savings accounts, CDs, and money market accounts. Online savings accounts are often one of the highest-yielding cash options; credit unions also frequently offer decent yields.",
      "As you shop for cash options to populate your emergency fund, remember that not every product type is FDIC-insured. Money market mutual funds, for example, do not qualify for FDIC protection though, in practice, they\u2019ve been quite safe. And remember that CDs carry penalties if you need to get your money out prematurely.",
      "Finally, being able to access emergency-fund assets in a pinch is crucial\u2014you don\u2019t want to have to deal with taxes or penalties. For that reason, it\u2019s ideal to maintain your emergency fund outside the confines of your retirement accounts.",
      "However, your Roth IRA can help back up your emergency fund, if need be. While it\u2019s not ideal to use your retirement savings as a piggy bank, you can tap Roth IRA contributions at any time and for any reason.",
      "If you\u2019re a homeowner, it can make sense to augment your emergency fund by setting up a home equity line of credit to use in case of emergency. That way, should you find yourself in a real bind and have to exhaust your emergency fund, you\u2019ll have another safety net in place.",

      "U.S. tech giants have quietly empowered Israel to track and kill many more alleged militants more quickly in Gaza and Lebanon through a sharp spike in artificial intelligence and computing services",
      "TEL AVIV, Israel -- U.S. tech giants have quietly empowered Israel to track and kill many more alleged militants more quickly in Gaza and Lebanon through a sharp spike in artificial intelligence and computing services. But the number of civilians killed has also soared, along with fears that these tools are contributing to the deaths of innocent people.",
      "Militaries have for years hired private companies to build custom autonomous weapons. However, Israel\u2019s recent wars mark a leading instance in which commercial AI models made in the United States have been used in active warfare, despite concerns that they were not originally developed to help decide who lives and who dies.",
      "The Israeli military uses AI to sift through vast troves of intelligence, intercepted communications and surveillance to find suspicious speech or behavior and learn the movements of its enemies. After a surprise attack by Hamas militants on Oct. 7, 2023, its use of Microsoft and OpenAI technology skyrocketed, an Associated Press investigation found.",
      "The investigation also revealed new details of how AI systems select targets and ways they can go wrong, including faulty data or flawed algorithms. It was based on internal documents, data and exclusive interviews with current and former Israeli officials and company employees.",
      "Israel\u2019s goal after the attack that killed about 1,200 people and took over 250 hostages was to eradicate Hamas, and its military has called AI a \u201cgame changer\u201d in yielding targets more swiftly. Since the war started, more than 50,000 people have died in Gaza and Lebanon and nearly 70% of the buildings in Gaza have been devastated, according to health ministries in Gaza and Lebanon.",
      "\u201cThis is the first confirmation we have gotten that commercial AI models are directly being used in warfare,\u201d said Heidy Khlaaf, chief AI scientist at the AI Now Institute and former senior safety engineer at OpenAI. \u201cThe implications are enormous for the role of tech in enabling this type of unethical and unlawful warfare going forward.\u201d",
      "Among U.S. tech firms, Microsoft has had an especially close relationship with the Israeli military spanning decades.",
      "That relationship, alongside those with other tech companies, stepped up after the Hamas attack. Israel\u2019s war response strained its own servers and increased its reliance on outside, third-party vendors, according to a presentation last year by Col. Racheli Dembinsky, the military\u2019s top information technology officer. As she described how AI had provided Israel \u201cvery significant operational effectiveness\u201d in Gaza, the logos of Microsoft Azure, Google Cloud and Amazon Web Services appeared on a large screen behind her.",
      "The Israeli military\u2019s usage of Microsoft and OpenAI artificial intelligence spiked last March to nearly 200 times higher than before the week leading up to the Oct. 7 attack, the AP found in reviewing internal company information. The amount of data it stored on Microsoft servers doubled between that time and July 2024 to more than 13.6 petabytes \u2014 roughly 350 times the digital memory needed to store every book in the Library of Congress. Usage of Microsoft\u2019s huge banks of computer servers by the military also rose by almost two-thirds in the first two months of the war alone.",
      "Microsoft declined to provide any comment for this story and did not respond to a detailed list of written questions about the cloud and AI services it provides to the Israeli military.",
      "In an expansive statement on its website, the company says \u201crespecting human rights is a core value of Microsoft\u2033 and it is committed \u201cto champion the positive role of technology across the globe.\u201d In its 40-page Responsible AI Transparency Report for 2024, Microsoft pledges to \u201cmap, measure, and manage generative AI risks throughout the development cycle to reduce the risk of harm,\u201d and does not mention its lucrative military contracts.",
      "Advanced AI models are provided through OpenAI, the maker of ChatGPT, through Microsoft\u2019s Azure cloud platform, where they are purchased by the Israeli military, the documents and data show. Microsoft has been OpenAI\u2019s largest investor.",
      "OpenAI said it does not have a partnership with Israel\u2019s military, and its usage policies say its customers should not use its products to develop weapons, destroy property or harm people. About a year ago, however, OpenAI changed its terms of use from barring military use to allowing for \u201cnational security use cases that align with our mission.\u201d",
      "The Israeli military declined to answer detailed written questions from The AP about its use of commercial AI products from American tech companies, but said its analysts use AI-enabled systems to help identify targets and independently examine them together with high-ranking officers to meet international law, weighing the military advantage against the collateral damage.",
      "\u201cThese AI tools make the intelligence process more accurate and more effective,\u201d said an Israeli military statement to the AP. \u201c\u2060They make more targets faster, but not at the expense of accuracy, and many times in this war they\u2019ve been able to minimize civilian casualties.\u201d",
      "Google and Amazon provide cloud computing and AI services to the Israeli military under \u201cProject Nimbus,\u201d a $1.2 billion contract signed in 2021, when Israel first tested out its in-house AI-powered targeting systems. The IDF has used Cisco and Dell server farms or data centers. Red Hat, an independent IBM subsidiary, also has provided cloud computing technologies to the Israeli military, while Palantir Technologies, a Microsoft partner in U.S. defense contracts, has a \u201cstrategic partnership\u201d providing AI systems to help Israel\u2019s war efforts.",
      "After OpenAI changed its terms of use last year to allow for national security purposes, Google followed suit earlier this month with a similar change to its public ethics policy to remove language saying it wouldn\u2019t use its AI for weapons and surveillance.",
      "Google said it is committed to responsibly developing and deploying AI \u201cthat protects people, promotes global growth, and supports national security.\u201d",
      "The Israel Defense Forces uses Microsoft Azure to compile information gathered through mass surveillance, which it transcribes and translates, including phone calls, texts and audio messages, according to an Israeli intelligence officer who works with the systems. That data can then be cross-checked with Israel\u2019s in-house targeting systems and vice versa.",
      "He said he relies on Azure to quickly search for terms and patterns within massive text troves, such as finding conversations between two people within a 50-page document. Azure also can find people giving directions to one another in the text, which can then be cross-referenced with the military\u2019s own AI systems to pinpoint locations.",
      "The Microsoft data AP reviewed shows that since the Oct. 7 attack, the Israeli military has made heavy use of transcription and translation tools and OpenAI models, although it does not detail which. Typically, AI models that transcribe and translate perform best in English. OpenAI has acknowledged that its popular AI-powered translation model Whisper, which can transcribe and translate into multiple languages including Arabic, can \u202f make up text that no one said, including adding racial commentary and violent rhetoric.",
      "Errors can happen for many reasons involving AI, said Israeli military officers who have worked with the targeting systems and other tech experts. Intercepted phone calls tied to a person\u2019s profile include the time the person called and the names and numbers of those on the call. But it takes an extra step to listen to and verify the original audio, or to see a translated transcript.",
      "The Israeli military says a person who knows Arabic is supposed to check translations. Still, one intelligence officer said he had seen targeting mistakes that relied on incorrect machine translations from Arabic to Hebrew.",

      "Those ambitions feel further away now than they have in decades, with United 15th in the standings and closer to the relegation zone than the top six after a woeful campaign. Sunday's 1-0 loss to Tottenham was the 12th in the league this season and an eighth under Amorim, who only took charge in November.",

      "In 2011, then-Chancellor Angela Merkel decided to hasten the end of nuclear power use in Germany while relying on gas from Russia to bridge the gap as the country moved away from coal generation and toward renewable energy. Russia was then considered to be a reliable energy partner; warnings to the contrary from Poland and the United States were dismissed.",
      "When Russia discontinued the flow, prices in Germany skyrocketed for gas and for electricity generated from gas, both key costs for energy-intensive industries such as steel, fertilizer, chemicals and glass. Germany had to turn to liquefied natural gas, or LNG, super-cooled and imported by ship from Qatar and the U.S. LNG costs more than pipeline gas.",
      "Electricity now costs industrial users in Germany an average of 20.3 euro cents per kilowatt hour, according to a study the research firm Prognos AG prepared for the Bavarian Industry Association. In the U.S. and China, where many competitors of German companies are located, the cost is the equivalent of 8.4 euro cents.",
      "Renewable sources of energy haven't scaled up fast enough to fill the gap. Homeowner and regional resistance to turbines slowed wind energy growth. Infrastructure to transport hydrogen as a replacement fuel for steel furnaces remains mostly on the drawing board.",
      "For years, Germany benefited from China's entry into the global economy - even as other developed countries lost jobs to China. German companies found a massive new market for industrial machinery, chemicals and vehicles. Through the early and mid 2010s, Mercedes-Benz, Volkswagen and BMW reaped fat profits selling into what became the world's largest car market.",
      "At the time, Chinese companies produced items like furniture and consumer electronics that didn't compete with Germany's core strengths. Then, manufacturers in China started making the same things that Germans did.",
      "State-subsidized Chinese solar panels wiped out Germany's makers. In 2010, Chinese panel makers depended on imported German equipment; today, global solar panel production relies on equipment from China. The government in Beijing has ramped up efforts to promote and subsidize manufacturing for export. The resulting goods \u2014 steel, machinery, solar panels, electric vehicles and EV batteries \u2014 now compete with German goods on export markets.",
      "Germany, the most auto-centric of the European Union economies, had the most to lose from China's export-oriented industrial policy. In 2020, China was not a net exporter of vehicles; by 2024, it was exporting 5 million a year. Germany's net exports fell by half over the same period, to 1.2 million cars. Chinese factory capacity is estimated at 50 million vehicles a year, roughly half of global demand.",
      "Germany grew complacent during the good times and put off investing in long-term projects such as rail lines and high-speed internet. The government balanced its budget and sometimes ran surpluses off the tax revenue from a booming economy.",
      "These days, German commuters shake their heads at trains that don't run on time and constant service disruptions while repairs are made to worn-out tracks. High speed internet hasn't yet reached some rural areas. A transmission line to bring electricity from Germany's windy north to factories in the south has run years behind and won't be ready before 2028. A key bridge on the highway connecting the industrial Ruhr region with southern Germany had to be closed in 2021, 10 years after doubts about its durability emerged. A replacement won't be ready before 2027.",
      "A 2009 constitutional amendment handcuffed the government by limiting deficit spending. Whether to loosen the so-called debt brake will be a thorny issue for the German government installed after the country's Feb. 23 election.",
      "German companies are having trouble finding workers with the right skills, from highly trained IT workers to daycare providers, senior care workers and hotel staff members. In a German Chamber of Commerce and Industry survey of 23,000 firms, 43% of companies said they couldn't fill open positions. The response rose to 58% for companies with more than 1,000 workers.",
      "Fewer German students are interested in STEM fields, meaning science, technology, engineering and mathematics. An aging population compounds the problem, as does a shortage of affordable child care that keeps many women working part-time or not at all. Bureaucratic hurdles pose an obstacle to employing high-skill immigrants, though a law passed in 2020 and strengthened in 2023 aims to ease the process.",
      "Lengthy approval procedures and too much paperwork are a drag on the economy, according to Germany companies and economists. Securing a construction permit for a wind turbine can take years. A few other examples, among dozens raised by German business groups:",
      "\u2014 Companies installing solar panels need to register with both government regulators and their local utility even though the utility could pass on the information to the government level.",
      "\u2014 Restaurants have to log refrigerator temperatures by hand and keep hard copies of the records for a month even if the data has been stored digitally.",
      "\u2014 A law requiring companies to certify that their suppliers are obeying environmental and labor standards went beyond EU requirements, putting a heavier burden on German companies than their European competitors.",

      "New government regulations on social media in Vietnam give authorities increased powers to prevent dissent and control the news, along with the tools to more easily track down critics and silence them",
      "BANGKOK -- New government regulations on social media in Vietnam give authorities increased powers to prevent dissent and control the news, along with the tools to more easily track down critics and silence them, according to an analysis released Tuesday.",
      "Vietnam's authorities implemented \u201cDecree 147\u201d in December, tightening regulations on social media companies like Facebook, X, YouTube and TikTok in a bid to further stifle criticism, said Ben Swanton, one of the authors of the report by The 88 Project, a group focused on human rights and free speech issues in Vietnam.",
      "\u201cAny challenge to the government and the Communist Party, any significant challenge to their official narrative of events, is perceived by them as a situation that is getting out of control,\u201d he said in an interview from Thailand.",
      "Among other things, the decree requires users to verify their accounts with phone numbers or national ID cards that must be provided to the government upon request, and for the social media companies to store their data in Vietnam.",
      "It also prevents social media users from engaging in citizen journalism or posting information about suspected government wrongdoing, and requires companies to remove posts deemed illegal within 24 hours. The decree requires companies to allow authorities access to their internal search engines so that it can identify offending content.",
      "Social media companies have until late March to be in compliance, and it is not yet clear whether they will try to push back. TikTok and Facebook refused to comment on their plans, while X and Google, which owns YouTube, did not return emails.",
      "Already, however, researchers have noticed a decline in political posts, Swanton said.",
      "\u201cIn the last several years Hanoi has imprisoned or forced into exile the country\u2019s most prominent independent journalists, reformers, human rights activists, and dissidents. This has had a chilling effect that encourages people to engage in self-censorship,\u201d he said. \u201cDecree 147 is designed to turn this chilling effect into an icy stranglehold on free speech.\u201d",
      "Vietnamese authorities did not respond to a request for comment on the Project 88 analysis or the intent behind the new decree.",
      "About 65 million Vietnamese have Facebook accounts, roughly two-thirds of the population, and some 35 million have YouTube accounts. About half of Vietnam's people say they get most of their news from social media.",
      "Already, the government frequently insists critical posts from outside the country be geo-blocked so they cannot be accessed inside Vietnam and it has moved quickly to censor posts it deems unacceptable, like a video of a top minister eating a gold-encrusted steak in London in 2021 while Vietnam was on COVID-19 lockdown.",
      "In October, a prominent Vietnamese blogger was sentenced to 12 years in prison for articles and videos exposing the corruption of government officials, and in January, a prominent Vietnamese lawyer was sentenced to three years in jail for Facebook posts criticizing the country's former top judge.",
      "Project 88 researchers said the new decree will also give authorities better tools to go after those who just read or watch social media posts as well.",
      "They noted a case last June in which police in one province went through the profiles of 13,328 members of a Facebook group that had information deemed \u201chostile to the state\u201d and identified 20 people in their province, went to their homes and demanded they leave the group.",
      "\u201cIf implemented as intended, Decree 147 would likely make it less time consuming to identify members of groups like this and ensure that groups with anti-state content will be blocked in the country,\u201d the report said.",
      "It urges social media companies and others affected to refuse to comply with provisions of the decree that violate free expression rights, and for the United States and United Nations to pressure Vietnam to repeal the measure."

      "Today the next generation of geothermal companies is trying to succeed where previous efforts failed. They don't rely on hot water close to the surface, but instead use techniques developed in the oil and gas industry to drill deep and extract heat from dry, hot rock. One of them, Eavor, is starting up its first commercial power plant in Geretsried \u2014 turning the tiny town of about 26,000 people, south of Munich, into a proving ground for the future of geothermal energy.",
      "Can technology like this be scaled and really make a difference for the future of the planet? The International Energy Agency thinks so. In a recent report, it said technology breakthroughs are unlocking huge potential for geothermal energy. Now that companies are drilling deeper than 3 kilometers (close to 2 miles), nearly every country has the potential to make heat and electricity this way, the IEA said.",
      "\u201cIt has been a niche energy and concentrated in a few countries,\u201d IEA Executive Director Fatih Birol said in an interview. But soon, Birol said, \"geothermal can contribute to the global energy picture in an accelerated manner.\u201d",

No one would\u2019ve been impressed if the Canadian company demonstrated its technology in Iceland, a place with abundant, easily accessible hot water, he added.",
      "It helped that the town was excited for geothermal and open to new ideas, he added.",
      "\u201cOur whole point is that we want to have geothermal anywhere, everywhere,\u201d Redfern said. \u201cWhat better way to prove that than to put our first well where they tried and failed with traditional geothermal systems.\u201d",
      "Germany is committed to transitioning away from fossil fuels. As part of the commitment, heating systems must switch to renewable sources because heating is one of the main sources of carbon dioxide emissions in Germany. And Germany couldn\u2019t depend on importing natural gas from Russia after Russia invaded Ukraine in 2022.",
      "Eavor, named for the phrase \u201cenergy for ever,\u201d has a demonstration facility in Alberta, Canada. Company executives know Geretsried well. One of them managed operations for the contractor that drilled there previously.",
      "This project will start by generating electricity in Geretsried, then add heat as the town fully builds out a district heating system.",
      "With district heating, heat is generated in a central location and distributed to homes and businesses. Most of these systems make their heat from burning fossil fuels, especially in China and Russia, which have the largest number of them, according to the IEA. Europe has 17,000 district heating and cooling networks, serving 67 million people, according to Euroheat & Power, the international network for district energy.",
      "In the United States, district energy systems are most often on college campuses, at hospitals, on military bases and in some downtown areas in larger cities. Some universities are switching their district heating systems off gas or heating oil to geothermal energy to address climate change. The Trump administration, while pivoting back to pro-oil and gas policies, does appear to also favor geothermal.",
      "Eavor has a contract to provide heat in the northwestern German city of Hanover, too. The city of more than 500,000 people is phasing out coal.",
      "Eavor is also licensing its technology to utilities and companies that are trying to curb emissions and want secure energy, Redfern said. A large Japanese power provider, Chubu Electric Power Company, is a major investor in Eavor. Japan has many sites suitable for geothermal but few geothermal power plants.",
      "The way it works is that Eavor drills two wells about 4 kilometers (2.5 miles) deep, then branches out and drills a dozen lateral wells, to maximize contact with the hot rock. The wells intersect to create a closed loop where water can flow, the \u201cEavor loop.\u201d The Geretsried project will have four loops, each with two vertical wells and about 12 lateral ones.",
      "Eavor does not frack, or hydraulically fracture, to create cracks and increase the permeability of rock.",
      "Instead in Geretsried, it will pump water down to flow through the hot rock, heating up on contact. It will rise naturally to the surface through an outlet well.",
      "That hot water can be used to heat the utility's water so it can be sent through pipes to heat the equivalent of about 36,000 homes. The hot water also can be routed to a power plant to make steam and then recirculated. When used to spin a turbine, that steam can generate electricity without any planet-warming greenhouse gas emissions.",
      "M\u00fcller, the mayor, said it's better to start changing the approach to energy today than push it off to tomorrow. He said residents can't rely on fossil fuels long term, they have to address climate change and they need secure energy.",
      "\u201cWe want to remain future proof,\u201d he said. \u201cSo let's start the future.\u201d",

      "MUNICH -- Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy says he directed his ministers not to sign off on a proposed agreement to give the United States access to Ukraine\u2019s rare earth minerals because the document was too focused on U.S. interests.",
      "The proposal, which was a key part of Zelenskyy\u2019s talks with U.S. Vice President JD Vance on the sidelines of the Munich Security Conference on Friday, did not offer any specific security guarantees in return, according to one current and one former senior Ukrainian official familiar with the talks.",
      "Zelenskyy\u2019s decision not to accept the proposal, at least for now, was described as \u201cshort-sighted\u201d by a senior White House official.",
      "\u201cI didn\u2019t let the ministers sign a relevant agreement because in my view it is not ready to protect us, our interest,\u201d Zelenskyy told The Associated Press on Saturday in Munich.",
      "The proposal focused on how the U.S. could use Kyiv\u2019s rare earth minerals \u201cas compensation\u201d for support already given to Ukraine by the Biden administration and as payment for future aid, the current and former senior Ukrainian officials said, speaking anonymously so they could speak freely.",
      "Ukraine has vast reserves of critical minerals that are used in the aerospace, defense and nuclear industries. The Trump administration has indicated it is interested in accessing them to reduce dependence on China but Zelenskyy said any exploitation would need to be tied to security guarantees for Ukraine that would deter future Russian aggression.",
      "\u201cFor me is very important the connection between some kind of security guarantees and some kind of investment,\u201d the Ukrainian president told AP.",
      "Zelenskyy did not go into details about why he instructed his officials not to sign the document, which was given to Ukrainian officials on Wednesday by U.S. Treasury Secretary Scott Bassent on a visit to Kyiv.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s a colonial agreement and Zelenskyy cannot sign it,\u201d the former senior official said.",
      "White House National Security Council spokesman Brian Hughes did not explicitly confirm the offer, but said in a statement that \u201cPresident Zelenskyy is being short-sighted about the excellent opportunity the Trump administration has presented to Ukraine.\u201d",
      "The Trump administration has grown weary of sending additional U.S. aid to Ukraine and Hughes said a minerals deal would allow American taxpayers to \u201crecoup\u201d money sent to Kyiv, while growing Ukraine\u2019s economy.",
      "Hughes added that the White House believes \u201cbinding economic ties with the United States will be the best guarantee against future aggression and an integral part of lasting peace.\u201d He added: \u201cThe U.S. recognizes this, the Russians recognize this, and the Ukrainians must recognize this.\u201d",
      "U.S. officials in discussions with their Ukrainian counterparts in Munich were commercially minded and largely concentrated on the specifics of exploring the minerals and how to form a possible partnership to do that with Ukraine, the senior official said.",
      "The potential value of the deposits in Ukraine has not yet been discussed, with much unexplored or close to the front line.",
      "The U.S. proposal apparently did not take into account how the deposits would be secured in the event of continuing Russian aggression. The official suggested the U.S. did not have \u201cready answers,\u201d to that question and that one of their takeaways from discussions in Munich will be how to secure any mineral extraction operation in Ukraine involving people and infrastructure.",
      "Any deal must be in accordance with Ukrainian law and acceptable to the Ukrainian people, the senior Ukrainian official said.",
      "\u201cSubsoil belongs to Ukrainians under the constitution,\u201d Kseniiia Orynchak, founder of the National Association of Mining Industry of Ukraine, previously told the AP, suggesting a deal would need popular support.",
      "Zelenskyy and Vance did not discuss the details of the U.S. document during their meeting Friday at the Munich conference, the senior official said. That meeting was \u201cvery good\u201d and \u201csubstantive,\u201d with Vance making it clear his and Trump\u2019s main goal was to achieve a durable, lasting peace, the senior official said.",
      "Zelenskyy told Vance that real peace requires Ukraine to be in a \u201cstrong position\u201d when starting negotiations, stressed that the U.S negotiators should come to Ukraine, and that the U.S., Ukraine and Europe must be at the negotiating table for talks with Russia.",
      "But Gen. Keith Kellogg, Trump\u2019s special envoy for Ukraine and Russia, all but cut Europeans out of any Ukraine-Russia talks, despite Zelenskyy\u2019s request.",
      "\u201cYou can have the Ukrainians, the Russians, and clearly the Americans at the table talking,\u201d Kellogg said at an event hosted by a Ukrainian tycoon at the Munich conference. Pressed on whether that meant Europeans won\u2019t be included, he said: \u201cI\u2019m a school of realism. I think that\u2019s not going to happen.\u201d",
      "Ukraine is now preparing a \u201ccounter proposal\u201d which will be delivered to the U.S. in \u201cthe near future,\u201d the official said.",
      "\u201cI think it\u2019s important that the vice president understood me that if we want to sign something, we have to understand that it will work,\u201d Zelenskyy told the AP.",

      "It's the latest group of Amazon employees to side against union representation.",
      "Workers at an Amazon warehouse in North Carolina rejected a proposal to unionize, becoming the latest group of the company\u2019s employees to side against union representation.",
      "About three-quarters of employees at an Amazon fulfillment center in Garner, a town located near Raleigh, voted against joining a grassroots labor organization called Carolina Amazonians United for Solidarity and Empowerment, the National Labor Relations Board announced Saturday.",
      "The federal labor agency said 2,447 workers cast ballots against union representation while 829 voted in favor of joining the independent union, which is made up of former and current Amazon workers. The NLRB had said 4,300 Amazon workers were eligible to cast ballots in the election, which took place Monday through Saturday.",
      "Rev. Ryan Brown, a former Amazon worker who co-founded the group, said Saturday, \u201cWe had already braced ourselves for a loss.\u201d",
      "\u201cWe knew that historically the tide was against us to have a win for several reasons,\u201d Brown said. \u201cOne, we\u2019re in the South. Two, the average worker that\u2019s in North Carolina knows nothing about a union and the benefits of a union and what a union could do for them.\u201d",
      "The outcome came just weeks after workers at a Whole Foods Market store in Pennsylvania voted to unionize, leading to the first successful entry of organized labor into the grocery chain, which Amazon owns. Following the union win, Whole Foods asked the NLRB to toss out the election results, arguing the voting process was tainted.",
      "In 2022, workers at an Amazon warehouse in the New York City borough of Staten Island unionized with Amazon Labor Union, which joined forces with the Teamsters last year. However, Amazon has objected to the election result and refused to negotiate over a contract.",
      "At the same time, the company has also been able to successfully fend off union victories at a second warehouse on Staten Island, as well as at facilities near Albany, New York, and in Bessemer, Alabama.",
      "In November, an NLRB administrative law judge ordered a third union election for Amazon warehouse workers in Bessemer after determining that the company committed six violations leading up to a rerun election in March 2022. That rerun was held after the Retail, Wholesale and Department Store Union, which is seeking to represent Amazon workers in Bessemer, filed objections to the first election, which results in a union loss.",
      "Workers affiliated with Carolina Amazonians United for Solidarity and Empowerment, or CAUSE, have been organizing at the North Carolina warehouse since January 2022. Co-founder Brown said in an interview last month he started organizing because he felt like Amazon was not providing workers adequate protections against COVID-19.",
      "The company said Saturday that Amazon already offers what many unions are requesting, such as safe and inclusive workplaces and competitive pay.",
      "\u201cWe\u2019re glad that our team in Garner was able to have their voices heard, and that they chose to keep a direct relationship with Amazon,\" Amazon spokesperson Eileen Hards said in a written statement.",

      "The Trump administration\u2019s effort to slash the size of the federal workforce reached the Food and Drug Administration this weekend",
      "WASHINGTON -- The Trump administration\u2019s effort to slash the size of the federal workforce reached the Food and Drug Administration this weekend, as recently hired employees who review the safety of food ingredients, medical devices and other products were fired.",
      "Probationary employees across the FDA received notices Saturday evening that their jobs were being eliminated, according to three FDA staffers who spoke to The Associated Press on condition of anonymity because they were not authorized to speak publicly.",
      "The total number of positions eliminated was not clear Sunday, but the firings appeared to focus on employees in the agency\u2019s centers for food, medical devices and tobacco products \u2014 which includes oversight of electronic cigarettes. It was not clear whether FDA employees who review drugs were exempted.",
      "On Friday, the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services announced plans to fire 5,200 probationary employees across its agencies, which include the National Institutes of Health, the FDA and the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.",
      "People who spoke with the AP on condition of anonymity on Friday said the number of probationary employees to be laid off at the CDC would total nearly 1,300. But as of early Sunday afternoon, about 700 people had received notices, according to three people who spoke on condition on anonymity because they were not authorized to speak publicly. They said none of the CDC layoffs affected the young doctors and researchers who track diseases in what\u2019s known as the Epidemic Intelligence Service.",
      "The FDA is headquartered in the Maryland suburbs outside Washington and employs nearly 20,000 people. It's long been a target of newly sworn-in health secretary Robert Kennedy Jr., who last year accused the agency of waging a \u201cwar on public health\u201d for not approving unproven treatments such as psychedelics, stem cells and chelation therapy.",
      "Kennedy also has called for eliminating thousands of chemicals and colorings from U.S. foods. But the cuts at FDA include staffers responsible for reviewing the safety of new food additives and ingredients, according to an FDA staffer familiar with the firings.",
      "An HHS spokesperson did not immediately respond to a request for comment Sunday afternoon.",
      "Nearly half of the FDA\u2019s $6.9 billion budget comes from fees paid by companies the agency regulates, including drug and medical device makers, which allows the agency to hire extra scientists to swiftly review products. Eliminating those positions will not reduce government spending.",
      "A former FDA official said cutting recent hires could backfire, eliminating staffers who tend to be younger and have more up-to-date technical skills. The FDA\u2019s workforce skews toward older workers who have spent one or two decades at the agency, and the Government Accountability Office noted in 2022 that the FDA \u201chas historically faced challenges in recruiting and retaining\u201d staff due to better money in the private sector.",
      "\u201cYou want to bring in new blood,\u201d said Peter Pitts, a former FDA associate commissioner under President George W. Bush. \u201cYou want people with new ideas, greater enthusiasm and the latest thinking in terms of technology.\u201d",
      "Mitch Zeller, former FDA director for tobacco, said the firings are a way to \u201cdemoralize and undermine the spirit of the federal workforce.\u201d",
      "\u201cThe combined effect of what they're trying to do is going to destroy the ability to recruit and retain talent,\" Zeller said.",
      "The FDA\u2019s inspection force has been particularly strained in recent years after a wave of departures during the COVID-19 pandemic, and many of the agency\u2019s current inspectors are recent hires. It was not immediately clear whether those employees were exempted.",
      "FDA inspectors are responsible for overseeing thousands of food, drug, tobacco and medical device facilities worldwide, though the AP reported last year that the agency faced a backlog of roughly 2,000 uninspected drug facilities that hadn\u2019t been visited since before the pandemic.",

      "The World Anti-Doping Agency on Monday offered an explanation for why top-ranked tennis player Jannik Sinner received a much shorter doping ban than the six-year suspension it handed to a Spanish figure skater in a similar doping case",
      "MADRID -- The World Anti-Doping Agency on Monday offered an explanation for why top-ranked tennis player Jannik Sinner received a much shorter doping ban than the six-year suspension it handed to a Spanish figure skater in a similar doping case.",
      "Spanish media has been calling attention to the lengthy ban handed to local skater Laura Barquero after she tested positive for the anabolic Clostebol, the same substance that earned Sinner a three-month ban after a settlement reached between WADA and the Italian tennis player on Saturday. The deal was criticized by many of his fellow tennis professionals this weekend.",
      "WADA pointed out that while both cases involved the same substance, the specific facts related to Barquero's case were \u201cvery different\u201d to Sinner's.",
      "\u201cThe fundamental difference between the two cases is that Ms. Barquero\u2019s version of how the substance entered her system was unconvincing in light of the evidence, such that the circumstances remained unknown as far as WADA was concerned,\" WADA said in an email sent to The Associated Press. \"In contrast, in the Sinner case, the evidence clearly confirmed the athlete\u2019s explanation as outlined in the first instance decision.\u201d",
      "Barquero first tested positive for Clostebol during the 2022 Winter Olympics, then again in January 2023 in an out-of-competition test carried out by the International Skating Union. WADA eventually entered into a \u201ccase resolution agreement\u201d in which the athlete was suspended for six years. It said the agreement was accepted and signed by WADA, the ISU and the athlete herself.",
      "\u201cIf Ms. Barquero did not agree with the proposed sanction, she was not obliged to sign the case resolution agreement and was free to take the case forward for hearing at CAS,\u201d WADA said.",
      "The agency had sought to ban Sinner, a three-time Grand Slam champion, for at least one year. It had challenged a decision last year by the International Tennis Integrity Agency not to suspend Sinner for what the ITIA judged was accidental contamination of the banned anabolic steroid last March.",
      "WADA formally withdrew its appeal saying it accepted the athlete\u2019s explanation for the cause of the violation, and that Sinner did not intend to cheat.",
      "Sinner\u2019s explanation was that trace amounts of Clostebol in his doping sample was due to a massage from a trainer who used the substance after cutting his own finger.",
      "Barquero\u2019s Instagram account republished several stories calling attention to the discrepancy in the punishment given to her and to Sinner. She then posted a video talking about how her lengthy suspension had affected her.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s a disproportionate sanction that meant the end of my career,\" she said. \"I believe it serves as a clear example of the failures of the system. I really don\u2019t know what happened. But I have to assume the consequences, accept the current regulations and face sanctions that sometimes are extremely disproportionate.\u201d",
      "The 23-year-old Barquero said she decided to accept the six-year ban based on \u201cunfair rules\u201d and so she could start moving on with her life.",
      "She said the trace amounts of Clostebol showed up in her results through the contamination of a cream commonly used to treat skin wounds that is sold in Italy without prescription and not intended to improve sporting performance.",
      "\u201cI had the misfortune of accidentally contaminating myself with a cream that a colleague had bought and that was used by people close to me,\u201d she said. \"I couldn\u2019t imagine that to test positive all you have to do is touch a person who has used that cream, or touch an object that was in contact with the cream.\u201d",

      "Kotsay and the Athletics announced Monday that they've agreed to a contract extension through the 2028 season that includes a club option for 2029. The deal coincided with the team's first full-squad workout of spring training, and dozens of players and coaches were in attendance for the manager's news conference.",

It continues with Wednesday's trip to No. 15 Missouri and Saturday's visit from No. 17 Kentucky to headline the AP Top 25 national schedule.",

      "Maybe by making the move to right, the Angels will get more out of Trout, who dominated the league in his first decade in the majors and now makes more than $37 million. In his most recent MVP season in 2019, Trout batted .291 with 45 home runs and 104 RBIs.",

And teams will point to recent history as proof that just getting into the playoffs means anything can happen: No. 5, No. 6, No. 7 and No. 8 seeds have made their way to the conference finals in the last two years alone.",
      "\u201cI\u2019m looking forward to the challenge,\u201d said the Warriors' Stephen Curry, the now two-time All-Star Game MVP. \u201cIt\u2019s basically a playoff game every single night, and that usually brings the best out of you.\u201d",

      "Oklahoma City and Cleveland are both 44-10, tied for the best record in the league. Defending champion Boston, currently No. 2 in the Eastern Conference, remains on pace to obliterate league records for 3-pointers made and attempted in a season. The Celtics, New York, Denver, Houston and the Lakers all have winning percentages over .600, which is an excellent sign \u2014 132 of the last 133 teams to reach the break with such a record have wound up making the postseason.",

      "\u201cThe last 25 to 30 games are really important for everyone,\" said Miami guard Tyler Herro, the league's new 3-point shootout champion. \u201cWe\u2019ve got a new group, in a sense, and we\u2019re going to hit the ground running. It's going to happen fast. Everything is going to matter throughout this next month and a half.\u201d",

San Antonio landed De'Aaron Fox from Sacramento, and the Los Angeles Clippers \u2014 who have barely had Kawhi Leonard available this season, but he's playing now \u2014 figure they're right in the mix to challenge as well.",

So, I think for us, it\u2019s just finding out how we want to play and attacking it.\u201d",
      "Milwaukee added Kyle Kuzma, moving Khris Middleton \u2014 a Bucks mainstay for years \u2014 to Washington in that deal. And Phoenix didn't trade Kevin Durant, which is a sign that the Suns are hoping their star trio of him, Devin Booker and Bradley Beal can make a push.",
      "\u201cWe\u2019re all figuring it out, man,\u201d Durant said. \u201cWe\u2019ve got 28, 29 games to go to figure it out. That\u2019s the fun part, trying to figure out how to get out of a slump.\u201d",
      "Davis' injury obviously isn't great for Dallas, especially with it compounded by a rash of other injuries to the Mavericks' big-man corps. Doncic is still working his way back into form after a calf issue, so he and James will still likely need some time to figure out the best way for this new star duo to work. Butler went to the Warriors with hopes of being the jolt that gets Curry, Draymond Green and coach Steve Kerr back to title contention.",
      "But a lot of teams have hope. And they all know that now's the time to make a move. Let the stretch run begin.",
      "\u201cI think, 27 games or so left to make a push,\u201d Curry said. \u201cAll we want is just to get into a playoff series and have a fighting chance to be a tough out against anybody in the West, and we have a good opportunity in front of us to do that.\u201d",

      "\"A majority of the players don\u2019t feel that it\u2019s fair. A majority of the players feel like there is favoritism happening. It appears that you can almost affect the outcome if you are a top player, if you have access to the top lawyers and whatnot.\u201d",
      "Sinner had been scheduled to play in Qatar before accepting the ban.",
      "The handling of Sinner\u2019s case had already raised questions about double standards, and when the ban was announced it was widely criticized by other players. The positive tests weren\u2019t publicly revealed until August because Sinner successfully appealed against being provisionally banned from playing. He then won the U.S. Open in September and the Australian Open in January.",
      "Sinner\u2019s explanation for the positive test was that trace amounts of Clostebol in his doping sample was due to a massage from a trainer who used the substance after cutting his own finger, which WADA accepted.",
      "Djokovic said he didn't question Sinner's and Swiatek's innocence but that he and other players are frustrated about the inconsistent handling of doping cases.",
      "He pointed to the case of former women's No. 1 Simona Halep \u2014 who was given a four-year ban by the ITIA in 2022 after a positive test before it was later reduced to nine months \u2014 and British player Tara Moore, who was suspended in May 2022 while an investigation lasted 18 months before an independent tribunal determined that her positive test for a banned substance was caused by contaminated meat.",
      "\u201cRight now it\u2019s a ripe time for us to really address the system, because the system and the structure obviously doesn\u2019t work, it\u2019s obvious,\" Djokovic said. \u201cSo, I hope that in the ... near future that the governing bodies are going to come together of our tours and the tennis ecosystem and try to find a more effective way to to deal with these processes.\"",

      "Amnesty International is urging French lawmakers to reject a bill this week that would ban headscarves in all sporting competitions",
      "Amnesty International is urging French lawmakers to reject a bill this week that would ban headscarves in all sporting competitions.",
      "The bill is backed by right-wing senators and will be debated from Tuesday in the upper house of the French parliament. Its aim is to ban all \u201costensibly religious\u201d clothing and symbols during competitions. Amnesty International says the move would be discriminatory.",
      "The vote is likely to refuel the lingering debate on secularism \u2014 still volatile more than a century after the 1905 law on separation of church and state that established it as a principle of the French Republic.",
      "Until now, sporting federations have been free to decide whether or not to allow headscarves, with two of the country\u2019s most powerful sports, soccer and rugby, opting to ban them.",
      "The bill is at an early stage and this week's vote marks the beginning of a long legislative process with an uncertain outcome. Even if senators vote in favor, the bill's future will remain unclear since the lower house has the final say.",
      "To pass, the bill would need a coalition of forces that don't usually collaborate in the deeply divided lower house.",
      "Amnesty International's calls come after French sprinter Sounkamba Sylla said last summer she was barred from the opening ceremony at the Paris Olympics because she wears a hijab. She was eventually allowed to take part wearing a cap to cover her hair.",
      "France enforces a strict principle of \u201c la\u00efcit\u00e9,\u201d loosely translated as \u201csecularism.\u201d At the Games, the president of the French Olympic Committee said its Olympians were bound by the secular principles that apply to public sector workers in the country, which include a ban on hijabs and other religious signs.",
      "\u201cAt the Paris Olympics, France\u2019s ban on French women athletes who wear headscarves from competing at the Games drew international outrage,\" said Anna B\u0142u\u015b, an Amnesty International researcher on gender justice.",
      "\"Just six months on, French authorities are not only doubling down on the discriminatory hijab ban but are attempting to extend it to all sports.\u201d",
      "Experts appointed by the UN Human Rights Council have previously criticized the decision by the French soccer and basketball federations to exclude players wearing the hijab, and the French government\u2019s decision to prevent its athletes wearing headscarves from representing the country at the Paris Games.",
      "Amnesty International said the bill in reality targets Muslim women and girls by excluding them from sporting competitions if they wear a headscarf or other religious clothing.",
      "\u201cLa\u00efcit\u00e9...which is theoretically embedded in the French constitution to protect everyone\u2019s religious freedom, has often been used as a pretext to block Muslim women\u2019s access to public spaces in France,\u201d Amnesty International said.",
      "\u201cOver several years, the French authorities have enacted laws and policies to regulate Muslim women\u2019s and girls\u2019 clothing, in discriminatory ways. Sport federations have followed suit, imposing hijab bans in several sports.\u201d",
      "Two years ago, France\u2019s highest administrative court said the country\u2019s soccer federation was entitled to ban headscarves in competitions even though the measure can limit freedom of expression.",
      "Wielding the principle of religious neutrality enshrined in the constitution, the country\u2019s soccer federation also does not make things easy for international players who want to refrain from drinking or eating from dawn to sunset during the Ramadan, Islamic holy month.",
      "Supporters of the bill cite growing attacks on secularism in sport, arguing that its core values are based on a principle of universality. To protect sports grounds from any non-sporting confrontation, they say, a principle of neutrality needs to be implemented to ensure that no political, religious or racial demonstration or propaganda can be promoted.",
      "The bill also states that using part of a sports facility as a place of worship would be a misuse of its purpose, and bans the wearing of religious clothing, such as the burkini, in public swimming pools.",
      "\u201cBy placing the wearing of a headscarf on the spectrum of \u201cattacks on secularism\u201d, which range from \u201cpermissiveness\u201d to \u201cterrorism\u201d, this legislation, if passed, would fuel racism and reinforce the growing hostile environment facing Muslims and those perceived to be Muslim in France,\u201d Amnesty International said.",

      "SCOTTSDALE, Ariz. -- Slick-fielding shortstop Geraldo Perdomo has agreed to a $45 million, four-year contract with the Arizona Diamondbacks that begins in 2026.",
      "The deal announced Tuesday includes a club option for 2030. Perdomo, who could have become eligible for free agency following the 2027 season, will make $2.55 million this year after being eligible for salary arbitration for the first time.",
      "The 25-year-old was an All-Star in 2023, the same year he helped the Diamondbacks reach the World Series. He missed a big chunk of last season with a torn meniscus in his right knee and hit .273 with three homers over 98 games, providing above-average defense at a crucial position.",
      "Now, he'll be a key piece moving forward as the franchise tries to win a Fall Classic for the first time since 2001.",
      "\u201cWe're ready to go,\u201d Perdomo said. \u201cWe didn't finish our job the last two years. It's win the World Series. That's the mindset for us and for everybody here.\u201d",
      "Perdomo usually hits lower in the batting order, but has a good eye at the plate with a .344 on-base percentage last season. Now entering his fifth season, the shortstop is well-liked in the clubhouse and emerging as a leader after the departure of first baseman Christian Walker, who signed with the Houston Astros.",
      "\u201cThe way he plays the baseball game is the way we try to play the baseball game,\u201d D-backs GM Mike Hazen said. \u201cIt's smart, fast and dynamic on both sides of the ball.\"",
      "The Diamondbacks have been aggressive this offseason as they try to compete with the big-spending Los Angeles Dodgers, San Diego Padres and San Francisco Giants in the NL West. Arizona's biggest move was signing ace pitcher Corbin Burnes to a $210 million, six-year deal in December.",

      "French organizers of the 2030 Winter Games were united Tuesday to unveil the team given the tightest schedule of any modern Olympics",
      "LYON, France -- Just five years before the opening ceremony, French organizers of the 2030 Winter Games put on a united front Tuesday to unveil the team given the tightest schedule of any modern Olympics.",
      "The 2030 French Alps Olympics must tie together snow and sliding venues in the mountains with skating and curling arenas among the palm trees on the Riviera coastal city Nice.",
      "A bid hastily pulled together in 2023 was approved by the International Olympic Committee only last July \u2014 in Paris on the eve of a hugely successful Summer Games \u2014 and even then with a special exemption to wait several months for guarantees from the national government.",
      "The project is now led by Edgar Grospiron, a freestyle skiing gold medalist in 1992 when France last hosted the Winter Games and a late hire in recent days as president of the organizing committee.",
      "\u201cWhat\u2019s important now is that from now we organize it, we deliver it,\u201d Grospiron said at a slick launch event at the stadium of soccer club Lyon, aiming for a Winter Games that is \"impeccable and irreproachable.\u201d",
      "Grospiron spoke after a parade of national and regional political figures, including sports minister Marie Barsacq and Michel Barnier, who as prime minister last October signed off the government\u2019s support.",
      "Layers of lawmakers\u2019 support has been vital to a project that still needs an ice arena built in Nice and a venue for speed skating, which could end up in Italy or the Netherlands.",
      "The popular success and expertise gained at the Paris Olympics was stressed as a foundation for the Winter Games which used to be given seven years by the IOC to organize.",
      "\u201cWe are not starting from zero,\u201d the IOC\u2019s executive director of Olympic Games, Christophe Dubi, told The Associated Press. \u201cWe had a great shortcut and it\u2019s called Paris 2024. Many of those things we can cut and paste.\u201d",
      "The IOC started 2023 with no clear candidate and a shrinking pool of options to host a cost-effective and sustainable Winter Games in 2030. A Swedish project centered on Stockholm seemed favored before a French bid emerged out of the IOC\u2019s strong pre-Paris relations with President Emmanuel Macron and national Olympic officials.",
      "France's win was confirmed on the same day in Paris as the 2034 Winter Games were awarded to Salt Lake City with four extra years to prepare. Its organizing team was unveiled in Utah last week.",
      "\u201cWe are the cradle of Olympism,\u201d said David Lappartient, leader of the French Olympic body and a candidate in the IOC presidential election next month. France already hosted three Summer Games in Paris and three previous Winter Games: Chamonix in 1924, Grenoble in 1968 and Albertville in 1992 that Barnier helped organize.",
      "The French Alps organizing committee has a prudent operational budget of 2 billion euros ($2.1 billion) and speakers Tuesday stressed the need for a project that was financially sober and in moderation.",
      "A key theme also was adapting to climate change and delivering an Olympics and subsequent Paralympic Winter Games that are sustainable.",
      "\u201cI would never pretend that the games want to save the world,\u201d Grospiron said, \u201cbut I think we can contribute to changing how it moves forward.\u201d",
      "Rising to environmental challenges was stressed by the head of the Provence-Alpes-C\u00f4te d\u2019Azur region that includes Nice and Marseille. Renaud Muselier cautioned that in dealing with the reality of climate change \u201cdefeatism has the same effect as skepticism.\u201d",

      "The Red Sox\u2019s ballyhooed signing of Alex Bregman was met with considerable resistance Monday when Rafael Devers said he wouldn\u2019t cede third base",
      "FORT MYERS, Fla. -- The Red Sox's ballyhooed signing of Alex Bregman was met with considerable resistance Monday when Rafael Devers said he wouldn't cede third base.",
      "Devers, a three-time All-Star, has played the hot corner for Boston since 2017 and himself received a major deal just two years ago.",
      "\u201cThird base is my position,\u201d Devers said through an interpreter. \u201cIt's what I play. I don't know what their plans are. We had a conversation. I made it clear on what my desires were. Whatever happens from here, I don't know.\u201d",
      "When asked if he would be willing to become a designated hitter, without waiting for his interpreter to relay the question, Devers said, \u201cNo.\u201d",
      "The Red Sox signed Bregman on Saturday to a three-year, $120 million contract that includes a $5 million signing bonus. A two-time All-Star, Bregman has hit more than 20 home runs each of the past three seasons.",
      "Landing Bregman was a key, the Red Sox hoped, to ending a stretch in which Boston has missed the playoffs five of the past six years.",
      "Devers signed an 11-year, $331 million contract in January 2021 and has been even more productive in recent seasons than Bregman. Devers hit 28 homers and drove in 83 runs last season despite playing just 138 games because of an assortment of injuries. The year before, he had 33 homers and 100 RBIs while playing in 153 games.",
      "That production and the financial investment by the Red Sox could give Devers some leverage in his push to stay at third.",
      "Red Sox manager Alex Cora noted that Devers \u201cwas very vocal last year\u201d about how the club needed to improve.",
      "\u201cThe decisions that are going to be made here about roster construction and about what we're going to do in the future, we're going to make sure we have the best team possible out there,\u201d Cora said. \"(Devers) has a lot of pride. We know that. He feels like he's a third baseman. He's going to work out as a third baseman and then we'll make decisions accordingly.",
      "\u201cI think here it's not about Bregman or Devers or Cora. It's about the Red Sox. Whatever decision we make is for the benefit of the team.\u201d",
      "Cora said Bregman could wind up at second or third base and Devers at third or DH.",
      "\u201cThere's competition here,\u201d Cora said. \u201cI think flexibility and versatility are huge for us.\u201d",

The truck then turned \u201cand entered the opposite lane of travel, nearly going into the ditch,\u201d a Baldwin County sheriff's deputy wrote.",

      "Cleveland was charged with driving under the influence of alcohol, and failing to stay in his lane.",
      "Jail booking records do not list an attorney who could speak on Cleveland's behalf. The Associated Press sent emails seeking comment to multiple representatives of the Ravens organization.",
      "The 6-foot-6 (198-centimeter), 343-pound (156-kilo) Cleveland was nicknamed \u201cBig Country\u201d during his college career at Georgia, where he was a first-team All-SEC pick and Associated Press third-team All-American in the COVID-19-shortened 2020 season.",
      "Cleveland has appeared in 54 games for Baltimore since the Ravens selected him in the third round of the 2021 NFL draft.",
      "He has battled injuries as a pro, started seven career games and played mostly on special teams this past season. He was wearing a medical boot when he was pulled over in Georgia, the incident report states. He told the deputy he had pain in his ankle and didn't want to continue some of the field sobriety tests that involved walking and standing.",

International cricket has three main formats: test matches, which can last up to five days; one-dayers (or ODIs), where both teams are allocated 50 overs to bat and matches take up to 8 hours; and Twenty20s (or T20s), where both innings comprise 20 overs and games last just a few hours.",

      "Two former Champions Trophy winners \u2014 Sri Lanka and the West Indies \u2014 didn\u2019t qualify for the ninth edition, which include 15 games across 19 days.",

      "Pittsburgh Pirates ace Paul Skenes is focused on becoming a more complete pitcher in 2024",
      "BRADENTON, Fla. -- Paul Skenes spent his rookie season dutifully following the Pittsburgh Pirates\u2019 plan to bring their young ace along as slowly and safely as possible.",
      "It worked. Maybe better than all involved imagined during an electrifying 2024 in which the towering right-hander started the All-Star Game and captured the National League Rookie of the Year award while becoming perhaps the game's hottest young star in a decade.",
      "It was an incredible ride to be sure. Yet when Skenes arrived this week for his second spring training, he did it with the kind of freedom he lacked a year ago.",
      "Oh, and a couple of new pitches, too.",
      "The 22-year-old is tinkering with adding a cutter and a running two-seam fastball to an arsenal that already includes a four-seamer that tops out north of 100 mph and a \u201csplinker\u201d that was one of the best put-away pitches in the majors in 2024.",
      "\u201cJust trying to create more swing decisions,\u201d Skenes said.",
      "Or, nondecisions.",
      "Veteran second baseman Adam Frazier, who reunited with the Pirates last month, volunteered to be the first batter to face Skenes during a live batting practice on Saturday. The first pitch the left-handed hitting Frazier saw was a splinker that darted down and away while catching the outside corner of the strike zone.",
      "Frazier's bat never moved as the ball whizzed by, a pitch \u201cnobody is going to do anything with,\u201d as the former All-Star put it.",
      "\u201cIf you hit it, you\u2019re hitting it straight in the ground,\u201d Frazier added. \u201cSo it\u2019s like, \u2018All right, strap it on and get ready.\u2019\u201d",
      "Frazier, second baseman Nick Gonzales and first baseman Darick Hall all failed to make solid contact off Skenes during a 25-pitch session in which a few dozen fans surrounded one of the practice fields at Pirates City, many of them with their phones raised to capture the first glimpse of Skenes in 2025.",
      "Skenes called the attention he commands \u201ca privilege.\" It's also, however, not a priority. The admitted perfectionist is too consumed with his craft to cultivate his celebrity. And for as dominant as he was at times last summer, Skenes knows he's hardly a finished product after 23 major league starts.",
      "Yes, his numbers as a rookie \u2014 an 11-3 record with a 1.96 ERA and 170 strikeouts in 133 innings \u2014 were dazzling. They were also just the beginning.",
      "While Skenes stressed he is not looking to get away from his identity as a strikeout pitcher, he is trying to find a way to get to strike three a little more quickly.",
      "\u201cGetting ahead, winning the 0-0, 0-1, 1-1 (pitches), winning those counts, that stuff is important,\u201d he said.",
      "That's where adding a couple of more options to a repertoire that already includes six different pitches comes in.",
      "\u201cAnything that looks like a fastball and doesn\u2019t end up being a fastball (helps),\u201d pitching coach Oscar Marin said. \u201cI think we all know how special his fastballs are. (More options are) just something that is going to really open up the zone for him as well.\u201d",
      "There is a sense of ease around Skenes that he didn't necessarily have when he arrived at spring training a year ago as a rookie just trying to make the team.",
      "He didn't initially, not because he wasn't good enough, but because it was part of the team's plan to methodically build him up rather than rush him to the majors.",
      "While Skenes admits that was \u201cfrustrating,\u201d he understands it was the right call.",
      "\u201cThey did a really good job with me last year,\" he said. \u201cI kind of knew, as much as I didn\u2019t want to believe it, that that was how it was going to be when I came into camp.\u201d",
      "Not this time. Skenes is a lock to be on the roster when the Pirates break camp. The questions now are whether he'll be the opening day starter \u2014 something Skenes thinks would be \u201creally cool\u201d \u2014 and if Pittsburgh is ready to take a step forward into contention despite a relatively quiet offseason.",
      "Skenes knows his performance at the top of the rotation is a vital part of that equation. He also knows it's hardly only up to him. It's one of the many reasons he plans to take on a more visible leadership role in 2025.",
      "There were small signs under a near-cloudless mid-February sky. Wearing long sleeves underneath his black No. 30 jersey, his gray pants pulled up to the knees to expose Pittsburgh-centric socks, Skenes dapped up support staff, chatted with video coordinator Kevin Roach and made it a point to wait for veteran pitcher Mitch Keller to finish before the two slowly walked off the practice fields together.",
      "The jitters he felt in 2024 are a rapidly fading memory. He has a little more experience to go with his ever-present swagger and the kind of stuff that few can match.",
      "Skenes wasn't sure how fast he was throwing on Saturday, though he smiled while noting that it was probably faster than 94 mph because if it wasn't \u201csome other people would have been concerned if it were.\u201d",
      "There are no concerns about Skenes at the moment, just optimism at the possibilities. Marin knows the season Skenes put together as a rookie will be difficult to match but allowed \u201cthat's the expectation.\u201d",
      "The team's expectation anyway. While he hasn't come out and said it, Skenes is likely aiming even higher.",
      "\u201cHis expectation is probably a little bit different than mine,\" Marin said. \u201cBut that\u2019s what makes him great.\u201d",

      "Huawei reached the position despite \u201cnot getting access to chips, to Google services. All these things basically have been huge roadblocks in front of Huawei,\u201d Ma said, adding that the \u201cresurgence we're seeing from them over the past year has been quite a bit of a victory.\"",
      "Huawei, China\u2019s first global tech brand, is at the center of a U.S.-China battle over trade and technology. Washington in 2019 severed Huawei\u2019s access to U.S. components and technology, including Google\u2019s music and other smartphone services, making Huawei's phone less appealing to users. It has also barred global vendors from using U.S. technology to produce components for Huawei.",
      "American officials say Huawei is a security risk, which the company denies. China\u2019s government has accused Washington of misusing security warnings to contain a rising competitor to U.S. technology companies.",
      "Huawei launched the Mate XT in China on Sept. 20 last year, the same day Apple launched its iPhone 16 series in global markets. But with its steep price tag, the Mate XT \u201cis not a mainstream product that people are going to jump for,\u201d Ma said.",
      "At the Kuala Lumpur event, Huawei also unveiled its MatePad Pro tablet and Free Arc, its first open-ear earbuds with ear hooks and other wearable devices.",
      "While Huawei\u2019s cutting-edge devices showcase its technological prowess, its long-term success remains uncertain given ongoing challenges over global supply chain constraints, chip availability and limitations on the software ecosystem, said Ruby Lu, an analyst with the research firm TrendForce.",
      "\"System limitations, particularly the lack of Google Mobile Services, means its international market potential remains constrained,\u201d Lu said.",
      "IDC's Ma said Huawei dominated the foldable phone market in China with 49% market share last year. In the global market, it had 23% market share, trailing behind Samsung's 33% share in 2024, he said. IDC predicted that total foldable phone shipments worldwide could surge to 45.7 million units by 2028, from over 20 million last year.",
      "While most major brands have entered the foldable segments, Lu said Apple has yet to release a competing product.",
      "\u201cOnce Apple enters the market, it is expected to significantly influence and stimulate further growth in the foldable phone sector,\u201d Lu added."

      "Why did humans start speaking",
      "Why did humans start speaking? Scientists suggest genetics played a big role \u2013 and they say the evolution of this singular ability was key to our survival.",
      "A new study links a particular gene to the ancient origins of spoken language, proposing that a protein variant found only in humans may have helped us communicate in a novel way. Speech allowed us to share information, coordinate activities and pass down knowledge, giving us an edge over extinct cousins like Neanderthals and Denisovans.",
      "The new study is \u201ca good first step to start looking at the specific genes\u201d that may affect speech and language development, said Liza Finestack at the University of Minnesota, who was not involved with the research.",
      "What scientists learn may someday even help people with speech problems.",
      "The genetic variant researchers were looking at was one of a variety of genes \"that contributed to the emergence of Homo sapiens as the dominant species, which we are today\u201d said Dr. Robert Darnell, an author of the study published Tuesday in the journal Nature Communications.",
      "Darnell has been studying the protein \u2013 called NOVA1 and known to be crucial to brain development \u2013 since the early 1990s. For the latest research, scientists in his lab at New York's Rockefeller University used CRISPR gene editing to replace the NOVA1 protein found in mice with the exclusively human type to test the real-life effects of the genetic variant. To their surprise, it changed the way the animals vocalized when they called out to each other.",
      "Baby mice with the human variant squeaked differently than normal littermates when their mom came around. Adult male mice with the variant chirped differently than their normal counterparts when they saw a female in heat.",
      "Both are settings where mice are motivated to speak, Darnell said, \u201cand they spoke differently\" with the human variant, illustrating its role in speech.",
      "This isn't the first time a gene has been linked to speech. In 2001, British scientists said they had discovered the first gene tied to a language and speech disorder.",
      "Called FOXP2, it was referred to as the human language gene. But though FOXP2 is involved in human language, it turned out that the variant in modern humans wasn't unique to us. Later research found it was shared with Neanderthals. The NOVA1 variant in modern humans, on the other hand, is found exclusively in our species, Darnell said.",
      "The presence of a gene variant isn't the only reason people can speak. The ability also depends on things like anatomical features in the human throat and areas of the brain that work together to allow people to speak and understand language.",
      "Darnell hopes the recent work not only helps people better understand their origins but also eventually leads to new ways to treat speech-related problems.",
      "University of Minnesota's Finestack said it\u2019s more likely the genetic findings might someday allow scientists to detect, very early in life, who might need speech and language interventions.",
      "\u201cThat\u2019s certainly a possibility,\u201d she said.",

      "TEL AVIV, Israel -- U.S. tech giants have quietly empowered Israel to track and kill many more alleged militants more quickly in Gaza and Lebanon through a sharp spike in artificial intelligence and computing services. But the number of civilians killed has also soared, fueling fears that these tools are contributing to the deaths of innocent people.",
      "Militaries have for years hired private companies to build custom autonomous weapons. However, Israel's recent wars mark a leading instance in which commercial AI models made in the United States have been used in active warfare, despite concerns that they were not originally developed to help decide who lives and who dies.",
      "The Israeli military uses AI to sift through vast troves of intelligence, intercepted communications and surveillance to find suspicious speech or behavior and learn the movements of its enemies. After a deadly surprise attack by Hamas militants on Oct. 7, 2023, its use of Microsoft and OpenAI technology skyrocketed, an Associated Press investigation found. The investigation also revealed new details of how AI systems select targets and ways they can go wrong, including faulty data or flawed algorithms. It was based on internal documents, data and exclusive interviews with current and former Israeli officials and company employees.",
      "\u201cThis is the first confirmation we have gotten that commercial AI models are directly being used in warfare,\u201d said Heidy Khlaaf, chief AI scientist at the AI Now Institute and former senior safety engineer at OpenAI. \u201cThe implications are enormous for the role of tech in enabling this type of unethical and unlawful warfare going forward.\u201d",
      "As U.S. tech titans ascend to prominent roles under President Donald Trump, the AP\u2019s findings raise questions about Silicon Valley\u2019s role in the future of automated warfare. Microsoft expects its partnership with the Israeli military to grow, and what happens with Israel may help determine the use of these emerging technologies around the world.",
      "The Israeli military\u2019s usage of Microsoft and OpenAI artificial intelligence spiked last March to nearly 200 times higher than before the week leading up to the Oct. 7 attack, the AP found in reviewing internal company information. The amount of data it stored on Microsoft servers doubled between that time and July 2024 to more than 13.6 petabytes \u2014 roughly 350 times the digital memory needed to store every book in the Library of Congress. Usage of Microsoft\u2019s huge banks of computer servers by the military also rose by almost two-thirds in the first two months of the war alone.",
      "Israel\u2019s goal after the attack that killed about 1,200 people and took over 250 hostages was to eradicate Hamas, and its military has called AI a \u201cgame changer\u201d in yielding targets more swiftly. Since the war started, more than 50,000 people have died in Gaza and Lebanon and nearly 70% of the buildings in Gaza have been devastated, according to health ministries in Gaza and Lebanon.",
      "The AP\u2019s investigation drew on interviews with six current and former members of the Israeli army, including three reserve intelligence officers. Most spoke on condition of anonymity because they were not authorized to discuss sensitive military operations.",
      "The AP also interviewed 14 current and former employees inside Microsoft, OpenAI, Google and Amazon, most of whom also spoke anonymously for fear of retribution. Journalists reviewed internal company data and documents, including one detailing the terms of a $133 million contract between Microsoft and Israel\u2019s Ministry of Defense.",
      "The Israeli military says its analysts use AI-enabled systems to help identify targets but independently examine them together with high-ranking officers to meet international law, weighing the military advantage against the collateral damage. A senior Israeli intelligence official authorized to speak to the AP said lawful military targets may include combatants fighting against Israel, wherever they are, and buildings used by militants. Officials insist that even when AI plays a role, there are always several layers of humans in the loop.",
      "\u201cThese AI tools make the intelligence process more accurate and more effective,\u201d said an Israeli military statement to the AP. \u201c\u2060They make more targets faster, but not at the expense of accuracy, and many times in this war they\u2019ve been able to minimize civilian casualties.\u201d",
      "The Israeli military declined to answer detailed written questions from the AP about its use of commercial AI products from American tech companies.",
      "Microsoft declined to comment for this story and did not respond to a detailed list of written questions about cloud and AI services provided to the Israeli military. In a statement on its website, the company says it is committed \u201cto champion the positive role of technology across the globe.\u201d In its 40-page Responsible AI Transparency Report for 2024, Microsoft pledges to manage the risks of AI throughout development \u201cto reduce the risk of harm,\u201d and does not mention its lucrative military contracts.",
      "Advanced AI models are provided through OpenAI, the maker of ChatGPT, through Microsoft\u2019s Azure cloud platform, where they are purchased by the Israeli military, the documents and data show. Microsoft has been OpenAI's largest investor. OpenAI said it does not have a partnership with Israel's military, and its usage policies say its customers should not use its products to develop weapons, destroy property or harm people. About a year ago, however, OpenAI changed its terms of use from barring military use to allowing for \u201cnational security use cases that align with our mission.\u201d",
      "It\u2019s extremely hard to identify when AI systems enable errors because they are used with so many other forms of intelligence, including human intelligence, sources said. But together they can lead to wrongful deaths.",
      "In November 2023, Hoda Hijazi was fleeing with her three young daughters and her mother from clashes between Israel and Hamas ally Hezbollah on the Lebanese border when their car was bombed.",
      "Before they left, the adults told the girls to play in front of the house so that Israeli drones would know they were traveling with children. The women and girls drove alongside Hijazi\u2019s uncle, Samir Ayoub, a journalist with a leftist radio station, who was caravanning in his own car. They heard the frenetic buzz of a drone very low overhead.",
      "Soon, an airstrike hit the car Hijazi was driving. It careened down a slope and burst into flames. Ayoub managed to pull Hijazi out, but her mother \u2014 Ayoub\u2019s sister \u2014 and the three girls \u2014 Rimas, 14, Taline, 12, and Liane, 10 \u2014 were dead.",
      "Before they left their home, Hijazi recalled, one of the girls had insisted on taking pictures of the cats in the garden \u201cbecause maybe we won\u2019t see them again.\u201d",
      "In the end, she said, \u201cthe cats survived and the girls are gone.\u201d",
      "Video footage from a security camera at a convenience store shortly before the strike showed the Hijazi family in a Hyundai SUV, with the mother and one of the girls loading jugs of water. The family says the video proves Israeli drones should have seen the women and children.",
      "The day after the family was hit, the Israeli military released video of the strike along with a package of similar videos and photos. A statement released with the images said Israeli fighter jets had \u201cstruck just over 450 Hamas targets.\" The AP\u2019s visual analysis matched the road and other geographical features in the Israeli military video to satellite imagery of the location where the three girls died, 1 mile (1.7 kilometers) from the store.",
      "An Israeli intelligence officer told the AP that AI has been used to help pinpoint all targets in the past three years. In this case, AI likely pinpointed a residence, and other intelligence gathering could have placed a person there. At some point, the car left the residence.",
      "Humans in the target room would have decided to strike. The error could have happened at any point, he said: Previous faulty information could have flagged the wrong residence, or they could have hit the wrong vehicle.",
      "The AP also saw a message from a second source with knowledge of that airstrike who confirmed it was a mistake, but didn\u2019t elaborate.",
      "A spokesperson for the Israeli military denied that AI systems were used during the airstrike itself, but refused to answer whether AI helped select the target or whether it was wrong. The military told the AP that officials examined the incident and expressed \u201csorrow for the outcome.\u201d",
      "Microsoft and the San Francisco-based startup OpenAI are among a legion of U.S. tech firms that have supported Israel\u2019s wars in recent years.",
      "Google and Amazon provide cloud computing and AI services to the Israeli military under \u201cProject Nimbus,\u201d a $1.2 billion contract signed in 2021 when Israel first tested out its in-house AI-powered targeting systems. The military has used Cisco and Dell server farms or data centers. Red Hat, an independent IBM subsidiary, also has provided cloud computing technologies to the Israeli military, and Palantir Technologies, a Microsoft partner in U.S. defense contracts, has a \u201cstrategic partnership\u201d providing AI systems to help Israel\u2019s war efforts.",
      "Google said it is committed to responsibly developing and deploying AI \u201cthat protects people, promotes global growth, and supports national security.\u201d Dell provided a statement saying the company commits to the highest standards in working with public and private organizations globally, including in Israel. Red Hat spokesperson Allison Showalter said the company is proud of its global customers, who comply with Red Hat's terms to adhere to applicable laws and regulations.",
      "Palantir, Cisco and Oracle did not respond to requests for comment. Amazon declined to comment.",
      "The Israeli military uses Microsoft Azure to compile information gathered through mass surveillance, which it transcribes and translates, including phone calls, texts and audio messages, according to an Israeli intelligence officer who works with the systems. That data can then be cross-checked with Israel\u2019s in-house targeting systems and vice versa.",
      "He said he relies on Azure to quickly search for terms and patterns within massive text troves, such as finding conversations between two people within a 50-page document. Azure also can find people giving directions to one another in the text, which can then be cross-referenced with the military\u2019s own AI systems to pinpoint locations.",
      "The Microsoft data AP reviewed shows that since the Oct. 7 attack, the Israeli military has made heavy use of transcription and translation tools and OpenAI models, although it does not detail which. Typically, AI models that transcribe and translate perform best in English. OpenAI has acknowledged that its popular AI-powered translation model Whisper, which can transcribe and translate into multiple languages including Arabic, can make up text that no one said, including adding racial commentary and violent rhetoric.",
      "\u201cShould we be basing these decisions on things that the model could be making up?\u201d said Joshua Kroll, an assistant professor of computer science at the Naval Postgraduate School in Monterey, California, who spoke to the AP in his personal capacity, not reflecting the views of the U.S. government.",
      "The Israeli military said any phone conversation translated from Arabic or intelligence used in identifying a target has to be reviewed by an Arabic-speaking officer.",
      "Errors can still happen for many reasons involving AI, said Israeli military officers who have worked with the targeting systems and other tech experts. One intelligence officer said he had seen targeting mistakes that relied on incorrect machine translations from Arabic to Hebrew.",
      "The Arabic word describing the grip on the launch tube for a rocket-propelled grenade is the same as the word for \u201cpayment.\u201d In one instance the machine translated it wrong, and the person verifying the translation initially didn\u2019t catch the error, he said, which could have added people speaking about payments to target lists. The officer was there by chance and caught the problem, he said.",
      "Intercepted phone calls tied to a person\u2019s profile also include the time the person called and the names and numbers of those on the call. But it takes an extra step to listen to and verify the original audio, or to see a translated transcript.",
      "Sometimes the data attached to people\u2019s profiles is wrong. For example, the system misidentified a list of high school students as potential militants, according to the officer. An Excel spreadsheet attached to several people\u2019s profiles titled \u201cfinals\u201d in Arabic, contained at least 1,000 students\u2019 names on an exam list in one area of Gaza, he said. This was the only piece of incriminating evidence attached to people\u2019s files, he said, and had he not caught the mistake, those Palestinians could have been wrongly flagged.",
      "He said he also worried that young officers, some still younger than 20, under pressure to find targets quickly with the help of AI would jump to conclusions.",
      "AI alone could lead to the wrong conclusion, said another soldier who worked with the targeting systems. For example, AI might flag a house owned by someone linked to Hamas who does not live there. Before the house is hit, humans must confirm who is actually in it, he said.",
      "\u201cObviously there are things that I live peacefully with and things that I could have done better in some targeted attacks that I\u2019m responsible for,\u201d the soldier told the AP. \u201cIt\u2019s war, things happen, mistakes happen, we are human.\u201d",
      "Tal Mimran served 10 years as a reserve legal officer for the Israeli military, and on three NATO working groups examining the use of new technologies, including AI, in warfare. Previously, he said, it took a team of up to 20 people a day or more to review and approve a single airstrike. Now, with AI systems, the military is approving hundreds a week.",
      "Mimran said over-reliance on AI could harden people\u2019s existing biases.",
      "\u201cConfirmation bias can prevent people from investigating on their own,\u201d said Mimran, who teaches cyber law policy. \u201cSome people might be lazy, but others might be afraid to go against the machine and be wrong and make a mistake.\u201d",
      "Among U.S. tech firms, Microsoft has had an especially close relationship with the Israeli military spanning decades.",
      "That relationship, alongside those with other tech companies, stepped up after the Hamas attack. Israel\u2019s war response strained its own servers and increased its reliance on outside, third-party vendors, according to a presentation last year by the military\u2019s top information technology officer. As she described how AI had provided Israel \u201cvery significant operational effectiveness\u201d in Gaza, the logos of Microsoft Azure, Google Cloud and Amazon Web Services appeared on a large screen behind her.",
      "\u201cWe\u2019ve already reached a point where our systems really need it,\u201d said Col. Racheli Dembinsky, commander of the Center of Computing and Information Systems, known by its Hebrew acronym, Mamram.",
      "One three-year contract between Microsoft and the Israeli Ministry of Defense began in 2021 and was worth $133 million, making it the company's second largest military customer globally after the U.S., according to a document reviewed by the AP. The Israeli military is classified within Microsoft as an \u201cS500\u201d client, meaning that it gets top priority as one of the company's most important customers globally.",
      "The Israeli military's service agreements with Microsoft include at least 635 individual subscriptions listed under specific divisions, units, bases or project code words. Subscription names reviewed by the AP included \u201cMamram\u201d and \u201c8200,\u201d an elite intelligence unit known for its technological prowess.",
      "One urgent Azure support ticket filed about two weeks after the Oct. 7 attack asked for delays of planned maintenance outages for the rest of the year due to the war, because any downtime could have \u201ca direct impact on life-saving systems.\u201d The request was flagged as being from \u201cGlilot \u2013 8200,\u201d a highly secure army base that houses Unit 8200, responsible for clandestine operations, collecting signal intelligence and code decryption, cyber warfare and surveillance.",
      "Records show Microsoft\u2019s global Azure support team responded to about 130 direct requests from the Israeli military through the first 10 months of the war. Microsoft\u2019s consulting services unit also works closely with Israel\u2019s military, which represented half of that section\u2019s overall revenue, an internal document said.",
      "Within Israel, a team of at least nine Microsoft employees is dedicated to serving the military\u2019s account. Among them is a senior executive who served 14 years in Unit 8200 and a former IT leader for military intelligence, according to their online resumes. Microsoft data is housed in server farms within two massive buildings outside Tel Aviv, enclosed behind high walls topped with barbed wire. Microsoft also operates a 46,000-square-meter corporate campus in Herzliya, north of Tel Aviv, and another office in Gav-Yam in southern Israel, which has displayed a large Israeli flag.",
      "The Israel Defense Forces has long been at the forefront of deploying artificial intelligence for military use. In early 2021, it launched Gospel, an AI tool that sorts through Israel\u2019s vast array of digitized information to suggest targets for potential strikes. It also developed Lavender, which uses machine learning to filter out requested criteria from intelligence databases and narrow down lists of potential targets, including people.",
      "Lavender ranks people between 0 and 100 based on how likely it is they are a militant, said an intelligence officer who used the systems. The ranking is based on intelligence, such as the person\u2019s family tree, if someone\u2019s father is a known militant who served time, and intercepted phone calls, he said.",
      "In May 2021, the Israeli military launched what Israeli intelligence officials described as their \u201cFirst AI War,\u201d an 11-day bombing campaign against Hamas. At the time, Israeli military officials described AI as a \u201cforce-multiplier,\u201d allowing them to carry out far more airstrikes than in prior conflicts.",
      "A 2021 post by the Israeli military also described the stakes surrounding the use of AI in war: \u201cUnlike in the realms of AdTech and Gaming, wrong decisions in the realm of intelligence may cost lives,\u201d it read. The same post described the military\u2019s incorporation of AI approaches to analyze the emotional tone of communications, a technique experts have found can fail to pick slang, jargon or nuance in people\u2019s speech.",
      "The relationship between tech companies and the Israeli military also has ramifications in the U.S., where some employees have raised ethical concerns.",
      "In October, Microsoft fired two workers for helping organize an unauthorized lunchtime vigil for Palestinian refugees at its corporate campus in Redmond, Washington. Microsoft said at the time that it ended the employment of some people \u201cin accordance with internal policy\u201d but declined to give details.",
      "Hossam Nasr, one of the employees fired by Microsoft who works with the advocacy group No Azure for Apartheid, said he and former colleagues are pushing for Microsoft to stop selling cloud and AI services to the Israeli military.",

      "In April, Google fired about 50 of its workers over a sit-in at the company\u2019s California headquarters protesting the war in Gaza.",
      "Former Google software engineer Emaan Haseem was among those fired. Haseem said she worked on a team that helped test the reliability of a \u201csovereign cloud\u201d \u2014 a secure system of servers kept so separate from the rest of Google\u2019s global cloud infrastructure that even the company itself couldn't access or track the data it stores. She later learned through media reports that Google was building a sovereign cloud for Israel.",
      "\u201cIt seemed to be more and more obvious that we are literally just trying to design something where we won\u2019t have to care about how our clients are using it, and if they\u2019re using it unfairly or unethically,\u201d Haseem said.",
      "Google said the employees were fired because they disrupted work spaces and made colleagues feel unsafe.

      "President Claudia Sheinbaum shared a letter addressed to her government from Cris Turner, Google\u2019s vice president of government affairs and public policy. It says that Google will not change the policy it outlined after U.S. President Donald Trump declared the body of water the Gulf of America.",
      "\u201cWe will wait for Google\u2019s response and if not, we will proceed to court,\u201d Sheinbaum said Monday during a morning press briefing.",
      "As it stands, the gulf appears in Google Maps as Gulf of America within the United States, as Gulf of Mexico within Mexico and Gulf of Mexico (Gulf of America) elsewhere. Turner in his letter said the company was using Gulf of America to follow \u201clongstanding maps policies impartially and consistently across all regions\" and that the company was willing to meet in person with the Mexican government.",
      "\u201cWhile international treaties and conventions are not intended to regulate how private mapping providers represent geographic features, it is our consistent policy to consult multiple authoritative sources to provide the most up to date and accurate representation of the world,\" he wrote.",
      "Mexico has argued that the mapping policy violates Mexican sovereignty because the U.S. only has jurisdiction over around 46% of the Gulf. The rest is controlled by Mexico, which controls 49% and Cuba, which controls around 5%. The name Gulf of Mexico dates back to 1607 and is recognized by the United Nations.",

      "The man who led a NASA facility that shouldered much of the blame for the 1986 space shuttle Challenger explosion has died",
      "William Ray Lucas, who led the NASA facility that shouldered much of the blame for the 1986 explosion of the space shuttle Challenger, has died. Lucas was 102.",
      "Lucas died Monday at his home in Huntsville, Alabama, according to an obituary published Friday by Laughlin Service Funeral Home in Huntsville. A funeral service has been set for March 1 on what would have been his 103rd birthday, funeral director Bryan Peek said Saturday.",
      "Lucas was director of the Marshall Space Flight Center in Huntsville when the Challenger exploded on Jan. 28, 1986, just 73 seconds after liftoff from Cape Canaveral, Florida. It was the deadliest U.S. space flight disaster at that time.",
      "The explosion killed all seven crew members, including schoolteacher Christa McAuliffe, who had been tapped to become the first U.S. civilian to travel to space. Her inclusion on the flight meant thousands of schoolchildren across the country were watching the Challenger's launch and witnessed the televised disaster in real time.",
      "A presidential commission charged with investigating the cause of the explosion pointed to the shuttle's solid-fuel booster rockets as the likely culprit and criticized NASA managers for not taking safety concerns surrounding the rockets more seriously. The Marshall center had supervised development of the rockets.",
      "Lucas pushed back on the criticism, telling reporters a month after the explosion that it was too soon to pinpoint the cause of the explosion, adding, \u201cI think it was a sound decision to launch.\"",
      "But within months he had resigned, just days ahead of the release of a commission report blaming faulty design of the booster rockets.",
      "The explosion and resulting shakeup within NASA overshadowed what was an otherwise stellar career for Lucas, who was born and raised in rural western Tennessee and graduated from high school in 1939 as the class valedictorian. He earned a bachelor of science degree from Memphis State College, served in the U.S. Navy during World War II and later earned a doctorate in metallurgy from Vanderbilt University.",
      "Lucas began his career in the guided missile development division of the U.S. Army's Redstone Arsenal near Huntsville. He became a charter member of the Marshall Space Flight Center when it was established in 1960 before rising through the ranks to become its director in 1974."

      "The Coast Guard said in a statement that the audio clip \u201crecords the suspected acoustic signature of the Titan submersible implosion\u201d on June 18, 2023, the day the submersible went missing.",
      "The implosion of the Titan killed all five people on board and set off a Coast Guard investigation and international debate about the future of private deep-sea travel. The Titan vanished on its way to the wreck of the Titanic in the North Atlantic Ocean, setting off a five-day search that ended with authorities telling the world that the vessel had been destroyed with no survivors.",
      "Concerns were raised after the implosion because of the Titan's unconventional design and its creator's refusal to submit to independent safety checks. OceanGate, the Washington state-based company that owned the submersible, suspended operations in July 2023.",
      "Titan operator Stockton Rush, who co-founded OceanGate, was among those who died in the implosion. The implosion also killed two members of a prominent Pakistani family, Shahzada Dawood and his son Suleman Dawood; British adventurer Hamish Harding; and Titanic expert Paul-Henri Nargeolet.",
      "A Coast Guard panel performing a lengthy investigation into the submersible disaster heard two weeks of testimony last September. The testimony included dramatic moments, such as when a former OceanGate scientific director said the Titan malfunctioned during a dive just a few days before its implosion.",
      "The Coast Guard is expected to release more information about the implosion in the future. A spokesperson for the agency said Wednesday the investigation is still ongoing and a final report will be released after it is completed."

      "Mexican President Claudia Sheinbaum says her government is not ruling out filing a civil lawsuit against Google if it maintains its stance of calling the stretch of sea between northeastern Mexico and the southeastern United States the \u201cGulf of America.\u201d",
      "MEXICO CITY -- Mexican President Claudia Sheinbaum said Thursday that her government wouldn't rule out filing a civil lawsuit against Google if it maintains its stance of calling the stretch of sea between northeastern Mexico and the southeastern United States the \u201cGulf of America.\u201d",
      "The area, long named the Gulf of Mexico across the the world, has gained a geopolitical spotlight in recent weeks after President Donald Trump declared he would change the Gulf's name.",
      "Sheinbaum, in her morning press conference on Thursday, said the president's decree is restricted to the \u201ccontinental shelf of the United States\" because Mexico still controls much of the Gulf. \u201cWe have sovereignty over our continental shelf,\" she said.",
      "Sheinbaum said that despite the fact that her government sent a letter to Google saying that the company was \u201cwrong\u201d and that \u201cthe entire Gulf of Mexico cannot be called the Gulf of America,\" the company has insisted on maintaining the nomenclature.",
      "It was not immediately clear where such a suit would be filed.",
      "Google reported last month on its X account, formerly Twitter, that it maintains a \u201clong-standing practice of applying name changes when they have been updated in official government sources.\u201d",
      "An Associated Press analysis shows that as of Thursday, the user's location and other data was dependent on how the Gulf appeared on Google Maps. If the user is in the United States, the body of water appeared as Gulf of America. If the user was physically in Mexico, it would appear as the Gulf of Mexico. In many other countries across the world it appears as \u201cGulf of Mexico (Gulf of America).\u201d",
      "Sheinbaum has repeatedly defended the name Gulf of Mexico, saying its use dates to 1607 and is recognized by the United Nations.",
      "She has also mentioned that, according to the constitution of Apatzing\u00e1n, the antecedent to Mexico\u2019s first constitution, the North American territory was previously identified as \u201cMexican America\u201d. Sheinbaum has used the example to poke fun at Trump and underscore the international implications of changing the Gulf's name.",
      "In that sense, Sheinbaum said on Thursday that the Mexican government would ask Google to make \u201cMexican America\u201d pop up on the map when searched.",
      "This is not the first time Mexicans and Americans have disagreed on the names of key geographic areas, such as the border river between Texas and the Mexican states of Chihuahua, Coahuila, Nuevo Le\u00f3n and Tamaulipas. Mexico calls it Rio Bravo and for the United States it is the Rio Grande.",
      "This week, the White House barred AP reporters from several events, including some in the Oval Office, saying it was because of the news agency's policy on the name. AP is using \u201cGulf of Mexico\u201d but also acknowledging Trump's renaming of it as well, to ensure that names of geographical features are recognizable around the world."

    "story": [
      "Meteorologists warn that the coldest burst of Arctic air this season is coming to put an icy and prolonged exclamation point on America\u2019s winter of repeated polar vortex invasions starting this weekend",
      "The coldest burst of Arctic air this season is coming to put an icy exclamation point on America's winter of repeated polar vortex invasions, meteorologists warn. And it will stay frozen there all next week.",
      "Different weather forces in the Arctic are combining to push the chilly air that usually stays near the North Pole not just into the United States, but also Europe, several meteorologists tell The Associated Press.",
      "This will be the 10th time this winter that the polar vortex \u2014 which keeps the coldest of Arctic air penned in at the top of the world \u2014 stretches like a rubber band to send some of that big chill south, said Judah Cohen, seasonal forecast director at the private firm Atmospheric and Environmental Research. In a normal winter, it happens maybe two or three times.",
      "This winter, with record snow in New Orleans and drought and destructive wildfires in Southern California, has not been normal.",
      "The latest projected cold outbreak should first hit the northern Rockies and northern Plains Saturday and then stick around all next week. The cold will likely concentrate east of the Rockies with only the far American west and central and southern Florida exempted, meteorologists said.",
      "On Tuesday, expect the Lower 48 states to have an average low of 16.6 degrees Fahrenheit (minus 8.6 Celsius), and then plunge to 14 degrees (minus 10 Celsius) on Wednesday, calculated private meteorologist Ryan Maue, a former National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration chief scientist.",
      "Sometime next week, 89% of the contiguous United States will be below the freezing mark and 27% of the Lower 48 will be below zero (minus 18 degrees Celsius), according to National Weather Service forecasts.",
      "Meteorologists expect strong winds to make the cold feel even worse. Every U.S. state but Hawaii, California and Florida have some or all parts forecast to have a good chance of windchills of 20 degrees or below sometime next week, the National Weather Service predicted.",
      "Kansas, Nebraska, Missouri and Iowa will have \u201cprobably the most impressive\u201d cold, with temperatures as much as 35 degrees (19 degrees Celsius) below what's normal for this time of year, said Zack Taylor, a meteorologist at the weather service's Weather Prediction Center. NOAA weather models predict Wednesday lows below zero in Oklahoma, Colorado, Nebraska, Missouri, Illinois, Iowa, Kansas, Wyoming, Montana, North Dakota, South Dakota, Minnesota, Wisconsin and Michigan.",
      "Some storms \u2014 with flooding, heavy snow or even a nor'easter \u2014 could hit during next week's prolonged cold outbreak, but details on those aren't certain yet, Taylor said.",
      "\u201cEverything, all the stars align, all the wind directions in the atmosphere are dragging the cold polar air out of the Canadian Arctic,\u201d Maue said. \u201cIt\u2019s the depths of winter. Everything signals extreme biting, winter cold. Obviously this isn\u2019t the first polar vortex episode of the winter, but it looks to be the most severe.\u201d",
      "A stretched polar vortex like this one happens lower in the atmosphere and is different than when the polar vortex has sudden warming, weakens and all the cold air escapes south and out of the poles, Cohen said. During stretching events, the polar vortex remains in place and strong, but it also just pulls and bends. Stretch outbreaks are usually slightly milder than the big polar escape events and often hit the United States, not Europe.",
      "Meteorologists are going to want to study why this stretching is happening so often this year, but it could just be natural randomness, said Laura Ciasto, a meteorologist at NOAA's Climate Prediction Center who specializes in the polar vortex.",
      "\u201cWhat we're observing right now is interesting, but not unprecedented,\u201d said Martin Stendel, a scientist at the National Center for Climate Research in Denmark.",
      "Another factor adding to the polar vortex stretching is a big blob of high pressure in the upper atmosphere over Greenland. It's moving west and will push the jet stream \u2014 the river of air that moves weather systems such as storms \u2014 into a pattern that causes polar air to plunge and stay there, Cohen said.",
      "Human-caused climate change may be making the jet stream wavier and more likely to be stuck in that wavy pattern, one of the factors involved, Stendel said.",
      "There haven't been many winters like this in the past to help meteorologists forecast what will happen next and when the cold will finally go away, Maue said.",
      "Despite the unusually cold winter across the U.S., the world remains in an overall warming pattern. Earth's average overall temperature set yet another monthly heat record in January. It was the 18th month of the last 19 that the world hit or passed the internationally agreed upon warming limit of 1.5 C (2.7 F) above pre-industrial times.",

    "published": "Tue, 18 Feb 2025 13:36:29 -0500",
    "summary": "Some members of the Arab American community still believe Donald Trump was a better candidate than Kamala Harris, despite his comments on Gaza.",
    "story": [
      "Kamala Harris faced strong opposition from the community over the war in Gaza.",
      "While President Donald Trump's comments about wanting to \"clean out\" Gaza and forcibly displace its nearly 2 million Palestinians have stirred outrage and accusations of ethnic cleansing among U.S. allies and international law experts, some members of the Arab American community still believe he was a better choice than Vice President Kamala Harris.",
      "\"I don't regret having supported the president. He promised us an end to the war, and he was able to get a ceasefire for us in Gaza, and for that we are grateful. Imagine how many hundreds of Palestinians we've been able to save because of the ceasefire,\" Bishara Bahbah, the chairman for Arab Americans for Peace told ABC News.",
      "Israel and Hamas reached a ceasefire-hostage exchange deal five days before Trump was sworn into office. Both President Joe Biden and Trump have taken credit for the ceasefire deal.",
      "The Biden-Harris administration faced criticism from the Arab American community due to its perceived unconditional support for Israel in its war on Gaza. More than 48,000 Palestinians have been killed in Gaza since the war began after Hamas' surprise attack on Israel on Oct. 7, 2023, killed 1,200 people and hundreds more were taken captive.",
      "\"President Biden was asleep at the wheel, ignoring our our pleas with him. So we decided to tell President Biden that because you have ignored us, we are going to punish you at the polls, and that's one of the major reasons why we decided to establish Arab Americans for Trump,\" Bahbah said.",
      "Many prominent Arab-American advocacy groups and community leaders threw their support behind Trump or Green Party candidate Jill Stein due to the Biden administration's stance on Gaza.",
      "\"For many people, this was very painful. This was not an easy choice, because they were looking at what was going on in Gaza, it was very hard for them to support President Biden,\" and later Vice President Harris, James Zoghby, the cofounder of the Arab American Institute, a political and policy organization that did not support Trump, told ABC News.",
      "Now, with Trump proposing the forcible displacement of Palestinians, and attempting to pressure Egypt and Jordan to take in Palestinians from Gaza -- by threatening to cut billions in aid -- some groups have maintained their support of Trump and are waiting to see what actions he takes and are maintaining their opposition to Harris and Biden.",
      "\"These were grotesque comments. They're unacceptable comments, they're absolutely horrific comments. But you know, at the end of the day, when you put them on a scale, they're comments. It's rhetoric, and I don't feel it is appropriate, nor is it honest to sit here and conflate it with the actions of the Biden-Harris administration, or to try and use that rhetoric to use it as a 'gotcha' moment to people who voted against the Biden-Harris administration,\" Hudhayfah Ahmad, the head of media for the Abandon Harris campaign, told ABC News.",
      "The Abandon Harris campaign, which started as the Abandon Biden campaign, gave both Democratic Party candidates an ultimatum, asking for them to call for an unconditional ceasefire or lose the group's support. Biden and Harris did not meet the deadline set by the group to call for a ceasefire, according to Ahmad.",
      "The Trump campaign was able to garner support from the Muslim American community largely in the last four weeks before the election by making public calls for a ceasefire and vowing to make it happen, Ahmad said.",
      "\"There was never really any support before that,\" Ahmad said.",
      "\"A considerable chunk of people who had previously committed to voting third party, said that I'm going to vote the Trump-Vance ticket at the top of the ticket, and I'll vote Green Party down ballot. I heard this from multiple people in multiple swing states,\" Ahmad said.",
      "But some community leaders felt that despite the actions of the Biden Administration in Gaza, Trump would be worse.",
      "\"I was very much opposed to the hucksters who were trying to sell Jill Stein and to the folks who supported Donald Trump. It was a really not just a bad call, it was a dangerous call. And I felt that despite the insult, despite the hurt, we had a responsibility to think big. [Biden and Harris] were at fault for making our job more difficult,\" Zoghby said.",
      "\"The pain that we knew would occur if Donald Trump got back into the White House was too great to too many people,\" Zoghby said. \"Even though [Biden and Harris] didn't give us what we needed, we still had to recognize that letting Donald Trump back into the White House was was going to be a disaster.\"",
      "Arab Americans for Peace -- an advocacy group formerly called Arab Americans for Trump -- changed its name this month after hearing some of Trump's rhetoric surrounding the displacement of Palestinians, but a leader told ABC News they have not yet withdrawn their support for Trump.",
      "\"Our objective from the very beginning for supporting Trump was peace. We were telling the Biden administration continuously to stop its aid to the Israelis because the Israelis are committing genocide with the arms that are provided by the United States and Western Europe,\" Bahbah said.",
      "\"The change of the name does not mean that we are withdrawing our support for President Trump. It just means that we are going back to the root cause of our very existence, which is the promotion of peace in the Middle East,\" Bahbah said.",
      "Even community leaders who did not support Trump as a candidate argued that he secured a ceasefire.",
      "\"Trump did this ceasefire solely for his own self interest and self image and self benefit. Nothing humanitarian about it at all,\" Ahmad said.",
      "\"It's hard to say that anyone feels regret [for supporting Trump] when you take into consideration that we are no longer seeing a daily influx of videos and pictures of children, men, women, elderly, being butchered with U.S. weaponry. That has stopped completely,\" Ahmad said.",
      "Despite some holding onto support for Trump, his comments on forcibly displacing Palestinians drew sharp criticism from Arab Americans.",
      "\"We are totally opposed to the idea of displacing Palestinians out of Gaza. Gaza belongs to the Palestinians, and it is not for anyone in the world to tell the Palestinians to leave that territory,\" Bahbah said.",
      "\"Like my father, Palestinians are prepared to die on their homeland. And will not immigrate or be forced out of their homeland,\" Bahbah said.",
      "Bahbah said there is still time to see how Trump's rhetoric will play out in the Middle East, but said the next four years will be critical for the Israel-Arab conflict.",
      "He said Arab Americans for Peace decided to support Trump because he promised to end the war in Gaza and ensure lasting peace in the Middle East.",
      "He believes Trump's pressure on Netanyahu stopped the war in Gaza.",
      "But Bahbah said he believes Trump's recent comments on Gaza are providing Israel cover to \"destroy\" the West Bank, drawing attention away from what is happening there.",
      "Other leaders in the Arab community strongly disagreed with Trump's comments on Gaza, and are skeptical of the motivations behind Trump's comments on wanting to forcibly displace Palestinians.",
      "\"I think the purpose is to provide Netanyahu the cover to end this ceasefire after phase one and secure the hostages and go no further. Because I don't think Trump is interested at all in seeing this through on the terms that were negotiated -- which ultimately requires a full Israeli withdrawal and the reconstruction,\" Zoghby said.",
      "Netanyahu has faced criticism for not laying out a plan for what happens in Gaza after the war is over. The ceasefire agreement requires a complete withdrawal of Israeli troops from Gaza, but remains unclear if the ceasefire will reach its final stages.",
      "\"I could get as indignant as everybody else about [Trump's comments] and it being illegal, but there's so much in that involves Israel's behavior toward Palestinians -- and the U.S.'s enablement of Israel doing it -- that is illegal, immoral,\" Zoghby said.",
      "Now they are awaiting on Trump to deliver lasting peace, Bahbah said.",
      "\"We continue to insist and be a voice of reason, telling the president what we want as an Arab American community, and that is lasting peace in the Middle East based on a two state solution, keeping in mind that what brought us to this point is the Biden-Harris administration by allowing Israel to literally destroy the Gaza Strip,\" Bahbah said.",
      "But support for Trump is conditional on what actions he takes, some activists say.",
      "\"We are not beholden to anybody or to any party. We will support whomever we think will end the wars and provide a permanent resolution to the Arab Israeli conflict and peace in the Middle East,\" Bahbah said.",
      "The group Abandon Harris plans to throw its support behind third-party candidates in the future, Ahmad said.",
      "\"Our movement is solely structured behind morals, values, principles -- not parties, not individuals, not candidates,\" Ahmad said.",

      "Three new studies provided nationwide data on the impact of abortion bans.",
      "New research shows the far-reaching effects of the abortion bans that have proliferated the United States since the Supreme Court struck down Roe v. Wade in 2022.",
      "Three new studies have provided some of the first nationwide data on the effects of those bans in the states where they are currently active -- revealing more births but also a rise in infant deaths.",
      "The impact of those bans have even spread to states where abortion is still legal, the studies showed.",
      "In the first study, Johns Hopkins researchers found that birth rates rose 1.7% in states with abortion bans. It showed that the bans primarily affect racial minorities, younger individuals and those with lower income or education, especially in the South.",
      "\"Those experiencing the greatest structural disadvantages and in the states amongst the worst in maternal and child health outcomes experience the greatest impact of these abortion bans on the number of live births,\u201d Suzanne Bell, PhD, MPH, the paper\u2019s lead author and an assistant professor at Johns Hopkins Bloomberg School of Public Health, told ABC News.",
      "\u201cMany of these occurred in states with among the weakest social services and worst outcomes, potentially deepening existing disparities and placing additional burdens on already strained resources,\u201d she said.",
      "At the same time, infant deaths rose in states with abortion bans, according to another Johns Hopkins study. Analyzing birth and death records from 2012 to 2023, Bell\u2019s team noted 478 more infant deaths than expected in 14 states with the bans. The highest increases were seen in Black infants (about an 11% higher death rate), infants in Southern states and infants born with severe medical conditions.",
      "\u201cWhen you look at Texas' contribution to the overall findings, we see that Texas is responsible for 73% of the additional births and 80% of the excess infant deaths,\u201d Bell said.",
      "But states without bans have also felt the effects.",
      "Abortion also rose in Colorado, a state that maintained access to abortion with no gestational limits, according to a research letter recently published in JAMA Network Open.",
      "Colorado State University researchers found that abortions for out-of-state residents in Colorado rose from 13% in 2020 to 30% in 2023. Abortions among Colorado residents also peaked six months after Texas\u2019 abortion ban, with an 11% increase in first-trimester abortions and an 83% increase in second-trimester abortions compared to before the ban.",
      "The surge in demand led to delays, possibly raising costs, emotional toll and procedure complexity, the authors said. However, second-trimester abortions have since stabilized, possibly due to expanded telehealth, self-managed abortions and access in other states, they added.",
      "Currently, abortion is illegal in 12 states, according to the Kaiser Family Foundation, and 29 states have some sort of abortion limitation based on gestational age. Nine states have no restriction on abortion.",
      "\u201cThe literature we have demonstrates that not being able to obtain an abortion has negative physical, mental and economic implications for birthing persons, their children and their families -- and undermines achieving health equity,\u201d Bell said. \u201cThese bans are deepening or worsening some of these existing population health disparities that exist.\u201d",

    "summary": "In an affidavit filed in federal court Tuesday, a White House official said Elon Musk is not the administrator of the Department of Government Efficiency, or DOGE.",
    "story": [
      "A White House filing clarified that the department's leader is not Elon Musk.",
      "As its influence within the federal government grows daily, one question routinely emerges about the Department of Government Efficiency: Who is in charge?",
      "That answer continues to evade the lawyers tasked with defending President Donald Trump's administration in court.",
      "In an affidavit filed in federal court on Tuesday, a White House official clarified that Elon Musk is not the administrator of the newly formed entity -- seemingly contradicting public statements by Trump.",
      "\"I am pleased to announce that the Great Elon Musk, working in conjunction with American Patriot Vivek Ramaswamy, will lead the Department of Government Efficiency,\" Trump said in December 2024. Since then, and following Ramaswamy's departure from DOGE, he has routinely referred to Musk its leader.",
      "However, according to Office of Administration Director Joshua Fischer, Musk is neither the administrator nor an employee of DOGE. Instead, Musk is a \"non career special government employee\" who serves as a senior adviser to the president. The filing compared Musk's role to that of Anita Dunn, a longtime political adviser who served as a senior adviser to President Joe Biden.",
      "\"In his role as senior advisor to the President, Mr. Musk has no greater authority than other senior White House advisors. Like other senior White House advisors, Mr. Musk has no actual or formal authority to make government decisions,\" the affidavit said.",
      "The filing comes after Judge Tanya Chutkan \u2013 who held a hearing Tuesday in a case that challenges the breadth of Musk's authority \u2013 raised concerns about the \"unpredictable and scattershot\" methods employed by DOGE.",
      "\"DOGE appears to be moving in no sort of predictable and orderly fashion,\" Chutkan said. \"This is essentially a private citizen directing an organization that's not a federal agency to have access to the entire workings of the federal government, fire, hire, slash, contract, terminate programs, all without apparently any congressional oversight.\"",
      "Federal judges are also wrestling with how to define DOGE itself. In an order issued Feb. 14, a federal judge in Washington, D.C., ruled that DOGE should be considered an \"agency\" -- though he noted how the Trump administration is \"curiously\" avoiding that label.",
      "\"This appears to come from a desire to escape the obligations that accompany agencyhood \u2014 such as being subject to the Freedom of Information Act, the Privacy Act and the Administrative Procedures Act -- while reaping only its benefits,\" U.S. District Judge John Bates wrote.",
      "The filing did not provide any information about who oversees DOGE, other than ruling out Musk.",
      "The mystery about DOGE's organization and leadership does not appear limited to members of the public; lawyers for the Trump administration have similarly struggled with the question in court.",
      "After a court hearing on Friday about DOGE's access to sensitive Treasury Department payment systems and records, Christopher Healy, senior adviser to the Treasury Department's general counsel, had little to say when asked about who runs DOGE.",

      "A federal judge appears poised to block the Trump administration if the Department of Defense attempts to place limitations on or ban transgender service members.",
      "U.S. District Judge Ana Reyes is still hearing arguments Tuesday in the case but signaled deep skepticism with the claim that transgender service members lessen the military\u2019s lethality or readiness.",
      "\u201cYou and I both agree that the greatest fighting force that world history has ever seen is not going to be impacted in any way by less than 1% of the soldiers using a different pronoun than others might want to call them. Would you agree with that?\u201d Judge Reyes asked during a hearing this morning.",
      "\u201cNo, Your Honor, I'm not. I can't agree with that,\u201d a lawyer for the Department of Justice responded.",
      "At issue is Trump\u2019s Jan. 27 executive order that directed the DOD to update its guidance \"regarding trans-identifying medical standards for military service and to rescind guidance inconsistent with military readiness.\" While the Department of Defense has not issued final guidance on transgender service members, the order led to a pause in gender affirming care for service members and is expected to lead to a significant curtailment of transgender service members based on \u201creadiness and lethality.\"",
      "With the DOD policy expected to be finalized over the coming week, Reyes said she would hold off on issuing an order but had largely made up her mind about the legality of the order, at one point remarking that \u201csmarter people on the D.C. Circuit would have to tell me I\u2019m wrong\u201d about the policy. She added that the central premise of the executive order -- that only two genders exist -- is \u201cnot biologically correct.\u201d",
      "Reyes also raised concerns about the wording of the executive order, which she criticized for being intentionally imprecise and a pretext for a ban on transgender soldiers.",
      "\u201cIf we had President Trump here right now, and I said to him, 'Is this a transgender ban?' What do you think he would say?\u201d Reyes asked.",
      "\u201cI have no idea, Your Honor,\u201d said DOJ attorney Jason Lynch.",
      "\u201cI do. He would say, 'Of course it is.' Because he calls it a transgender ban, because all the language in it is indicative,\u201d Reyes said.",
      "The judge -- who began the hearing by noting that every service member regardless of their gender ideology \u201cdeserves our gratitude\u201d -- also spent a portion of the hearing questioning Lynch about the group of transgender soldiers who filed the lawsuit.",
      "\u201cIf you were in a foxhole, you wouldn't care about these individuals' gender ideology, right? You would just be happy that someone with that experience and that bravery and that honorable service to the country was sitting right next to you. Right?\u201d Reyes asked.",
      "\u201cDon't want to testify as a witness, Your Honor, or offer my personal views of hypothetical,\u201d Lynch responded before conceding, \u201cIf I were in a foxhole, I doubt that the gender identity would be a primary concern.\u201d",
      "Reyes also pushed the lawyer for the Department of Justice -- who she later commended for arguing his case well -- to admit that the transgender soldiers made the country \u201csafer.\u201d",
      "\u201cAre they honorable, truthful, and disciplined?\" Reyes asked. \"As far as I know, among them, they have over 60 years of military service.\u201d",
      "\u201cThat's correct,\u201d Lynch said.",
      "\u201cAnd you would agree that together, the plaintiffs have made America safer?\u201d Reyes asked.",

My first call as Acting Commissioner was to our Inspector General's office to provide them an opportunity to oversee and review any and all agency activities, including my actions past, present, and future. Transparency is at the heart of good government,\" Dudek wrote in the email.",
      "When asked for comment, White House Deputy Press Secretary Harrison Fields reiterated the White House's expectation that Bisignano will be confirmed in the coming weeks.",
      "\"In the meantime, the agency will be led by a career Social Security anti-fraud expert as the acting commissioner. President Trump is committed to appointing the best and most qualified individuals who are dedicated to working on behalf of the American people, not to appease the bureaucracy that has failed them for far too long,\" Fields said in a statement.",
      "In an interview with Fox News, White House Press Secretary Karoline Leavitt said President Donald Trump had dispatched Musk and DOGE to identify fraud at the Social Security Administration.",
      "\"And so their goal in going into the Social Security Administration is to identify three things. Number one, to identify duplicate payments and to end them. Number two, to identify payments that are going to deceased people who are no longer living and should no longer be receiving that money. And number three, to protect the integrity of the system for hard working Americans who have been paying into it their entire lives,\" Leavitt said.",
      "\"So rest assured to all of the people watching your show tonight, if you paid into the system honestly, you will continue to receive your Social Security checks,\" Leavitt added.",

      "A U.S. foreign service officer deployed overseas blamed President Donald Trump administration's \"cruel and harmful shutdown\" of USAID for threatening the lives of his pregnant wife and unborn child, according to court documents filed Monday night.",
      "Identified in an affidavit only as Terry Doe, the foreign service officer explained in vivid detail how the emotional strain, financial burden and logistical hurdles brought on by the administration's \"rushed, haphazard\" attempt to dismantle the aid agency left him and his wife in a \"life-threatening emergency.\"",
      "\"My wife is 31 weeks pregnant, after years of infertility and $50,000 of personal investment in countless fertility treatments,\" Doe explained. \"Because of the stress and strain of the constant onslaught by my employer in recent weeks, my wife has repeatedly been in the hospital with a life-threatening condition and stress-related complications.\"",
      "ABC News has reached out to the Trump administration for comment.",
      "After a local physician and the embassy's medical unit advised her to be medically evacuated out of the country, Doe continued, the State Department twice refused Doe's request, along \"with a message stating that 'there is no USAID funding for medivacs.'\"",
      "Only when an unidentified U.S. senator intervened on Doe's behalf was he able to secure approval for a medical evacuation -- but by then, Doe wrote, \"my wife began hemorrhaging and had to be admitted to the hospital at our overseas post,\" where she remains as of Monday.",
      "\"The stress on all USAID families since January 20th contributed to her deteriorating medical condition,\" Doe asserted. \"Now I'm afraid for her and my baby's health because of this rushed, haphazard and cruel push to shut down the agency. This didn't have to happen.\"",

      "Chester disputed Marocco's characterization of the evacuation of USAID employees from the Congo as a \"success,\" instead claiming that the agency \"completely failed to provide the DRC evacuees with the logistical and financial support that they would normally be due under standard evacuation processes.\"",
      "Chester also wrote that USAID's payment system, called Phoenix, remains \"inoperable,\" and that some foreign service officers who were forced to evacuate the Congo \"reported that they are carrying $10,000s of debt due to the Agency not paying vouchers\" for their travel, hotels, and meals during the evacuation.",

    "published": "Mon, 17 Feb 2025 17:23:17 -0500",
    "summary": "Elon Musk\u2019s Department of Government Efficiency requested access to an IRS data system that retains the personal tax information on millions of Americans, sources say.",
    "story": [
      "If granted, DOGE would have personal financial details on millions of Americans.",
      "Elon Musk's Department of Government Efficiency is pushing for access to an Internal Revenue Service system that retains the personal tax information of millions of Americans for the ostensible reason of rooting out fraud, according to several sources familiar with the effort.",
      "The move has rattled agency insiders and privacy experts who warn that granting political operatives access to such private information could be extraordinarily dangerous.",
      "The system, known as the Integrated Data Retrieval System, is used by IRS employees to review a person's tax information, issue notices and update taxpayer records. The database includes such private information as a person's Social Security number and address, as well as details on how much they earn, how much money they owe, properties and even details related to child custody agreements.",
      "Access to the files, which is tightly controlled within the agency, had not been granted as of this weekend, several sources told ABC News.",
      "\u201cWaste, fraud, and abuse have been deeply entrenched in our broken system for far too long. It takes direct access to the system to identify and fix it,\" White House spokesperson Harrison Fields told reporters late Sunday.",
      "\"DOGE will continue to shine a light on the fraud they uncover as the American people deserve to know what their government has been spending their hard earned tax dollars on,\" he added.",
      "The White House has not said how exactly it would use the system to look for fraud and if it would take steps to protect Americans from being targeted for political reasons. Musk, estimated to be the richest man in the world, has criticized federal judges for curbing his power and called for their impeachment. Musk also has alleged without evidence or examples of wrongdoing that federal workers were defrauding taxpayers.",
      "\"We do find it rather odd that there are quite a few people in the bureaucracy who have ostensibly a salary of a few hundred thousand dollars, but somehow managed to accrue tens of millions of dollars in net worth while they are in that position,\" Musk told reporters on Feb. 12 while in the Oval Office with President Donald Trump. \"We're just curious as to where it came from.\"",
      "Earlier this month, DOGE employees demanded access to the Treasury Department's vast federal payment system responsible for managing trillions of dollars in government expenditures. That access triggered a lawsuit by 19 states and has been temporarily blocked by a federal judge.",
      "Musk and the White House have not said what federal data the DOGE team has been able to get to, or what's been done with the data that's been acquired.",
      "\"People who share their most sensitive information with the federal government do so under the understanding that not only will it be used legally, but also handled securely and in ways that minimize risks like identity theft and personal invasion, which this reporting brings into serious question,\" said Elizabeth Laird, a former state privacy officer now with the Center for Democracy and Technology.",
      "Sources say one DOGE staffer arrived at the IRS last Thursday seeking meetings with various offices about how the IRS collects and manages data and what each business unit within the IRS does.",
      "The White House initially told reporters on Sunday that an unnamed IRS employee connected to DOGE had access to the system to identify \"fraud and protect taxpayers.\" But a few minutes later, the administration walked that back, telling ABC News the employee was expected to seek access but doesn't have it yet.",
      "According to the Washington Post, which first reported the development, the IRS is considering a memorandum of understanding that would give DOGE officials access to several systems, including IDRS.",
      "When pressed last week by reporters on what checks are in place to ensure Musk -- whose companies have billions of dollars in current federal contracts -- is not accessing data to his advantage, the billionaire insisted that DOGE posts all of its activity on its website \"so all of our actions are maximally transparent.\"",
      "The DOGE site on Monday included a list of mostly canceled government contracts and a message on its \"savings\" tab: \"Receipts coming over the weekend!\"",
      "According to one person familiar with DOGE's efforts, the team acquiring access to the IRS system would not allow them to change any data within it. But if granted, the access would allow unfettered access to access any person's tax filings.",
      "According to an IRS rulebook for the system posted online, anyone accessing IDRS is specifically not allowed to review the personal tax information of relatives, friends, neighbors or celebrities.",
      "\"IDRS users shall not access the account of any taxpayer or another IRS employee unless there is a business need and access has been formally authorized as part of the user's official duties,\" the agency rulebook stated.",
      "The policy noted: \"Willful unauthorized disclosure, access or inspection of non-computerized taxpayer records, including hard copies of returns - as well as computerized information - is a crime, punishable upon conviction, by fines, prison terms and termination of employment.\"",
      "While a district court judge in Manhattan has temporarily blocked DOGE's access to the Treasury Department system for now, a separate ruling by another district court judge has allowed DOGE to access data at the Department of Labor, Department of Health and Human Services, and the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau.",

      "His group spent hundreds of thousands of dollars on ads opposing Robert F",
      "WASHINGTON -- His group spent nearly $1 million on ads opposing Robert F. Kennedy Jr., Donald Trump's pick to lead the nation's health agencies. He's delivering speeches urging the president to stand with longstanding foreign allies and lobbying members of Congress while aides write letters and opinion columns.",
      "This weekend, he posted an article he penned more than a decade ago on the limits of presidential power after Trump claimed that, \u201cHe who saves his Country does not violate any Law.\u201d",
      "Mike Pence is emerging as one of the last Republicans in Washington willing to publicly criticize the new administration.",
      "It's an especially jarring role for the former vice president, whose refusal to break with Trump defined their time together in office until the two had a falling out over Trump\u2019s refusal to accept the results of the 2020 election and his efforts to remain in power.",
      "Pence and those who work with him at Advancing American Freedom, his political advocacy group, stress they are not looking to take on the \u201cNever Trump\" mantle. They intend to praise the administration when they agree with it, while raising concerns when they don't, advocating for longtime conservative principles that have fallen out of favor as Trump's \u201cMake America Great Again\u201d brand of populism has taken hold.",
      "\u201cWe\u2019re calling balls and strikes here,\u201d Pence told The Associated Press.",
      "Pence opposed Kennedy \u2014 who has since been confirmed as secretary of health and human services \u2014 due to Kennedy\u2019s past comments voicing support for abortion rights. His group is now lobbying against Lori Chavez-DeRemer, Trump's pick for labor secretary, accusing her of being pro-union, and plans to spend the coming months pushing to increase military spending, shrink the deficit, and make permanent 2017 tax cuts, as well as trying to convince Trump to stop slapping tariffs on allies.",
      "The AP recently sat down with Pence to discuss his efforts and his relationship with Trump \u2014 including a closely watched handshake at the funeral of President Jimmy Carter and his wife's lack of reaction as the 45th and 47th president took his seat.",
      "Here is a transcript of that conversation, which has been lightly edited for space and clarity:",
      "Pence: \u201cTo be an anchor to windward ... I came across that line I think in a Herman Melville book a long time ago.\u201d",
      "\u201cThe wind blows in the direction of more government. And I think it\u2019s a role of conservatives to anchor the party so that when the wind blows, you put the anchor to windward so you stay grounded and hopefully do some small part to hold, you know, hold the ship of state on the principles that really minted my career in this movement.\u201d",
      "\u201cA strong defense, to American leadership of the free world, limited government, fiscal responsibility, growth, the right to life, traditional values \u2014 those were the values that drew me to the Republican Party. And I still think that they are the timeless ideals of the party of Lincoln. And so I want to do my part, even as a former elected official, to use whatever remains of my bully pulpit to be a champion for those principles.\u201d",
      "Pence: \u201cWell, for me, it\u2019s always principles first. It\u2019s not personal. I went to the inauguration last month and I was very moved in the outpouring of kind words and expressions of appreciation from former colleagues, including many members of the new administration who I encountered in hallways. And I saw Secretary of State (Marco) Rubio. I gave him a hug, told him how proud I was of him. We had praised him from here when he was selected. I must have seen about or interacted with about half the incoming Cabinet.\"",
      "\u201cWe went to the Carter funeral. And the president and I had a very cordial exchange. You know, he was coming down the row in front of us at the National Cathedral and he said, \u2018Hi, Mike.\u2019 And I was standing up, extended my hand, and I said, \u2018Congratulations, Mr. President.\u2019 And I could see his countenance softened. And he said, \u2018Thanks.\u2019 And Melania reached out and I said, \u2018Congratulations, Melania.\u2019 And it was, you know, the people that know me know it\u2019s not personal. I\u2019ve long since forgiven the president for any differences that we had at the end of our administration. We still have those differences as the president still holds the view that, to my knowledge, that I had some authority that I did not have under the Constitution or laws of the country. But from my heart, I've prayed often for the president.\"",
      "\u201cAnd so, to answer your question, I think that the way we want to approach this is with integrity to principle. And I\u2019m very encouraged. I think the Trump administration is off to a great start ... I\u2019m very pleased about the president undoing Biden\u2019s border policies and putting back into place the policies that we had negotiated and established that secured the border. But you know, with regard to the nomination of RFK ... for me, it would begin and end with the right to life ... I saw the nomination of an abortion rights supporter to be secretary of HHS to be a dramatic departure from 50 years of strong pro-life leadership at HHS under Republican administrations. So we thought it was important to speak out. And we got a lot of quiet encouragement about that.\"",
      "\u201cWell, we got a lot of quiet encouragement from people that, for whatever reason, didn't feel compelled to join us in that chorus. But I thought it was an important point for us to make. And, you know, we'll continue to be a champion.\"",
      "Pence: \u201cI never speculate on motives. You know, I\u2019m not new to town. I\u2019ve waged lonely battles before.\u201d",
      "\u201cBut you know, you have to be willing to step out and lead. And my hope is that even in the wake of this fight that, you know, the Senate has worked its will, the president will get his choice at HHS. My hope is that when the next issue of life comes up, that people will have been encouraged, emboldened to know that they\u2019re not alone.\u201d",
      "Pence: \u201cWell now you hit it. Now you're on it. I don\u2019t think \u2014 look, I think some of the prominent voices in the party have embraced a more populist thinking. I don\u2019t believe the overwhelming majority of people that ever vote Republican think any differently than they thought during our administration when we hewed to a conservative agenda or the years before or since.\"",
      "\"Let me give you one anecdote. So I'm at a town hall meeting when I\u2019m running for president. And at the end of the town hall meeting \u2014 it was well-attended, it was in Iowa \u2014 a farmer walked up to me and he said, \u2018It was a great town hall meeting. I agree with everything you say.\u2019 You know, and I argued for \u2014 this was literally in the wake of the Oct. 7 attack. And I argued for strong American support for Israel, strong American leadership in the world, continued support for Ukraine in their fight and limited government and bringing about reforms to put our fiscal house in order and right to life.",
      "And this farmer says to me, he said, \u2018I agree with absolutely everything you said.\u2019 So I said, \u2018Well, can I count on your vote?\u2019 And he said, \u2018No, I got to be for Trump this time.\u2019 And he goes, \u2018But I\u2019ll see you in four years. You\u2019re going to be a great president someday.\u2019 I said, \u2018Would you mind telling me, you know, why?\u2019 And he said words I never forgot, which was in effect: He lamented Biden\u2019s failed record. And I saw that he was drawn to the need for a rematch. And then he said, \u2018Plus, if they can do that to a former president, they can do that to me.\u2019 And the \u2018lawfare\u2019 stuff went into higher relief.",
      "\u201cSo I didn\u2019t see in this last election a Republican Party that was embracing big government or a vision to pull back from America\u2019s commitments on the world stage or marginalizing the right to life. I didn\u2019t see that traveling all over the country and I still don\u2019t see it. I think there were other factors that gave the former president a decided advantage in the election. He\u2019d earned it. He\u2019d won it. And then he won it in the fall. But I don\u2019t think the party\u2019s changed.\"",
      "(At the funeral, former second lady Karen Pence refused to acknowledge the then-president elect or shake Melania Trump\u2019s hands \u2014 footage that ended up going viral online.)",
      "Pence: \u201cMy wife loves her husband. And I love my wife and I have great respect for her. And so \u2014 but I\u2019ve been really moved at how many people around the country have thanked us both for that day.",
      "\"But again, you know, I want to emphasize, we\u2019re eyes forward here. You know, I\u2019d always thought the president was going to come around on the position he took on Jan. 6. If you read the end of my book, which I\u2019d be flattered if you did, you\u2019ll read we actually parted on very amicable terms, very good terms. But in the spring, when he returned to the rhetoric about how I could have done something that neither the Constitution nor the law would ever permit any vice president to do, then I just decided it was important to go our separate ways. But hope springs eternal. And we want to be a constructive force for the conservative agenda. I think that\u2019s good for the administration. It\u2019s good for the Congress. More importantly, it\u2019s good for America.\u201d",

      "The White House later shared the statement from its official X account but didn't elaborate on why he posted it or what he meant by it. Although its exact origins are unclear, the quote is often attributed to Napoleon, the French general who effectively declared himself emperor in the early 1800s.",
      "The White House declined to comment when ABC News asked on Monday what Trump intended to say with the post.",

      "Peter Marocco, a Trump loyalist and the architect of efforts to slash USAID as part of President Donald Trump's massive federal cuts, wrote in his eight-page affidavit that the agency is \"working diligently to address these delays,\" which he said included \"routine payments to employees\" stationed overseas. The agency has placed several employees on temporary paid leave, including some deployed in high-risk countries.",
      "\"Although these delays could continue to impact certain payments to employees in the immediate future, an employee's leave status would not itself impact the timing or eligibility for such payments,\" Marocco said.",
      "Marocco did not specify how many government workers have been impacted, nor did he describe what actions had precipitated the delays, except to call them \"changes in the process by which payments can be made and approved by the Agency over the past weeks.\"",
      "Aid organizations have also reported having difficulty accessing funds dispersed through the agency's payment system, called Phoenix, though it was not clear from Marocco's affidavit whether those issues were related.",
      "Marocco penned the affidavit as part of a lawsuit brought by a union that represents government employees who are challenging the staffing cuts to USAID being made by the administration and its new Department of Government Efficiency. Plaintiffs in the case include foreign service officers who described their harrowing escape from the Democratic Republic of the Congo in recent weeks amid protests tearing through the country.",
      "One such official, identified in the court record only as Olivia Doe, said she and her family were evacuated from Kinchasa by speedboat in the middle of the night only \"with what could fit on our laps,\" calling the experience \"traumatizing\" for her two small children who \"witnessed the violence on the streets.\"",
      "\"Three days later, we finally arrived back to winter in DC with no warm clothes, a place to stay, or a school for the kids to go to,\" Doe wrote. \"We arrived to the news that DOGE and the Trump Administration were calling us 'criminals' -- something particularly hard to stomach after the ordeal we had just survived.\"",
      "Doe added that she feared losing her evacuation allowance \"due to the whims of DOGE and the Trump Administration,\" saying it would be \"completely unfair and inhumane to cut USAID evacuees off from the special evacuation allowance after many of us served for years in what is one of the poorest countries in the world.\"",
      "Marocco responded to some of those concerns in his affidavit on Friday, claiming that the administration's communication with employees being evacuated \"was clear, consistent, and without disruption,\" and that those who left the Congo \"were welcomed by a USAID landing team at Dulles Airport in Dulles, Virginia, and were provided a host of necessities and care packages upon their arrival to the United States.\"",

      "On a recent hot summer day in Chile, the beaches of Vi\u00f1a del Mar, Conc\u00f3n and Re\u00f1aca are packed with holidaymakers sharing yerba mate teas and playing ball",
      "VI\u00d1A DEL MAR, Chile -- On a recent hot summer day in Chile, the beaches of Vi\u00f1a del Mar, Conc\u00f3n and Re\u00f1aca are packed with holidaymakers sharing yerba mate teas and playing ball. Others mill about in the shopping centers on the coast and in the capital, some wearing shirts with Lionel Messi\u2019s name on them, carrying bags full of clothes, video games and mobile phones.",
      "They are part of a wave of Argentines who have found Chile to be a budget-friendly paradise this southern summer.",
      "\u201cEverything here is so cheap for us,\u201d said Cristian V\u00e1zquez, who was enjoying the sea in Re\u00f1aca, on Chile\u2019s central coast.",
      "In December 2024, the start of the Southern Hemisphere\u2019s summer, more Argentines went on vacation abroad than in the previous year, with Chile, Brazil, and Uruguay as the top destinations.",
      "Despite a year of economic crisis, Argentines are flocking to beaches, mountains and shopping centers abroad, encouraged by a favorable economic outlook \u2014 and a strong peso.",
      "Between December 2023 and the same month in 2024 the Argentine peso appreciated by around 41% against the official U.S. dollar, thanks in part of a strong adjustment plan implemented by President Javier Milei, an ultra-liberal who came to power at the end of 2023 on vows to \u201cblow up\u201d the central bank, take an axe to the bloated government and kill sky-high inflation.",
      "The stampede of Argentines traveling abroad for their summer vacations is driven by several factors, including the recent devaluation of various foreign currencies, the convenience of nearby destinations accessible by car and the prohibitively high cost of domestic vacations, especially along the Argentine Atlantic coast.",
      "Argentine tourism abroad surged in December, with departures up 76.4% year-over-year to 1.3 million travelers compared to the same month the previous year, according to official figures. Of those, 80.7% visited neighboring countries, primarily Chile (28%), Brazil (22.6%) and Uruguay (15.6%).",
      "Chile has become a popular destination for Argentines, who made up 40% of the 5.2 million visitors to the country in 2024 and early 2025. Chile\u2019s strong economic position relative to Argentina has resulted in competitive prices, a major draw for Argentine tourists.",
      "Chile\u2019s tourism undersecretary, Ver\u00f3nica Pardo, noted that visitors are also spending more than in previous years, averaging about $63.3 per person per day.",
      "Argentine visitors aren\u2019t confined to the sun-drenched beaches of the Chilean coast. Messi jerseys and mate gourds are also a common sight in other neighboring countries.",
      "Nicol\u00e1s Lentini, 37, recently arrived in Brazil, drawn by the devalued real and lower prices. \u201cA week\u2019s rent for four people in Argentina costs $700,\" he said, noting that he paid the same amount for 14 days in B\u00fazios, a Brazilian resort east of Rio de Janeiro.",
      "\u201cBesides, the beaches here are incomparable to ours, where it\u2019s cold. Here, you can wear a T-shirt all day.\u201d",
      "Brazil experienced a surge in tourism after the real depreciated by around 27% in 2024, when it reached a record of 6.6 million foreign arrivals, with Argentines being the main visitors (1.9 million).",
      "Andr\u00e9s Dey\u00e1, from Argentina's federation of travel and tourism business associations, highlighted the challenges of competing with neighboring countries like Brazil.",
      "\u201cWe can provide good services, financing tools, tourism quality and everything else,\u201d he said, but ultimately \"macroeconomic issues define where Argentines decide to travel.\u201d",
      "After a four-year hiatus marked by the COVID-19 pandemic and a subsequent economic crisis, Luis S\u00e1nchez returned to the exclusive resort of Punta del Este, Uruguay.",
      "\u201cWe like it a lot... this year the prices aren\u2019t as high as they\u2019ve been,\u201d said S\u00e1nchez, one of 309,570 Argentines who visited Uruguay between December 20, 2024, and January 13, 2025, representing nearly half of all visitors to the country, where the U.S. dollar appreciated almost 13% against the Uruguayan peso in 2024 compared to 2023.",
      "Tourism operators in Argentina note that the Argentine exodus was also fueled by recovering purchasing power due to falling inflation and the recent elimination of a tax on foreign credit card purchases.",
      "Sunbathing in a bikini on a Punta del Este beach, Esperanza Fagalde said she hadn\u2019t vacationed at the Uruguayan resort for the past two years. \u201cIt just wasn\u2019t affordable,\u201d she said, citing the unfavorable exchange rate and high costs.",

      "The leader of a cultlike group known as the Zizians that is linked to six killings in three states was ordered held without bail",
      "CUMBERLAND, Md. -- A Maryland court on Tuesday ordered a blogger known as Ziz who leads a cultlike group connected to six killings held without bail.",
      "The blogger, Jack LaSota, 34, of Berkeley, California, was arrested Sunday along with Michelle Zajko, 32, of Media, Pennsylvania, and Daniel Blank, 26, of Sacramento, California. They face charges including trespassing, obstructing and hindering and possession of a handgun in a vehicle.",
      "The Zizians have been tied to the killing of U.S. Border Patrol Agent David Maland near the Canadian border in January and five other killings in three states.",
      "LaSota, Zajko and Blank were arrested in Frostburg, Maryland, on Sunday afternoon.",
      "The judge in the case ordered LaSota held without bail citing concerns about her being a flight risk and a danger to public safety. Prosecutors said LaSota \u201cappears to be the leader of an extremist group known as Zizians\u201d that has been linked to killings.",
      "The three were expected to appear remotely for a bail hearing Tuesday at Allegany District Court in Cumberland, Maryland, court officials said.",
      "The Zizians have been tied to the death of a woman during an attack on a California landlord in November 2022, the landlord's subsequent slaying in January, the December 2022 deaths of Zajko's parents in Pennsylvania and a highway shootout last month in Vermont that left U.S. Border Patrol Agent David Maland and a car passenger dead.",
      "A Frostburg resident told police he wanted three \u201csuspicious\u201d people off his property after they\u2019d parked two box trucks there and asked to camp for a month, according to police documents.",
      "They were dressed in black and two wore gun belts holding ammunition, according to police. Officers found a rifle in the back of one truck and a handgun on the front floorboard. Zajko, who refused to put her hands behind her back and was taken to the ground, also was carrying a handgun, police said.",
      "Maland, 44, was killed in a Jan. 20 shootout following a traffic stop in Coventry, Vermont, a small town about 20 miles (32 kilometers) from the Canadian border. Felix Bauckholt, a passenger in the car, also died, and the driver, Teresa Youngblut, has pleaded not guilty to federal firearms charges.",
      "Officials have said the guns they were carrying were bought by a person of interest in the Dec. 31, 2022, deaths of Richard and Rita Zajko in Chester Heights, Pennsylvania, and that Youngblut had been in close contact with a person of interest in a homicide in Vallejo, California.",
      "Maximilian Snyder, who applied for a marriage license with Youngblut in November, is charged with the Jan. 17 stabbing death of Curtis Lind, a Vallejo landlord who had survived an earlier attack by members of the Zizian group and was set to testify against them.",
      "Officials have offered few details of the cross-country investigation, but Associated Press interviews and a review of court records and online postings tell the story of how a group of young, highly intelligent computer scientists, most of them in their 20s and 30s, met online, shared anarchist beliefs, and became increasingly violent.",
      "Their goals aren\u2019t clear, but online writings included topics such as radical veganism, gender identity and artificial intelligence.",
      "At the middle of it all is \u201cZiz,\u201d the leader of the strange group whose members are sometimes called \u201cZizians\u201d in online forums.",
      "LaSota published a dark and sometimes violent blog under the name Ziz and, in one section, described her theory that the two hemispheres of the brain could hold separate values and genders and \u201coften desire to kill each other.\u201d",
      "LaSota, who used she/her pronouns, and in her writings says she is a transgender woman, railed against perceived enemies, including so-called rationalist groups, which operate mostly online and seek to understand human cognition through reason and knowledge. Some are concerned with the potential dangers of artificial intelligence.",
      "LaSota has not responded to emails from the AP in recent weeks, and her attorney Daniel McGarrigle declined to comment on whether she is connected to any of the deaths. She\u2019s wanted for arrest in two states for missing court appearances.",
      "McGarrigle would only confirm Monday that he has represented LaSota and wouldn't confirm her arrest or any details of the latest case. Attempts to reach attorneys for Zajko and Blank were not successful.",
      "Pennsylvania state police records describe Daniel Blank as Michelle Zajko\u2019s housemate in Vermont. In January 2023, police investigating the shooting deaths of Zajko\u2019s parents detained both LaSota and Blank at a hotel where Zajko was staying. Blank was not charged. LaSota was charged with obstructing law enforcement and disorderly conduct.",

      "New York\u2019s top court affirmed the constitutionality of an ethics watchdog created three years ago to stem public corruption, rejecting arguments from former Gov. Andrew Cuomo",
      "ALBANY, N.Y. -- New York's top court on Tuesday affirmed the constitutionality of an ethics watchdog created three years ago to stem public corruption, rejecting arguments from former Gov. Andrew Cuomo related to a $5 million book deal.",
      "The Commission on Ethics and Lobbying in Government had been fighting for its survival after Cuomo\u2019s lawyers persuaded lower courts that the panel was given unconstitutional enforcement powers. Cuomo contended that the law creating the agency violated the separation of powers mandated under the state constitution, since enforcing ethics laws is a power that belongs to the executive branch.",
      "The Court of Appeals sided with the commission in a 4-3 vote, reversing lower court rulings.",
      "Judge Jenny Rivera wrote in a majority opinion that the law creating the commission gives it narrow powers to avoid having top state officials regulating their own ethics.",
      "\"Trust in government is essential to democracy because its erosion leads to apathy, disaffection, and the breakdown of civic institutions,\" Rivera wrote. \u201cGiven the danger of self-regulation, the Legislature and the Governor have determined that there is an urgent need for the robust, impartial enforcement of the State\u2019s ethics and lobbying laws.\u201d",
      "The commission was formed by the Legislature and Gov. Kathy Hochul as a more independent alternative to a previous ethics panel widely criticized for being overly beholden to top government officials. It debuted in the wake of Cuomo\u2019s 2021 resignation in a sexual harassment scandal.",
      "Cuomo was fighting an attempt by the commission that could force him to forfeit $5 million he got for writing a book about his administration\u2019s efforts during the COVID-19 pandemic. State officials claim Cuomo hadn\u2019t kept a promise not to use any state resources on the book. Cuomo denies those allegations.",
      "A trial court judge sided with Cuomo in 2023, noting that enforcing ethics laws is a power that belongs to the executive branch, yet the governor cannot control ethics commission members, force them to explain their actions or remove them for neglecting their duties, the judge wrote. A mid-level appeals court upheld the judge\u2019s ruling in May.",
      "The ruling Tuesday lifts a cloud of uncertainty that has been looming over the commission for more than a year and was cheered by good government advocates.",
      "The commission\u2019s leadership released a prepared statement saying the top court's validation \u201cis especially important now, when the need for an agency with our mission is as great as it has ever been.\"",
      "Judge Michael Garcia wrote in a dissent that the law forming the commission violated constitutional \u201cbedrock principles\u201d requiring a separation of powers. He accused the majority of focusing on the individual powers granted to the commission under the statute and pronouncing \u201ceach, in turn, not wolf. But step back \u2014 it\u2019s not grandma; it\u2019s a wolf.\u201d",
      "\u201cWe intend to file for reconsideration \u2014 as is our right,\u201d Cuomo spokesperson Richard Azzopardi wrote in an email, \u201cbut it is disturbing that any judge of NY\u2019s highest court would countenance flagrant violations of the constitution when it conflicts with what is most convenient to the political class.\u201d",
      "Cuomo resigned in August 2021 after the attorney general released the results of an investigation that concluded he had sexually harassed at least 11 women. Cuomo has denied those allegations."

      "Pence opposed Kennedy \u2014 who has since been confirmed as secretary of health and human services \u2014 due to Kennedy\u2019s past comments voicing support for abortion rights. His group is now lobbying against Lori Chavez-DeRemer, Trump's pick for labor secretary, accusing her of being pro-union, and plans to spend the coming months pushing to increase military spending, shrink the deficit, and make permanent 2017 tax cuts, as well as trying to convince Trump to stop slapping tariffs on allies.",
      "The AP recently sat down with Pence to discuss his efforts and his relationship with Trump \u2014 including a closely watched handshake at the funeral of President Jimmy Carter and his wife's lack of reaction as the 45th and 47th president took his seat.",
      "Here is a transcript of that conversation, which has been lightly edited for space and clarity:",
      "Pence: \u201cTo be an anchor to windward ... I came across that line I think in a Herman Melville book a long time ago.\u201d",
      "\u201cThe wind blows in the direction of more government. And I think it\u2019s a role of conservatives to anchor the party so that when the wind blows, you put the anchor to windward so you stay grounded and hopefully do some small part to hold, you know, hold the ship of state on the principles that really minted my career in this movement.\u201d",
      "\u201cA strong defense, to American leadership of the free world, limited government, fiscal responsibility, growth, the right to life, traditional values \u2014 those were the values that drew me to the Republican Party. And I still think that they are the timeless ideals of the party of Lincoln. And so I want to do my part, even as a former elected official, to use whatever remains of my bully pulpit to be a champion for those principles.\u201d",
      "Pence: \u201cWell, for me, it\u2019s always principles first. It\u2019s not personal. I went to the inauguration last month and I was very moved in the outpouring of kind words and expressions of appreciation from former colleagues, including many members of the new administration who I encountered in hallways. And I saw Secretary of State (Marco) Rubio. I gave him a hug, told him how proud I was of him. We had praised him from here when he was selected. I must have seen about or interacted with about half the incoming Cabinet.\"",
      "\u201cWe went to the Carter funeral. And the president and I had a very cordial exchange. You know, he was coming down the row in front of us at the National Cathedral and he said, \u2018Hi, Mike.\u2019 And I was standing up, extended my hand, and I said, \u2018Congratulations, Mr. President.\u2019 And I could see his countenance softened. And he said, \u2018Thanks.\u2019 And Melania reached out and I said, \u2018Congratulations, Melania.\u2019 And it was, you know, the people that know me know it\u2019s not personal. I\u2019ve long since forgiven the president for any differences that we had at the end of our administration. We still have those differences as the president still holds the view that, to my knowledge, that I had some authority that I did not have under the Constitution or laws of the country. But from my heart, I've prayed often for the president.\"",
      "\u201cAnd so, to answer your question, I think that the way we want to approach this is with integrity to principle. And I\u2019m very encouraged. I think the Trump administration is off to a great start ... I\u2019m very pleased about the president undoing Biden\u2019s border policies and putting back into place the policies that we had negotiated and established that secured the border. But you know, with regard to the nomination of RFK ... for me, it would begin and end with the right to life ... I saw the nomination of an abortion rights supporter to be secretary of HHS to be a dramatic departure from 50 years of strong pro-life leadership at HHS under Republican administrations. So we thought it was important to speak out. And we got a lot of quiet encouragement about that.\"",
      "\u201cWell, we got a lot of quiet encouragement from people that, for whatever reason, didn't feel compelled to join us in that chorus. But I thought it was an important point for us to make. And, you know, we'll continue to be a champion.\"",
      "Pence: \u201cI never speculate on motives. You know, I\u2019m not new to town. I\u2019ve waged lonely battles before.\u201d",
      "\u201cBut you know, you have to be willing to step out and lead. And my hope is that even in the wake of this fight that, you know, the Senate has worked its will, the president will get his choice at HHS. My hope is that when the next issue of life comes up, that people will have been encouraged, emboldened to know that they\u2019re not alone.\u201d",
      "Pence: \u201cWell now you hit it. Now you're on it. I don\u2019t think \u2014 look, I think some of the prominent voices in the party have embraced a more populist thinking. I don\u2019t believe the overwhelming majority of people that ever vote Republican think any differently than they thought during our administration when we hewed to a conservative agenda or the years before or since.\"",
      "\"Let me give you one anecdote. So I'm at a town hall meeting when I\u2019m running for president. And at the end of the town hall meeting \u2014 it was well-attended, it was in Iowa \u2014 a farmer walked up to me and he said, \u2018It was a great town hall meeting. I agree with everything you say.\u2019 You know, and I argued for \u2014 this was literally in the wake of the Oct. 7 attack. And I argued for strong American support for Israel, strong American leadership in the world, continued support for Ukraine in their fight and limited government and bringing about reforms to put our fiscal house in order and right to life.",
      "And this farmer says to me, he said, \u2018I agree with absolutely everything you said.\u2019 So I said, \u2018Well, can I count on your vote?\u2019 And he said, \u2018No, I got to be for Trump this time.\u2019 And he goes, \u2018But I\u2019ll see you in four years. You\u2019re going to be a great president someday.\u2019 I said, \u2018Would you mind telling me, you know, why?\u2019 And he said words I never forgot, which was in effect: He lamented Biden\u2019s failed record. And I saw that he was drawn to the need for a rematch. And then he said, \u2018Plus, if they can do that to a former president, they can do that to me.\u2019 And the \u2018lawfare\u2019 stuff went into higher relief.",
      "\u201cSo I didn\u2019t see in this last election a Republican Party that was embracing big government or a vision to pull back from America\u2019s commitments on the world stage or marginalizing the right to life. I didn\u2019t see that traveling all over the country and I still don\u2019t see it. I think there were other factors that gave the former president a decided advantage in the election. He\u2019d earned it. He\u2019d won it. And then he won it in the fall. But I don\u2019t think the party\u2019s changed.\"",
      "(At the funeral, former second lady Karen Pence refused to acknowledge the then-president elect or shake Melania Trump\u2019s hands \u2014 footage that ended up going viral online.)",
      "Pence: \u201cMy wife loves her husband. And I love my wife and I have great respect for her. And so \u2014 but I\u2019ve been really moved at how many people around the country have thanked us both for that day.",
      "\"But again, you know, I want to emphasize, we\u2019re eyes forward here. You know, I\u2019d always thought the president was going to come around on the position he took on Jan. 6. If you read the end of my book, which I\u2019d be flattered if you did, you\u2019ll read we actually parted on very amicable terms, very good terms. But in the spring, when he returned to the rhetoric about how I could have done something that neither the Constitution nor the law would ever permit any vice president to do, then I just decided it was important to go our separate ways. But hope springs eternal. And we want to be a constructive force for the conservative agenda. I think that\u2019s good for the administration. It\u2019s good for the Congress. More importantly, it\u2019s good for America.\u201d",

      "In Fresno, California, social media rumors about impending immigration raids at the city's schools left some parents panicking \u2014 even though the raids were all hoaxes. In Denver, a real immigration raid at an apartment complex led to scores of students staying home from school, according to a lawsuit. And in Alice, Texas, a school official incorrectly told parents that Border Patrol agents might board school buses to check immigration papers.",
      "President Donald Trump's immigration policies already are affecting schools across the country, as officials find themselves responding to rising anxiety among parents and their children, including those who are here legally. Trump's executive actions vastly expanded who is eligible for deportation and lifted a ban on immigration enforcement in schools.",
      "While many public and school officials have been working to encourage immigrants to send their children to school, some have done the opposite. Meanwhile, Republicans in Oklahoma and Tennessee have put forward proposals that would make it difficult \u2014 or even impossible \u2014 for children in the country illegally and U.S.-born children of parents without documentation to attend school at all.",
      "As they weigh the risks, many families have struggled with separating facts from rumor.",
      "In the Alice Independent School District in Texas, school officials told parents that the district \u201creceived information\u201d that U.S. Border Patrol agents could ask students about their citizenship status during field trips on school buses that pass through checkpoints about 60 miles from the Texas-Mexico border. The information ended up being false.",
      "Angelib Hernandez of Aurora, Colorado, began keeping her children home from their schools a few days a week after Trump\u2019s inauguration. Now she doesn\u2019t send them at all.",
      "She\u2019s worried immigration agents will visit her children\u2019s schools, detain them and separate her family.",
      "\u201cThey\u2019ve told me, \u2018Hopefully we won\u2019t ever be detained by ourselves,\u2019\u201d she said. \u201cThat would terrify them.\u201d",
      "Hernandez and her children arrived about a year ago and applied for asylum. She was working through the proper legal channels to remain in the U.S., but changes in immigration policies have made her status tenuous.",
      "In the past week, her fears have intensified. Now, she says, her perception is \u201ceveryone\u201d \u2014 from Spanish-language media to social media to other students and parents \u2014 is giving the impression that immigration agents plan to enter Denver-area schools. The school tells parents that kids are safe. \u201cBut we don\u2019t trust it.\u201d",
      "Immigration and Customs Enforcement agents are not known to have entered schools anywhere. But the possibility has alarmed families enough that some districts are pushing for a change in the policy allowing agents to operate in schools.",
      "Denver Public Schools last week sued the Department of Homeland Security, accusing the Trump administration of interfering with the education of young people in its care. Denver took in 43,000 migrants from the southern border last year, including children who ended up in the city\u2019s public schools. Attendance at schools where migrant kids are concentrated has fallen in recent weeks, the district said in the lawsuit, saying the immigration raid at a local apartment complex was a factor.",
      "The support Denver schools have given to students and families to help through the uncertainty involves \"tasks that distract and divert resources from DPS\u2019s core and essential educational mission,\u201d lawyers for the district said in the lawsuit.",
      "Around the country, conservatives have been questioning whether immigrants without legal status should even have the right to a public education.",
      "Oklahoma\u2019s Republican state superintendent, Ryan Walters, pushed a rule that would have required parents to show proof of citizenship \u2014 a birth certificate or passport \u2014 to enroll their children in school. The rule would have allowed parents to register their children even if they could not provide proof, but advocates say it would have strongly discouraged them from doing so. Even the state\u2019s Republican governor, Kevin Stitt, thought the rule went too far \u2014 and vetoed it.",
      "In Tennessee, Republican lawmakers have put forward a bill that would allow school districts to decide whether to admit students without papers. They say they hope to invite legal challenges, which would give them a chance to overturn a four-decade-old precedent protecting the right of every child in the country to get an education",
      "The implications of immigration policy for U.S. schools are enormous. Fwd.us, a group advocating for criminal justice and immigration reform, estimated in 2021 that 600,000 K-12 students in the U.S. lacked legal status. Nearly 4 million students \u2014 many of them born in the U.S. \u2014 have a parent living in the country illegally.",
      "Immigration raids have been shown to impact academic performance for students \u2014 even those who are native-born. In North Carolina and California, researchers have found lower attendance and a drop in enrollment among Hispanic students when local police participate in a program that deputizes them to enforce immigration law. Another study found test scores of Hispanic students dropped in schools near the sites of workplace raids.",
      "In Fresno, attendance has dropped since Trump took office by anywhere from 700 to 1,000 students a day. Officials in the central California district have received countless panicked calls from parents about rumored immigration raids \u2013 including about raids at schools, said Carlos Castillo, chief of diversity, equity and inclusion at the Fresno Unified School District. The feared school raids have all been hoaxes.",
      "\u201cIt goes beyond just the students who \u2026 have citizenship status or legal status,\u201d Castillo said. Students are afraid for their parents, relatives and friends, and they\u2019re terrified that immigration agents might raid their schools or homes, he said.",

      "A former Watergate prosecutor has urged the federal judge presiding over the prosecution of New York City Mayor Eric Adams to assign a special counsel to help decide how to handle the Justice Department's request to drop charges",
      "NEW YORK -- A former Watergate prosecutor on Monday urged a federal judge presiding over the prosecution of New York City Mayor Eric Adams to assign a special counsel to help decide how to handle the Justice Department\u2019s request to drop charges while three ex-U.S. attorneys urged a \u201csearching factual inquiry.\u201d",
      "Attorney Nathaniel Akerman told Judge Dale E. Ho in a letter filed in the case record in Manhattan federal court that he sought to intervene because nobody was representing the public\u2019s interest after three attorneys from the Justice Department in Washington made the request Friday.",
      "The one-time Watergate prosecutor urged the judge to reject the dismissal request, saying the court could look into how the Justice Department reached its decision and could require Acting Deputy Attorney General Emil Bove, who first directed prosecutors to drop the case, to appear in court and explain his position.",
      "Akerman, representing Common Cause, a nonpartisan advocacy group for U.S. elections integrity, said the judge may ultimately need to appoint an independent special prosecutor to the case.",
      "Three ex-U.S. attorneys also submitted arguments to Ho Monday, saying what was at stake was \u201cfar more than an internal prosecutorial dispute about an individual case.\u201d",
      "\u201cThe public furor that has arisen during the past week raises concerns about respect for the rule of law and the division of power between the Executive and Judicial Branches of government in our nation,\u201d wrote John S. Martin Jr., the Manhattan U.S. attorney from 1980 to 1983; Robert J. Cleary, U.S. attorney for New Jersey from 1999 to 2002; and Deirdre M. Daly, U.S. attorney for Connecticut from 2013 to 2017.",
      "They suggested Ho first learn why the Justice Department wanted the charges dismissed and whether its reasons were pretextual.",
      "If the judge decides dismissal of charges is inappropriate, he will have multiple remedies, including the power to appoint a special prosecutor or to direct federal prosecutors to make evidence, including grand jury materials, available to state and local prosecutors, they said.",
      "They also wrote that a factual inquiry might lead to other \u201cnecessary and important outcomes,\u201d including the possibility of a contempt proceeding, criminal referrals and disciplinary recommendations.",
      "\u201cIn short, depending on the circumstances, the Court could have a variety of procedural avenues available to protect the integrity of the Court and the justice system from abuse,\u201d the former prosecutors said.",
      "The ex-prosecutors also told the judge that additional public statements regarding the events of the past week have been issued or would be issued shortly by hundreds of former federal prosecutors.",
      "Adams has pleaded not guilty to charges that while in his prior role as Brooklyn borough president, he accepted over $100,000 in illegal campaign contributions and lavish travel perks from a Turkish official and business leaders seeking to buy his influence.",
      "The last week has featured after an unusual public fight between Bove, the second-in-command of the Justice Department, and two top New York federal prosecutors: interim Manhattan U.S. Attorney Danielle Sassoon and Hagan Scotten, an assistant U.S. attorney in Manhattan who led the Adams prosecution.",
      "On Thursday, Sassoon resigned, along with five high-ranking Justice Department officials. A day later, Scotten resigned, noting that Sassoon had properly resisted a demand that the charges be dropped and the possibility they could be reinstated after this year's election.",
      "\u201cNo system of ordered liberty can allow the Government to use the carrot of dismissing charges, or the stick of threatening to bring them again, to induce an elected official to support its policy objectives,\u201d he wrote.",
      "On Monday, Adams \u2014 amid calls to resign by some Democrats \u2014 confirmed that four of his top deputies had decided to resign in the fallout from the Justice Department\u2019s push to end the corruption case against him and ensure his cooperation with Trump\u2019s immigration crackdown.",
      "In his letter to Ho, Akerman echoed Sassoon's assertion that the Justice Department had accepted a request by Adams\u2019 lawyers for a \u201cquid pro quo\u201d \u2014 his help on immigration enforcement in exchange for dropping the case. She called it a \u201cbreathtaking and dangerous precedent.\"",
      "Akerman wrote that there was \u201coverwhelming evidence from DOJ\u2019s own internal documents showing that the dismissal of the Adams indictment is not in the public interest and is part of a corrupt quid pro quo between Mayor Adams and the Trump administration.\u201d",
      "He said the internal documents show that in return for dismissal of the indictment, Adams agreed to improperly assist the Trump administration with immigration enforcement.",
      "Adams\u2019 lawyer Alex Spiro said Thursday that the allegation of a quid pro quo was a \u201ctotal lie.\u201d",
      "When he directed Sassoon to drop the charges a week ago, Bove said the mayor of America\u2019s largest city was needed to assist in Trump\u2019s immigration crackdown and the dismissal of charges could enable Adams to campaign for reelection against multiple opponents unencumbered by criminal charges."

      "JUNO BEACH, Fla. -- Eight green sea turtles were released back into the Atlantic Ocean on Tuesday, nearly a month after an arctic blast brought a rare snowfall to northern Florida and left the aquatic reptiles suffering from a condition known as cold stunning.",
      "A total of 17 sea turtles found stranded last month along Florida's northeastern Atlantic Coast were brought to the Loggerhead Marinelife Center in Juno Beach, north of West Palm Beach, for rehabilitation.",
      "\u201cThere are so many turtles that were affected by that cold stunning event that happened several weeks ago,\" lead veterinarian Dr. Heather Barron said. \"The cold really suppresses their immune system because they are reptiles, and their body temperature is taken from the surrounding temperature of the water.\u201d",
      "It snowed as far south as northern Florida, which is extremely rare, and the frigid temperatures reached South Florida. More than a dozen additional turtles have been brought to Loggerhead Marinelife Center since the initial group, and other turtle facilities around the state have reached capacity.",
      "Veterinarians have been treating the turtles with antibiotics, fluids and intravenous nutrition. They all suffered from cold stunning, which causes sea turtles to lose mobility and become lethargic. Most of the turtles are expected to be released back into the ocean in a few weeks.",
      "Loggerhead Marinelife Center expects to host over 15,000 people this upcoming weekend at its 20th Annual TurtleFest. The free event focuses on promoting ocean conservation through interactive educational exhibits and marine life.",

      "WASHINGTON -- The White House says billionaire Elon Musk is not the administrator of the Department of Government Efficiency team that is sweeping through federal agencies, but is rather a senior adviser to President Donald Trump.",
      "Musk's exact role could be key in the legal fight over DOGE's access to government data as the Trump administration moves to lay off thousands of federal workers. Defining him as an adviser rather that the person in charge of day-to-day operations at DOGE could help the administration beat a lawsuit arguing Musk has too much power for someone who isn't elected or Senate-confirmed.",
      "The declaration was filed Monday as the Trump administration fends off the lawsuit from several Democratic states that want to block Musk and the DOGE team from accessing government systems. The litigants say Musk is wielding \u201cvirtually unchecked power\u201d in violation of the Constitution.",
      "The Trump administration, on the other hand, says Musk has \u201cno actual authority to make government decisions himself,\u201d Joshua Fisher, director of the White House Office of Administration, said in court papers. The documents do not name the administrator of DOGE, whose work Musk has championed in posts on his social-media platform X and in a public appearance at the White House.",
      "The DOGE team has roamed from agency to agency, tapping into computer systems, digging into budgets and searching for waste, fraud and abuse, while lawsuits pile up claiming Trump and DOGE are violating the law. At least two are targeting Musk himself.",
      "U.S. District Judge Tanya Chutkan seemed skeptical in a hearing Monday when Justice Department lawyers asserted that Musk has no formal authority.",
      "\u201cI think you stretch too far. I disagree with you there,\u201d Chutkan said."

      "MADISON, Wis. -- People who lost their homes to Hurricane Helene or California wildfires could get a sizeable tax break to move to Wisconsin.",
      "Republican legislators in the Dairy State have proposed a bill that would give anyone who moves to Wisconsin from North Carolina or Los Angeles County because they were displaced by one of the disasters a $10,000 income tax credit for the 2025 tax year. People who have been convicted of felonies wouldn't be eligible.",
      "The bill's authors, state Rep. Cindi Duchow and state Sen. Dan Feyen, said in memo to their colleagues seeking co-sponsors that the tax credit could draw people to the state and help alleviate chronic workforce shortages, particularly in the health care sector. A task force that Democratic Gov. Tony Evers formed to study Wisconsin's worker shortage released a report in August showing a potential deficit of up to 19,000 registered nurses in the state by 2040 and nearly 32,000 annual openings in the health care field over the next five years.",
      "\u201cHurricane Helene created massive flooding issues in Appalachia, and the devastating wildfires affecting Los Angeles County have displaced thousands of people from their homes,\u201d the lawmakers wrote in their memo. \u201cMany have lost nearly all possessions and will need to rebuild in the wake of this tragedy. Some highly skilled workers may consider or be forced to leave North Carolina or California, so why not incentivize them to settle in Wisconsin?\u201d",
      "The bill's prospects are unclear at best.",
      "Spokespeople for Republican Assembly Speaker Robin Vos and Senate Republican Majority Leader Devin LeMahieu didn't immediately respond to emails inquiring about the bill's chances of getting a floor vote in either chamber.",
      "Evers' spokesperson, Britt Cudaback, also didn't immediately respond to an email asking what the governor might do with the proposal if it reaches his desk. It's unlikely he would sign it into law given the gaping rift that has developed between him and Republican legislative leaders since he first took office in in 2019.",

      "The term \u201cpolar vortex\u201d usually refers to the gigantic circular upper air weather pattern in the Arctic region. It is a normal pattern that is stronger in the winter and keeps some of the coldest weather bottled up near the North Pole.",
      "But at times some of the vortex can break off or move south, bringing unusually cold weather south and permitting warmer weather to creep up north.",
      "This week, parts of the U.S. are experiencing the 10th and coldest polar vortex event this season. Weather forces in the Arctic are combining to push the chilly air into the U.S. and Europe.",

    "summary": "Indigenous activist Leonard Peltier is set to be released from a Florida prison Tuesday",
    "story": [
      "Indigenous activist Leonard Peltier is set to be released from a Florida prison Tuesday",
      "Indigenous activist Leonard Peltier is set to be released from a Florida prison Tuesday based on former President Joe Biden having commuted his life sentence for the 1975 killings of two FBI agents, a decision that elated Peltier's supporters while angering law enforcement officials who believe in his guilt.",
      "For nearly half a century, Peltier\u2019s imprisonment has symbolized systemic injustice for Native Americans across the country who believe in his innocence. The decision to release the 80-year-old to home confinement was celebrated by supporters.",
      "\u201cHe represents every person who\u2019s been roughed up by a cop, profiled, had their children harassed at school,\u201d said Nick Estes, a professor of American Indian Studies at the University of Minnesota and a member of the Lower Brule Sioux Tribe who has advocated for Peltier\u2019s release.",
      "But the last-minute move as Biden was leaving office also prompted criticism from those who say Peltier is guilty, including former FBI Director Christopher Wray, who called him \u201ca remorseless killer\u201d in a private letter to Biden that was obtained by The Associated Press.",
      "\u201cGranting Peltier any relief from his conviction or sentence is wholly unjustified and would be an affront to the rule of law,\u201d Wray wrote.",
      "The commutation was not a pardon for crimes committed, something that Peltier\u2019s advocates have hoped for since he has always maintained his innocence.",
      "Peltier, an enrolled member of the Turtle Mountain Band of Chippewa in North Dakota, was active in the American Indian Movement, which beginning in the 1960s fought for Native American treaty rights and tribal self-determination.",
      "The group grabbed headlines in 1969, when activists occupied the former prison island of Alcatraz in the San Francisco Bay, and again in 1972, when they presented presidential candidates with a list of demands including the restoration of tribal land. After they were ignored, they seized the headquarters of the Bureau of Indian Affairs.",
      "From then on the group was subject to FBI surveillance and harassment under a covert program that sought to disrupt activism and was exposed in 1975.",
      "Peltier's conviction stemmed from a confrontation that same year on the Oglala Sioux Indian Reservation in Pine Ridge, South Dakota, in which FBI agents Jack Coler and Ronald Williams were killed. According to the FBI, the agents were there to serve arrest warrants for robbery and assault with a dangerous weapon.",
      "Prosecutors maintained at trial that Peltier shot both agents in the head at point-blank range. Peltier acknowledged being present and firing a gun at a distance, but said he fired in self-defense. A woman who claimed to have seen Peltier shoot the agents later recanted her testimony, saying it had been coerced.",
      "He was convicted of two counts of first-degree murder and given two consecutive life sentences.",
      "Two other movement members, co-defendants Robert Robideau and Dino Butler, were acquitted on the grounds of self-defense.",
      "Peltier was denied parole as recently as July and was not eligible to be considered for it again until 2026.",
      "\u201cLeonard Peltier\u2019s release is the right thing to do given the serious and ongoing human rights concerns about the fairness of his trial, his nearly 50 years behind bars, his health and his age,\" said Paul O\u2019Brien, executive director with Amnesty International USA in a statement. \"While we welcome his release from prison, he should not be restricted to home confinement.\u201d",
      "Prominent Native American groups like the National Congress of the American Indian have called for Peltier's release for decades, and Amnesty International considered him a political prisoner. Prominent supporters included South African Archbishop Desmond Tutu, civil rights icon Coretta Scott King, actor and director Robert Redford and musicians Pete Seeger, Harry Belafonte and Jackson Browne.",
      "Generations of Indigenous activists and leaders lobbied multiple presidents to pardon Peltier. Former Interior Secretary Deb Haaland, a member of the Pueblo of Laguna and the first Native American to hold the secretary's position, praised Biden's decision.",
      "\u201cI am grateful that Leonard can now go home to his family,\u201d she said Jan. 20 in a post on the social platform X. \u201cI applaud President Biden for this action and understanding what this means to Indian Country.\u201d",
      "As a young child, Peltier was taken from his family and sent to a boarding school. Thousands of Indigenous children over decades faced the same fate, and were in many cases subjected to systemic physical, psychological and sexual abuse.",
      "\u201cHe hasn\u2019t really had a home since he was taken away to boarding school,\u201d said Nick Tilsen, who has been advocating for Peltier's release since he was a teen and is CEO of NDN Collective, an Indigenous-led advocacy group based in South Dakota. \u201cSo he is excited to be at home and paint and have grandkids running around.\u201d"

      "NEW YORK -- New York City Mayor Eric Adams will face the federal judge on Wednesday who will decide whether to grant the Justice Department's request to dismiss corruption charges against him after lawyers explain the abrupt change in position just weeks before an April trial.",
      "Judge Dale E. Ho in Manhattan scheduled an afternoon hearing in a written order Tuesday as his first response to the government\u2019s Friday request to dismiss the charges after a weeklong clash among government lawyers that led to resignations by several top prosecutors in Washington and New York who refused to seek dismissal.",
      "Ho said the parties in the case must be prepared to address the reasons for the government's dismissal request, the \u201cscope and effect of Mayor Adams's \u2018consent in writing,\u2019\u201d ... and the \u201cprocedure for resolution of the motion.\u201d",
      "At the start of his two-page order, Ho quoted from an opinion by the 2nd U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals in Manhattan that said Rule 48(a) of the Federal Rules of Criminal Procedure, which governs the government's request, was not created to shift absolute power from the Executive to the Judicial Branch but was intended \u201cas a power to check power.\u201d",
      "The appeals court also wrote that the Executive Branch is \u201cpresumptively the best judge of whether a pending prosecution should be terminated\u201d and advised that \u201cpending prosecutions should not be judicially disturbed unless clearly contrary to manifest public interest.\u201d",
      "Ho also cited legal history noting that a judge has independent obligations once the government has involved the judiciary by obtaining an indictment or a conviction. And he quoted from one judicial opinion that said a judge must be \u201csatisfied that the reasons advanced for the proposed dismissal are substantial\u201d before approving a dismissal.",
      "The hearing will occur as a growing number of former prosecutors express concerns about the past week's events, with some calling on Ho to conduct an inquiry that could put Washington's Justice Department leadership under a spotlight.",
      "Late Monday, Justice Connection, which supports Justice Department employees, released a letter from over 900 former federal prosecutors to career federal prosecutors that said they have \u201cwatched with alarm\u201d as values \u201cfoundational to a fair and justice legal system\u201d have been tested in the past week.",
      "In the letter, the former prosecutors said they \u201csalute and admire the courage many of you have already exhibited. You have responded to ethical challenges of a type no public servant should ever be forced to confront with principle and conviction, in the finest traditions of the Department of Justice.\"",
      "The letter was released after three former U.S. attorneys from New York, New Jersey and Connecticut submitted papers to Ho suggesting that he appoint a special prosecutor if he finds the Justice Department acted improperly or that he order that all evidence be made available to state and local prosecutors.",
      "Adams has pleaded not guilty to charges that while in his prior role as Brooklyn borough president, he accepted over $100,000 in illegal campaign contributions and lavish travel perks from a Turkish official and business leaders seeking to buy his influence.",
      "The last week has featured an unusual public fight between Emil Bove, the second-in-command of the Justice Department, and two top New York federal prosecutors: interim Manhattan U.S. Attorney Danielle Sassoon and Hagan Scotten, an assistant U.S. attorney in Manhattan who led the Adams prosecution.",
      "Bove wrote that the case had \u201cunduly restricted Mayor Adams\u2019 ability to devote full attention and resources to the illegal immigration and violent crime.\u201d",
      "On Thursday, Sassoon resigned, along with five high-ranking Justice Department officials. A day later, Scotten resigned, noting that Sassoon had properly resisted a demand that the charges be dropped and the possibility they could be reinstated after this year\u2019s election.",
      "\u201cNo system of ordered liberty can allow the Government to use the carrot of dismissing charges, or the stick of threatening to bring them again, to induce an elected official to support its policy objectives,\u201d Scotten wrote.",
      "On Monday, Adams \u2014 amid calls to resign by some Democrats \u2014 confirmed that four of his top deputies had decided to resign in the fallout from the Justice Department\u2019s push to end the corruption case against him and ensure his cooperation with Trump\u2019s immigration crackdown.",

      "WASHINGTON -- The Trump administration has begun firing several hundred Federal Aviation Administration employees, upending staff on a busy air travel weekend and just weeks after a January fatal midair collision at Ronald Reagan Washington National Airport.",
      "Probationary workers were targeted in late-night emails Friday notifying them they had been fired, David Spero, president of the Professional Aviation Safety Specialists union, said in a statement.",
      "The impacted workers include personnel hired for FAA radar, landing and navigational aid maintenance, one air traffic controller told The Associated Press. The air traffic controller was not authorized to talk to the media and spoke on condition of anonymity.",
      "A Transportation Department official told the AP late Monday that no air traffic controllers were affected by the cuts, and that the agency has \u201cretained employees who perform critical safety functions.\u201d In a follow-up query the agency said they would have to look into whether the radar, landing and navigational aid workers affected were considered to handle critical safety functions.",
      "The National Air Traffic Controllers Association said in a brief statement Monday it was \"analyzing the effect of the reported federal employee terminations on aviation safety, the national airspace system and our members.\u201d",
      "Other FAA employees who were fired were working on an urgent and classified early warning radar system the Air Force had announced in 2023 for Hawaii to detect incoming cruise missiles, through a program that was in part funded by the Defense Department. It's one of several programs that the FAA's National Airspace System Defense Program manages that involve radars providing longer-range detection around the country's borders.",
      "Due to the nature of their work, staff in that office typically provide an extensive knowledge transfer before retiring to make sure no institutional knowledge is lost, said Charles Spitzer-Stadtlander, one of the employees in that branch who was terminated.",
      "The Hawaii radar and the FAA defense program office working on it are \u201cabout protecting national security,\" Spitzer-Stadtlander said. \u201cI don't think they even knew what NDP does, they just thought, oh no big deal, he just works for the FAA.\u201d",
      "\u201cThis is about protecting national security, and I'm scared to death,\" Spitzer-Stadtlander said. \u201cAnd the American public should be scared too.\u201d",
      "Spero said messages began arriving after 7 p.m. Friday and continued late into the night. More might be notified over the long weekend or barred from entering FAA buildings Tuesday, he said.",
      "The employees were fired \u201cwithout cause nor based on performance or conduct,\u201d Spero said, and the emails were \u201cfrom an \u2018exec order\u2019 Microsoft email address\u201d \u2014 not a government email address. A copy of the termination email that was provided to the AP shows the sending address \u201cASK_AHR_EXEC_Orders@usfaa.mail.outlook.com.\"",
      "The firings hit the FAA as it is facing a shortfall in controllers. Federal officials have been raising concerns about an overtaxed and understaffed air traffic control system for years, especially after a series of close calls between planes at U.S. airports. Among the reasons they have cited for staffing shortages are uncompetitive pay, long shifts, intensive training and mandatory retirements.",
      "In the Jan. 29 fatal crash between a U.S. Army Black Hawk helicopter and American Airlines passenger jet, which is still under investigation, one controller was handing both commercial airline and helicopter traffic at the busy airport.",
      "Just days before the collision, President Donald Trump had already fired all the members of the Aviation Security Advisory Committee, a panel mandated by Congress after the 1988 PanAm 103 bombing over Lockerbie, Scotland. The committee is charged with examining safety issues at airlines and airports.",
      "Spitzer-Stadtlander suggested he was targeted for firing for his views on Tesla and X, formerly Twitter, not as part of a general probationary-level sweep. Both companies are owned by Elon Musk, whose Department of Government Efficiency is leading Trump's effort to cut the federal government.",
      "Spitzer-Stadtlander is Jewish and was angered by Musk's straight-arm gesture at Trump's inauguration. On his personal Facebook page he urged friends to get rid of their Teslas and X accounts in response.",
      "Spitzer-Stadtlander said that post drew the attention of a Facebook account labeled \u201cDepartment of Government Efficiency,\" which reacted with a laughing emoji. Soon after, he saw the same account reacting to much older posts through his personal Facebook feed.",
      "There are at least a half-dozen Facebook accounts labeled \u201cDepartment of Government Efficiency,\u201d and it\u2019s unclear who operates any of them. White House spokesperson Karoline Leavitt wrote Monday on X, \u201cDOGE doesn\u2019t even have a Facebook page.\u201d",
      "Spitzer-Stadtlander said he was supposed to be exempted from the probationary firings because the FAA office he worked in focused on national security threats such as attacks on the national airspace by drones.",
      "\u201cLess than a week later, I was fired, despite my position allegedly being exempted due to national security,\u201d Spitzer-Stadtlander wrote in a post over the weekend on LinkedIn.",
      "He added, \"When DOGE fired me, they turned off my computer and wiped all of my files without warning.\u201d",

      "CANANDAIGUA, N.Y. -- Investigators have not yet found evidence that the torture and killing of a transgender man whose body was discarded in an upstate New York field was a hate crime, law enforcement officials said.",
      "Five people were charged Friday in the death of Sam Nordquist, a 24-year-old transgender man who was reported missing on Feb. 9. State Police Maj. Kevin Sucher called the circumstances of the case \u201cbeyond depraved\u201d at a post-arrest news conference in the Finger Lakes region. Officials said the investigation found a \u201cdeeply disturbing pattern of abuse\u201d that ultimately led to Nordquist\u2019s death.",
      "The brutal killing has led to questions about whether it was a hate crime.",
      "In a statement released Sunday, the Ontario County District Attorney's Office said, \u201cHis assailants were known to each other, identified as LGBTQ+, and at least one of the defendants lived with Sam in the time period leading up to the instant offense.\"",
      "\u201cWe urge the community not to speculate into the motive behind the murder as we work to find justice for Sam,\u201d the statement says. \u201cAt this time, we have no indication that Sam\u2019s murder was a hate crime.\u201d",
      "Under New York state law, a hate crime is an offense committed \u201cin whole or in substantial part\u201d because of a belief or perception regarding race, gender, gender identity and other identifiers.",
      "Requests for updates to the investigation were made Tuesday to police and prosecutors. It remains unclear if the five suspects have attorneys yet. A message was left seeking comment with the Ontario County public defender\u2019s office.",
      "Nordquist's mother told Syracuse.com on Monday that he left Minnesota for New York in September to meet a woman he had become romantically involved with after connecting online.",
      "\u201cThat\u2019s all Sam ever wanted, was to be loved and to be in a relationship,\u201d Linda Nordquist told the news site, describing him as trusting and loving.",
      "Nordquist was supposed to fly home in October but decided to stay longer to work on the relationship, his mother said. Soon afterward, phone calls between them began to dwindle, which she said was unusual. In December, Linda Nordquist was informed by the Ontario County Department of Social Services that her son had sought help from the agency, saying he was in a controlling relationship and missed home.",
      "Among those accused of killing him is the woman he met online and came to visit, the mother said. The woman and the other four suspects were charged with second-degree murder after police on Thursday searched a room at the Patty\u2019s Lodge motel in Canandaigua, New York, the last place Nordquist was known to be staying."

      "China\u2019s Foreign Ministry has taken issue with a revised U.S. government fact sheet that removed a line on American opposition to independence for Taiwan",
      "BEIJING -- China's Foreign Ministry took issue Monday with a revised U.S. government fact sheet that removed a line on American opposition to independence for Taiwan.",
      "The United States has \u201cgravely backpedaled\u201d on its position on Taiwan and sent the wrong message to \u201cseparatist forces\" on the island, ministry spokesperson Guo Jiakun said.",
      "Taiwan and China split in 1949 during the civil war that brought the communists to power in China. The defeated Nationalists fled to Taiwan and set up a rival government there. Taiwan has its own government and military but has never declared formal independence from China.",
      "\u201cWe urge the U.S. to ... stop emboldening and supporting Taiwan independence and avoid further damaging China-U.S. relations and the peace and stability of the Taiwan Strait,\u201d Guo said when asked about the revision at a daily media briefing.",
      "The Taiwan Strait is a narrow waterway that separates the island of Taiwan from China's east coast.",
      "The U.S. State Department removed the phrase \"we do not support Taiwan independence\u201d from the fact sheet last week. The document on America\u2019s relations with the self-governing island is posted on its website.",
      "Taiwan's government welcomed the move, though a statement sent to The Associated Press on Monday did not mention the language specifically.",
      "\u201cThe Ministry of Foreign Affairs has noted that the U.S. State Department updated the \u2018Current State of U.S.-Taiwan Relations\u2019 page ... with text that is positive and friendly toward us, reflecting the close and amicable partnership between Taiwan and the United States,\u201d it said.",
      "It\u2019s not the first time the State Department has removed the phrase. It did so in May 2022 but restored it a few weeks later after a strong protest from China.",
      "It\u2019s unclear why the State Department changed the language again and whether it signals any shift in policy under President Donald Trump, who returned to the White House last month.",
      "The government in Taiwan is worried that Trump might not be as steadfast a supporter of the island as his predecessor, former President Joe Biden.",
      "The U.S. does not recognize Taiwan as a country but is its strongest backer and biggest arms supplier.",
      "Trump said last week that Taiwan, a leading maker of semiconductors, had taken the chip business away from the U.S. and that he wants it to come back.",
      "China, which says that Taiwan must come under its control, has stepped up military exercises around the island of 23 million people in recent years. The U.S. government fact sheet says that it expects \u201cdifferences to be resolved by peaceful means, free from coercion, in a manner acceptable to the people on both sides.\u201d",

      "Dubbed \u201cNo Kings on Presidents Day\u201d by the 50501 Movement, the latest protests came less than two weeks after a similar nationwide event on Feb. 5 drew participants in dozens of cities. Both protests denounced Trump and billionaire adviser Elon Musk, the leader of Trump\u2019s new Department of Government Efficiency, an outside-government organization designed to slash federal spending.",
      "Nearly 1,000 people marched in the snow from the Statehouse in Boston to City Hall, chanting \u201cElon Musk has got to go\u201d and \u201cNo kings on Presidents Day!\u201d The temperature was below freezing with wind chills in the teens.",
      "Boston protesters, some dressed in Revolutionary War-style clothing from the 1700s, carried signs saying such things as \u201cThis is a Coup\u201d and \u201cCowards Bow to Trump, Patriots Stand Up.\u201d One sign had a depiction of Uncle Sam saying \u201cI Want You to Resist.\u201d",
      "\u201cI thought it was important to be here on Presidents Day to demonstrate for what America stands for,\u201d said Emily Manning, 55, a Boston engineer who came to the rally with her two teenage sons. \u201cAmerican values are not the values of the plutocracy or the limited few rich people.\u201d",
      "Organizers of Monday\u2019s protests, which were focused on state capitals and major cities including Washington, D.C.; Orlando, Florida; and Seattle, said they were targeting \u201canti-democratic and illegal actions of the Trump administration and its plutocratic allies.\u201d",
      "One sign at the rally that attracted hundreds in the nation's capital said, \u201cDeport Musk Dethrone Trump.\u201d",
      "Many demonstrations were slated for cities where temperatures were well below freezing as a polar vortex worked its way across the country.",

      "A traffic stop in Vermont has cracked open a cultlike group called Zizians linked to six deaths in three states",
      "In the wooded outskirts of Chapel Hill, North Carolina, a perplexed landlord noticed odd sights at two of his rental properties.",
      "Tenants wore long black coats and parked box trucks outside the duplexes. They ran an electrical cord from one box truck into one of the condos, and kept a stretcher inside another.",
      "A neighbor remembers similarly dressed figures walking around at night holding hands. They never spoke a word.",
      "By the time the FBI searched the property last week, one of the most recent tenants had been killed in a shootout with U.S. Border Patrol agents in Vermont, and a second was under arrest. A third, a shadowy figure known online as \u201cZiz,\u201d remains missing after authorities linked their cultlike group to six deaths in three states.",
      "Officials have offered few details of the cross-country investigation, which broke open after the Jan. 20 shooting death of a Border Patrol trooper in Vermont during a traffic stop. Associated Press interviews and a review of court records and online postings tell the story of how a group of young, highly intelligent computer scientists, most of them in their 20s and 30s, met online, shared anarchist beliefs, and became increasingly violent.",
      "Their goals aren\u2019t clear, but online writings span topics from radical veganism and gender identity to artificial intelligence.",
      "At the middle of it all is \u201cZiz,\u201d who appears to be the leader of the strange group, who called themselves \u201cZizians.\u201d She has been seen near multiple crime scenes and has connections to various suspects.",
      "She was even declared dead for a time, before reappearing amid more violence.",
      "Jack LaSota moved to the San Francisco Bay area after earning a computer science degree from the University of Alaska Fairbanks in 2013 and interning at NASA, according to a profile on a hiring site for programmers, coders and other freelance workers. NASA officials did not respond to a request to confirm LaSota's internship, but a Jack LaSota is listed on a website about past interns.",
      "In 2016, she began publishing a dark and rambling blog under the name Ziz, describing her theory that the two hemispheres of the brain could hold separate values and genders and \u201coften desire to kill each other.\u201d",
      "LaSota used she/her pronouns, and in her writings says she is a transgender woman. She railed against perceived enemies, including so-called rationalist groups, which operate mostly online and seek to understand human cognition through reason and knowledge. Some are concerned with the potential dangers of artificial intelligence.",
      "LaSota began promoting an extreme mix of rationalism, ethical veganism, anarchism and other value systems, said Jessica Taylor, an AI researcher who met LaSota both in person and online through the rationalist community and knew her as Ziz.",
      "When LaSota left the rationalists behind, she took with her a group of \u201cextremely vulnerable and isolated\u201d followers, Anna Salamon, executive director of the Center for Applied Rationality, told the San Francisco Chronicle.",
      "Taylor said Ziz adherents use the rationalist ideology as a reason to commit violence. \u201cStuff like, thinking it\u2019s reasonable to avoid paying rent and defend oneself from being evicted,\u201d she said.",
      "Poulomi Saha, a professor who has studied cults, said LaSota\u2019s beliefs and writings may have made readers feel seen, an often central factor in the formation of groups commonly labeled cults. That\u2019s especially true in the era of online communities, in which it\u2019s easier for marginalized people to seek fellow believers.",
      "\u201cFor the person who feels hailed by that blog post, there is likely to be a kind of dual experience,\u201d said Saha, co-director of the program in critical theory at the University of California, Berkeley. \u201cOne where they feel like \u2018I have been saying this, or thinking this, all along, and no one has believed me.\u2019\u201d",
      "LaSota, 34, has not responded to multiple Associated Press emails in recent weeks, and her attorney Daniel McGarrigle declined to comment when asked whether she is connected to any of the deaths. She has missed court appearances in two states, and bench warrants have been issued for her arrest. Associated Press reporters have left numerous phone and e-mail messages with LaSota's family and received no response.",
      "In November 2019, LaSota was arrested along with several other people at a protest outside a Northern California retreat center where the Center for Applied Rationality was holding an event. Sheriff\u2019s deputies called in a SWAT team and armored vehicle after the mask-wearing group blocked the property\u2019s exits and handed out fliers railing against the rationalist organization. The group said they were protesting sexual misconduct inside the rationalist group.",
      "The case against LaSota, Emma Borhanian, 31, Gwen Danielson and Alexander Leatham, 29, was pending in August 2022 when the U.S. Coast Guard responded to a report that LaSota had fallen out of a boat in San Francisco Bay. Her body wasn\u2019t found, but her mother confirmed the death and an obituary was published.",
      "It wasn\u2019t long before Ziz surfaced again.",
      "By the autumn of 2022, LaSota had moved with other group members, including Borhanian and Leatham, into vans and box trucks on property owned by Curtis Lind in Vallejo, about 30 miles north of San Francisco.",
      "\u201cEmma\u2019s van was amazing,\u201d said someone who knew Borhanian. \u201cIt had a refrigerator and freezer and microwave. It was truly a work of art.\u201d",
      "The person, who spoke on condition of anonymity because of fears for her safety, described Borhanian as a kind and loving young woman so smart that she worked at Google while in college. Google did not respond to an inquiry about Borhanian's employment there.",
      "Prosecutors say she was among those who attacked Lind on Nov. 13 when he tried to evict the group for not paying rent.",
      "Impaled by a sword and partially blinded, Lind fought back, fatally shooting Borhanian. Concluding that Lind acted in self-defense, officials charged Leatham and Suri Dao, 23, with murder in Borhanian\u2019s death, as well as attempted murder of Lind.",
      "A person reached by an Associated Press reporter at a phone number listed for Alex Leatham\u2019s father declined to comment. Attempts to reach family members for Dao were not successful.",
      "Police believe LaSota was at the scene of the crime, but she was not arrested.",
      "On New Year\u2019s Eve of 2022, a couple was shot and killed in their home in Chester Heights, Pennsylvania.",
      "A doorbell camera captured audio and video of a car pulling up to the home of Richard Zajko, 71, and his wife, Rita, 69. A voice shouts \u201cMom!\u201d and another voice exclaims, \u201cOh my God! Oh, God, God!\u201d according to a Pennsylvania state police affidavit. Police found the couple shot in the head in an upstairs bedroom after they failed to show up to take care of Rita\u2019s mother.",
      "Police questioned the couple\u2019s daughter, Michelle, at her home in Vermont, and a few weeks later, took her into custody at a Pennsylvania hotel. She wasn't arrested or charged with anything. LaSota was at the hotel, too, and was arrested after refusing to cooperate with officers, and charged with obstructing law enforcement and disorderly conduct.",
      "Six months later, LaSota was released on bail but stopped showing up for court.",
      "LaSota\u2019s attorney, Daniel McGarrigle, said last month his client was \u201cwholly and unequivocally innocent of the charges filed in this case.\u201d",
      "Meanwhile, the case regarding the landlord in California was headed to trial. The landlord, who was 82, was the only eyewitness, and prosecutors wanted to hurry along the proceedings.",
      "But on Jan. 17, Lind\u2019s throat was cut, and he died, not far from where he had survived the earlier attack.",
      "Maximilian Snyder, 22, who is charged with murder, appeared in court Feb. 6, only long enough to request a new attorney. It's not clear how he was identified as a suspect; he has ties to a woman who just days later would be involved in a shootout.",
      "Snyder is listed as in custody in the Solano County Jail in California. Attempts to reach family members of Snyder were not successful.",
      "On. Jan 20, in Vermont, U.S. Border Patrol agents stopped a vehicle carrying two people connected to the Ziz group. A hotel worker had called authorities after seeing one of them, Teresa Youngblut, with a gun.",
      "Youngblut was driving the car when it was pulled over on Jan. 20, and authorities say she quickly opened fire on officers. The passenger, Felix Bauckholt, a German national who is also listed in court documents as Ophelia, died, along with the border patrol agent, David Maland.",
      "Youngblut was wounded and arrested and has pleaded not guilty to firearms charges.",
      "Authorities who searched the car found a ballistic helmet, night-vision goggles, respirators and ammunition, the FBI said. They also found two-way radios and used shooting range targets.",
      "Youngblut applied for a marriage license with Snyder, the man accused of murdering the elderly landlord. He was a childhood friend; it was unclear if they were married. Authorities say the gun she was carrying was purchased by a person of interest in the Zajko killings.",
      "Youngblut and Bauckholt had been living at the two condos in North Carolina, where the landlord and neighbors now say they saw the odd behavior.",
      "LaSota also had been living there as recently as this winter, said the landlord, who reviewed LaSota\u2019s 2019 police booking photo. He spoke to The Associated Press on the condition of anonymity because he was concerned for his safety.",
      "Expressing similar concerns, a neighbor who lived in the other side of Bauckholt\u2019s duplex until September 2023 recalled seeing three people wearing long black robes and tactical clothes.",
      "\u201cThey rarely came out during the day but would walk around the neighborhood and in the woods at night,\u201d the former neighbor said, who also spoke only on condition of anonymity because of concerns for their safety. \u201cSometimes all three of them would go for a walk and they all held hands. They seemed to care for each other a great deal.\u201d",

Previously, the administration announced a plan to offer buyouts to almost all federal employees through a \u201cdeferred resignation program\u201d to quickly reduce the government workforce. The program deadline was Feb. 6, and administration officials said employees who accept will be able to stop working while still collecting a paycheck until Sept. 30.",

      "MUNICH, Germany -- Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy says he directed his ministers not to sign off on a proposed agreement to give the United States access to Ukraine\u2019s rare earth minerals because the document was too focused on U.S. interests.",
      "The proposal, which was at the center of Zelenskyy\u2019s talks with U.S. Vice President JD Vance on the sidelines of the Munich Security Conference on Friday, did not offer any specific security guarantees in return, according to one current and one former senior official familiar with the talks.",
      "Zelenskyy\u2019s decision to reject a deal, at least for now, was described as \u201cshort-sighted\u201d by a senior White House official.",
      "\u201cI didn\u2019t let the ministers sign a relevant agreement because in my view it is not ready to protect us, our interest,\u201d Zelenskyy told The Associated Press on Saturday in Munich.",
      "The proposal focused on how the U.S. could use Kyiv\u2019s rare earth minerals \u201cas compensation\u201d for support already given to Ukraine by the Biden administration and as payment for future aid, current and former senior Ukrainian officials said speaking anonymously so they could speak freely.",
      "Ukraine has vast reserves of critical minerals which are used in aerospace, defense and nuclear industries. The Trump administration has indicated it is interested in accessing them to reduce dependence on China but Zelenskyy said any exploitation would need to be tied to security guarantees for Ukraine that would deter future Russian aggression.",
      "\u201cFor me is very important the connection between some kind of security guarantees and some kind of investment,\u201d the Ukrainian president said.",
      "Zelenskyy did not go into details about why he instructed his officials not to sign the document which was given to Ukrainian officials on Wednesday by U.S. Treasury Secretary Scott Bassent on a visit to Kyiv.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s a colonial agreement and Zelenskyy cannot sign it,\u201d the former senior official said.",
      "White House National Security Council spokesman Brian Hughes did not explicitly confirm the offer, but said in a statement that \u201cPresident Zelenskyy is being short-sighted about the excellent opportunity the Trump Administration has presented to Ukraine.\u201d The Trump administration has grown weary of sending additional U.S. aid to Ukraine and Hughes said a minerals deal would allow American taxpayers to \u201crecoup\u201d money sent to Kyiv while growing Ukraine\u2019s economy.",
      "Hughes added that the White House believes \u201cbinding economic ties with the United States will be the best guarantee against future aggression and an integral part of lasting peace.\u201d He added, \u201cThe U.S. recognizes this, the Russians recognize this, and the Ukrainians must recognize this.\u201d",
      "U.S. officials in discussions with their Ukrainian counterparts in Munich were commercially minded and largely concentrated on the specifics of exploring the minerals and how to form a possible partnership to do that with Ukraine, the senior official said.",
      "The potential value of the deposits in Ukraine has not yet been discussed, with much unexplored or close to the front line.",
      "The U.S. proposal apparently did not take into account how the deposits would be secured in the event of continuing Russian aggression. The official suggested the U.S. did not have \u201cready answers,\u201d to that question and that one of their takeaways from discussions in Munich will be how to secure any mineral extraction operation in Ukraine involving people and infrastructure.",
      "Any deal must be in accordance with Ukrainian law and acceptable to the Ukrainian people, the senior Ukrainian official said.",
      "\u201cSubsoil belongs to Ukrainians under the Constitution,\u201d Kseniiia Orynchak, founder of the National Association of Mining Industry of Ukraine previously told the AP suggesting a deal would need popular support.",
      "Zelenskyy and Vance did not discuss the details of the U.S. document during their meeting Friday at the Munich Security Conference, the senior official said. That meeting was \u201cvery good\u201d and \u201csubstantive,\u201d with Vance making it clear his and Trump\u2019s main goal was to achieve a durable, lasting peace, the senior official said.",
      "Zelenskyy told Vance that real peace requires Ukraine to be in a \u201cstrong position\u201d when starting negotiations, stressed that the U.S negotiators should come to Ukraine, and that the U.S., Ukraine and Europe must be at the negotiating table for talks with Russia.",

    "story": [
      "Thames Water has won a crucial High Court battle to secure a \u00a33bn rescue loan, staving off the prospect of the debt-laden company coming under government control.",
      "The UK's largest water and waste company was set to run out of cash by the end of March and would have likely been placed into temporary nationalisation to keep services running.",
      "The court decision on Tuesday has given Thames breathing space to undergo a major restructuring, but the future of the company remains uncertain as it struggles with \u00a319bn worth of debt and the ruling is set to be appealed.",
      "Thames has faced heavy criticism over its performance in recent years following a series of sewage discharges and leaks.",
      "The supplier serves about a quarter of the UK's population, mostly across London and parts of southern England, and employs 8,000 people.",
      "Since the dire state of the company's finances first emerged about 18 months ago, the government has been on standby to put Thames into special administration.",
      "Regardless of what happens to the company in the future, water supplies and waste services to households will continue as normal.",
      "The water regulator, Ofwat, said Thames Water remained \"subject to our turnaround oversight regime and safeguards are in place to ensure that services to customers are protected\".",
      "Thames has said the \u00a33bn in emergency funding will give it the space needed to complete a restructuring of its debts and attract a cash injection from prospective new investors.",
      "But the proposals had to be approved by the High Court after a group of Thames Water's creditors opposed it, arguing that the 9.75% interest rate on the loan was too costly.",
      "In approving the lifeline, Mr Justice Leech ruled that the \"relevant alternative\" to the company's plan being approved was temporary nationalisation, known as a Special Administration Regime.",
      "\"After taking into account the public interest in ensuring the uninterrupted provision of vital public services, I nevertheless exercise my discretion to sanction the plan,\" he said.",
      "He also added that Ofwat and the Environment Secretary had \"not opposed the plan\".",
      "Why is Thames Water in so much trouble?",
      "How much will I have to pay for my water?",
      "How much sewage is released into lakes, rivers and the sea?",
      "The Thames Water creditors in favour of the company's plan said the judgement was a \"positive step towards efforts to deliver a highly complex operational turnaround and restructuring\" and avoided \"billions in additional costs on UK taxpayers\".",
      "However, the group of creditors opposed to the deal confirmed they would appeal against the court's decision, after the judge granted them permission to do so.",
      "The group had argued an alternative \"B plan\" would provide the company with the same funding but on better terms and said it was \"disappointed\" by the ruling.",
      "\"Having this judgement reviewed by the Court of Appeal is essential against the backdrop of predatory lending to an essential utility with a clear public interest,\" a spokesperson said.",
      "'Good money after bad'",
      "Thames Water chairman Sir Adrian Montague said the ruling marked a \"significant milestone\" for the company while chief executive Chris Weston said it put \"our business on a firmer financial footing\".",
      "However, Charlie Maynard, Liberal Democrat MP for Witney in Oxfordshire, said he would appeal against the decision.",
      "The politician, who gave a witness statement to the High Court opposing the loan, said: \"Allowing Thames Water to take on \u00a33bn more debt is not in the interests of their millions of customers\".",
      "Henry Swithinbank, policy and advocacy manager at environmental charity Surfers Against Sewage, said the cash lifeline was a \"sticking plaster that will allow Thames Water to limp along until it requires another bailout\".",
      "Thames Water's problems have been blamed on a combination of poor historical regulation, actions by shareholders, climate change and management failure.",
      "Some have argued Thames should have been allowed to collapse and be nationalised due to it being the architect of its own misfortune. Previous owners loaded the company with debt and took out big dividends.",
      "But others, including water companies, have argued that a growing population and the challenges of a changing climate mean bills need to be higher and were kept at lower levels for too long.",
      "The first \u00a31.5bn of the rescue loans to Thames Water will see the company through to the autumn.",
      "A second instalment will be used to fund the company as it appeals a decision by Ofwat over how much Thames can raise household bills by \u2013 a process which could take up to a year.",
      "The company was set to repay \u00a3200m worth of debt due in March, but following the court ruling, all its debt repayments have been extended by two years.",
      "Last week, Thames launched an appeal to allow it to increase bills by more than the regulator had granted.",
      "Ofwat has capped bill rises at 35% over the next five years, but Thames has argued they need to increase by 53%.",
      "Five other water companies - Anglian Water, Northumbrian Water, Southern Water, and Wessex Water along with water-only company South East Water - have also said they will appeal to allow them to increase bills beyond Ofwat's cap.",
      "In total, the six companies serve more than half of all households in England.",
      "David Henderson, chief executive of the trade association Water UK said the extra money is need for water infrastructure investment.",
      "Six firms have said they will not appeal: Severn Trent, United Utilities, Pennon plus Dwr Cymru Welsh Water, SES and Hafren."

      "The predicted rise will come as the days get lighter and warmer, when energy use tends to fall.",

      "The regulator illustrates the cap by showing the impact on the annual bill of a household with typical energy usage.",
      "In January, there was a 1.2% rise - which worked out as \u00a31.75 extra a month compared with the previous cap.",

    "summary": "Elon Musk's goal might be hindering the growth potential of the AI firm of his rival Sam Altman, experts say.",
    "story": [
      "OpenAI's board of directors has officially rejected Elon Musk's nearly $100bn offer for the maker of what is the world's best-known artificial intelligence (AI) tool, ChatGPT.",
      "But the unsolicited bid might not be a failure - at least as far as Musk is concerned, experts say.",
      "That's because the offer could still complicate CEO Sam Altman's plans to transform OpenAI from a non-profit controlled entity to a for-profit company.",
      "Musk is \"basically trying to stymie OpenAI's growth trajectory,\" said University of Cambridge associate teaching professor Johnnie Penn in an interview with the BBC.",
      "Profit & non-profit",
      "Last week, Musk and a consortium of investors including Hollywood superagent Ari Emanuel tabled a $97.4bn (\u00a378.4bn) offer for all of OpenAI's assets.",
      "It was a huge sum - but less than the $157bn the firm was valued at in a funding round just four months ago, and much lower than the $300bn that some think it is worth now.",
      "Complicating all of this is OpenAI's unusual structure which involves a partnership between non-profit and for-profit arms.",
      "Mr Altman is understood to want to change that, stripping it of its non-profit board.",
      "That involves costs which Mr Musk is seemingly trying to inflate.",
      "\"What Musk is trying to do here is raise the perceived value of the non-profit arm of OpenAI, so that OpenAI has to pay more to get out of the obligations it has to its own non-profit,\" said Dr Penn.",
      "The value of its non-profit assets isn't clear. With his bid, Musk was floating a price, according to Cornell University senior lecturer Lutz Finger, who is also the founder and CEO of AI startup R2Decide.",
      "\"By Musk putting a price tag on the non-profit part, he makes the split way more expensive for Altman to do,\" Mr Finger told the BBC. \"It's very simple.\"",
      "What is AI and how does it work?",

      "\"Musk has missed the AI train, somewhat. He's behind, and he has made several attempts to catch up,\" Mr Finger said.",
      "Now, Mr Finger says, Mr Musk is trying to kneecap his most formidable competitor.",
      "An already-tense relationship appeared to worsen further last week with Mr Altman taunting Mr Musk's offer on X, and Mr Musk retorting by calling his onetime partner a \"swindler\".",
      "Mr Altman then hit back in an interview with Bloomberg, opining that Mr Musk is not \"a happy person\" and saying his decisions are made from a \"position of insecurity\".",

      "The UK's trading relationship with US had suggested it would be less exposed to tariffs than others, but the surprise inclusion of VAT to calculate potential tariffs has prompted questions over the impact on British businesses.",
      "Analysts have suggested tariffs of 20% or more could be placed on the UK as well as the European Union, but the outcome remains uncertain.",
      "The British Chambers of Commerce (BCC) business group warned that cars, pharmaceuticals, and food and drink were specific goods which could be \"significantly hit\" by the measures, which were announced by the White House on Thursday.",
      "The latest announcement by Trump administration was wide-ranging and threatened retaliation by the US for not just trade tariffs, but for other \"unfair or harmful acts, policies or practices\".",
      "One of the justifications Trump has given to date for imposing tariffs on countries is whether they have a trade surplus with the US - i.e. they sell more to the US than they import from the country.",

      "Both the UK and US claim to have trade surpluses with each other due to discrepancies in how the countries collect data. It remains uncertain whether Trump would exempt the UK from tariffs, but the introduction of Value Added Tax (VAT) into the equation complicates matters.",
      "The president's latest announcement cited VAT as an \"unfair, discriminatory or extraterritorial tax\".",
      "VAT tax is the tax people have to pay when people buy most goods or services, apart from food and children's clothes. The standard rate in the UK is 20% and it is levied regardless of whether a product has been imported from overseas or not.",
      "George Saravelos, global head of FX research at Deutsche Bank, said if the US imposed taxes based on existing tariffs and VAT combined, British businesses exporting to the US could face charges of 21%.",
      "\"If reciprocal tariffs are applied on a VAT basis, European countries would be much higher on the list of impacted countries,\" he said.",
      "William Bain, head of trade policy at the BCC, said the UK had a \"level of insulation\" due to it not exporting as many goods to the US in comparison to other countries.",
      "But he warned Trump's proposals would \"create more cost and uncertainty\" and \"upend established trade norms\".",
      "Fiona Conor, managing director of Trust Electric Heating, a Leeds-based radiator manufacturer which has plans to expand into the US, said if tariffs applied to her products, she would not want to pass on the costs through higher prices to customers.",

      "She said the government should \"be strong negotiators\", adding that Prime Minister Sir Keir Starmer needed to \"strengthen our partnership\" with the US.",
      "Paul Ashworth, chief UK economist for Capital Economics, said that most people would regard VAT as a non-discriminatory tax as it is applied to all goods whether they were produced domestically or imported.",
      "But he noted one of Trump's advisers had argued that given the US applied a much lower average sales tax at state level, VAT was a \"form of discriminatory tariff\".",
      "Mr Ashworth said it appeared the US president now favoured tariffs to be imposed on a \"country-by-country basis\" as opposed to his original idea of introducing universal tax on all imports to the US.",
      "'Difficult to predict'",
      "A tariff is a tax on imports collected by a government and it is paid by the company importing the good. Countries typically erect tariffs in a bid to protect certain sectors from foreign competition.",
      "But in protecting domestic businesses, prices for consumers can go up if a company importing goods from abroad passes higher costs on, rather than absorbing them or reducing imports.",
      "Caroline Ramsay, partner and head of international trade at law firm TLT, said it was \"difficult to predict\" what the latest announcement would mean for the UK.",
      "She suggested the word \"reciprocal\" did not mean what people might have first assumed, adding an assessment by the US would be made on what it considers to be fair.",
      "\"It does not mean that the USA is going to check what the UK tariff is on paper imports and match that tariff percentage for paper exports to the US from the UK,\" she added.",

      "\"It's really very interesting work and quite impressive,\" says Friedemann Reinhard at the University of Rostock in Germany, who was not involved in the work. In 2017, Prof Reinhard and colleagues described how Wi-Fi signals could allow spies to see into private rooms.",
      "One slight limitation is that the spinning array cannot, by definition, see in all directions at once. Prof Reinhard says that a lot of data processing carried out by the system appears necessary to clean up the image that results from this spinning device.",
      "However, the robot sends out radio waves in the millimetre wave band (waves that are between one and ten millimetres long). This is the same technology used for some 5G installations.",
      "\"That's potentially very attractive, it's a very well understood, cheap technology,\" says Prof Reinhard. \"I certainly would love to see a self-driving car driving only on radar.\"",
      "But it is possible to avoid using spinning radio-emitting devices to get a full picture, says Fabio da Silva, founder and chief executive of US firm Wavsens, which is also developing radio-based sensing technology.",
      "\"We created an algorithm that allows you to sense the entire space instantaneously and continuously so we don't have to spin our antennas,\" he says.",
      "He describes the system as akin to echolocation, used by bats. It sends out radio waves and \"listens\" to how the waves come back, which reveals the shape of whatever they have hit.",
      "Some researchers have used radio waves to detect concealed weapons such as hidden handguns and knives.",
      "Radio waves can even \"fingerprint\" the details of a room. Then, if scanned again later, this would reveal whether any objects in the room have been moved.",
      "Last year, scientists in Germany proposed that countries use this method to scrutinise other countries' management of their nuclear weapons stockpiles. It would be one way of knowing whether someone had been moving the warheads around, for example.",
      "Separately, Luana Olivieri at Loughborough University has explored using a different form of non-visible electromagnetic radiation, terahertz waves. These are shorter than radio waves but longer than visible light waves. \"This wavelength is particularly unexplored,\" says Dr Olivieri.",
      "It is possible to see through objects and analyse materials using this form of radiation, she adds. Such a system could even, in theory, identify specific drugs by detecting their chemical structure.",
      "But while seeing through materials could help a rescue bot find a trapped person in some future disaster, it also has other applications. Police forces and militaries have access to radio-based technology that allows them to see through doors and walls, to some extent.",
      "\"Warfighting is definitely one market that it caters to. It can be used to find and kill someone,\" says Mr da Silva. He has exhibited Wavsens' technology to the US Department of Defense and the Israeli Ministry of Defense, he says.",
      "And yet these applications are not entirely surprising, suggests Prof Reinhard, who points out that a range of emerging technologies have, in principle, made it easier to detect and attack people.",
      "\"Maybe radar sounds scary \u2013 but drones and cheap cameras are the much more dangerous thing,\" he says."

    "published": "Fri, 14 Feb 2025 22:54:48 GMT",
    "summary": "Trump wants US vehicles to be more popular in Europe, but it's a difficult market for them to crack.",
    "story": [
      "Donald Trump is threatening to introduce big tariffs on EU car imports, unhappy that Europeans don't buy more American vehicles. But why are US cars, with the notable exception of Tesla, not more popular in Europe?",
      "Italy's ancient towns and cities, with their narrow, cobbled streets, offer an obvious explanation why, in the words of US President Donald Trump, Europeans \"don't take our cars\".",
      "Or as car industry analyst Hampus Engellau puts it: \"Try to go around Italy in a big SUV. I've done it, and it's very difficult\".",
      "Add cost to the question, and it becomes obvious why you don't see too many American pick-up trucks on European roads, observes Mike Hawes, CEO of The Society of Motor Manufacturers & Traders, which represents the industry in the UK.",
      "\"We tend to have higher fuel prices than the Americans, so we prefer smaller, more fuel-efficient vehicles, while they generally prefer larger vehicles.\"",
      "Mr Engellau, who works for Swedish investment bank Handelsbanken Capital Markets, also highlights petrol prices being substantially cheaper in the US. \"They pay per gallon what we pay per litre,\" he says. There are 3.8 litres to one US gallon.",
      "Yet these differences have done little to deter European carmakers from gaining market share in the US. Again, in the words of Mr Trump, the US has \"millions of cars coming in - BMW, Mercedes, Volkswagen and many others\".",
      "In 2022, 692,334 new EU-made cars were exported to the US, worth \u20ac36bn ($37bn; \u00a330bn). While only 116,207 new US-made cars went in the opposite direction, for \u20ac5.2bn.",
      "This imbalance is caused by unfair trading rules and needs correcting, according to Mr Trump.",
      "\"Mr Trump is concerned because the terms of trade are not really equal,\" explains Mr Engellau, pointing out that the EU's 10% tariffs on cars imported from the US far exceeds the 2.5% tariffs the US \u2013 currently - charges on cars imported from the EU.",
      "These disparities have prompted Trump to say he wants to raise US tariffs on European automotive imports. He has already announced 25% import tariffs on steel and aluminium imports, two metals crucial for carmakers.",
      "Trump's move appears to have prompted EU officials to consider reducing their own tariffs in order to protect Europe's automotive industry from a potential trade war.",
      "Trump's intervention has not impressed Jim Farley, the boss of US carmaker Ford. \"So far what we've been seeing is a lot of cost and a lot of chaos,\" NBC News recently reported him as saying.",
      "In fact, the very focus on trade is perhaps misplaced, according to automotive industry veteran Andy Palmer, formerly the chief operating officer of Nissan and CEO of Aston Martin, and currently a consultant. \"If you can help it, you don't want to ship cars around the world. They're big boxes of expensive air,\" he says.",
      "The automotive industry is global, adds the SMMT's Mr Hawes, so carmakers generally want to \"manufacture close to where the customer is based\".",
      "As such, several European carmakers, most notably marques such as BMW, Mercedes and Audi, are making some of their largest cars in North America, and some of these vehicles are exported back to Europe.",
      "US carmakers have historically pursued similar strategies in Europe. General Motors owned and manufactured European marques such as Opel/Vauxhall and Saab, but it sold the former in 2017, and shut the latter back in 2009.",
      "Meanwhile, Ford offloaded Aston Martin in 2007, Jaguar and Land Rover in 2008, and Volvo in 2010.",
      "After years of losing money, Ford is currently redirecting its European business towards electric and commercial vehicles and away from small, affordable cars, such as its Focus models.",
      "Ford plans to cut 800 jobs in the UK and 2,900 jobs in Germany by 2027, which represents a 14% reduction in its 28,000-strong European workforce.",
      "Elon Musk's Tesla has a factory near Berlin in Germany, where it makes its Model Y cars for the European market, but even here there are headwinds as low-cost Chinese imports in particular see their share of Europe's market for electric cars grow.",
      "Europe is a very tough marketplace for carmakers, according to Jose Asumendi, head of European automotive research at JP Morgan, an investment bank. \"You need to have the right products, and you need to run the manufacturing plants well.\"",
      "He also points to brands having a competitive advantage in their home countries, be it BMW, Mercedes, Volkswagen and Audi in Germany, Peugeot, Citroen and Renault in France, or Fiat and Alfa Romeo in Italy.",
      "\"There's a natural inclination for people to buy local champions, especially in Germany, France and Italy,\" explains Mr Asumendi.",
      "He adds that while other European countries are more open to different brands, the market is crowded, with a slew of Japanese, South Korea, and, increasingly, Chinese cars.",
      "Adding to Europe's complexities for overseas carmakers are different taxation regulations, and the need to communicate in many different languages.",
      "Mr Palmer does not think \"European customers have any particular objections to American cars\", and Mr Asumendi agrees. \"I think Europeans do like American brands, but there are many other brands available in Europe, so competition is fierce,\" he says.",
      "Mr Trump's ambition is to make the US car industry stronger, by bringing more production and innovation home. But Mr Palmer insists that a car trade war with Europe will not deliver this.",
      "Not least, he says, since tariffs tend to \"insulate the beneficiaries from the free market, and this merely makes them lazy, so they stop innovating and fail to remain competitive\".",
      "\"It's not about trade,\" adds Mr Palmer. \"It's about investment and collaboration.\"",

      "One day in 1989, Gonzalo Rojas was at school in the Colombian capital of Bogota when a teacher pulled him out of class to deliver some devastating news.",
      "His father, also called Gonzalo, had died in a plane crash that morning.",

      "The blast wasn't an accident. It was a deliberate bomb attack by Pablo Escobar and his Medell\u00edn cartel.",
      "While an era defined by drug wars, bombings, kidnappings and a sky high murder rate has largely been relegated to Colombia's past, Escobar's legacy has not.",
      "The notorious criminal, who was killed by security forces in 1993, has achieved a near cult-like status around the world, immortalised in books, music and TV productions like the Netflix series Narcos.",
      "In Colombia itself, his name and face are adorned on mugs, keychains, and t-shirts in tourist shops catering mainly to curious visitors.",
      "But a proposed law in Colombia's Congress is seeking to change this.",
      "The bill wants to ban Escobar merchandise - and that of other convicted criminals  - to help put an end to the glorification of a drug boss who was central in the global cocaine trade and widely held responsible for at least 4,000 killings.",
      "\"Difficult issues that are part of the history and memory of our country cannot simply be remembered by a T-shirt, or a sticker sold on a street corner,\" says Juan Sebasti\u00e1n G\u00f3mez, Congress member and co-author of the bill.",
      "The proposed law would prohibit the selling, as well as the use and carrying of clothing and items promoting criminals, including Escobar. It would mean fines for  those who violated the rules, and a temporary suspension of businesses.",
      "Many vendors selling the goods claim a law prohibiting this merchandise would harm their livelihoods.",
      "\"This is terrible. We have a right to work, and these Pablo T-shirts especially always sell well,\" says Joana Montoya, who owns a stall stocked full of Escobar merchandise in Comuna 13, a popular tourist zone of Medell\u00edn.",
      "Medell\u00edn, Escobar's hometown, was known as \"the most dangerous city in the world\" in the late 80s and early 90s due to violence associated with drug wars and Colombia's armed conflict.",
      "Today it's been revitalised into a hub of innovation and tourism, with vendors eager to cash in on the influx of visitors wanting to take home souvenirs - some related to Escobar.",
      "\"This Escobar merchandise benefits many families here - it sustains us. It helps us pay our rent, buy food, look after our kids,\" says Ms Montaya, who supports herself and her young daughter.",
      "Ms Montoya says at least 15% of her sales come from Escobar products, but some sellers tell the BBC that for them it's as much as 60%.",
      "If the bill is approved there would be a defined time period for sellers to familiarise themselves with the new rules and phase out their Escobar stock.",
      "\"We'd need a transition phase so that people could stop selling these products and replace them with other ones,\" explains Congressman G\u00f3mez. He says that Colombia has more interesting things to show than drug lords, and that the association with Escobar has stigmatised the country abroad.",
      "Some of the T-shirts, sold for around \u00a35, bear a catchphrase linked to Escobar - \"silver or lead?\".  This symbolises the choice the cartel boss gave to those who posed a threat to his criminal operations: accept a bribe or be killed.",
      "Shop assistant Mar\u00eda Suarez believes that the profit gained from sales of Escobar merchandise isn't ethical.",
      "\"We need this ban. He did awful things and these souvenirs are things that shouldn't exist,\" she says, explaining that she feels uncomfortable that her boss stocks Escobar items.",
      "Escobar and his Medell\u00edn cartel at one point were believed to have controlled 80% of the cocaine entering the US. In 1987, he was named as one of the richest people in the world by Forbes magazine.",
      "He spent some of his fortune developing deprived neighbourhoods, but many people consider this as a tactic to buy loyalty from some segments of the population.",
      "Years on from his father's death, Mr Rojas remembers him as a calm and responsible man, who loved his family. For him, the bill is a defining moment.",
      "\"It's a milestone in the road about how we reflect on what is happening in terms of the commercialisation of images of Pablo Escobar in order to correct it,\" says Mr Rojas.",
      "Yet he does have criticisms about the proposals. He believes the bill doesn't focus enough on education.",
      "Mr Rojas recalls a day many years ago when he met a man wearing a green T-shirt with a silhouette of  Escobar, and the words \"Pablo, President\".",
      "\"It caused me such confusion that I wasn't able to say anything to him about it,\" he says.",
      "\"There needs to be more of an emphasis on how we deliver different messages to new generations, so that there isn't a positive image of what a cartel boss is.\"",
      "Mr Rojas has actively been involved in efforts to reshape narratives around Escobar and the drug trade. Along with some other victims, he launched narcostore.co in 2019, an online shop that appears to sell Escobar-themed items.",
      "But none of the products actually exist and when customers select an item they are shown a video testimony from a victim. Mr Rojas says the site has attracted 180 million visits from around the world.",
      "In Colombia's Congress, the bill faces four stages it needs to pass before it can become law. G\u00f3mez says he's hoping it sparks reflection both inside and outside of Congress.",
      "\"In Germany you don't sell Hitler T-shirts or swastikas. In Italy you don't sell Mussolini stickers, and you don't go to Chile and get a copy of Pinochet's ID card.",
      "\"I think the most important thing the bill can do is to generate a conversation as a country - a conversation that hasn't happened yet.\"",
      "Medell\u00edn's mayor  - who was also a presidential candidate in the 2022 elections - has publicly backed the bill, calling the merchandise \"an insult to the city, the country and the victims\".",
      "In El Poblado, an upmarket area of Medell\u00edn popular with tourists, three Americans browse a stall brimming with souvenirs. One buys a cap with Escobar's name and face printed on the front. He says he wants a memento of \"history\".",
      "But for supporters of the bill, this isn't about removing Escobar from history, it's about erasing a mythical construct of him, fostering new ways to honour the victims he killed - and acknowledging the lingering pain of victims left behind."

    "published": "Wed, 12 Feb 2025 00:33:37 GMT",
    "summary": "With the economy a key factor in German elections this month, can the auto sector get back on the road to recovery?",
    "story": [
      "Listen to Theo read this story",
      "Listen to Theo read this story",
      "For decades, car-making has been the jewel in Germany's industrial crown, a powerful symbol of the country's famous post-war economic miracle. Its \"Big Three\" brands, Volkswagen, Mercedes-Benz, and BMW, have long been praised for their performance, innovation and precision engineering. But today, the German motor industry is struggling. With the faltering economy a key factor in federal elections this month, how can it get back on the road to recovery?",
      "When you arrive by train in Wolfsburg, Lower Saxony, the first thing you see is the Volkswagen factory. Its huge facade, emblazoned with a giant VW logo and flanked by four tall chimneys, dominates one bank of the canal that runs through the city. The 6.5 sq km (2.5 sq mile) complex sits adjacent to the Autostadt, a kind of theme park devoted to the automobile and to VW, Europe's biggest carmaker. The Volkswagen Arena, a sports stadium, is a short distance away.",
      "Wolfsburg is Germany's answer to mid-20th Century Detroit - not so much a city with a car factory as a factory with a city that has grown up around it. Some 60,000 people from across the region work in the plant, while the town itself has a population of around 125,000. Locals say that even if you don't work in the factory yourself, it's certain many of your friends will, along with half of your class from school.",
      "\"Wolfsburg and Volkswagen - it's kind of a synonym,\" explains Dieter Landenberger, the VW Group's in-house historian, as he looks lovingly at an early model Beetle. It is one of an array of beautifully restored classic cars in the Zeithaus \u2013 a huge, glass-fronted museum in the Autostadt dedicated to icons of the motor industry.",
      "\"We're proud of the plant,\" he says. \"It is a symbol of that period in the 1950s when Germany had to reinvent itself and rebuild after the war. It was a kind of motor for the German economic miracle.\"",
      "Today, however, the plant has also come to symbolise some of the main problems affecting the German car industry as a whole. The Wolfsburg factory is capable of building 870,000 cars a year. But by 2023 it was making just 490,000, according to the Cologne-based German Economic Institute. And in Germany it is far from alone. Car factories across the country have been operating well below their maximum capacity. The number of cars produced in Germany declined from 5.65m in 2017 to 4.1m in 2023, according to the International Organisation of Motor Vehicle Manufacturers.",
      "All of this matters deeply as the German public prepares to go to the polls on 23 February. The car industry is not just a source of national pride; it is also a significant driver of national wealth. Disagreements over how to resolve the country's economic malaise were a factor in the collapse of the coalition government in November. Whoever is in power after the election will inevitably need a plan to revive the economy \u2013 and getting the motor industry back in gear is likely to play an important role.",
      "Car-making makes up about a fifth of the country's manufacturing output, and if the supply chain is taken into account, it generates around 6% of GDP, according to Capital Economics. The industry employs some 780,000 people directly \u2013 and supports millions of other jobs.",
      "It's not just production that is down. Sales of cars made by German brands are far lower than they were just a few years ago. Between 2017 and 2023, those of VW fell  from 10.7m to 9.2m, while over the same period BMW's went from 2.46m to 2.25m and Mercedes-Benz's went from 2.3m to 2.04m, company reports show.",
      "All of the Big Three saw their pre-tax profits fall by about a third in the first nine months of 2024, and each warned that their earnings for the year as a whole would be lower than previously forecast.",
      "The development of electric cars has sucked up huge investment, but the market for them hasn't grown as quickly as expected, while foreign competitors are flexing their muscles. The threat of tariffs being imposed by the US and other governments also looms large.",
      "\"There are so many crises, a whole world of crises. When one crisis is over, another is coming up,\" is how Simon Sh\u00fctz, a spokesman for the German Automotive Industry Federation (VDA) puts it.",
      "Car sales across Europe have been declining since 2017, according to Franziska Palmas, a senior Europe economist at Capital Economics. \"Lately they've recovered a bit, but they're still around 15 to 20% lower than they were at the peak in 2017,\" she says. \"That's partly due to factors like the pandemic, the energy crisis. But it's also cars lasting longer  - and people already have a lot of cars in Europe. So demand has been weak.\"",
      "Electric dreams",
      "Another key factor has been the aforementioned transition to electric cars. Since the diesel emissions scandal of 2015 \u2013 in which VW was found to have rigged emissions tests in the US \u2013 the industry has been undergoing a technological revolution.",
      "With the EU and European governments determined to phase out petrol and diesel cars over the next decade, manufacturers have had little choice but to invest tens, and collectively hundreds of billions of Euros on developing electric models and building new production lines.",
      "However, although electric cars do now make up a significant share of all cars sold \u2013 13.6% in the EU and 19.6% in the UK last year, for example \u2013 their market share has not been growing as quickly as anticipated.",
      "And in Germany itself, the sudden removal of generous subsidies for electric car buyers in late 2023 actually contributed to a dramatic 27% fall in sales of all electric cars within the country last year, making life still more difficult for German firms in their home market.",
      "\"The decision to drop subsidies suddenly \u2013 that was very bad, because it undermined trust among our customers,\" says the VDA's Simon Sch\u00fctz.",
      "\"Going from the combustion engine to electric mobility is very big process. We are investing billions in rebuilding all the factories. And so that takes some time, there's no question about it.\"",
      "An expensive business",
      "While all of this has been going on, German manufacturers have also been grappling with another serious concern. Doing business in Germany itself, operating factories here and employing hundreds of thousands of people, is very expensive.",
      "Workers in the automotive sector have traditionally enjoyed generous pay and benefits thanks to agreements drawn up between unions and management. According to Capital Economics, in 2023 the average monthly base salary in the German auto industry was about \u20ac5,300, compared with \u20ac4,300 across the German economy as a whole.",
      "For years, this approach gave German-based companies certain advantages, for example in avoiding industrial unrest and in attracting and retaining talented staff. However, it also led to German car manufacturers having the highest labour costs in the global industry. In 2023, these averaged \u20ac62 per hour, compared to \u20ac29 in Spain and \u20ac20 in Portugal, according to the VDA.",
      "The situation for Germany's domestic car industry became more acute following Russia's invasion of Ukraine. This choked off Germany's once-abundant supplies of cheap Russian gas, at the very time when the country was phasing out nuclear power.",
      "The result was a sharp increase in energy prices. Although they have since subsided, energy costs for industrial users in Germany remain very high by international standards. \"Energy prices here are three to five times higher than in the US, or in China \u2013 much higher than for our main competitors,\" says Mr Sch\u00fctz.",
      "And this is being felt across the industry, not just at the carmakers themselves. \"From the Thysenkrupp and Salzgitter steel mills producing the sheet metal rolls that are later turned into doors and bonnets, to makers of smaller components used in drivetrains, costs have exploded as a result of high energy prices,\" says Matthias Schmidt of Schmidt Automotive Research.",
      "'A very big shock'",
      "Last year these pressures came to a head. At VW, which has 45% of its global staff in Germany, managers finally decided radical action was needed to bring down costs.",
      "\"It was a very big shock,\" IG Metall union spokesman Steffen Schmidt tells me over a cup of coffee near the VW factory in Wolfsburg. \"The company didn't say anything publicly.\"",
      "It was left to Daniela Cavallo, head of the powerful VW works council and the top employees' representative, to deliver the news. \"They held a big meeting outside the gates of the factory. Thousands of workers \u2013 and you could have heard a pin drop,\" says Mr Schmidt.",
      "\"They were stunned. Thousands of people, all completely silent.\"",
      "What VW proposed was unprecedented. Union representatives had come to meetings expecting to negotiate an annual pay rise. They were asking for a 7% boost. Instead, they were told, the company needed them to take a 10% pay cut.",
      "Worse was to follow. The company said it might have to close up to three of its factories within Germany itself \u2013 and was tearing up a job security agreement that had been in place for decades.",
      "Arne Meiswinkel, VW's chief negotiator, said at the time that the situation it faced in Germany was \"very serious\" and that \"Volkswagen will only be able to prevail if we future-proof the company now in the face of rising costs and the massive increase in competition\".",
      "Volkswagen had never previously closed a German factory in its 87-year history. In the face of intense opposition from unions and politicians, and following short but disruptive \"warning strikes\" by unionised workers, the idea was ultimately shelved. But the very fact it had been put forward sent a seismic shock through the entire sector.",
      "In the meantime, the workforce did agree to painful limits on pay and bonuses, and VW said it would cut more than 35,000 jobs by the end of the decade, albeit in a \"socially responsible manner\" that avoided compulsory redundancies.",
      "Less conspicuously, Mercedes-Benz also launched a cost-cutting drive last year, aimed at saving several billion euros annually - albeit compulsory redundancies in the German workforce are highly unlikely, as a job security agreement effectively rules them out until 2030. Meanwhile Ford, which operates two factories in Germany, recently announced plans to cut 2,800 jobs in the country.",
      "Not all of the German car industry's problems are confined to Germany itself. With the European market saturated, for several decades the continent's manufacturers have looked for growth elsewhere.",
      "The impact of China",
      "One of the most lucrative markets has been China, where for a while the growing middle class had an apparently insatiable appetite for upmarket European vehicles. VW, Mercedes-Benz and BMW all teamed up with local businesses, setting up factories in China itself to meet local demand.",
      "But now that source of growth is drying up. The Big Three have all seen sales fall recently  \u2013 in 2023 VW's China sales were down 9.5% on the previous year, Mercedes-Benz's by 7% and BMW's by 13.4%. Their combined share of the Chinese market has shrunk as well to 18.7%, from a peak of 26.2% in 2019. This appears to be the result of a slowing Chinese economy, falling interest in expensive, foreign-badged cars and the rapid growth of local marques, especially in the electric car market.",
      "\"Not that long ago, Western brands represented quality and trust,\" explains Mark Rainford, founder of the Inside China Auto website. However, he says, since then the reputation and appeal of Chinese brands has improved beyond recognition.",
      "All of the Big Three say trends in China have had a significant impact on their earnings.",
      "Chinese brands are also attempting to build a share of the European market, helped by their much lower operating costs than more established rivals, both because wages are lower in China and because, as pure EV firms, they don't have the same legacy costs carried by manufacturers making the transition from petrol and diesel to battery-powered cars.",
      "According to the European Commission, Chinese brands also benefit from hefty government subsidies, which allow them to sell cars at artificially low prices. In October, the EU introduced extra tariffs on imports of Chinese-made EVs, in an effort to create a more level playing field.",
      "Trade wars?",
      "German firms opposed the EU tariffs, because they feared retaliation from China could affect their own exports. Now they also face the threat of new protectionist measures being introduced by the Trump administration, including possible tariffs on cars shipped from the EU.

      "Dubbed by one newspaper as the \"head from hell\", the latest controversy has focused on his decision to introduce detentions on Saturdays.",
      "But as the recently appointed head of 1,300-pupil Caldicot School in Monmouthshire, which has been plagued by issues in recent years including teachers striking over violence in classrooms, Mr Ebenezer said he was unapologetic about a focus on \"strict discipline and firm boundaries\".",

      "\"[We] have a zero-tolerance towards defiance,\" said Mr Ebenezer who, within days of taking the reins at the comprehensive school in June 2024, hit the headlines with reports of children being sent home as part of a school uniform clampdown.",
      "\"So people saying 'no, not doing it' or walking away [swearing] - zero tolerance,\" he added.",
      "Mr Ebenezer told BBC News that two or three families had taken their children out of the school as they felt that his policies were too strict.",

      "\"I can say to you that we've never had to ask the same parent in twice - it's effective,\" said Mr Ebenezer.",

      "\"We operate a same-day detention policy, which we think works,\" he said.",
      "\"Apparently in Wales it's illegal, because we have to give parents 24 hours' notice so that they know where their children are.\"",
      "Schools are entitled to hold Saturday detentions, except on weekends immediately before and after half-term holidays.",
      "But legislation requires parents to be given at least 24 hours' notice in writing of any detention that will take place outside school sessions if the pupil is at a school in Wales, a requirement which was repealed in England in 2011.",
      "\"The reason we've done [same-day detentions] is because if I'm badly behaved today, I want to be sorted out today,\" said Mr Ebenezer.",
      "Mr Ebenezer was asked to take over at the school after a difficult period which saw teachers striking over \"violent and abusive behaviour\" by pupils.",
      "\"My firm belief is what all young people need is strict discipline and firm boundaries,\" said Mr Ebenezer.",

      "A recent report by education inspectors Estyn found behaviour at the school had improved but said it was still in need of \"significant improvement\".",
      "It said there was work to do on attendance, safeguarding and developing pupils' skills.",
      "One of the senior team, Hayley Moseley, is in her 15th year at Caldicot School and said she had seen \"lots of changes, lots of different styles of management\".",
      "She said there had been difficulties, but felt the culture in the school was starting to change and that pupils seemed \"happier\".",
      "Pupil Lilly-Belle, 12, was told off in her first week at the school because she was wearing her sister's old skirts which were not the right length.",
      "She said the approach could be \"a bit strict sometimes\" but added: \"It's better to be strict than not strict at all.\"",
      "Caden, 12, said he had been pulled up for an untucked shirt but said he was comfortable with the rules: \"I'm quite happy with them and they're good.\"",
      "Parent Katherine, who has two sons at the school, said the change in approach was initially a shock.",
      "\"It was a bit military - some people called it draconian,\" she said.",
      "\"But sometimes you need that shock to kind of get everybody singing from the same hymn sheet.\"",
      "Mr Ebenezer said he wanted to make Caldicot School one of the top 20 in Wales.",
      "\"It's about doing the right thing,\" he said.",
      "He said his focus was on \"high standards of uniform and appearance, punctuality, attendance, behaviour, attitude\" and said prevailing approaches to behaviour were misguided.",
      "\"It's definitely too soft. I think people confuse strict with nasty,\" he said.",
      "\"Strict is no nonsense - you do this, this happens. No means no, it's not nasty.",

      "It also said the chief statistician for Scotland - Alastair McAlpine - would reply to Mr Humpherson's letter shortly.",

      "The multiple choice answers include \"oral sex\" and \"vaginal or anal sex\".",
      "At the time of the survey, campaigners warned that it must protect children's right to privacy and give informed consent.",

    "published": "Fri, 14 Feb 2025 12:10:40 GMT",
    "summary": "Pupil numbers are set to fall by 90,000 by 2040, but ministers want to maintain school staffing.",
    "story": [
      "Long-term plans need to be drawn up for Scotland's schools to reflect falling pupil numbers, a think tank has said.",
      "The Institute for Fiscal Studies (IFS) said there could be 90,000 fewer pupils in the country's classrooms by 2040 - and suggested that teacher numbers could be cut as a result.",
      "The group said this could eventually free up \u00a3500m per year, but the government has flatly rejected the idea.",
      "Teaching unions have hit out too, with the EIS saying cutting teacher numbers \"lacks any educational rationale\" and the NASUWT calling it a \"false economy\" that would damage life chances and Scotland's future prosperity.",
      "But when you consider the falling birth rate and demographic changes alongside the need to get the maximum benefit out of every pound spent on services, is it time to talk about teacher numbers?",
      "School staffing is a frequent topic of dispute between politicians - usually in terms of demands for more of them, not fewer.",
      "The SNP pledged in its 2021 manifesto to increase teacher numbers by 3,500.",
      "So when it was revealed in December that the figure had actually fallen, opposition leaders were quick to give the first minister a hard time about it.",
      "John Swinney pledged to get teacher numbers back to 2023 levels, and keeping them there is the government's new goal.",
      "But pupil numbers are already starting to plateau, and are projected to drop sharply over the coming decades.",
      "That's why the Institute for Fiscal Studies argues that perhaps it would be OK to allow teacher numbers to go down in line with that, rather than holding them at 2023 levels.",
      "The government has flatly rejected the report's conclusions.",
      "But much of the picture it paints is actually pretty positive.",
      "The IFS underlines that class sizes in Scotland are smaller than those elsewhere in the UK - averaging about 13 pupils per teacher, compared with 17 to 19 pupils per teacher down south.",
      "Spending per pupil is also rising, and is the highest in the UK - 20% higher than it is in England.",
      "But on both counts that can be explained in part by the number of pupils rising far more sharply south of the border. Scotland is set to have the opposite problem.",
      "The stickiest issue for the government is that these smaller class sizes and higher spending hasn't necessarily led to notably better outcomes.",
      "Scotland's struggle in international comparisons of school performance has been well documented. There has been a long-term decline in reading, maths and science, and Covid has hardly helped.",
      "The gap in attainment between pupils from more and less affluent backgrounds also remains stubbornly unclosed, almost a decade on from it being made the government's \"number one priority\".",
      "The IFS argument is that continuing to plough money into school staffing against a backdrop of falling school rolls isn't the most cost-effective way to improve things.",
      "Pupil numbers are projected to fall by 90,000 by 2040. If teacher numbers hold steady at 2023 levels, then the pupil-teacher ratio will fall closer to 12 - the lowest ever.",
      "But IFS research economist Darcey Snape says smaller class sizes \"only tend to have modest effects on pupil attainment\".",
      "Her analysis suggests that letting teacher numbers fall could free up funds - up to \u00a3500m per year by 2040 - either for other areas of schooling, or indeed for other badly-stretched budgets such as social care.",
      "Ms Snape accepts there would inevitably be \"practical difficulties\", like amalgamating classes and schools as rolls fall - but says local councils are arguably best placed to make these decisions, \"rather than applying a one-size-fits-all approach across Scotland\".",
      "The latter point is already the subject of some dispute between schools and councils.",
      "Ultimately councils are the employers, and control the overall numbers - the government can only enforce its policy by holding carrots and sticks over them.",
      "Education Secretary Jenny Gilruth has clashed with council leaders by threatening to withdraw funding which was offered on the basis of keeping numbers at 2023 levels.",
      "A deal has just been struck with Glasgow City Council, which was planning on cutting 450 posts over a three-year period - which in turn had led to strike threats from unions.",
      "Groups representing teachers are predictably negative about the IFS's report, calling it a \"false economy\" and a \"race to the bottom\".",
      "The EIS and NASUWT say things aren't as straightforward in schools as the report might make out.",
      "Both make the point that the number of pupils with additional support needs has risen to record levels. They need more support, not less, and cutting teacher numbers would \"further entrench existing inequalities\" in their prospects.",
      "They also point to the fact teachers already have \"excessive workloads and working hours\", and face issues with anti-social behaviour and even violence in classrooms.",
      "It is absolutely fair to argue that long-term planning needs to be done, to take account of shifting demographics.",
      "The ever-increasing strain on care services provides a prime example of why we need to be ready for the ways in which society will change.",
      "Perhaps we do need to have a grown-up debate about the best and most cost-effective way to improve outcomes in schools.",
      "But when the headline is getting rid of teachers, it's always going to be difficult to sell the idea to politicians who face an election in just over a year.",
      "The Scottish government has already flatly rejected the idea, saying teachers play a central role in driving improvements in schools.",
      "And as noted above, opposition parties are chiefly interested in holding ministers to account on their promised increases. Nobody is going to put cutting teacher numbers on a leaflet.",
      "And it's particularly tough to get MSPs to stick their necks out when we're talking about something which will be an issue in 2040, which feels pretty distant.",
      "But a year is famously a long time in politics, and 15 of them is an eternity. Look back 15 years and Gordon Brown was prime minister and the SNP were being propped up by the Conservatives at Holyrood.",
      "If one thing is guaranteed, it's change; it's incredibly unlikely that we will reach 2040 with the current policy structure intact.",
      "Unless something also shifts in terms of Scotland's birth rate and the pace of demographic change, decisions are going to be needed sooner or later."

      "Speaking to BBC Breakfast on Tuesday, he said the work so far on the movie looks \"fantastic\" and will prove to be \"a very fitting way to end this part of the Peaky story.\"",
      "When quizzed on what he meant by \"this part\" by presenters Jon Kay and Sarah Campbell, Knight added: \"It's not over, let's just put it like that. I'm not allowed to announce it... but I'm just saying that the world of Peaky will continue.\"",
      "The writer and producer was appearing on the show to promote his new Disney+ period drama, A Thousand Blows, starring Stephen Graham.",
      "'Best British actors'",
      "There have been six series of the Bafta-winning hit BBC TV show Peaky Blinders, from 2013-2022, with the upcoming Netflix film continuing the story of Tommy Shelby and his Birmingham crime gang.",
      "It will see Oscar-winner Cillian Murphy reprise his lead role alongside an ensemble cast including Graham, Sophie Rundle, Ned Dennehy, Packy Lee and Ian Peck; as well as Rebecca Ferguson, Tim Roth, Jay Lycurgo, and Barry Keoghan.",

      "\"The stuff that I'm watching, the rushes... no-one will be disappointed.",
      "\"It is quite an incredible thing.\"",
      "Speaking on Radio 4's Today programme, Knight also described himself as a \"BBC loyalist\", despite the fact his new period drama A Thousand Blows is launching on Disney+.",
      "In his latest creation, Graham stars as notorious boxer Sugar Goodson making his way in the dangerous world of illegal boxing in 1880s Victorian London.",

      "His new drama, based on the blurring of several true stories, finds Knight - with the help of executive producer, broadcaster and historian David Olusoga - imagining \"what would have happened\" if Hezekiah Moscow and Mary Carr had actually met.",
      "\"I find that the best stories are the ones least told for some reason,\" he added.",
      "Knight added he was trying to address the issue of class within the series, as that was more prominent at the time than the issues of gender and race.",
      "\"People in the East End [of all genders and races], if you're cold, you're cold; if you're hungry, you're hungry,\" he noted.",
      "\"The real struggle, I suppose, in A Thousands Blows, is about east versus west\", he added.",
      "In a five-star review, the Telegraph's Benji Wilson said Knight's \"brutal new drama may be his best yet.\"",
      "\"The Disney+ 19th-century bare-knuckle boxing series is blockbusting television in every conceivable sense.\"",
      "The Standard's Adam Bloodworth awarded it four stars, writing that the show's ingredients made for a \"fantastically entertaining stew \u2013 as well as a chaotic and gruesome one, where limbs get hacked off in the ring and bones crunch like so many cornflakes.",
      "\"Tinge Krishnan and Nick Murphy's directorial vision is a dingy but Disney-fied labyrinth of intimidating backstreets and ropey pubs, while script writer and creator Steven Knight's script is confident but often sparse; a look speaks a thousand words, but when men like Goodson talk, you listen.\"",
      "Empire's Nicola Austin also gave it four stars, calling Graham's \"metamorphosis\" into Goodson \"incredible\".",
      "\"Though not always a total knockout, A Thousand Blows certainly packs a punch \u2013 courtesy of excellent lead performances, a gripping plot, and a fascinating historical setting,\" she wrote.",
      "And in another four star review, Morgan Cormack of the Radio Times said: \"Peaky Blinders comparisons will come, but this boxing drama is its own beast.\"",

      "\"All the things you're told not to do, when those films are proven to be commercially viable, and people want original, daring movies, it makes me feel more optimistic than usual.'\"",

      "Conclave, made by German director Edward Berger, picked up four awards in total including best film and best British film; the first time a movie has won both in the same year since the 2019 war drama, 1917. It also won best adapted screenplay and best editing.",
      "US filmmaker Brady Corbet's The Brutalist also won four - Corbet picked up best director while Adrien Brody won best actor for his portrayal of Hungarian architect and Holocaust survivor,  L\u00e1szl\u00f3 T\u00f3th. The film also won best original score and cinematography.",

      "Anora, about a New York stripper who has a whirlwind romance with the son of a Russian oligarch, had been picking up best picture momentum ahead of the Oscars next month - but instead came away with best actress and best casting.",
      "The best actress win for Madison was something of a surprise, despite her impressive performance in Sean Baker's film. Madison herself, on accepting the prize, said: \"Wow, I really wasn't expecting this. I probably should have listened to my publicist  and written a speech or something!\"",
      "The 25-year-old starred in US comedy series Better Things and also had roles in Quentin Tarantino's Once Upon a Time in Hollywood and horror film Scream. But her leading role in Anora has catapulted her into the spotlight.",
      "Madison added: \"I want to take a moment to recognise the sex worker community. I see you, you deserve respect and human decency. I will always be an ally and a friend.\"",

      "Many thought she would win the Bafta, too. She will still be a favourite at the Oscars although Madison's Bafta win does make things more interesting.",
      "The Substance only picked up one win on Sunday for make-up and hair. The film sees a TV aerobics presenter in her 50s (Moore) who takes a black-market drug to create a younger, more beautiful version of herself. Full of gory effects, the film is the favourite to pick up the same prize at next month's Oscars.",

      "In what has been an unpredictable awards season, the Baftas followed a similar pattern, with no single film sweeping the board, and several movies sharing the spoils.",
      "This was the third year in a row that no British stars won any of the four acting prizes at the most prestigious night in the British film calendar.",

      "Some wondered if the saga would affect its chances. With 11 nominations, it ended up winning best international film alongside Zoe Salda\u00f1a's win. She is now a favourite to replicate her Bafta win at next month's Oscars.",

      "Read on for this week's biggest releases...",
      "Sam Fender is People Watching",
      "By Mark Savage, Music correspondent",
      "Sam Fender made me cry twice last week.",
      "The first time, it was with the video for his single People Watching, starring Sherlock's Andrew Scott as a man trying and failing to grapple with the loss of his mother.",
      "He followed that up with another heart-tugging video, for Remember My Name, in which Dave Johns (from I, Daniel Blake) plays an elderly man caring for his wife as her health fails. Beautifully shot and delicately told, these stories would bring a lump to anyone's throat.",
      "Death and loss loom large over Fender's new album, which is released Friday and is also called People Watching. He says it was inspired by his trips to and from a palliative care home to visit his friend and mentor, Annie Orwin, who he's described as being like \"a surrogate mother\" to him.",
      "\"She was the one that gave me the confidence to go on stage, and always used to be like 'why haven't you mentioned my name in your acceptance speech',\" he wrote on Instagram last year. \"But now an entire song (and album) connects to her. I hope that wherever she is now she's looking down saying 'about time kid'.\"",
      "If that leaves you expecting mawkish sentiment and introspective wallowing, you've not been paying attention. Fender is one of our finest songwriters, with a sharp eye for detail and a heartland rock style that turn even the bleakest observations into rousing stadium anthems.",
      "Standout tracks on his new album (which is produced by The War On Drugs' Adam Granduciel) include the chiming riffs of Nostalgia's Lie, which explores the false allure of living in the past; and Crumbling Empire, whose lyrics draw parallels between the de-industrialisation and urban decay of Detroit and Fender's hometown of North Shields.",

    "published": "Sun, 16 Feb 2025 00:00:34 GMT",
    "summary": "As clips from Spain's Temptation Island go viral, the BBC speaks to the show's executive producer.",
    "story": [
      "Reality TV gold has a new three-word definition: \"Montoya, por favor!\"",
      "If you've been anywhere near social media over the past fortnight, you'll know the raw drama setting the internet ablaze this award season hasn't come from Hollywood, but the love tragedy played out in clips posted from Spanish reality TV show Temptation Island.",
      "Contestant Jose Carlos Montoya's spiralling meltdown at watching his girlfriend Anita cheat with another man is like an uncensored Love Island on steroids.",
      "In Temptation Island, couples are taken to a tropical island, separated and sent to separate villas filled with attractive singles ready to test their loyalty. In a final twist, every move made is recorded for the other half to see.",
      "Forced to watch a graphic real-time stream of the betrayal, Montoya's emotions swell until he snaps, breaking all the show's rules.",
      "Blind to the now infamous pleas of host Sandra Barneda (\"Montoya, por favor!\"), he rampages down the beach to confront the pair, tugging at his shorts in anguish as lightning streaks across the sky.",
      "A second clip shows the resulting confrontation: Anita flips the script, calling out Montoya's own indiscretions before collapsing in tears, begging for forgiveness.",
      "\"This is cinema,\" wrote one X user, posting a clip that has now been watched on the platform a staggering 224 million times since 4 February.",
      "\"Montoya. The tension... you don't need to speak Spanish to understand, this is insane.\"",
      "Yet those behind Spain's Temptation Island see its success as more than just shock value. Executive producer Juanra Gonzalo tells me they are overjoyed by the \"completely unexpected\" global reaction, and he believes the show's appeal lies in its relatability.",
      "\"In Love Island, all the people are single. In Temptation Island, there are real couples, and they are putting their love at risk,\" he says. \"I think [audiences] know it too. These emotions and reactions cannot be faked.",
      "\"Everyone wants to know what their boyfriend or girlfriend is doing when they are not with them. We can imagine, but we don't know. Temptation Island lets the audience ask, what would I do in that situation?\"",
      "The magic ingredient to making this work is careful casting. \"Montoya and Anita were perfect - they are very emotive and expressive,\" he says.",
      "Gonzalo calls Montoya, a singer by trade with previous TV experience, a \"special man\". At 31, he told casters he'd \"never experienced love like this before\", having been with Anita \"every day for a year\".",
      "\"She's a strong woman with a lot of character,\" Gonzalo adds.",
      "The Sun's senior showbiz reporter Lottie Hulme says the programme's \"authentic emotion\" sets it apart from competitors like Love Island, Love Is Blind, Married At First Sight and Dating Naked.",
      "Seeing such unfettered and raw emotion may stand out to British and American viewers, who have become used to glossy and well-worn competitive reality formats like Love Island and semi-scripted reality shows like Made in Chelsea.",
      "\"It was refreshing and almost shocking to see something so raw, because it's something that we just don't see on the reality TV shows in Britain nowadays,\" Hulme says.",
      "\"We're at a point with reality TV culture where we're wondering 'what if' - are contestants really being their authentic self... or are they after followings and a brand deal?\"",
      "Alongside constructed storylines, the commercialised reality TV-to-influencer pipeline has made existing formats feel \"predictable\" adds Hulme.",
      "'Never allowed' on UK TV?",
      "A curious quirk of the Montoya phenomenon is that the Spanish show isn't available to watch in the UK - an irony that has only fuelled its illicit appeal on social media.",
      "A previous British version failed to take off, and production company Banijay says it does not presently plan to broadcast the Spanish version in the UK.",
      "After Montoya's meltdown caught the eye of Love Island host Maya Jama, she posted: \"They would never allow this on UK TV. For so many reasons. But it's one of the best things I've ever seen\".",
      "When asked why, she simply replied: \"people would complain\".",
      "Like Big Brother before it, Love Island has been the subject of complaints to Ofcom.",
      "A heated confrontation between 2021 Love Islanders Faye and Teddy over Teddy's behaviour in Casa Amor (a segment similar to Temptation Island's premise) sparked 25,000 Ofcom complaints.",
      "Despite the shocked reactions Gonzalo's show has provoked, he says it operates within strict boundaries, suitable for its primetime slot.",
      "\"Not everything we record is aired,\" he says. \"We are very careful - we only show a few seconds of sexual content.\"",
      "Temptation Island is just the latest in a string of particularly high-octane Spanish dating shows.",
      "Take Falso Amor (or Deep Fake Love) is another. Currently streaming on Netflix, it intensifies the premise of Temptation Island by asking couples to decide whether videos of each other are real or highly convincing AI deepfakes.",
      "So is content which British audiences find shocking viewed differently in Spain?",
      "When I raise Love Island's Zara Holland being stripped of her Miss Great Britain title after having sex on the show in 2016, Gonzalo is shocked and welcomes the internet's more light-hearted reaction to Anita's sexual scenes.",
      "\"As in other countries, things in Spain are progressing from the past - this is positive for our view of women and sexuality,\" he says, adding that no gender should face double standards.",
      "Montoya 'given the right help'",
      "In the UK, there has been heightened scrutiny and awareness of the impact reality TV can have on cast members' mental health, following the deaths of several former contestants.",
      "When I press Gonzalo on this, given the intensity of Montoya and Anita's experience, he says a team of psychologists monitor contestants before, during and after filming.",
      "Montoya received particular support after his beach escapade.",
      "\"We made sure he was not alone, that he had a safe space to process everything. It was important for us to provide him with the right help,\" he says.",
      "Looking ahead, Netflix is to relaunch a US version of the show next month.",
      "Gonzalo is up for the fight. He laughs at the internet's playful suggestion that the beach scene should win an Oscar, then adds: \"My team deserve all the awards!\""

      "Peter Kay made the news last weekend when he kicked two hecklers out of his show at the Manchester Arena.",
      "Kay defended the move afterwards, saying he'd done his \"best to address the situation and made light of it, as any comedian would, but unfortunately their interruptions continued\".",
      "One heckler was removed for loudly ordering the Bolton comic's favourite \"garlic bread\" one too many times. He went on to tell the Daily Mail he felt he'd been \"treated like a terrorist\".",
      "Another had announced \"we love you, Peter\" in the aftermath, resulting in Kay calling her Lisa Riley as she was ejected, because of her resemblance to the actress.",
      "The woman later said on TikTok that she felt \"humiliated\" and thought his reaction was a bit \"over the top\".",
      "BBC News journalist Ellen Kirwin told the BBC the \"vibe was good\" in the place before the red cards, which \"seemed unjustified\".",
      "The incidents prompted a week-long discussion about when piping up can be fun, and how it can quickly get out of hand.",
      "With this in mind, we asked an English, a Welsh and Scottish comedian for their thoughts on the subtle art of dealing with hecklers.",
      "'Most brutal heckle ever'",
      "Larry Dean, who starts his UK tour on Wednesday 19 February in Cardiff, tells the BBC he \"felt sorry for the audience, not just Peter Kay\".",
      "\"It's a really hard thing to do because no one wants to see a comic go serious, you feel like a teacher sometimes,\" he says.",
      "\"It changes the atmosphere when a heckler goes too far, but it really is about gauging do the people around me want me to keep going?\"",
      "Last year, Dean found himself the victim of what he has described as \"the most brutal heckle ever\".",
      "When discussing the topic of ghosts, he overheard a woman loudly talking to someone else in the audience and decided to ask if she was okay.",
      "\"My dad bought me these tickets because he's dying and he wanted me to have a laugh,\" came the reply.",
      "\"We're not laughing\", she added, \"so I've said to my pal we're going to leave.\"",
      "Dean recalls his shocked response.",
      "\"Obviously I'm not gonna make fun of that,\" he tells the BBC.",
      "The Glaswegian looked so discombobulated by the heckle that another audience member asked him if he was okay.",
      "\"Looking at it, perspective-wise, Chris Rock [who was slapped on stage at the Oscars by Will Smith] and Peter Kay - who have the two most famous show interruptions from the past few years - they've had it easy!",
      "\"They need to get this woman from Dundee to know what a heckle really is.\"",
      "His second-worst heckle involved a man on the front row repeating the same whispered swear word at him, so low that only he could hear it. \"I just had to ignore it,\" he says.",
      "Arenas, like the ones Kay performs in, bring in more people but they can also bring problems for stand-ups, he says.",
      "\"They're harder to play than a theatre or comedy club because the laughter goes up, it doesn't come towards the stage,\" says Dean, who has played support slots in arenas.",
      "He says it's difficult for comedians in Kay's situation to hear what audience members are actually saying, and that their interjections are also distracting for others watching in different parts of the arena.",
      "\"People say, 'he should have said this...', but usually people who say that have never been on stage before and they don't know how hard it can be thinking that quickly in the moment about what the best thing for the show is; because you just want everybody to have a good time.\"",
      "Another British comic James Acaster last year released a special entitled Hecklers Welcome, not because he particularly enjoys the experience, but to face his biggest fear and, as he told GQ, \"run towards the thing I was scared of\".",
      "Dean feels that \"nothing will ever catch people's attention more\" than watching a comedian get heckled.",
      "But, he warns, if you're going to take a pop at a professional then you have to expect something to come back your way.",
      "Heckling versus crowd work",
      "Abi Clarke, who has almost a million followers on TikTok, thinks most comedians will be on Kay's side of the argument.",
      "Crucially though, the Bristolian notes: \"There's a difference betwen heckling and crowd work.",
      "\"With crowd work a comedian is inviting it, you're asking a question, you're wanting a chat and that's very different from somebody shouting out a random thing.",
      "\"Once is fine, or twice but if the comedian stops engaging with you or says that's enough, then at that point you're ruining it.\"",
      "New comic superstar Paul Smith made his name roasting crowds as a comedy club MC/compere in Liverpool, while Jimmy Carr is also famed for inviting and actively engaging with interruptions.",
      "For Clarke, heckling comes into its own when comics are workshopping new material. If someone joins in, it can create new \"source material\" that can be used as a fresh joke at the next gig.",
      "\"I've had hecklers who have interrupted multiple times but if they're engaging, joining in with what you're saying and being positive, I don't mind that, it's quite fun.",
      "\"If they're just derailing the gig because they like the sound of their own voice, then I think you should just chuck them out!",
      "\"'Garlic bread' - there's not much you can do with that.\"",
      "'Spontaneous moments'",
      "Clarke thinks if you're going to someone's headline show that they've honed and crafted - \"they've perfected the rhythm, set-up and punchline\" - then the time to interject has passed.",
      "\"I promise you, It will be a better show if they get to perform it how it's meant to be performed.\"",
      "The other time that heckling comes in handy, she says, is for promotional purposes online, as comics don't want to give away their best written material for free, when a great bit of crowd banter will show off their skills just as well.",
      "\"The ones we will post are the wonderful one-off spontaneous moments because they'll never happen again, so they won't ruin the show.\"",
      "She's \"quite lucky so far\", she says, having had only \"two or three horrible instances\" of bad heckling, and in those cases the audience had her back.",

    "title": "How EastEnders was made, from 'doof doofs' to Angie and Den",
    "published": "Sun, 16 Feb 2025 00:01:45 GMT",
    "summary": "Archive documents show Manchester and Birmingham were considered as alternative settings for the soap.",
    "story": [
      "For 40 years, EastEnders has shown us life in a fictional community in east London - but from the iconic characters to the theme tune, could it all have been very different?",
      "In the early research stages of EastEnders, multiple cities were considered for the new soap, from Manchester to London to Birmingham, according to BBC archive documents.",
      "But one audience report recommended that a serial set in a working-class neighbourhood in London would probably have the most widespread appeal.",
      "This would also set the soap apart from other big series of the time, like Coronation Street (set in Greater Manchester), Emmerdale Farm (set in Yorkshire) and Crossroads (set in a Midlands motel).",
      "Though EastEnders creators Julia Smith and Tony Holland would eventually settle on the fictional Walford with its E20 postcode, at this point the show had a working title of East 8 - and it was to be based on a real street in the London borough of Hackney.",
      "In March 1984, Smith and Holland headed to Lanzarote for a working holiday where they created 23 character biographies, three years of storyline overviews and 20 detailed story breakdowns.",
      "Despite all their planning, however, some of the most important elements of EastEnders were last-minute accidents, including the iconic drum \"doof doofs\" in the theme tune, which have since become shorthand for the show's dramatic cliffhangers.",
      "\"In those days, if a theme tune was popular, you'd often release it as a single. So I would make longer versions of the themes to allow for that,\" says Simon May, the theme tune's composer, who would go on to write EastEnders-related singles for cast members Anita Dobson and Nick Berry.",
      "\"The longer version gets a bit more Cockney, so I asked the drummer to play something to transition into the end theme. He played those 'doof doofs' and Tony and Julia happened to be in the studio at the time.",
      "\"They said: 'We love that drum thing.'\"",
      "Another key ingredient of the early years of EastEnders also happened at the last minute: the pairing of the actors behind Angie and her bad-boy husband Den Watts, played by Leslie Grantham.",
      "After a read-through of the first six episodes, the producers thought that original Angie Watts actress Jean Fennell was not quite working in the role. Anita Dobson took on the character at the last minute.",
      "Actor and stuntman Derek Martin, who joined the soap 15 years later as Charlie Slater, explains he was also up for the role of Den.",
      "\"Leslie got it, and he was very good, he was the ladies' man, and I was more the hard man,\" the 91-year-old actor says.",
      "This pairing of Angie and Den proved popular with the public - and the Christmas Day 1986 episode that sees Den serve Angie divorce papers remains the only scripted programme to have been watched by more than 30 million people in the UK, according to Barb figures.",
      "'We might have something here'",
      "The first episode of EastEnders was broadcast on 19 February 1985, with 17 million people watching - making it the second most-watched episode on the BBC that week behind The Two Ronnies.",
      "This compared with the 18 million who watched the same week's Coronation Street.",
      "The episode started with a kick, as Den broke down a door to find the nearly dead body of Reg Cox (played by Johnnie Clayton) - and ended with a punch, as suspect number one in the attack, Nick Cotton (John Altman), put his fist through the glass of the Queen Vic doors.",
      "Though the press was quick to set up a rivalry between EastEnders and Coronation Street, the cast had their eye on another ITV soap.",
      "Actor Adam Woodyat, who played Ian Beale in that first episode, says: \"We were going out at the same time as Emmerdale Farm at 7pm. It felt like Emmerdale Farm gave us an absolute kicking in the ratings until they shifted us to half past seven.\"",
      "Newspapers of the time suggested reactions were mixed. A Sunday People poll of 600 viewers showed 56% of respondents didn't like the first episode, with complaints over \"coarse\" and \"bawdy\" dialogue.",
      "The Guardian, however, was more measured, with their critic Hugh Hebert predicting it would \"probably take a year before anyone knows whether the BBC has got it right\".",
      "The show would prove itself earlier than that. On 25 July 1985, the programme was the most-watched on the BBC that week. This coincided with the show's first blockbuster storyline that saw Michelle (played by Susan Tully) become pregnant by a mystery man, eventually revealed to be Den Watts.",
      "\"After the reveal of Den and Michelle,\" says Woodyat, \"that's when we started to realise we might have something here.\"",

    "story": [
      "It has been dubbed one of the world's rarest treasure troves of art but few people outside its host country know about it.",
      "For decades, masterpieces by the likes of Pablo Picasso, Vincent Van Gogh, Andy Warhol and Jackson Pollock have been kept in the basement of a museum in Iran's capital Tehran, shrouded in mystery.",
      "According to estimates in 2018, the collection is worth as much as $3bn.",
      "Only a small portion of the work has been exhibited since the 1979 Iranian Revolution but in recent years, the Tehran Museum of Contemporary Art has been showcasing some of its most captivating pieces.",
      "The Eye to Eye exhibition at the Tehran Museum of Contemporary Art, which opened in October 2024, was extended twice due to overwhelming public demand, running until January 2025.",
      "The display was widely regarded as one of the most significant exhibitions in the history of the museum, and it also became its most visited.",
      "The showcase featured more than 15 works unveiled for the first time, including a sculpture by Jean Dubuffet - marking its first-ever appearance in an Iranian exhibition.",
      "From abstract expressionism to pop art, the collection at the museum serves as a time capsule of pivotal artistic movements.",
      "Among the artwork is Warhol's portrait of Farah Pahlavi - Iran's last queen - a rare piece blending his pop art flair with Iranian cultural history.",
      "Elsewhere, Francis Bacon's work called Two Figures Lying on a Bed with Attendants shows figures appearing to spy on two naked men lying on a bed.",
      "On the opposite wall in the basement of the museum, a portrait of Ayatollah Ruhollah Khomeini, the founder of the Islamic Republic of Iran, is on display in juxtaposition.",
      "The museum was built in 1977 under the patronage of Pahlavi, the exiled widow of the last Shah of Iran who was overthrown during the revolution.",
      "Pahlavi was a passionate art advocate and her cousin, architect Kamran Diba, designed the museum.",
      "It was established to introduce modern art to Iranians and to bridge Iran closer to the international art scene.",
      "The museum soon became home to a stunning array of works by luminaries including Picasso, Warhol and Salvador Dali, alongside pieces by leading Iranian modernists, and quickly established itself as a beacon of cultural exchange and artistic ambition.",
      "But then came the 1979 revolution. Iran became an Islamic republic as the monarchy was overthrown and clerics assumed political control under Ayatollah Khomeini.",
      "Many artworks were deemed inappropriate for public display because of nudity, religious sensitivities or political implications.",
      "Pierre-Auguste Renoir's Gabrielle with Open Blouse was deemed too scandalous. And Warhol's portrait of the former queen of Iran was too political. In fact, Pahlavi's portrait was vandalised and torn apart with a knife during the revolutionary turmoil.",
      "After the revolution, many of the artworks were locked away, collecting dust in a basement that became the stuff of art world legend.",
      "It was only in the late 1990s that the museum reclaimed its cultural significance during the reformist presidency of Mohammad Khatami.",
      "Suddenly the world remembered what it had been missing. Art lovers could not believe their eyes. Van Gogh, Dali, even Monet - all in Tehran.",
      "Some pieces were loaned to major exhibitions in Europe and the United States, briefly reconnecting the collection with the global art world.",
      "Hamid Keshmirshekan, an art historian based in London, has studied the collection and calls it \"one of the rarest treasure troves of modern art outside the West\".",
      "The collection includes Henry's Moore's Reclining Figure series - an iconic piece by one of Britain's most celebrated sculptors - and Jackson Pollock's Mural on Indian Red Ground, a vibrant example of the American's painting technique pulsing with energy and emotion.",
      "Picasso's The Painter and His Model - his largest canvas from 1927 - also features, a strong example of his abstract works from the post-cubism period.",
      "And there is Van Gogh's At Eternity's Gate - one of the very rare survivals of his first printmaking campaign during which he produced six lithographs in November 1882.",
      "But for art lovers in Britain, the collection is out of reach. The UK Foreign Office advises against all travel to Iran and says British and British-Iranian dual nationals are at significant risk of arrest, questioning or detention.",
      "Having a British passport or connections to the UK can be reason enough for detention by the Iranian authorities, it says.",
      "Challenges remain for the museum which operates under a tight budget. Shifting political priorities mean that it often functions more as a cultural hub than a traditional museum.",
      "Yet it continues to be a remarkable institution - an unlikely guardian of modern art masterpieces in the heart of Tehran."

      "Hollywood may be known as Tinseltown, a dream factory at the heart of the global entertainment industry. But nowadays crews are more likely to film in Atlanta, London, Toronto or Sydney than in Los Angeles.",
      "Cheaper labour and better tax breaks have lured producers away from the City of Angels for years. The wildfires, which killed at least 29 people and destroyed thousands of homes, have only added to this existential crisis.",
      "Now, many here are calling on the state - and studios and streaming services - to boost local production.",
      "\"The best thing the studios could do for fire relief is to bring work back for the rank and file LA film workers,\" says Mark Worthington, a production designer whose home burned down in Altadena.",
      "\"That's what we want.\"",
      "Mr Worthington had already been struggling to cope with the city's downturn, noting he hadn't set foot on an LA set in two years. Covid, labour strikes, and the inevitable end of the streaming boom had led many producers to try and save costs by skipping town - sometimes leaving the country altogether.",

      "Productions in the US decreased 26% last year compared to pre-strike levels in 2022, according to ProdPro, which tracks global production. In Australia and New Zealand, production was up 14% and in the UK it was up nearly 1%, with Canada up 2.8%.",
      "The loss clearly stings. The Red Hot Chili Peppers are a band synonymous with Los Angeles, with many love songs to the City of Angels. But a biopic about the band is being filmed in Atlanta, Georgia - which has become a major production hub due to its lucrative tax breaks - not LA.",
      "Before the fires, \"Survive until '25\" had become a kind of mantra for Mr Worthington and other filmmakers who hoped for a turnaround of fortune. Instead, their city went up in flames.",
      "\"It's crushing in terms of how you see yourself as a creative individual and just as a person, and then on top of that to have these fires,\" Mr Worthington says. \"This is adding a horrible other thing to pile on top of all the other difficulties and our own work situation over the last couple years.\"",

      "Mel Gibson, Jeff Bridges and other LA celebrities lose homes to wildfires",
      "'I have nothing to go back to' - LA fires heartbreak",
      "Hollywood's studios and streaming services have donated more than $70m (\u00a356m) to fire relief efforts and have turned the glitzy awards season parties and red carpets typical this time of year into major fundraisers.",
      "Many say these efforts are not enough and that Hollywood's biggest companies need to commit to filming in LA.",
      "But studios don't often make business decisions based on the greater good of workers in one city - ultimately, they care about the bottom line. The reality is LA is expensive and the vast majority of industry jobs here are union protected \u2013 so they come with high salaries and expensive health care and pensions.",

      "It's part of a grassroots campaign started by director Sarah Adina Smith and other filmmakers who want California to use its emergency powers to boost tax incentives for the next three years to make filming in LA more affordable and help heal Los Angeles. They also want studios to commit to making 10% more productions in Los Angeles.",
      "\"We need to bring production back to LA and get LA working again if we want to rebuild,\" says Ms Smith.",
      "Before the fires, California Gov Newsom had already proposed to more than double the tax credit the state offers to producers of films and TV shows that shoot in California \u2013 changing the annual credit from $330m to $750m, but that must be approved by the state legislature and might not come into effect until the summer.",
      "He says the incentives are good for the economy and that California's programme has generated more than $26bn in economic activity and supported more than 197,000 cast and crew jobs across the state.",
      "If passed, the subsidy would be the most generous offered by any US state except Georgia, which doesn't have a cap on the amount it gives to productions per year. Stay in LA wants the cap lifted now.",
      "President Donald Trump has also said he plans to make Hollywood great again with the help of actors Jon Voight, Mel Gibson, and Sylvester Stallone, who have been tapped to be \"special ambassadors\" for \"troubled Hollywood\".",
      "It's not yet clear what they have in mind - they did not agree to an interview - but several executives said the instability caused by the Trump administration's trade wars make risk-averse Hollywood studios nervous. The Canadian dollar recently hit 22-year lows making Canada even more attractive to Hollywood.",
      "On a rainy day more than a month after the fires, Mr Worthington, the production designer, and his partner Mindy Elliott, a film editor, inspected the remains of their home, wishing they'd taken some of their art when they evacuated. They marvelled that a cactus was regrowing next to where their SUV had melted.",
      "\"If only we'd had this rain in January,\" says Ms Elliott.",
      "Although he is critical that the tax breaks amount to \"corporate welfare\" for behemoth companies, Mr Worthington says they are a necessary evil if LA wants to compete - both Australia and the UK now have more lucrative tax breaks than California.",
      "Ms Smith, the co-founder of Stay in LA, likens the decline of Hollywood productions to the fall of Detroit, whose once formidable automotive industry collapsed, leaving much of the city desolate and impoverished.",
      "\"Once you ruin that infrastructure and that legacy, it's not so easy to build it back again,\" she says. \"If we let Hollywood die, it could be for good.\"",
      "Others think it's na\u00efve to think that any incentives will usher in a new Golden Age of Hollywood.",
      "Pointing out the melted remains of what used to be his piano and his drum set in the music studio of his incinerated Topanga Canyon home, composer Matthew Ferraro wipes away tears for what he and his wife have lost.",
      "His once spectacular hilltop home is now rubble and ash and Ferraro says he's still in shock, consumed with thoughts of where he will sleep on Tuesday, rather than his future in LA.",
      "\"I think it's wishful thinking for people who are still in love with, like yesteryear's dream of Hollywood, but that's just not how it works anymore,\" says Ferraro, who composed music for The Incredibles and The Minority Report among others.",
      "About a mile away, Jamie Morse's home also burned. Topanga Canyon has always attracted artists, musicians and dreamers - and Morse had just quit her sensible day job to devote 2025 to making it in Hollywood, working fulltime on her comedic writing and performing.",
      "She laughs when asked about the terrible timing - and says she's grieving along with everyone else in LA, but remains hopeful.",
      "\"Whether they're performers or studio execs - people love this city,\" says Ms Morse, who is now in an Airbnb temporary rental after staying at friends' homes with her dog between comedy gigs or classes with her improv troupe, The Groundlings.",
      "Ms Morse wishes she'd taken more sentimental things when she evacuated with her dog, like a Toronto Blue Jays T-shirt which reminded her of her grandfather and her native Canada. But she's astonished that some of her notebooks and journals survived with some of her comedy writing intact.",
      "\"Where an entire stone table is, is in pieces, is like, absolutely decimated, melted,\" she said. \"But pieces of paper survived\u2026 It's truly unbelievable.\"",
      "Does she think it's fate? A sign that she is meant to make it in Hollywood?",
      "\"I'm choosing to believe that this is a sign,\" she says, adding that there will be \"beautiful, creative things to come out of this very, very crappy time.\""

      "Pop star Rihanna, his partner with whom he shares two children, has been a repeated presence in the court as the trial delved into allegations that he pulled a gun out on his former friend and opened fire multiple times.",
      "The trial started late last month and will determine whether the rapper will face jail time on two charges of felony assault. He could face decades in prison.",
      "A$AP Rocky has pleaded not guilty to the charges and his lawyers have argued the weapon was a prop gun and his former friend is only after money.",
      "Here's what you need to know about the case.",
      "What is A$AP Rocky charged with?",
      "A$AP Rocky's assault trial began on 24 January in Los Angeles.",
      "The rapper, whose real name is Rakim Mayers, was charged with two felony assault charges relating to a 2021 shooting incident in the heart of Hollywood.",
      "Authorities allege A$AP Rocky and a former friend got into a heated discussion that turned violent and led to the rapper pulling out a gun and opening fire.",
      "Who is the accuser Terell Ephron?",
      "The victim in the case is fellow artist and childhood friend Terell Ephron, also known as A$AP Relli. He is the star witness for prosecutors",
      "They were both part of the A$AP Mob hip-hop collective and have known one another since their time together at a New York high school.",
      "Their relationship eroded over time as A$AP Rocky's career took off and he became famous.",
      "It all led up to a disagreement between the pair in November 2021.",
      "Mr Ephron took the stand last week to describe their relationship and the moments of the alleged shooting.",
      "What is A$AP Rocky accused of doing?",
      "Authorities have said Mr Ephron met Mr Mayers on 6 November in 2021, a day after the pair got into a disagreement.",
      "They met outside a Hollywood hotel about a block from the iconic stars on the Hollywood Walk of Fame.",
      "Prosecutors say when the pair met things got physical. Mr Mayers is alleged to have whipped out a gun from his waistband and pointed it toward Mr Ephron, telling him \"I'll kill you right now\".",
      "Court documents outline that Mr Ephron told the rapper to fire the weapon, which Mr Mayers did not and instead started walking away.",
      "Mr Ephron followed behind and yelled at Mr Mayers about their disagreements, court documents show.",
      "That's when prosecutors allege Mr Mayers pulled out the gun again and opened fire.",
      "Court documents allege multiple bullets were fired, one of which is alleged to have grazed Mr Ephron's knuckles.",
      "Authorities say parts of the incident were captured on surveillance footage, including some footage that included audio of gunfire, although there is no video showing the shooting.",
      "Some of this footage has been played in court already for jurors.",
      "What is A$AP Rocky saying about the allegations?",
      "There are several key points of contention in the case: the weapon, police investigation and Mr Ephron's injuries.",
      "The rapper's lawyers have noted the weapon authorities say was the gun he pulled out was not usable - instead it was a prop weapon his security encouraged him to carry to ward off would-be attackers.",
      "His lawyers have also focused on Mr Ephron taking multiple days to report the incident to police, and how authorities found no trace of bullet casings or a shooting when they responded to the incident.",
      "Court documents detail that Mr Ephron returned to the scene later and gathered two shell casings he said he found in the area. He brought them when he reported the incident to police two days later.",
      "He also did not immediately go to hospital after the incident and instead sought medical treatment after flying back to New York.",
      "What's happened in court so far?",
      "Prosecutors finished presenting their case before jurors as to why they believe Mr Mayers is guilty.",
      "Prosecutors showed jurors footage of the incident, captured on surveillance, that included audio of gunfire but no video evidence showing the shooting itself.",
      "There were a number of tense and emotional exchanges, especially when Mr Ephron was on the stand and testified about being shot.",
      "At one point while on the witness stand, Mr Ephron called A$AP Rocky's attorney \"annoying,\" which led to a reprimand from the judge. Another tense moment came when A$AP Rocky screamed in court.",
      "Another associate of the pair, A$AP Twelvyy, was being questioned by prosecutors on the stand when they showed him a photo of Mr Mayers' bed with the letters \"AWGE\" emblazoned on furniture.",
      "When asked what the letters stood for, Mr Mayers interrupted and yelled out, \"Don't say!\"",
      "Twelvyy would only say, \"It means AWGE,\" which angered the prosecutor, who asked the judge to force the witness to be more forthcoming.",
      "Mr Mayers' defence attorney, Joe Tacopina, has asserted the case was one of \"extortion, plain and simple\".",
      "Mr Mayers' lawyer said Mr Ephron's claims were financially motivated and suggested that Mr Ephron sought monetary compensation in exchange for dropping the charges.",
      "The trial is nearly at its conclusion. Mr Tacopina told the judge on Monday that they expect to rest their arguments on Tuesday.",
      "After his defence is finished, both sides will be able to give their closing statements before a jury decides the rapper's fate.",
      "Will A$AP Rocky take the stand?",
      "The rapper waived his right to testify on Tuesday, meaning that he will not take the stand.",
      "Now, it is believed that the trial will conclude without comment from the famous rapper. Closing arguments are expected to begin on Thursday.",
      "The rapper is not legally obligated to testify, and it could have been a risky move. Taking the stand would have mean he would face questioning from prosecutors as well as his own lawyers.",
      "Speculation that he would speak at his own trial only arose when his attorney, Mr Tacopina, stated that the rapper was \"eager to tell his story\", and that \"he would love the opportunity to do so\".",
      "Had he testified, the rapper was expected to argue that the firearm involved in the 2021 fight was a starter pistol loaded with blanks, carried solely for security reasons.",
      "Could A$AP Rocky face prison time?",
      "Yes, the rapper could face up to 24 years in prison if found guilty in the trial, which is expected to go on for about three weeks.",
      "A panel of 12 jurors will decide his fate.",
      "Will Rihanna continue to be in court?",
      "Rihanna has continued to appear at the trial.",
      "Before the proceedings started, the rapper's lawyer had told the court that Mr Mayers had tried to keep his family away from all of this, but she has appeared multiple times during the trial to support him.",
      "At some points in the trial, she sat between the rapper's mother and sister in the courtroom, media reports indicate. The couple's two children have not appeared.",
      "During Rihanna's first appearance at the trial, news reporters and fans gathered outside the courthouse to try to catch a glimpse of the singer.",
      "She ended up using a non-public entrance used by judges and was already seated in the courtroom when media were allowed into the chamber.",
      "During jury selection, prosecutors questioned jurors about Rihanna and whether her connection to the case would affect their ability to deliver a fair verdict. While some described themselves as Rihanna fans, and many more had heard of Rihanna than A$AP Rocky, jurors said her presence in the courtroom would not influence their decision making.",
      "Rihanna's presence had attracted attention from jurors in a murder trial across the hall at the courthouse, with some commenting on her being so nearby.",
      "Rocky's trial is being televised, but Rihanna has sat out of view of cameras in the courtroom.",

    "published": "Sun, 16 Feb 2025 00:00:42 GMT",
    "summary": "More young people are presenting to audiology teams in England with difficulty processing sound.",
    "story": [
      "Whether it's the echo of beeping tills in a supermarket or the hissing of a coffee machine in your local caf\u00e9, the brain is constantly working to decode hundreds of noises each day.",
      "But, for some, those background noises can become so overwhelming that they distract them from recognising voices or alerts.",
      "This is the reality for Sophie, a 25-year-old administration assistant from London, who is used to being told she doesn't listen, zones out, or is \"a bit ditsy\".",
      "\"Even though I can hear that there are noises going on, I can't listen to where the noise is coming from. I know it's the person's voice, I just can't really compute it quick enough,\" she said.",
      "After a hearing test came back normal, Sophie met a private audiologist for further testing. She was eventually diagnosed with auditory processing disorder (APD), a neurological condition where the brain finds it difficult to understand sounds and spoken words.",
      "Her audiologist and others in England are now calling for more research into whether the condition is linked to overuse of noise-cancelling headphones.",
      "'Words sound like gibberish'",
      "Having grown up on a peaceful farm in the countryside, it wasn't until a few years ago when Sophie started university in London that she noticed a change in her hearing - specifically trouble identifying where a sound was coming from.",
      "She rarely attended her university lectures in person, instead opting to watch them online and with subtitles.",
      "\"All the words sounded like gibberish when I was in the actual lecture, and I was trying to hear,\" she said.",
      "It affected her social life too and Sophie would leave bars and restaurants early because of the \"overwhelming noise\".",
      "The cause of Sophie's APD diagnosis is unknown, but her audiologist believes the overuse of noise-cancelling headphones, which Sophie wears for up to five hours a day, could have a part to play.",
      "Other audiologists agree, saying more research is needed into the potential effects of their prolonged use.",
      "Five NHS audiology departments have told the BBC that there has been an increase in the number of young people referred to them from GPs with hearing issues - only to find their hearing is normal when tested and it is their ability to process sound that is struggling.",
      "APD is more common in neurodivergent people, those who have suffered from a brain injury or had a middle-ear infection as a child. However, more patients with APD are presenting outside of those categories, leaving audiologists to question if external factors, such as noise-cancelling headphones, are contributing.",
      "Hearing vs listening",
      "Renee Almeida, an adult audiology clinical lead at Imperial College Healthcare NHS Trust, says it is important to hear a diversity of sounds so the brain can decide what is important to focus on.",
      "Her team has seen an increase in the amount of young people referred for hearing services in the last year. She said: \"There is a difference between hearing and listening. We can see that listening skills are suffering.\"",
      "Noise-cancelling headphones do have their benefits, particularly for long-term ear health where their soundproofing feature can prevent high frequency and loud noise from reaching and damaging the ear - even while listening to music.",
      "Lisa Barber, technology editor at Which?, said the devices had \"exploded in popularity\" in recent years. But the level of transparency can vary from model to model.",
      "\"Some simply offer passive noise cancelling, where the acoustic seal between the headphones and your ears reduces nearby noise,\" she said. Others have a transparency mode that allows you to hear partial background noise.",
      "A false reality?",
      "But Claire Benton, vice-president of the British Academy of Audiology, suggests that by blocking everyday sounds such as cars beeping, there is a possibility the brain can \"forget\" to filter out the noise.",
      "\"You have almost created this false environment by wearing those headphones of only listening to what you want to listen to. You are not having to work at it,\" she said.",
      "\"Those more complex, high-level listening skills in your brain only really finish developing towards your late teens. So, if you have only been wearing noise-cancelling headphones and been in this false world for your late teens then you are slightly delaying your ability to process speech and noise,\" Benton suggests.",
      "For those experiencing difficulties with sound processing in England, APD care in the NHS is limited.",
      "A UK-wide survey from 2024, distributed by the BAA and ENT UK, the professional body representing ear, nose and throat surgery, found that only 4% of audiologists consider themselves to be well-informed on APD.",
      "And, for those who are 16 years and over, the Royal National ENT and Eastman Hospital is the only NHS provider in England offering a full APD assessment and the waiting list is nine months long.",
      "Prof Doris-Eva Bamiou, who carries out the assessments there, says this is partially down to the time it takes to diagnose APD. \"It is a costly service because it is not just an audiogram, the test can take up to two hours and it requires additional assessments. In adults I also refer them for a cognitive assessment and in children I may also need to speak to an educational psychologist.\"",
      "Particularly after the pandemic, behaviours and engagement with visuals and audio has changed. This comes in part due to new products and technology, as well as increased anxiety in noisy environments after the lockdown.",
      "It is now common to see people walking outside wearing their noise-cancelling headphones and watching videos online with subtitles, despite perfectly hearing the sound. One YouGov survey showed that 61% of 18-24 year olds prefer to watch TV with the subtitles on.",
      "Dr Angela Alexander, audiologist and owner of APD Support, a private organisation, is among the audiologists calling for more research into the impact of noise-cancelling headphones on auditory processing, particularly in children.",
      "\"What does the future look like if we don't investigate this link? There are a lot of well-meaning parents and teachers who think the answer to children having problems with noise is to wear ear plugs or having noise-cancelling headphones on.\"",
      "Dr Amjad Mahmood, the head of audiology at Great Ormond Street Hospital supported the call for more research.",
      "He said there had been a \"significant increase in demand\" for assessments at the hospital's large APD clinic for under-16s. \"especially with difficulties noticed at school\".",
      "'Having a hearing dog is like winning the lottery'",
      "Could solar-powered headphones be the next must-have?",
      "Study finds 18m people in the UK have hearing loss",
      "Treatment for APD can make a significant positive difference, with some patients able to make a full recovery.",
      "So-called \"word in noise\" training exercises on mobile apps have become a popular way of practising pulling speech from background noise. But training can vary and includes practice with auditory discrimination too, such as how to distinguish separate sounds in words like seventy and seventeen, and free and three.",
      "Microphones and low-gain hearing aids can also be provided to help the patient in certain situations, such as a meeting or classroom work, but adults outside the education system are not entitled to these products on the NHS.",
      "\"Right now I can hear there is a fan above my head but my brain is telling me that is not something I need to worry about,\" says Dr Alexander, describing what is called auditory scene analysis.",
      "\"It's the way we identify threats in our environment, so it makes sense to me that there would be an increase in anxiety if a person's brain no longer has those inputs helping tell them what is a concern and what is not.\"",
      "To improve this, Dr Alexander suggests reducing headphone use time and using the transparency mode which can amplify the background noise as well as wearing headphones that don't completely occlude or block the ears.",
      "Limited research",
      "Wayne Wilson, an associate professor in the school of health and rehabilitation sciences at The University of Queensland, says more research needs to be done on the possible link.",
      "However, he points out that doing controlled research with so many variables could prove tricky.",
      "\"The devil is in the detail as the answer probably depends on which sounds, which scenes, which noise, which noise cancellation, what period of noise cancellation, what age of child, etc.\"",
      "Sophie is set to start treatment for her APD in the next few months, and feels excited for the future.",
      "\"If me and my boyfriend go out to a bar, sometimes we will leave early because of the noise. It's nice to know maybe after this treatment, I will be able to go to busier places and handle it a bit better.\"",

      "At a Parliamentary committee NHS leaders acknowledged the fundamental problem was the contract that dentists are offered to carry out NHS work \u2013 and the best thing was to rip it up and start again.",
      "The Dental Recovery Plan was first outlined by Conservative health ministers in February 2024, to try and address a crisis in NHS dentistry in England.",

      "A \"Golden Hello\" payment scheme has so far only seen an additional 39 dentists contracted to work in underserved areas, against a target of 240.",
      "And a reform of the amount of money dentists are paid for individual treatments had failed to bridge the gap with what they earn for private work.",
      "Amanda Pritchard, head of NHS England, told the Public Accounts Committee that lessons would be learned from the failure of the plan.",
      "\"The thing which we are focusing on next, which is a very clear priority for the Government, is the delivery of the additional 700,000 urgent dental appointments.",
      "\"We are expecting commissioners to plan for that.",
      "\"And crucially we are leaning the lessons of what hasn't worked.\"",
      "There was an acknowledgement from health leaders and MPs that the fundamental problem with dentistry is the contract for NHS work, which many dentists say actually costs them money.",
      "Amanda Pritchard of NHS England agreed with one MP who suggested the solution was to rip up the existing contract and start again.",
      "\"The right answer I think is to consider a much more radical reshaping of dentistry in this country because it feels to us that tweaking around the edges...you can see it has made some difference, but not enough.\""

    "title": "How much is the NHS going to cost us?",
    "published": "Thu, 13 Feb 2025 06:38:57 GMT",
    "summary": "Spending on the NHS has been going up for decades and is set to rise further. BBC Verify has examined some of the key numbers.",
    "story": [
      "The amount of money the UK spends on health, predominantly on the NHS, has been rising for decades.",
      "And as the UK population ages and people demand access to new medicines and treatments, there is every likelihood that the national bill will continue to grow.",
      "So how much could the NHS ultimately end up costing the nation? And is it possible to get better value for the money we collectively spend?",
      "BBC Verify has examined some of the key numbers.",
      "How much do we spend on health?",
      "Shortly after the NHS was founded, in 1949-50, total UK health spending was around \u00a317bn in today's money.",
      "By 2023\u201324 it had grown to \u00a3226bn.",
      "Health spending per person in 2022-23 was around \u00a33,300 in England and Scotland, \u00a33,600 in Wales and \u00a33,500 in Northern Ireland.",
      "In the Autumn Budget last year, Chancellor Rachel Reeves announced an additional \u00a326bn a year for the English health budget by 2025-26, which will automatically increase the resources available to the devolved nations.",
      "As a share of the overall economy - or GDP - spending on health has massively increased over the past 70 years.",
      "In 1949-50, health spending was only 3.6% of GDP. In 2023-24, it had more than doubled to 8.1% of GDP, after peaking at more than 10% in the Covid pandemic.",
      "Health spending jumped in the pandemic due to the costs of vaccinations and the \"test and trace\" programme.",
      "Around 80% of total health spending is funded by the government in the UK, mainly going to the NHS. The other 20% comes through private insurance schemes or out-of-pocket costs.",
      "That means health spending as a share of total government spending has also considerably increased.",
      "In the middle of the 1950s, health accounted for around \u00a31 in every \u00a38 the government spent.",
      "Today it's roughly \u00a31 in every \u00a33.",
      "How does that compare to other countries?",
      "Despite that surge in health spending in recent decades, the UK is by no means an outlier among rich countries.",
      "In 2022, using comparable data on public health spending, the UK was spending around 9.3% of GDP.",
      "That was higher than Canada (7.9%) and Italy (6.8%) as well as the EU average, but less than Germany (10.9%) and France (10.2%).",
      "The US was the real outlier, spending 14.1% of GDP on health, largely because America has a private insurance system with few of the cost controls of other nations.",
      "And those countries have, like the UK, seen health spending rise considerably in recent decades, driven up by growing demand for new medical treatments and ageing populations.",
      "What's going to happen to NHS spending in future?",
      "Last year, the Office for Budget Responsibility (OBR), the government's official forecaster, said there was every likelihood there would be continued upward pressure on UK public health spending, citing those same factors: an ageing population and more demand for new medicines and treatments.",
      "It also cites rising ill health among the population as one of the contributors to rising spending, albeit not the dominant one.",
      "The amount of health spending on an individual rises dramatically as they grow older. Average annual spending per person on those aged 45 is around \u00a32,000. For those aged 85 it is \u00a313,000 a year.",
      "The OBR projects that the proportion of the population aged 65 and over will rise from around one in five today to one in four by 2070.",
      "As people's incomes grow, research suggests they are typically willing to spend more of those incomes on healthcare, which in the UK is done mainly through the taxpayer-funded NHS.",
      "In its central forecast, the OBR projected UK public healthcare spending will rise by around 3% every year, after adjusting for inflation. This would be broadly in line with average growth over recent decades, although the rate has fluctuated under different governments.",
      "The OBR estimates this trend would add up to roughly an extra 1% of GDP going on public health spending every decade going forward.",
      "That would take public health spending from around 8% of GDP in 2024-25, up to 14.5% of GDP by 2073-74, equivalent to around \u00a3180bn in today's money.",
      "However, this would also depend on the long term growth rate of the economy. The OBR assumes public health spending will grow roughly twice as fast as the overall economy.",
      "If that path of spending transpired, it would also likely mean health spending accounting for an even larger share of total government public service spending.",
      "How do we get better value for money from health spending?",
      "Many politicians argue it's important for the NHS to deliver higher levels of productivity, in other words, to spend money more efficiently in order to keep the national bill under control.",
      "Productivity growth in the NHS has long lagged behind productivity growth in the rest of the UK economy.",
      "Last year, the OBR looked at what would happen if NHS productivity grew faster than currently expected in the coming decades.",
      "This, the OBR said, could curb the overall rise in public health spending. It might rise only to 11% of GDP by 2074, rather than to 14.5%.",
      "The recent indications of productivity growth in the NHS, however, are unclear.",
      "The latest estimates from the Office for National Statistics are that in the second half of 2024 NHS measured \"inputs\" - mainly in the form of more doctors and nurses hired - were 32% higher than they were before the pandemic in 2019.",
      "But measured \"outputs\" - things like operations completed and patients discharged - were only up by 7%.",
      "This meant that UK public sector health productivity was still around 19% lower than it was five years previously - and showing no signs of sustained growth.",
      "However, measuring productivity in the public services is far from simple and the ONS has stressed that these statistics are still only \"in development\".",
      "Other estimates from NHS England and the Institute for Fiscal Studies - the independent economic research institute - point to an improvement in productivity in hospitals in England more recently, suggesting a corner might have been turned in the delivery of health services after the shock of the pandemic.",
      "But regardless of the statistical discrepancy, most experts agree that improving productivity in the health sector in the medium and long term is an important objective. And the extent to which it is delivered will play a key part in determining how much the NHS ends up costing the nation in the coming years.",

      "Badenoch, the Tory party leader, had asked the prime minister about a decision to grant a Palestinian family the right to live in the UK after they originally applied through a scheme designed for Ukrainians, saying it was \"completely wrong\".",
      "Sir Keir said he agreed, adding: \"It should be Parliament that makes the rules on immigration\".",
      "But Lady Chief Justice Baroness Sue Carr said the remarks were \"unacceptable\" and conflicted with the duty of politicians to uphold the rule of law and respect the independent role of judges.",
      "A government spokesperson said Sir Keir had \"made clear that it is for Parliament to make the laws and for the government to decide policy.\"",
      "Speaking at her annual news conference, Baroness Carr also said that judges' concerns about their personal security were at an \"all-time high\" - thanks to attacks on social media driven by wider misreporting of their work.",
      "The exchange between Sir Keir and Badenoch came during Prime Minister's Questions (PMQs) last week.",
      "Badenoch was critical of how an immigration judge had handled the family's application, which she said was made under a scheme designed for Ukrainians fleeing the war. The case has been widely misreported and misunderstood.",
      "Badenoch said: \"A judge has now ruled in their favour. That is not what the scheme was designed to do.",
      "\"This decision is completely wrong, and cannot be allowed to stand. Are the government planning to appeal on any points of law, and, if so, which ones?\"",
      "The full reading of the judgement reveals that the family of six - a mother and father, and their four children - had sought permission to live with a British relative who proved he was able to house and financially support them.",
      "Part of their case had been that they were political opponents of Hamas, which is banned in the UK under terrorism laws.",
      "The family, whose home in Gaza was destroyed by an air strike, have been granted anonymity.",
      "Their initial application had been incorrectly made using a form reserved to help Ukrainian families reunite. They eventually won permission to stay under entirely separate general human rights considerations. These allow families from any background to make a case to reunite if there are compelling reasons to do so outside of standard immigration schemes.",
      "This detail, including the specific risks the family say they faced, was not spelled out at PMQs, with Sir Keir saying the case had been one that had been dealt with under the Conservatives.",
      "PM pledges to close loophole that let Gazans settle in UK",
      "UK to deny citizenship to small boat refugees",
      "Net migration numbers are down - how have the rules changed?",
      "Replying to Badenoch, Sir Keir said: \"Let me be clear: I do not agree with the decision. The leader of the opposition is right that it is the wrong decision.",
      "\"She has not quite done her homework, however, because the decision in question was taken under the last government, according to their legal framework.\"",
      "He went on: \"It should be Parliament that makes the rules on immigration; it should be the government who make the policy. That is the principle. The home secretary is already looking at the legal loophole that we need to close in this particular case.\"",
      "The prime minister has not specified what the \"legal loophole\" is that he wants to close.",
      "Meanwhile, the two Upper Tribunal judges, who granted the family permission to reunite in the UK, said that their decision was not creating a Palestinian settlement scheme, but dealing with a complex and exceptional case.",
      "They had not been presented with any evidence from the government that this family's unusual case would open \"floodgates\".",
      "The UK currently has schemes for some Afghans, Ukrainians and people from Hong Kong to come to the UK, but no route for Palestinians.",
      "Reflecting on the PMQs clash, Baroness Carr said on Monday that \"both the question and the answer were unacceptable\".",
      "\"It is for the government visibly to respect and protect the independence of the judiciary,\" she said. \"Where parties, including the government, disagree with their findings, they should do so through the appellate process.\"",
      "She also said MPs, \"just like the governing body, have a duty to respect the rule of law\". Her officials had now written to the prime minister and the lord chancellor's offices.",
      "Responding to Baroness Carr's comments, Badenoch said \"politicians must be able to discuss matters of crucial public importance in Parliament\" - and that such debate \"doesn't compromise the independence of the judiciary\".",
      "\"This is not just some legal loophole that can be closed, but requires a fundamental overhaul of our flawed human rights laws,\" she said in a statement on X.",
      "A government spokesperson said: \"Where the law is not working as we think it should be, the government will take action to tighten up the rules - and that is what we are doing\".",
      "\"As a former chief prosecutor, the prime minister's respect for the judiciary, the role they play in our democracy and the rule of law is beyond question,\" the statement added.",
      "Making a wider point about concerns over the safety of judges, Baroness Carr said it was \"not acceptable for judges to be the subject of personal attacks for doing no more than their jobs\".",
      "\"Their job is to find the facts on the evidence before them and apply the law as it stands to those facts,\" she told reporters. \"If they get it wrong, the protection is a challenge on appeal. If the legislation is wrong, it is Parliament's prerogative to legislate.\"",
      "\"It is really dangerous to make any criticism of a judgment without a full understanding of the facts and the law,\" the lady chief justice said - adding that judges are \"public servants acting independently\" and that, \"frankly, judges deserve better\"."

    "summary": "The independent review says successive governments made \"knee jerk\" decisions to issue longer prison sentences.",
    "story": [
      "Successive governments trying to look \"tough on crime\" have driven the rising prison population which forced the early release of thousands of inmates last year, a review suggests.",
      "The report by the Independent Sentencing Review found governments over the past 25 years jailed more criminals, despite evidence it does not prevent re-offending.",
      "The review, led by former lord chancellor David Gauke, also found there were \"knee-jerk\" decisions to issue longer sentences in an effort to show government action.",
      "Mr Gauke warned that unless radical changes are made this year, prisons in England and Wales could run out of cells again by spring 2026.",
      "More prisoners freed early to ease overcrowding",
      "More prisoners freed early to ease overcrowding",
      "\"It's only a matter of time before, once again, prison numbers will exceed capacity,\" Mr Gauke told the BBC's Radio 4 Today programme.",
      "England and Wales has one of the highest prison population rates in western Europe, according to the report.",
      "Despite an overall decline in crime since the mid-1990s, England and Wales' prison population has almost doubled between 1993 and 2012, the review found, while reoffending has stayed stubbornly high.",
      "The government launched an early prisoner release scheme in September last year as part of an emergency plan to tackle overcrowding.",
      "It saw eligible prisoners serving more than five years automatically released after only 40% of their fixed-term sentence, rather than the usual 50%.",
      "The government then commissioned the report to examine how prisons became so full, and to consider ways to ease overcrowding by giving tougher punishments outside of prison. The panel's recommendations are due in spring.",
      "The review found that the early release scheme freed up enough spare cells for newly-remanded or convicted criminals, but that headroom will disappear by next year, even with more prison places being built.",
      "Mr Gauke said: \"Last year we were confronted with the consequences of decades of haphazard policy making and underinvestment in the criminal justice system - bringing it to the brink of collapse.",
      "\"For too long politicians have operated in a vacuum, increasing sentencing for individual crimes without considering the knock-on impact on the wider system.\"",
      "He said the system had failed victims, and that while punishment would always be a central aim of the criminal justice system, \"prison is not the only form of punishment\".",
      "Probation: 'Too few staff, with too little experience, managing too many offenders'",
      "Early release of hundreds of prisoners in Scotland begins",
      "Figures show that almost six out of 10 offenders jailed for less than a year go on to break the law again - a cycle of criminality that had been feeding more and more people into the prison population.",
      "In contrast, fewer community sentences have been handed out by courts and there has been decades of under-investment in probation teams, who are charged with offenders in the community, and proven rehabilitation programmes.",
      "As a consequence, more money has been spent on emergency overcrowding measures, including building more jails, rather than on punishment in the community and cheaper programmes aimed at stopping offending in the first place.",
      "Mr Gauke's review found that the prison population began to balloon as Labour and Conservative administrations competed to introduce tougher and tougher measures aimed at jailing people.",
      "\"Over the last 25 years, the political landscape has been increasingly dominated by a 'tough on crime' narrative that has focused on longer imprisonment. In tandem, politicians have implemented legislative and policy changes which have inflated sentencing,\" it reads.",
      "Mr Gauke told the BBC that the last 30 years have seen \"something of a bidding war between political parties as to who is prepared to lengthen sentences the most\".",
      "\"As a consequence, we've seen our prison population essentially double over that time,\" he added.",

      "The UK's largest water and waste company was set to run out of cash by the end of March and would have likely been placed into temporary nationalisation to keep services running.",
      "The court decision on Tuesday has given Thames breathing space to undergo a major restructuring, but the future of the company remains uncertain as it struggles with \u00a319bn worth of debt and the ruling is set to be appealed.",
      "Thames has faced heavy criticism over its performance in recent years following a series of sewage discharges and leaks.",
      "The supplier serves about a quarter of the UK's population, mostly across London and parts of southern England, and employs 8,000 people.",
      "Since the dire state of the company's finances first emerged about 18 months ago, the government has been on standby to put Thames into special administration.",
      "Regardless of what happens to the company in the future, water supplies and waste services to households will continue as normal.",
      "The water regulator, Ofwat, said Thames Water remained \"subject to our turnaround oversight regime and safeguards are in place to ensure that services to customers are protected\".",
      "Thames has said the \u00a33bn in emergency funding will give it the space needed to complete a restructuring of its debts and attract a cash injection from prospective new investors.",
      "But the proposals had to be approved by the High Court after a group of Thames Water's creditors opposed it, arguing that the 9.75% interest rate on the loan was too costly.",
      "In approving the lifeline, Mr Justice Leech ruled that the \"relevant alternative\" to the company's plan being approved was temporary nationalisation, known as a Special Administration Regime.",

      "The Thames Water creditors in favour of the company's plan said the judgement was a \"positive step towards efforts to deliver a highly complex operational turnaround and restructuring\" and avoided \"billions in additional costs on UK taxpayers\".",
      "However, the group of creditors opposed to the deal confirmed they would appeal against the court's decision, after the judge granted them permission to do so.",
      "The group had argued an alternative \"B plan\" would provide the company with the same funding but on better terms and said it was \"disappointed\" by the ruling.",
      "\"Having this judgement reviewed by the Court of Appeal is essential against the backdrop of predatory lending to an essential utility with a clear public interest,\" a spokesperson said.",

      "Henry Swithinbank, policy and advocacy manager at environmental charity Surfers Against Sewage, said the cash lifeline was a \"sticking plaster that will allow Thames Water to limp along until it requires another bailout\".",
      "Thames Water's problems have been blamed on a combination of poor historical regulation, actions by shareholders, climate change and management failure.",
      "Some have argued Thames should have been allowed to collapse and be nationalised due to it being the architect of its own misfortune. Previous owners loaded the company with debt and took out big dividends.",
      "But others, including water companies, have argued that a growing population and the challenges of a changing climate mean bills need to be higher and were kept at lower levels for too long.",
      "The first \u00a31.5bn of the rescue loans to Thames Water will see the company through to the autumn.",

      "The company was set to repay \u00a3200m worth of debt due in March, but following the court ruling, all its debt repayments have been extended by two years.",
      "Last week, Thames launched an appeal to allow it to increase bills by more than the regulator had granted.",

      "Five other water companies - Anglian Water, Northumbrian Water, Southern Water, and Wessex Water along with water-only company South East Water - have also said they will appeal to allow them to increase bills beyond Ofwat's cap.",

    "story": [
      "UK Special Forces command rejected resettlement applications from more than 2,000 Afghan commandos who had shown credible evidence of service in units that fought alongside the SAS and SBS, the Ministry of Defence has confirmed for the first time.",
      "UK Special Forces officers appear to have rejected every application from a former Afghan commando referred to them for sponsorship, despite the Afghan units having fought with the British on life-threatening missions against the Taliban.",
      "The MoD had previously denied there was a blanket policy to reject members of the units - known as the Triples - but the BBC has not been able to find any evidence that UK Special Forces (UKSF) supported any resettlement applications.",
      "Asked if UKSF had supported any applications, the MoD declined to answer the question.",
      "The Triples - so-called because their designations were CF 333 and ATF 444 - were set up, trained, and paid by UK Special Forces and supported the SAS and SBS on operations in Afghanistan. When the country fell to the Taliban in 2021, they were judged to be in grave danger of reprisal and were entitled to apply for resettlement to the UK.",
      "The rejection of their applications was controversial because it came at a time when a public inquiry in the UK was investigating allegations that British Special Forces had committed war crimes on operations in Afghanistan where the Triples were present.",
      "The inquiry has the power to compel witnesses who are in the UK, but not non-UK nationals who are overseas. If resettled, former members of the Triples could be compelled by the inquiry to provide potentially significant evidence.",
      "BBC Panorama revealed last year that UK Special Forces command had been given veto power over their resettlement applications and denied them asylum in Britain. The revelation caused a wave of anger among some former members of the SAS and others who served with the Afghan units.",
      "The MoD initially denied the existence of the veto, suggesting that the BBC's reporting had been inaccurate, but then-Defence Minister Andrew Murrison was later forced to tell the House of Commons the government had misled parliament in its denials.",
      "The confirmation of the more than 2,000 rejections emerged in court hearings earlier this month during a legal challenge brought by a former member of the Triples. Lawyers for the MoD applied for a restriction order which temporarily prevented the BBC from reporting on the relevant parts of the proceedings, before withdrawing their application last week under challenge.",
      "Documents disclosed in court also showed that at the same time the MoD was denying the existence of the veto, it already knew that every rejection decision made by UK Special Forces was potentially unsound and would have to be independently reviewed.",

      "Mike Martin MP, a member of the defence select committee and former British Army officer who served in Afghanistan, told the BBC the rejections were \"extremely concerning\".",
      "\"There is the appearance that UK Special Forces blocked the Afghan special forces applications because they were witnesses to the alleged UK war crimes currently being investigated in the Afghan inquiry,\" Martin said.",
      "\"If the MoD is unable to offer any explanation, then the matter should be included in the inquiry,\" he added.",
      "Johnny Mercer, the former Conservative MP for Plymouth Moor View, who served alongside the SBS in Afghanistan, testified to the Afghan inquiry that he had spoken to former members of the Triples and heard \"horrific\" allegations of murder by UK Special Forces.",
      "Mercer said it was \"very clear to me that there is a pool of evidence that exists within the Afghan [special forces] community that are now in the United Kingdom that should contribute to this Inquiry\".",
      "The MoD began a review last year of all 2,022 resettlement applications referred to and rejected by UK Special Forces. All contained what MoD caseworkers on the resettlement scheme regarded as \"credible\" evidence of service with the Triples units.",
      "The government said at the time that the review would take 12 weeks, but more than a year later it has yet to be completed. Some rejections have already been overturned, allowing former Triples to come to the UK. But the MoD has refused to inform the Afghan commandos whether they are in scope of the review or if their rejections were upheld, unless they write to the MoD.",
      "Many are in hiding in Afghanistan, making it difficult to obtain legal representation or pro-actively contact the MoD. Dozens have reportedly been beaten, tortured, or killed by the Taliban since the group regained control of the country.",
      "\"Although decisions have been overturned, it's too late for some people,\" said a former Triples officer. \"The delays have caused a lot of problems. People have been captured by the Taliban or lost their lives,\" he said.",
      "The officer said that the Afghan commandos worked alongside British Special Forces \"like brothers\" and felt \"betrayed\" by the widespread rejections.",
      "\"If Special Forces made these rejections they should say why. They should have to answer,\" he said.",
      "The MoD is now facing a legal challenge to aspects of the review, including the decision not to inform applicants whether their case is being reviewed or disclose the criteria used to select those in scope.",
      "The legal challenge is being brought by a former senior member of the Triples who is now in the UK, on behalf of commandos still in Afghanistan.",
      "\"Our client's focus is on his soldiers left behind in Afghanistan, some of whom have been killed while they wait for these heavily delayed protection decisions,\" said Dan Carey, a partner at the law firm Deighton Pierce Glynn.",
      "\"As things stand they have a right to request a reassessment of a decision they haven't even been told about. And there are others who think they are part of the Triples Review when the secret criteria would tell them that their cases aren't even being looked at.\"",
      "Lawyers acting for the former member of the Triples also heavily criticised the level of disclosure in the case by the MoD, which has not handed over any documentation from within UK Special Forces or government records about the decision-making process that led to the rejections.",
      "In court filings, they criticised the \"total inadequacy\" of the MoD's disclosure, calling it an \"an obvious failure to comply with the duty of candour and to provide necessary explanation\" of the process.",
      "New evidence that emerged last week in court also showed that the MoD appeared to have rejected out of hand some applicants who served with UK Special Forces in Afghanistan after 2014 - when Britain's conventional armed forces left Helmand province - without even referring them to UK Special Forces headquarters for sponsorship.",
      "The MoD has not explained the reasoning behind the policy, which was kept secret from applicants. A spokesperson for the MoD said that after 2014 the UK's role \"evolved from combat operations to primarily training, advising and assisting CF 333, who were under the command of the Afghan Ministry of Interior\".",
      "But officers who served with UK Special Forces told the BBC that the Triples continued to support British-led operations after 2014.",
      "\"Saying the Triples didn't support UK Special Forces operations after 2014 isn't true at all,\" said former officer who served with UKSF.",
      "\"We had a squadron of CF 333 with us. We worked closely together. These were NATO targets, UK planned operations,\" he said.",

    "story": [
      "The UK and EU countries must spend more on defence, with Europe facing an \"existential question\" even in the event of a negotiated peace in Ukraine, David Lammy has said.",
      "The foreign secretary told the Munich Security Conference \"Putin will not go away\", and that, while it was positive 23 Nato countries were now spending at least 2% of their GDP on defence, \"we all know we have to go upward\".",
      "He said the UK was \"absolutely\" committed to spending 2.5% and would set out a \"pathway\" to achieving that goal in a few months' time.",
      "Lammy's comments come after US Vice-President JD Vance told the conference on Friday that Europe must \"step up in a big way to provide for its own defence\".",
      "In his address, Vance said it was his belief the greatest threat facing Europe was not from Russia or China but \"from within\".",
      "He said many European governments, including the UK's, had retreated from their values and ignored issues such as migration and free speech.",
      "Speaking on Saturday during a panel discussion on European security, Lammy told the audience that successive US presidents had asked Nato members to increase defence spending and emphasised the importance of continued support for Ukraine.",
      "Appearing alongside his counterparts from France, Germany and Poland, Lammy said: \"There is a question for Europe. If we look at GDP combined, it's about 0.01% that we are spending on that fight for Ukraine.",
      "\"We know this is the frontline, not just for Ukraine, but for Europe. We know too that even when we get to a negotiated peace, Putin will not go away. So this is an existential question for Europe.\"",
      "He said that he understood why the US was now focusing on its security interests in the Pacific, where China is a major power both economically and militarily.",

      "\"We recognise that pacing threat as the United States bears down on that issue. So of course Europe has to do more.\"",
      "Earlier, in an article for The Telegraph, Lammy and Defence Secretary John Healey said the West had done too little in the past when Russia first invaded Ukraine in 2014.",
      "They said the UK and Europe now needed to \"do more together\" to \"share the burden\" of security across the continent.",

      "Zelensky has proposed what he described as an \"army of Europe\" to secure the continent.",
      "He told the conference on Saturday: \"As we fight this war and lay the groundwork for peace and security, we must build the armed forces of Europe so that Europe's future depends only on Europeans, and decisions about Europe are made in Europe.\"",
      "He added: \"Europe needs a single voice, not a dozen different ones.\"",
      "Asked during the panel discussion about the security guarantees being considered, Lammy said a long-term military and financial partnership might be best.",
      "\"The UK has just signed a 100-year partnership with Ukraine and I would encourage Donald Trump, and the Ukrainians, to look very carefully at a deepening partnership over the next generations,\" he said.",
      "\"Why? Because the best deal, and the best security guarantee, is binding US industry, business and defence capability into their future.",
      "\"That is what will make Putin sit up and pay attention and that is what is attractive to a US president who knows how to get a good deal.\"",
      "Among the other possible measures mentioned by experts is the deployment of a peacekeeping mission to Ukraine.",
      "Lord Dannatt, who was head of the British Army from 2006 to 2009, estimated that around 100,000 soldiers would be needed for such a mission and that the UK might need to contribute 40,000 of them.",

    "story": [
      "Since BBC News reported on Thursday that Rachel Reeves had exaggerated her online CV and had been investigated over her use of expenses while working at Halifax Bank of Scotland (HBOS), Labour colleagues have mounted a robust defence of the chancellor.",
      "Sir Keir Starmer said she had \"dealt with any issues that arise\" from the questions about her CV, and Health Secretary Wes Streeting told BBC Newsnight that she was doing a \"brilliant and difficult job\".",

      "Here we examine the key Labour responses and look at the evidence that supports our journalism.",
      "What did we reveal about Reeves's expenses?",
      "The BBC News investigation revealed that concerns were raised about Reeves's expenses while working at HBOS between 2006 and 2009.",
      "A detailed six-page whistleblowing complaint was submitted, with dozens of pages of supporting documents including emails, receipts and memos.",
      "It accused Reeves and two other managers, one of whom was her boss, of using the bank's money to \"fund a lifestyle\", with spending on events, taxis and gifts, including for each other.",
      "We have seen these documents and spoken to more than 20 people, many of whom were former colleagues.",
      "The chancellor and her expenses before she became an MP",
      "The chancellor and her expenses before she became an MP",
      "What happened to the whistleblower's complaint?",
      "The complaint led to an internal investigation by the bank's risk department.",
      "This was passed to internal audit, which reviewed the allegations and concluded that they were substantiated and there appeared to be evidence of wrongdoing by Reeves and her two colleagues, according to a senior source with direct knowledge of the investigation.",
      "What we have not been able to establish is what happened next and whether the bank ever reached a formal conclusion.",
      "How are Labour defending Reeves?",
      "Reeves has said she was not aware of an investigation or issue with her expenses and said she left the bank on good terms.",
      "She said her expenses had always been signed off in the proper way. The person who signed off her expenses, her boss, was also subject to the internal investigation.",
      "Other Labour figures have criticised BBC News's reporting on the story, with two MPs repeating similar attacks.",
      "On Friday, Science Secretary Peter Kyle told BBC Radio 4's Today programme that the reporting was \"inaccurate\".",
      "Both he and Siobhain McDonagh, a Labour MP who appeared on BBC's Politics Live on Thursday, raised comments by a former HR manager, Jane Wayper - which, they said, disproved the BBC News's story.",
      "What did the HR manager say?",
      "Wayper spoke to the BBC after being given permission to do so by Reeves's team.",
      "She provided an on-the-record statement which said she \"would have been made aware of any investigation which concluded there was a case to answer\" on the basis that she \"would have been required to organise and oversee a disciplinary process\".",
      "However, the BBC has not reported that the case reached a formal conclusion, or that there was disciplinary action.",
      "Kyle incorrectly claimed that the quote had not been included in our report - but it had been in the article since it was first published on Thursday morning.",
      "He also incorrectly referred to Wayper as the head of HR at the bank.",
      "In reality she was an HR business partner working in the department where Reeves worked.",
      "What has Reeves said?",
      "On Friday, Reeves was asked about the expenses claims directly. She said: \"No-one ever raised any concerns about my expenses when I worked for Halifax Bank of Scotland.\"",
      "She said her expenses had been \"signed off in the proper way\" and \"no issues were ever raised\" during her time at the bank.",
      "Her expenses were signed off by her manager, who was also one of the three employees who were the subject of the expenses probe.",
      "Reeves left the bank in May 2009, as did her boss. The other senior manager was on sick leave in May and never returned to work at the bank.",
      "There is no suggestion any of the departures were linked to the investigation or spending issues and a spokesman for Reeves said the chancellor left the bank on good terms.",
      "What has BBC News established about her LinkedIn CV?",
      "Reeves has accepted the findings of another part of our investigation, this time over her CV.",
      "We established that the chancellor had exaggerated the length of time she worked at the Bank of England.",
      "Reeves has often said she spent the \"best part of a decade\" working at the bank when setting out her credentials to run the economy to voters.",

      "The BBC has now established that Reeves left the Bank of England in March 2006, meaning the time she spent working there amounts to five and a half years.",

      "Reeves's team vigorously denied the allegations.",
      "However, Labour's imminent victory in last summer's general election prompted a post on a private Facebook group for former HBOS employees that BBC News has seen asking if anyone remembered Reeves.",
      "One former employee replied: \"the expenses dept certainly do!\"",
      "Several others made reference to Reeves being investigated over her expenses spending.",

      "A detailed six-page whistleblowing complaint and dozens of pages of attached evidence, which we have seen, raised concerns that the three managers were using the bank's money to \"fund a lifestyle\" with allegedly inappropriate spending on dinners, events, taxis and gifts, including for each other.",
      "We have not been able to establish what the final outcome of the investigation was. Indeed it may not have concluded.",
      "But the initial part of the investigation, which was conducted by Internal Audit at the request of the bank's risk department, found that the three managers appeared to have broken the rules and the whistleblower's allegations were substantiated, according to a senior source with knowledge of the investigation.",
      "A spokesman for Reeves said the Chancellor had no knowledge of the investigation, always complied with expenses rules and left the bank on good terms.",
      "Banking career",
      "Reeves was in her 20s and trying to become an MP when she took up a job at Halifax Bank of Scotland in West Yorkshire in 2006.",
      "The role required her to move north from London, where she had unsuccessfully stood as Labour's parliamentary candidate in what had been a safe Conservative seat.",
      "She initially worked in the mortgage department, but in late 2007 moved to become Head of Business Planning in the Customer Relations department, which handled complaints.",
      "Her career at HBOS coincided with what would prove to be a tumultuous time for the bank.",
      "The global financial crisis which began in late summer of 2007 would force the sector to embark on a massive programme of job cuts and cost savings.",
      "In September 2008, HBOS itself came close to collapse, requiring a government-brokered takeover by Lloyds and an emergency bailout which would total \u00a320.5bn of taxpayers' money.",
      "It was shortly after this near-collapse, by early 2009, that a whistleblower from her department raised concerns about the spending habits of Reeves and two other managers, one of whom was Reeves's boss.",

      "Rachel Reeves: Playing Labour's first big gambit",
      "Before this, in late 2008, a memo was circulated to Reeves and others which called for tighter cost control in the department.",
      "Written by a planning and strategy manager, the document, \"Financial Risk Control within Customer Relations\", raised concerns about \"spending on travel\" and on corporate spending cards, including Motivation cards which were used to reward staff.",
      "It laid out proposals to \"improve cost controls\" which included monthly discussions with Reeves and another of the senior managers who the whistleblower claimed had mis-used expenses to \"give visibility of claims, invoices, Thanks card use and reports\".",
      "Separately, Reeves was emailed in mid-December 2008 about proposals for a presentation setting out how much had been spent on Motivation cards, recognising top performers and on taxi travel, to \"focus attention on particular aspects of travel that are costly and perhaps need more consideration\".",
      "Reeves replied to say that she was not sure a \"huge analysis\" was needed and she wanted to see the papers before they went any further.",
      "Whistleblower complaint and investigation",
      "The whistleblower's complaint submitted by early 2009 was a six-page document laying out a range of concerns about an alleged spending culture in the Customer Relations department.",
      "It focused on the behaviour of three individuals: Reeves, Reeves's boss, and another senior manager in the department. Reeves's boss, who we are not naming, was responsible for signing off the expenses of the other two managers.",
      "The report and attached receipts and other documents seen by BBC News show Reeves was accused of spending hundreds of pounds on handbags, perfume, earrings and wine for colleagues, including one gift for her boss. Concern was also expressed about her spending on taxis and on a Christmas party. The whistleblower believed the spending to be excessive.",
      "After a call to the whistleblowing hotline, the whistleblower was instructed to hand in a physical copy of their report and supporting evidence, two sources said.",
      "A separate source, who contacted BBC News themselves in the wake of an article on the furore around Reeves's CV last year, was also aware that someone had blown the whistle on Reeves and another colleague.",
      "The report was passed to the bank's risk department and, at their request, was taken on by the Internal Audit department.",
      "A source who worked in risk at the bank told us: \"Given the nature of the allegations \u2013 claiming expenses for things you wouldn't normally claim expenses for \u2013 and the relative seniority of the individuals, the matter was referred for investigation by a team outside of that department.\"",
      "The Internal Audit department, which had access to expenses claims and sign-offs, then assessed the complaint and supporting documents, according to two sources.",
      "It found that there was evidence of apparent wrongdoing by the three senior managers including Reeves, a senior source with direct knowledge of the investigation told BBC News.",
      "Internal Audit completed its involvement in the investigation and passed its findings to an investigative part of the Risk department in around April 2009. The normal process would then have been for the managers to be interviewed about the allegations. There would then be an assessment of potential disciplinary action if necessary.",
      "However it does not appear that this next interview stage took place, or that the investigation ever reached a formal conclusion. Reeves insisted she was never interviewed, as did her boss, who said she was \"not aware of an expenses probe and my departure was not related to any alleged investigation\". The other senior manager declined to comment.",
      "There is no evidence of which we are aware that the bank's internal investigation was completed, or that there was ever a concluding finding of any wrongdoing.",
      "Reeves left the bank in May 2009, as did her boss. The other senior manager was on sick leave in May and never returned to work at the bank.",
      "There is no suggestion any of the departures were linked to the investigation or spending issues and a spokesman for Reeves said the Chancellor left the bank on good terms.",
      "They also provided a statement from the lawyer who provided legal advice on the compromise agreement - a voluntary legal document ending an employee's employment - she signed on her departure.",
      "He said it was a \"standard-style agreement adopted by the company when a mutually agreed exit was made during the bank's restructure\".",
      "\"Absolutely no allegations of wrongdoing or misconduct were mentioned by the HBOS HR team during this process,\" he said.",
      "Expenses allegations",
      "What lay behind the whistleblower's complaint and the grumbles of other colleagues was unhappiness relating to several different areas of spending.",
      "One concern was the use of bank payment cards to pay for Christmas and birthday gifts.",
      "\"A culture developed among senior managers in Customer Relations where gifts were given freely to direct reports  - both upwards and downwards,\" one former colleague of Reeves claimed.",
      "\"[They had] a very cavalier attitude regarding the budget in the department.\"",
      "Reeves and the other senior managers had both a corporate credit card and another payment card known as a 'Motivation' or 'Thanks' card.",
      "The Motivation card was intended to be used to reward high-performers for good work.",
      "There was guidance about its use. In February 2008 a memo instructed HBOS employees on the correct use of Motivation cards, which were widely used within the Customer Relations department.",
      "It stated that the cards were to be used to \"reward/acknowledge colleagues who have gone the extra mile\".",
      "Suggested gifts included \"chocolates, flowers, wine, vouchers or you could simply log on and send a free e-card to say 'Thanks' for a job well done\", the memo said.",
      "It warned that managers would be \"responsible for all transactions on your card and will be held accountable if spending on your statement cannot be verified\".",
      "Spending in this area was scrutinised because the company incurred tax on it.",
      "The memo doesn't explicitly prohibit Christmas and birthday gifts.",
      "But 11 former employees told us they had never heard of colleagues being bought birthday gifts with the bank's money, and believed that doing so was in breach of the rules. Several said any birthday gifts were bought with their own money.",
      "However, one ex-staff member, Jane Wayper, a former HR business partner who was given permission to speak to us by Reeves's team, claimed that \"birthday gifts and Christmas presents could be purchased using Motivation cards\" and \"staff were encouraged to do so for their teams\".",
      "Reeves bought birthday presents for colleagues with HBOS's money throughout her time in Customer Relations, receipts show, with purchases including wine and cosmetics. Some were bought using a Motivation card, while others were reimbursed through an expenses claim.",
      "She also spent \u00a3152 on a handbag and perfume as a present for her boss using the bank's money, according to the whistleblower's report. The present was a joint gift from Reeves and one of the other managers who was later investigated alongside her.",
      "And she bought earrings as a present for her PA, which she claimed back on expenses.",
      "Her PA, Linda Barrowclough, said she had received Christmas and birthday gifts from Reeves but had assumed they were \"personal gifts [and] they'd have come out of her own pocket\".",
      "Reeves also used her Motivation card to spend more than \u00a3400 on a leaving meal for a colleague, which the whistleblowing complaint claimed was not a permitted use.",
      "Christmas gifts",
      "The situation around Christmas gifts, which Reeves also bought for her PA and others, was more complicated.",
      "That's because, according to internal bank guidance we have seen, these could be bought on expenses providing they were small gifts of \u00a325 or less and they were not bought using the Motivation card.",
      "The \u00a325 limit was based on tax advice as anything more substantial would attract tax.",
      "It appeared to her colleagues that Reeves had broken these rules.",
      "But there does appear to have been confusion about the policy. We have also seen emails showing that Reeves was encouraged by her boss to buy more expensive Christmas presents, and to pay for them with her Motivation card.",
      "In late October 2008, Reeves's manager wrote that \"after checking with other departments, it looks like the standard practice of buying\u202fChristmas\u202fgifts for direct reports using motivation bank will continue this year\", emails seen by the BBC show.",
      "She suggested spending \u00a350 to \u00a375 per person on the presents.",
      "A reminder titled \"further clarity\" about how to buy Christmas gifts and how much to spend was circulated by another HBOS employee in early December, emails show.",
      "Reeves and the other managers who were later investigated were all among the recipients of this email confirming the rules on Christmas gifts.",
      "While seasonal gifts, such as at Christmas, were allowed, the managers were explicitly told they could not use Motivation cards for these purchases. The cost of these \"trivial\" gifts was also not allowed to exceed \u00a325, in line with\u202fHMRC guidance, the email said.",
      "This is because rewards for performance at work are taxable whereas seasonal gifts such as those given for Christmas, providing they are not too costly, are exempt.",
      "Replying to the email, Reeves wrote that she didn't understand why the \"goal posts are shifting\" and said she had already ordered and paid for her presents using \"Motivation Bank/Thanks, and I do not intend to cancel them,\" claiming this would cost more time and money.",
      "A colleague responsible for finance acknowledged that the message on paying for Christmas gifts hadn't always been clear but said: \"I don't believe that the goalposts are being moved.\"",
      "Receipts show that gifts bought by Reeves at Christmas 2008 included a \u00a349 handbag for her PA, while she herself received \u00a355 worth of wine from her boss.",
      "Open secret?",
      "There was a widespread belief at the bank that there had been an expenses investigation into Reeves and two colleagues.",
      "But Reeves has said that she has no recollection of being investigated or having questions raised over her expenses.",
      "A spokesman for Reeves said she was \"proud of the work she did at HBOS\" and was not aware of the claims about her expenses until approached by the BBC.",
      "\"She was not aware of an investigation nor was she interviewed, and she did not face any disciplinary action on this or any other matters. All expenses were submitted and signed off in the proper way,\" she said.",
      "The spokesman also said Reeves left in 2009 \"on good terms and received a severance payment, including her full notice pay and bonus\".",
      "\"HBOS allowed her to keep a company car for six months after she left and she was given a favourable reference.\"",
      "Reeves's team put forward several former HBOS employees for interview who they said corroborated her account that she had not been investigated.",
      "One said she hadn't seen evidence of senior managers misusing expenses and the bank had controls to prevent it but she left in February 2008, more than a year before Reeves departed. She also said that she had never heard of giving birthday and Christmas gifts at HBOS's expense as being part of the bank's policies.",
      "Another, Jane Wayper, the former HR business partner, said in a statement that she didn't recognise the accusations against Reeves and \"would have been aware of any investigation which concluded there was a case to answer\" as she would have been involved in the disciplinary process.",
      "She said there was \"extensive oversight of all expenses policies\" and claimed that \"birthday gifts and Christmas presents could be purchased using Motivation cards\". But this is at odds with a document seen by BBC News and the testimony of 11 sources we have spoken to.",
      "Many of Reeves' former HBOS colleagues were worried about the consequences of sharing confidential information with BBC News but believe it is in the public interest for what happened, and their concerns about the now-Chancellor's spending of the bank's money, to be reported.",
      "But, given their concerns about speaking out publicly, we have agreed not to name them.",
      "A Downing Street spokesman said the prime minister had no concerns about Reeves's conduct.",
      "Asked whether Sir Keir Starmer still thought the Chancellor had integrity after she updated her career history on LinkedIn, his official spokesman said: \"Yes. The Chancellor and the prime minister are working hand in hand to deliver on the priorities, the plan for change, and to deliver the higher growth and the improvements in living standards that the country needs.\"",
      "The Number 10 official added that the chancellor had gone through the declaration process, which all members of Cabinet go through, when asked if she disclosed that there had been an investigation into her expenses before she was an MP.",
      "Conservative leader Kemi Badenoch said the investigation raised questions for the chancellor.",
      "She posted on X: \"Keir Starmer said 'restoring trust in politics is the great test of our era'. Until she [Reeves] comes clean - not just about her CV but about the circumstances in which she left HBOS, no one will take him seriously.\"",
      "The investigation at HBOS was not the last time Reeves would face scrutiny over her expenses.",
      "In 2015, it emerged that she was among 19 MPs who had had their official credit cards suspended by the parliamentary expenses watchdog after failing to show their spending was valid.",
      "Reeves owed more than \u00a34,000 in spending at the time when her card was blocked. She subsequently cleared her debt.",

      "Reeves was born in south-east London in 1979, just months before Margaret Thatcher became prime minister at a time of immense social and economic change.",
      "She has previously told the BBC her mother would tick off items on a bank statement against receipts while sitting at the kitchen table: \"We weren't poor, but we didn't have money to waste.\"",
      "Her parents separated when she was at primary school, and she and younger sister Ellie, also a Labour MP, were shuttled between separate homes.",
      "During the school holidays, the sisters would spend time with their grandparents in the Northamptonshire town of Kettering.",
      "They would be taken to do the rounds of relatives' houses, who would give them a 20p or 50p piece each. At the end of their week, they were taken to the local toy shop to choose their goodies. While Ellie would spend all her cash, the young Rachel would allow herself a smaller treat and save most of the money.",
      "Decades later, Chancellor Reeves would say that kind of restraint defines her, and she has very much modelled herself on Gordon Brown\u2019s \"prudence\" in the lead-up to Labour\u2019s 1997 election win.",
      "Chess talent",
      "Reeves played chess from an early age, with her father teaching her the key moves. She became a national under-14 champion, and would \"quietly thrash\" any boys who might think they were in for an easy game, according to Ellie.",
      "She has credited chess with teaching her \"to think ahead, to plan a strategy\".",
      "A keen flute player, she took her music GCSE a year early at Beckenham's Cator Park School for Girls, a comprehensive, and would go on to gain four A grades at A-level.",
      "Seeing the extent of cuts at her school, where the library had been turned into a classroom and the sixth form consisted of \"two pre-fab huts in the playground\", she has said she was politicised by her own experience of public services. At the age of 16, she joined the Labour Party.",
      "She went on to study Philosophy, Politics and Economics at Oxford University. As a student, she would host others before college discos, blasting out Destiny's Child songs and dressing up in her room.",
      "Despite her serious demeanour, colleagues and friends have suggested the Labour MP's public persona does not reflect her human side, including a loud laugh and a deep love of Beyonc\u00e9 tracks.",

      "CVs and expenses",
      "Before becoming MP for Leeds West in 2010, Reeves moved to the city and spent time working there for the retail arm of Halifax Bank of Scotland.",
      "Her career at HBOS has now come under scrutiny, after the BBC revealed Reeves and two colleagues were the subject of an expenses probe while she was a senior manager at the bank.",
      "The initial stage of the HBOS investigation found that a whistleblower's complaint was substantiated, and the three employees appeared to have broken the rules, according to a senior source with direct knowledge of the probe.",
      "The BBC has not been able to establish what the final outcome of the investigation was and it might not have concluded.",
      "A spokesman for Reeves said the chancellor had no knowledge of the investigation, always complied with expenses rules and left the bank on good terms.",
      "Reeves has also faced questions about the accuracy of her online CV, which the BBC found exaggerated the length of time she worked at the Bank of England.",
      "A spokesman for Reeves confirmed that dates on her LinkedIn were inaccurate and blamed an administrative error by the team.",
      "Last year, her LinkedIn profile was also changed to describe her role at HBOS as \"Retail Banking\".",
      "It had previously claimed she worked as an economist at the bank, but she instead held a management role in the bank's customer relations department, which dealt with complaints.",
      "Plagiarism row",
      "Entering Parliament in 2010, an early mentor on economic policy was Alistair Darling - the last Labour chancellor, during the financial crisis.",
      "She quickly rose up the party's ranks, shadowing roles at the Treasury, Work and Pensions, and the Cabinet Office.",
      "Throughout Jeremy Corbyn's four and a half years as Labour leader, she remained on the backbenches because she felt she could not endorse his policies. Called a \"Red Tory\" by some in the party, she described this as a \"very unpleasant period\" in an interview with the BBC's Nick Robinson.",
      "A former editor of the BBC's Newsnight programme was forced to issue a written apology to Reeves after calling her \"boring snoring\" on social media in a post that was meant to be a private message.",
      "While she said the incident was \"deeply humiliating\", her key objective after Sir Keir Starmer appointed her shadow chancellor was to portray Labour as a steady, pro-business hand on the economy.",
      "In October 2023, she admitted she \"should have done better\" after it emerged some passages in her book, The Women Who Made Modern Economics, had been lifted from other sources without acknowledgment.",
      "She told the BBC some sentences \"were not properly referenced\" and this would be corrected in future reprints.",
      "'Iron chancellor'",
      "Last July, Reeves became the country's first female chancellor and quickly faced what she described as \"tough choices\".",
      "She claimed a \"black hole\" in the nation's finances meant winter fuel payments would have to be cut for millions of pensioners and National Insurance hiked for employers.",
      "Despite Labour's attempts to win over businesses during the election campaign, many were disappointed they bore the brunt of the \u00a340bn in tax rises announced in her first Budget.",
      "Before winning power, Reeves promised she would govern with \"iron discipline\" and bring stability to the public finances, leading to comparisons with Conservative \"Iron Chancellor\" Margaret Thatcher.",
      "Now Reeves is under pressure to deliver the economic growth promised by her party, while also ensuring people feel better off."

    "summary": "The world's frozen oceans keep the planet cool, but they currently have less ice than ever recorded before.",
    "story": [
      "The world's frozen oceans, which help to keep the planet cool, currently have less ice than ever previously recorded, satellite data shows.",
      "Sea-ice around the north and south poles acts like a giant mirror by reflecting much of the Sun's energy back into space.",
      "But as rising temperatures cause this bright layer to shrink, the dark ocean below can absorb more heat, warming the planet further.",
      "This latest sea-ice low appears to have been driven by a combination of warm air, warm seas and winds breaking apart the ice.",
      "Over the 5 days to 13 February, the combined extent of Arctic and Antarctic sea-ice was 15.76 million sq km (6.08 million sq miles), according to BBC analysis of data from the US National Snow and Ice Data Center (NSIDC).",
      "This breaks the previous 5-day record low of 15.93 million sq km (6.15 million sq miles) from January-February 2023.",
      "Arctic sea-ice is currently at its smallest recorded extent for the time of year, while Antarctic sea-ice is close to a new low in satellite records going back to the late 1970s.",
      "The decline of Arctic sea-ice in response to a warming planet is well-established. Its end-of-summer extent fell from an average of 7 million sq km in the 1980s to 4.5 million sq km in the 2010s.",
      "But until the mid-2010s, Antarctic sea-ice had been remarkably resilient, defying predictions that it would shrink.",
      "Since then, Antarctica has shown a series of very low sea-ice extents, although there is still lots of natural variability.",
      "\"Every year, every data point that we get suggests that this isn't a temporary shift, but something more permanent, like what we've seen in the Arctic,\" Walter Meier, senior research scientist at NSIDC, told BBC News.",
      "\"It is indicating that the Antarctic has moved into a new regime of lower ice extents.\"",
      "Antarctic sea-ice is relatively thin and mobile - being surrounded by ocean rather than continents like the Arctic - so it can be particularly sensitive to winds breaking up the ice.",
      "But warmer air and warmer waters look to have played a key role in this latest 2025 low, towards the end of the southern hemisphere summer.",
      "The Antarctic ice-shelves \u2013 ice flowing off the Antarctic continent, rather than sea-ice \u2013 appear to have had a particularly extreme season of surface melting, driven by high air temperatures.",
      "\"Atmospheric conditions in December and January looked like they were strongly promoting surface melting on the ice-shelves,\" said Tom Bracegirdle, research scientist at the British Antarctic Survey.",
      "\"That could also have contributed to what we've seen in Antarctic sea-ice, and ongoing ocean warming is setting the backdrop to all of this as well.\"",
      "Antarctica's record sea-ice low of 2023 would have been a one-in-2,000 year event without climate change, according to a recent study. Yet 2025 is not far from eclipsing it.",
      "At the other end of the planet, the Arctic should be reaching its annual maximum, with cold winter temperatures helping the oceans to freeze over.",
      "But current sea-ice extent is nearly 0.2 million sq km below anything previously recorded for the time of year, and has been tracking very low since late 2024.",
      "This is partly as a result of a late freeze-up of ice around Hudson Bay, with unusually warm ocean waters taking a long time to cool down.",
      "As well as warmer seas, some storms also disrupted ice around the Barents and Bering Seas, with the consequences likely amplified by long-term reductions in sea-ice thickness.",
      "\"A thinner ice cover is more responsive to weather [\u2026 so] weather events can have a stronger impact than they used to,\" said Julienne Stroeve, professor of polar observation and modelling at University College London.",
      "In recent weeks, Arctic sea-ice has moved even further below average. Temperatures around the north pole were about 20C above normal in early February, leading to melting conditions in places like Svalbard.",
      "This \"is quite astonishing\" for the time of year, according to Dr Bracegirdle.",
      "This very low winter extent doesn't necessarily mean the Arctic will end up with record conditions throughout 2025, as conditions can change quickly at the poles.",
      "But, with the Arctic warming nearly four times faster than the global average, declines over the coming decades are almost inevitable.",
      "The Arctic is expected to be essentially free of sea-ice at the end of its summer at least once before 2050, according to the UN's Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change. Some recent studies suggest it could happen sooner.",
      "Declining sea-ice at both poles not only has implications for local wildlife like polar bears and penguins, but also the Earth's climate.",
      "Polar sea-ice has already lost around 14% of its natural cooling effect since the early-to-mid 1980s, as the area of bright, reflective ice has declined, according to a study published last year.",
      "\"If you significantly change the sea ice distribution in and around Antarctica, you modify that part of the planet which is actually helping us fight against climate change,\" said Simon Josey, a professor at the National Oceanography Centre.",
      "Sea-ice also plays an important role in the great ocean conveyor, the mass movement of water that helps distribute heat around the planet and keeps places like the UK and north-west Europe relatively mild.",
      "\"If we see another strong winter loss [of Antarctic sea-ice], people are going to start to worry about what it's doing to the ocean circulation,\" said Prof Josey.",

    "summary": "The world's frozen oceans keep the planet cool, but they currently have less ice than ever recorded before.",
    "story": [
      "The world's frozen oceans, which help to keep the planet cool, currently have less ice than ever previously recorded, satellite data shows.",
      "Sea-ice around the north and south poles acts like a giant mirror by reflecting much of the Sun's energy back into space.",
      "But as rising temperatures cause this bright layer to shrink, the dark ocean below can absorb more heat, warming the planet further.",
      "This latest sea-ice low appears to have been driven by a combination of warm air, warm seas and winds breaking apart the ice.",
      "Over the 5 days to 13 February, the combined extent of Arctic and Antarctic sea-ice was 15.76 million sq km (6.08 million sq miles), according to BBC analysis of data from the US National Snow and Ice Data Center (NSIDC).",
      "This breaks the previous 5-day record low of 15.93 million sq km (6.15 million sq miles) from January-February 2023.",
      "Arctic sea-ice is currently at its smallest recorded extent for the time of year, while Antarctic sea-ice is close to a new low in satellite records going back to the late 1970s.",
      "The decline of Arctic sea-ice in response to a warming planet is well-established. Its end-of-summer extent fell from an average of 7 million sq km in the 1980s to 4.5 million sq km in the 2010s.",
      "But until the mid-2010s, Antarctic sea-ice had been remarkably resilient, defying predictions that it would shrink.",
      "Since then, Antarctica has shown a series of very low sea-ice extents, although there is still lots of natural variability.",
      "\"Every year, every data point that we get suggests that this isn't a temporary shift, but something more permanent, like what we've seen in the Arctic,\" Walter Meier, senior research scientist at NSIDC, told BBC News.",
      "\"It is indicating that the Antarctic has moved into a new regime of lower ice extents.\"",
      "Antarctic sea-ice is relatively thin and mobile - being surrounded by ocean rather than continents like the Arctic - so it can be particularly sensitive to winds breaking up the ice.",
      "But warmer air and warmer waters look to have played a key role in this latest 2025 low, towards the end of the southern hemisphere summer.",
      "The Antarctic ice-shelves \u2013 ice flowing off the Antarctic continent, rather than sea-ice \u2013 appear to have had a particularly extreme season of surface melting, driven by high air temperatures.",
      "\"Atmospheric conditions in December and January looked like they were strongly promoting surface melting on the ice-shelves,\" said Tom Bracegirdle, research scientist at the British Antarctic Survey.",
      "\"That could also have contributed to what we've seen in Antarctic sea-ice, and ongoing ocean warming is setting the backdrop to all of this as well.\"",
      "Antarctica's record sea-ice low of 2023 would have been a one-in-2,000 year event without climate change, according to a recent study. Yet 2025 is not far from eclipsing it.",
      "At the other end of the planet, the Arctic should be reaching its annual maximum, with cold winter temperatures helping the oceans to freeze over.",
      "But current sea-ice extent is nearly 0.2 million sq km below anything previously recorded for the time of year, and has been tracking very low since late 2024.",
      "This is partly as a result of a late freeze-up of ice around Hudson Bay, with unusually warm ocean waters taking a long time to cool down.",
      "As well as warmer seas, some storms also disrupted ice around the Barents and Bering Seas, with the consequences likely amplified by long-term reductions in sea-ice thickness.",
      "\"A thinner ice cover is more responsive to weather [\u2026 so] weather events can have a stronger impact than they used to,\" said Julienne Stroeve, professor of polar observation and modelling at University College London.",
      "In recent weeks, Arctic sea-ice has moved even further below average. Temperatures around the north pole were about 20C above normal in early February, leading to melting conditions in places like Svalbard.",
      "This \"is quite astonishing\" for the time of year, according to Dr Bracegirdle.",
      "This very low winter extent doesn't necessarily mean the Arctic will end up with record conditions throughout 2025, as conditions can change quickly at the poles.",
      "But, with the Arctic warming nearly four times faster than the global average, declines over the coming decades are almost inevitable.",
      "The Arctic is expected to be essentially free of sea-ice at the end of its summer at least once before 2050, according to the UN's Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change. Some recent studies suggest it could happen sooner.",
      "Declining sea-ice at both poles not only has implications for local wildlife like polar bears and penguins, but also the Earth's climate.",
      "Polar sea-ice has already lost around 14% of its natural cooling effect since the early-to-mid 1980s, as the area of bright, reflective ice has declined, according to a study published last year.",
      "\"If you significantly change the sea ice distribution in and around Antarctica, you modify that part of the planet which is actually helping us fight against climate change,\" said Simon Josey, a professor at the National Oceanography Centre.",
      "Sea-ice also plays an important role in the great ocean conveyor, the mass movement of water that helps distribute heat around the planet and keeps places like the UK and north-west Europe relatively mild.",
      "\"If we see another strong winter loss [of Antarctic sea-ice], people are going to start to worry about what it's doing to the ocean circulation,\" said Prof Josey.",

      "\"By allowing fingerprinting, Google has given itself - and the advertising industry it dominates - permission to use a form of tracking that people can't do much to stop,\" said Martin Thomson, distinguished engineer at Mozilla, a rival to Google.",
      "What is fingerprinting?",
      "Fingerprinting collects information about a person's device and browser and puts it together to create a profile of that person.",
      "The information is not explicitly collected in order to advertise to people, but it can be used to target specific ads based on that user's data.",
      "For example, a person's screen size or language settings are legitimately needed in order to display a website properly.",
      "But when that is combined with their time zone, browser type, battery level - and many other data points - it can create a unique combination of settings which makes it easier to work out who is using a web service.",
      "These details along with someone's IP address - the unique identifier used by internet devices - were previously prohibited by Google for ad targeting.",
      "Privacy campaigners say that unlike cookies, which are small files stored on a local device, users have little control over whether they send fingerprinting information to advertisers.",
      "\"By explicitly allowing a tracking technique that they previously described as incompatible with user control, Google highlights its ongoing prioritisation of profits over privacy,\" said Lena Cohen, staff technologist at the Electronic Frontier Foundation.",
      "\"The same tracking techniques that Google claims are essential for online advertising also expose individuals' sensitive information to data brokers, surveillance companies, and law enforcement,\" she added.",
      "'Irresponsible' change",
      "\"My argument would be that fingerprinting sits in a little bit of a grey area,\" says Pete Wallace, from advertising technology company GumGum.",
      "\"Should people feel comfortable staying in a grey area of privacy? I'd say no,\" he adds.",
      "GumGum, which has worked with the BBC on ad campaigns before, relies on something called contextual advertising, which uses other data points to target adverts to online users, such as keywords on the website they are on - rather than their personal data.",
      "Mr Wallace says allowing fingerprinting represents a shift in the industry.",
      "\"Fingerprinting feels like it's taking a much more business-centric approach to the use of consumer data rather than a consumer-centric approach,\" he says.",
      "\"This sort of flip-flopping is, in my opinion, detrimental to that route that the industry seemed to be taking towards this idea of really putting consumer privacy at the forefront.\"",
      "He adds that he hopes ad tech companies conclude \"that it isn't the appropriate way to use consumer data,\" but expects them to look at fingerprinting as an option in order to better target adverts.",
      "Advertising is the lifeblood of the internet business model, and allow many websites to be freely available to users without them having to directly pay to access them.",
      "But in return, users often have to give up private information about themselves so that advertisers can show them relevant adverts.",
      "The UK's data watchdog, the Information Commissioner's Office (ICO), says \"fingerprinting is not a fair means of tracking users online because it is likely to reduce people's choice and control over how their information is collected.\"",
      "In a blog post in December, the ICO's Executive Director of Regulatory Risk Stephen Almond wrote: \"We think this change is irresponsible.\"",
      "He added that advertisers and businesses which decide to use this technology will have to demonstrate how they are staying within data and privacy laws in the UK.",
      "\"Based on our understanding of how fingerprinting techniques are currently used for advertising this is a high bar to meet,\" he wrote.",
      "Google said in a statement: \"We look forward to further discussions with the ICO about this policy change.",
      "\"We know that data signals like IP addresses are already commonly used by others in the industry today, and Google has been using IP responsibly to fight fraud for years.\"",
      "A spokesperson added: \"We continue to give users choice whether to receive personalised ads, and will work across the industry to encourage responsible data use.\"",

      "This uses end-to-end encryption, where only the account holder can access the data stored. Apple itself cannot see it.",
      "It is an opt-in service, and not all users choose to activate it.",
      "The demand was first reported by the Washington Post, quoting sources familiar with the matter, and the BBC has spoken to similar contacts.",
      "The Home Office said then: \"We do not comment on operational matters, including for example confirming or denying the existence of any such notices.\"",
      "Apple declined to comment, but says on its website that it views privacy as a \"fundamental human right\".",
      "The order has been served by the Home Office under the Investigatory Powers Act, which compels firms to provide information to law enforcement agencies.",
      "Under the law, the demand by the Home Office cannot be made public.",
      "Senator Wyden and Congressman Biggs say agreeing to the request would \"undermine Americans' privacy rights and expose them to espionage by China, Russia and other adversaries\".",
      "They state that Apple does not make different versions of its encryption software for each country it operates in and, therefore, Apple customers in the UK will use the same software as Americans.",
      "\"If Apple is forced to build a backdoor in its products, that backdoor will end up in Americans' phones, tablets, and computers, undermining the security of Americans' data, as well as of the countless federal, state and local government agencies that entrust sensitive data to Apple products.\"",
      "The move by the UK government has stunned experts and worried privacy campaigners, with Privacy International calling it  an \"unprecedented attack\" on the private data of individuals.",
      "However the US government has previously asked Apple to break its encryption as part of criminal investigations.",
      "In 2016, Apple resisted a court order to write software which would allow US officials to access the iPhone of a gunman - though this was resolved after the FBI were able to successfully access the device.",
      "That same year, the US dropped a similar case after it was able to gain access by discovering the passcode of an alleged drug dealer.",
      "Similar cases have followed, including in 2020, when Apple refused to unlock iPhones of a man who carried out a mass shooting at a US air base. The FBI later said it had been able to \"gain access\" to the phones.",
      "It is understood that the UK government does not want to start combing through everybody's data.",
      "Rather it would want to access it if there were a risk to national security - in other words, it would be targeting an individual, rather than using it for mass surveillance.",
      "Authorities would still have to follow a legal process, have a good reason and request permission for a specific account in order to access data - just as they do now with unencrypted data.",
      "Apple has previously said it would pull encryption services like ADP from the UK market rather than comply with such government demands - telling Parliament it would \"never build a back door\" in its products.",
      "WhatsApp, owned by Meta, has also previously said it would choose being blocked over weakening message security.",
      "But even withdrawing the product from the UK might not be enough to ensure compliance - the Investigatory Powers Act applies worldwide to any tech firm with a UK market, even if they are not based there."

      "The email to Hill Dickinson employees said: \"We have been monitoring usage of Al tools, particularly publicly available generative Al solutions, and have noticed a significant increase in usage of, and uploading of files to, such tools.\"",

      "Elon Musk denied leading a \"hostile takeover\" of the US government and defended his cost-cutting plans as he made a surprise first appearance at the White House on Tuesday.",
      "The world's richest man took questions from reporters in the Oval Office as he stood next to President Donald Trump, who has tasked him with slashing the size and spending of the federal government.",
      "Trump then signed an order giving Musk's Department of Government Efficiency (Doge) more authority to cut the federal workforce. It instructed the heads of government agencies to comply with Doge.",
      "The agency has been criticised by Democrats who have accused it of a lack of transparency, and its efforts have also been hampered by legal challenges.",
      "Doge has, for example, been blocked by a federal judge from accessing treasury records - in a case that seeks to ensure the agency does not interfere with funding signed off by Congress, which is outside Doge's scope.",
      "But Musk, who was questioned by reporters for the first time since Trump took office last month, described sweeping government cuts as \"common sense\" measures that are \"not draconian or radical\".",
      "\"The people voted for major government reform and that's what the people are going to get,\" he said. \"That's what democracy is all about.\"",

      "\"It's not optional for us to reduce the federal expenses,\" Musk said. \"It's essential. It's essential for America to remain solvent as a country.\"",
      "Musk was also asked about a recent false claim that the US government was sending millions of dollars worth of condoms to Gaza. \"Some of the things that I say will be incorrect and should be corrected,\" Musk replied.",
      "In the first weeks of Trump's term, Musk has spearheaded the effort to rapidly shrink the federal government. Doge representatives have entered various departments to monitor spending, offered millions of workers an exit route and moved to freeze federal funding as well as the work of agencies such as the US Agency for International Development (USAID).",

      "\"I hope that the court system is going to allow us to do what we have to do,\" Trump said on Tuesday, referring to recent judgments that have temporarily halted his efforts to shrink government, including through an employee buyout programme.",
      "Critics of Doge have also pointed to potential conflicts of interest given Musk's many business interests. Democrats have accused him of personally benefiting from some of the changes the Trump administration is trying to push through.",
      "Musk said the public could take its own view about potential conflicts. Trump then said if the White House thought there was a lack of transparency or a conflict of interest, \"we would not let him do that segment or look in that area\".",

    "summary": "Researchers have given a robot a powerful radio-based vision system which can see through smoke.",
    "story": [
      "If you want to find out whether your robot can see through smoke, well, you're going to need some smoke.",
      "But a University of Pennsylvania student got a shock when they began setting up a late night experiment to test such a robot.",
      "Shortly after flicking the switch on the smoke machine, a loud fire alarm went off.",
      "\"The whole building got triggered,\" says Mingmin Zhao of the University of Pennsylvania, smiling. \"My student called me. He was very surprised.\"",
      "The incident was a minor setback for the team developing a robot equipped with a innovative radio-based sensing system.",
      "Radio waves could allow robots or autonomous vehicles to see through thick smoke, intense rain \u2013 or even around corners. Such waves can even detect concealed weapons.",
      "But simulating visual imagery based on radio waves is an unusual approach for robots and autonomous vehicles. Much more established in those fields are regular optical cameras, light detection and ranging (Lidar), and other sensors.",
      "However, Prof Zhao and his students have developed a potentially powerful way for robots to see using radio waves.",
      "Of course radar, which uses radio waves, has been used for decades to track aircraft, ships and the weather.",
      "But the spinning array on Prof Zhao's robot throws radio waves in all directions.",
      "An on-board artificial intelligence (AI) system then builds a 3D view of the environment with this information.",
      "\"What we have been trying to do here is basically help robots obtain superhuman vision \u2013 to see in scenarios where human eyes or traditional visual sensors cannot,\" explains Prof Zhao.",
      "He suggests the technology could help a future search-and-rescue robot save people from a burning building.",
      "Subsequent tests of the bot used a clear plastic box full of smoke placed around the its spinning equipment, in order to avoid triggering any nearby fire alarms.",
      "Although humans can't see them, radio waves are a form of light in the sense that they are part of the electromagnetic spectrum, which also includes X-rays and gamma rays. Only a small part the spectrum is classed as visible light.",
      "Being light, radio waves can reflect off surfaces and materials, though in a slightly different way to visible light. Prof Zhao and his colleagues have designed their robot so that it can sense these radio wave reflections.",
      "The crucial factor here is that radio waves are much longer than visible light waves meaning they are not blocked by tiny smoke particles.",
      "Prof Zhao says he has also been working on adapting the technology so that the robot can see part of the way round a corner. Think of it like a hall of mirrors, he suggests, just for radio waves rather than visible light.",
      "\"It's really very interesting work and quite impressive,\" says Friedemann Reinhard at the University of Rostock in Germany, who was not involved in the work. In 2017, Prof Reinhard and colleagues described how Wi-Fi signals could allow spies to see into private rooms.",
      "One slight limitation is that the spinning array cannot, by definition, see in all directions at once. Prof Reinhard says that a lot of data processing carried out by the system appears necessary to clean up the image that results from this spinning device.",
      "However, the robot sends out radio waves in the millimetre wave band (waves that are between one and ten millimetres long). This is the same technology used for some 5G installations.",
      "\"That's potentially very attractive, it's a very well understood, cheap technology,\" says Prof Reinhard. \"I certainly would love to see a self-driving car driving only on radar.\"",
      "But it is possible to avoid using spinning radio-emitting devices to get a full picture, says Fabio da Silva, founder and chief executive of US firm Wavsens, which is also developing radio-based sensing technology.",
      "\"We created an algorithm that allows you to sense the entire space instantaneously and continuously so we don't have to spin our antennas,\" he says.",
      "He describes the system as akin to echolocation, used by bats. It sends out radio waves and \"listens\" to how the waves come back, which reveals the shape of whatever they have hit.",
      "Some researchers have used radio waves to detect concealed weapons such as hidden handguns and knives.",
      "Radio waves can even \"fingerprint\" the details of a room. Then, if scanned again later, this would reveal whether any objects in the room have been moved.",
      "Last year, scientists in Germany proposed that countries use this method to scrutinise other countries' management of their nuclear weapons stockpiles. It would be one way of knowing whether someone had been moving the warheads around, for example.",
      "Separately, Luana Olivieri at Loughborough University has explored using a different form of non-visible electromagnetic radiation, terahertz waves. These are shorter than radio waves but longer than visible light waves. \"This wavelength is particularly unexplored,\" says Dr Olivieri.",
      "It is possible to see through objects and analyse materials using this form of radiation, she adds. Such a system could even, in theory, identify specific drugs by detecting their chemical structure.",
      "But while seeing through materials could help a rescue bot find a trapped person in some future disaster, it also has other applications. Police forces and militaries have access to radio-based technology that allows them to see through doors and walls, to some extent.",
      "\"Warfighting is definitely one market that it caters to. It can be used to find and kill someone,\" says Mr da Silva. He has exhibited Wavsens' technology to the US Department of Defense and the Israeli Ministry of Defense, he says.",
      "And yet these applications are not entirely surprising, suggests Prof Reinhard, who points out that a range of emerging technologies have, in principle, made it easier to detect and attack people.",
      "\"Maybe radar sounds scary \u2013 but drones and cheap cameras are the much more dangerous thing,\" he says."

      "The girl who goes only by one name, Iqra, succumbed to multiple injuries in  hospital last Wednesday. A preliminary police investigation said she had been tortured.",
      "The case in Rawalpindi has sparked widespread outrage and posts with the hashtag #JusticeforIqra having garnered tens of thousands of views, and reignited a debate over child labour and the mistreatment of domestic workers.",

      "Iqra began working as a maid from the age of eight. Her father, a 45-year-old farmer, said he had sent her to work because he was in debt.",
      "After working for a few employers, she went to work for the couple two years ago, who have eight children of their own. She was earning about \u00a323 ($28) per month.",
      "Police said Iqra had been accused of stealing chocolates from her employers, adding that a preliminary investigation showed that Iqra had been tortured.",
      "Police also say there was evidence of frequent abuse. Pictures and videos obtained by the BBC showed multiple fractures in her legs and arms, as well as a serious injury to her head.",
      "An autopsy is being conducted to assess the full extent of her injuries, and the police has told the BBC that they were still awaiting the final medical report.",
      "\"My heart cries tears of blood. How many... are subjected to violence in their homes every day for a trivial job of a few thousand?\" activist Shehr Bano wrote on X. \"How long will the poor continue to lower their daughters into graves in this way?\"",

    "summary": "A new energy plan cites growing demand from power-hungry AI data centres and semiconductor plants.",
    "story": [
      "Japan says it will increase its reliance on nuclear energy in a major policy shift as it seeks to meet growing demand from power-hungry sectors like AI and semiconductors.",
      "An energy plan approved by the cabinet on Tuesday called for \"maximising the use of nuclear energy\" and dropped reference to \"reducing reliance on nuclear energy\".",
      "The energy plan, written by the Ministry of Economy, Trade and Industry says that by 2040, nuclear energy should account for 20% of Japan's grid supply in 2040, more than double the 8.5% share in 2023.",
      "It comes as the Fukushima nuclear plant disaster from 14 years ago continues to hang over the country, conjuring painful memories.",
      "In March 2011, a 9.0-magnitude earthquake near Japan's north-east coast spawned a tsunami that killed more than 18,000 people, wiping out entire towns and flooding the reactors of the Fukushima Daiichi plant.",
      "Japan now operates 14 commercial nuclear reactors, compared to 54 before the Fukushima disaster when 30% of the country's energy was from nuclear sources.",
      "The plan still needs approval by parliament, where it will be discussed in the coming months.",
      "The country, which imports 90% of its fuel, needs to look to nuclear sources as part of its plan to cut back on carbon and be self-reliant on energy, said Daishiro Yamagiwa, an MP who was part of a government advisory committee on the energy plan.",
      "\"Because of the conflict in Ukraine and the war in the Middle East, even fossil fuels have become difficult to buy,\" he told the BBC. \"Japan is a country without energy resources, so we must use whatever is available in a balanced way.\"",
      "Yamagiwa added that energy burdens are growing because of demand from AI data processing centres and semiconductor factories around the country.",
      "But experts say increasing reliance on nuclear energy will be both risky and costly.",
      "Japan will need to import uranium, which is expensive and will make the country reliant on other countries, said Professor Kenichi Oshima at the faculty of policy science at Ryukoku University.",
      "Prof Oshima told the BBC the main concern is that increasing the number of nuclear power plants also raises the risk of potentially disastrous accidents.",
      "He cited the 2024 New Year's Day earthquake in the Noto peninsula, where two decades ago, a plan to build a nuclear plant was scrapped because locals opposed it.",
      "\"If there had been a nuclear power plant there, it is quite clear that it would have caused a major accident,\" he said.",
      "Fukushima looms large",
      "In Japan, any mention of nuclear energy inevitably brings back difficult memories of the nuclear meltdown at the Daiichi power plant.",
      "\"We all had such a terrible experience at the time of the Fukushima quake,\" Tokyo resident Yuko Maruyama told the BBC.",
      "\"How could I support it [the nuclear energy plan]? I want the government to rely on other sources of energy,\" she added.",
      "\"As a mother I think of the children, of their safety. I cannot help but think about what would happen in the future.\"",
      "The meltdown at Fukushima is considered the world's worst since that of Chernobyl in 1986.",
      "It stirred fresh controversy in 2023, when Japan started releasing treated water from the site of the Fukushima plant. This drew protests from Japan's neighbours, including China, over safety concerns.",
      "The United Nations atomic energy regulator IAEA said the waste water was safe and would have a \"negligible\" impact on people and the environment.",
      "In response to the new energy plan announced this week, Greenpeace said promoting nuclear energy is \"outrageous\" when the fallout from Fukushima is still ongoing.",
      "\"There is no justification for continuing to rely on nuclear energy, which remains toxic for tens of thousands of years, produces radioactive waste that requires long-term management, and carries risks like earthquakes and terrorism,\" the group said.",
      "What happened at Fukushima 12 years ago?",
      "China anger over Fukushima fuelled by disinformation",
      "China retaliates as Japan releases Fukushima water",
      "To meet the government's goal, experts say 33 reactors must be put back online, but the current pace of safety checks as well as residents' objections in some areas will make this difficult.",
      "Many of these nuclear plants are old and will need to be refitted with new technology for them to function safely.",
      "\"That most difficult problem is that each nuclear power plant is in a different location and will need its own safety protocol and infrastructure,\" Yamagiwa said.",
      "\"We must check each of them carefully. It still takes time.\"",
      "In recent months, regulators have given several old reactors approval to keep operating.",
      "In October 2024 Japan's oldest reactor, Takahama nuclear power plant, was given the go-ahead to continue operations, making it the first reactor in the country to get approval to operate beyond 50 years."

      "The man he sent to the Kremlin to handle a titanic geopolitical challenge does not even have a diplomatic background.",
      "Instead Trump picked his personal friend, golf buddy and billionaire real estate developer Steve Witkoff.",
      "The president has made Witkoff his Middle East envoy. But last week the Bronx-born businessman found himself in discussions about ending a conflict in Eastern Europe - having been \"with [Putin] for a very extended period, like about three hours\", in Trump's words.",
      "Witkoff was in Moscow to help facilitate a deal that saw the US and Russia swap prisoners, which was seen as signalling a possible thaw in relations between the two countries.",
      "Witkoff also played a part in brokering the current ceasefire agreement between Israel and Hamas, for which both Trump and his predecessor Joe Biden took credit.",
      "Though he was not yet officially in his post, Witkoff flew to Tel Aviv to meet Netanyahu before the deal was brokered in Qatar. He then spent time with Biden's envoy Brett McGurk in Doha, who later praised their cooperation, calling it a \"very close partnership, even friendship\", according to the Washington Post.",

      "\"The president sees Steve as one of the world's great dealmakers,\" a White House official told Axios. Witkoff's preferred negotiating tactic was to use charm, according to another associate, but he could also turn up the pressure.",
      "The 67-year-old was raised in Long Island, New York and trained as a real estate developer in one of America's most cut-throat markets.",
      "As a long-time Republican donor, he has known Trump for decades, and, like the president, made his fortune in real estate in both New York and Florida.",
      "Addressing last year's Republican National Convention, during which he recalled speaking to Trump in the aftermath of an assassination attempt, Witkoff called the other man his \"true and dear friend... in good times and bad times\".",
      "The two men are also long-time golfing companions, US Senator Lindsey Graham told NBC News. \"Steve and I would be the two guys who would play Trump and somebody else, and lose,\" Graham said.",
      "It was during a shared golfing session in Florida last September that another alleged would-be Trump attacker was foiled by the Secret Service. Trump said he and Witkoff were bundled into golf carts as agents moved to counter a suspect in the bushes.",
      "Graham also said that Witkoff first mentioned his interest in becoming Middle East envoy to Trump during a lunchtime conversation. \"That stunned me, because I didn't know he was interested in the Mideast,\" Graham said.",
      "Witkoff's remit as Middle East envoy is also reported to include diplomacy with Iran. People familiar with the matter told the Financial Times he had been chosen to spearhead a nuclear deal with Tehran as part of a broader plan to \"stop the wars\" in the region.",
      "Witkoff's deal-making skills were on display during Trump's 2024 campaign. He helped to ease tension between Trump and his defeated Republican presidential primary rival, Florida Governor Ron DeSantis.",
      "Witkoff also reportedly met Georgia Governor Brian Kemp to smooth things over, after Kemp drew Trump's scorn for refusing to support his unfounded claims of fraud in the 2020 election which Trump lost to Biden.",
      "He currently serves as chairman of the University of Miami's business school real estate advisory board, and was appointed by Trump during his first term to the board of trustees of the John F Kennedy Center for the Performing Arts."

      "Alya came here a decade ago from Syria with her baby son. Now 10, he and his mother welcome me into their home.",
      "They were among a record 1.2 million people who applied for asylum in Germany from 2015-16, many of them from Syria but also from countries including Afghanistan and Iraq.",

      "He has lived in the city most of his life and used to work as a car mechanic and tiler. He mourns what he sees a general decline in Oberhausen, pointing to because of ageing infrastructure and a lack of investment.",
      "Many in Germany also talk of a wish for greater public safety and a disillusionment with the parties that have governed the country since reunification.",
      "Germany's outgoing government has reimposed border controls as it tries to bring down the number of asylum seekers, and opposition parties want to go further.",
      "Georg says it's a difficult issue but believes there needs to be security: \"No matter who's in charge. Not like it is right now. It has to change.\"",
      "Before Europe's migration crisis, Oberhausen was  already a multicultural city.",

      "\"No, of course not,\" Mr Lange replies \u2013 but again denies it's racist.",
      "\"He personally attacked me,\" says Mr Lange. \"He said 'you're a Nazi'. And then of course you have to say that if something doesn't suit you here in Germany then you can go back. Then leave us alone here.\"",

      "\"I'm a German,\" says Prathep. \"I'm proud of this city,\" chimes in Kwame. \"Wherever I go in the world [I say] I'm from Oberhausen.\"",
      "Both think their community has  become \"drastically\" more divided in recent years.",

      "The Social Democrats have pledged to speed up asylum procedures and boost deportations.",

      "Alya hopes that Germany will keep its doors open to refugees: \"There's still war everywhere. And the people need this\u2026 maybe there are very good people running away from war.\"",
      "The future of Germany's migration policy will depend on which parties form a coalition after this election, and what they can agree on.",
      "But a rightward shift is already underway, in reality and rhetoric."

    "story": [
      "The choice by the Trump administration of Saudi Arabia as the location for key talks on Ukraine underscores how far the Kingdom has come diplomatically from the near pariah state it became after the murder of the Saudi journalist Jamal Khashoggi in 2018.",
      "The shadow that cast over the country and its de facto leader, Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman in particular, appears to have lifted, although there are still concerns occasionally raised at international forums over Saudi Arabia's human rights record.",
      "On many fronts - in entertainment and sport in particular - the country has spent huge amounts of money to further its ambitions to be a major player on the world stage.",
      "Diplomatically, the Saudi leadership has also been enhancing its role.  During the Biden years, the Kingdom increased its pivot away from reliance on the US as its key international ally.",
      "The Saudis made clear that they would follow what they perceive as their interests first and foremost - striking up closer relationships with countries viewed as key rivals to the US, such as Russia and China.",
      "The return of Donald Trump to the White House will have been welcomed by the Saudis.",
      "His first foreign visit in his first term was to Saudi Arabia - and the transactional nature of his foreign policy is more conducive to the current Saudi leadership.",
      "One of the possible achievements that Mr Trump would most like to chalk up on his record would be a peace deal between the Saudis and Israel - which would be the culmination of the Abraham Accords that he initiated in his first term.",
      "But the war in Gaza has subsequently got in the way and may well raise the price that Saudi Arabia will demand for a peace agreement.",
      "The Saudis were very quick to announce their definitive rejection of Mr Trump's plan for Gaza - to remove all the Palestinians and rebuild it as a resort.",
      "It has spurred the Kingdom to try to come up with a workable alternative plan with other Arab states - which would see Gazans remain in place as the enclave is rebuilt and would lead to a two state solution of the conflict.",
      "The Trump administration's current thinking would seem to be at odds with this - in its policy towards both Gaza and the occupied West Bank.",
      "How this will be resolved will be key to the dynamics in the evolving relationship between Saudi Arabia and the US.",
      "What is clear is that the Saudis have no intention of reining in their ambition of becoming an essential player in global diplomacy."

      "According to estimates in 2018, the collection is worth as much as $3bn.",
      "Only a small portion of the work has been exhibited since the 1979 Iranian Revolution but in recent years, the Tehran Museum of Contemporary Art has been showcasing some of its most captivating pieces.",
      "The Eye to Eye exhibition at the Tehran Museum of Contemporary Art, which opened in October 2024, was extended twice due to overwhelming public demand, running until January 2025.",
      "The display was widely regarded as one of the most significant exhibitions in the history of the museum, and it also became its most visited.",
      "The showcase featured more than 15 works unveiled for the first time, including a sculpture by Jean Dubuffet - marking its first-ever appearance in an Iranian exhibition.",
      "From abstract expressionism to pop art, the collection at the museum serves as a time capsule of pivotal artistic movements.",

      "On the opposite wall in the basement of the museum, a portrait of Ayatollah Ruhollah Khomeini, the founder of the Islamic Republic of Iran, is on display in juxtaposition.",
      "The museum was built in 1977 under the patronage of Pahlavi, the exiled widow of the last Shah of Iran who was overthrown during the revolution.",
      "Pahlavi was a passionate art advocate and her cousin, architect Kamran Diba, designed the museum.",
      "It was established to introduce modern art to Iranians and to bridge Iran closer to the international art scene.",
      "The museum soon became home to a stunning array of works by luminaries including Picasso, Warhol and Salvador Dali, alongside pieces by leading Iranian modernists, and quickly established itself as a beacon of cultural exchange and artistic ambition.",
      "But then came the 1979 revolution. Iran became an Islamic republic as the monarchy was overthrown and clerics assumed political control under Ayatollah Khomeini.",
      "Many artworks were deemed inappropriate for public display because of nudity, religious sensitivities or political implications.",
      "Pierre-Auguste Renoir's Gabrielle with Open Blouse was deemed too scandalous. And Warhol's portrait of the former queen of Iran was too political. In fact, Pahlavi's portrait was vandalised and torn apart with a knife during the revolutionary turmoil.",
      "After the revolution, many of the artworks were locked away, collecting dust in a basement that became the stuff of art world legend.",
      "It was only in the late 1990s that the museum reclaimed its cultural significance during the reformist presidency of Mohammad Khatami.",

      "Hamid Keshmirshekan, an art historian based in London, has studied the collection and calls it \"one of the rarest treasure troves of modern art outside the West\".",
      "The collection includes Henry's Moore's Reclining Figure series - an iconic piece by one of Britain's most celebrated sculptors - and Jackson Pollock's Mural on Indian Red Ground, a vibrant example of the American's painting technique pulsing with energy and emotion.",
      "Picasso's The Painter and His Model - his largest canvas from 1927 - also features, a strong example of his abstract works from the post-cubism period.",
      "And there is Van Gogh's At Eternity's Gate - one of the very rare survivals of his first printmaking campaign during which he produced six lithographs in November 1882.",
      "But for art lovers in Britain, the collection is out of reach. The UK Foreign Office advises against all travel to Iran and says British and British-Iranian dual nationals are at significant risk of arrest, questioning or detention.",
      "Having a British passport or connections to the UK can be reason enough for detention by the Iranian authorities, it says.",
      "Challenges remain for the museum which operates under a tight budget. Shifting political priorities mean that it often functions more as a cultural hub than a traditional museum.",
      "Yet it continues to be a remarkable institution - an unlikely guardian of modern art masterpieces in the heart of Tehran."

      "The UK",
      "By Harry Farley, Political Correspondent in London",
      "Sir Keir Starmer is hoping to be a bridge between European leaders and Trump's White House berating them about their defence spending.",
      "Starmer's offer to put UK troops on the ground in Ukraine is part of that role he wants to play.",
      "The government used to say the terms of any peace deal was up to Ukraine. That has shifted with the new US administration signalling that a return to 2014 borders was \"unrealistic\".",
      "Instead Sir Keir will be hoping more European nations in Paris join him in offering their forces to secure a deal \u2013 and prevent Russia invading again.",
      "But while the prime minister is in Paris, in Westminster the debate goes on about how much the country should spend on defence.",
      "Labour has promised to \"set out a path\" to increase defence spending from 2.3% of GDP now to 2.5%. Defence sources say that would be a significant rise.",
      "But there is no date for when that would happen - and many argue it is now urgent.",
      "Germany",
      "By Damien McGuinness, Germany correspondent in Berlin",
      "It is a sign of how rattled German leaders are by Trump's approach to Ukraine that just days before a national election Chancellor Olaf Scholz is also in Paris.",
      "All mainstream parties have condemned American suggestions that a peace deal be brokered without Ukraine or the EU. Far-right and populist-left politicians welcome talks with Putin and want to stop arming Kyiv. But they will not get into power.",
      "So, whatever the next German government looks like, Berlin's support for Ukraine will remain strong. That is because Berlin's political elite recognises that a bad deal - one that undermines Ukrainian sovereignty - would be disastrous for Germany.",
      "But with Germany's war-torn 20th century in mind, voters here are wary of militarisation.",
      "Over the past three years the country has successfully pivoted away from Russian energy and massively upped defence spending. But this has hit the German economy hard and the subsequent budget rows sparked the collapse of the German government.",

      "It is also a loud voice arguing that Russia cannot be allowed to win the war it launched \u2013 because the whole of Europe's security is at stake. So there is consternation that the US looks like it is conceding to Moscow's key demands, even before talks begin, when Poland very clearly sees Russia as the aggressor and as dangerous.",
      "Russia is why Poland spends big on its own military \u2013 up to almost 5% of GDP now - and agrees with the US that the rest of Europe should do the same.",
      "On his way to the talks in Paris, Poland Prime Minister Donald Tusk wrote on X: \"If we, Europeans, fail to spend big on defence now, we will be forced to spend 10 times more if we don't prevent a wider war.\"",

      "By Liza Fokht, BBC Russian in Paris",
      "Since the summer, Putin has stated that his main conditions for starting negotiations to end the war are the recognition of Russian-occupied Ukrainian territories, the lifting of sanctions on Russia, and denial of Ukraine's request to join Nato.",
      "Most European countries categorically reject these demands. The US has been very cautious in discussing what concessions Russia might have to make, though both the White House and the Pentagon have said they expect compromises from \"both sides\".",
      "Moscow's priority is clearly the meeting in Saudi Arabia. Russian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov has said he would \"first and foremost like to listen\" to the American proposals on ending the conflict in Ukraine.",
      "As for Europe, Moscow sees no point in inviting it to the negotiating table.",
      "It is no secret that for many years Putin has sought dialogue specifically with the US \u2013 a country he both blames for starting the war in Ukraine and considers the only power equal to Russia.",
      "Moscow may take note of Starmer's statements about being ready to send peacekeepers to the Ukraine \u2013 for the first time in a week, the discussion is about potential Russian, rather than Ukrainian, concessions.",
      "But whether Russia is ready for any compromises remains an open question.",
      "The US",
      "By Bernd Debusmann Jr reporting from Mar-a-Lago, Florida",

      "Despite Trump's public engagements in recent days, it is clear that the negotiations with Russia over the fate of Ukraine have been his focus behind the scenes.",
      "On Sunday, Trump told reporters he had been kept abreast of the latest developments and the talks are \"moving along\".",
      "His short-term goal is to stop the fighting in Ukraine. Longer term, he appears to want less American involvement, given that the US has sent tens of billions of dollars' worth of weapons to Kyiv.",
      "Trump has also pushed for access to rare minerals in Ukraine in return for aid, or even as compensation for the support the US has already provided.",
      "But he has not yet said what a post-war Ukraine would look like, setting off alarm bells in Europe.",
      "He also notably said that he expects Ukraine's Volodymyr Zelensky to be a part of the \"conversation\", but not the talks in Riyadh. Rubio has said the talks in Saudi Arabia are only the start of a longer process that will \"obviously\" include Europe and Ukraine.",
      "Those remarks are likely to provide little comfort for US allies who have been listening to Trump's remarks over the last several days.",
      "In response to a BBC question on Wednesday, Trump said he believes he is inclined to agree with Defence Secretary Pete Hegseth's assessment that a return to pre-2014 borders is unrealistic for Ukraine, although he expects Ukraine might get \"some\" of that land back.",

      "By Mariana Matveichuk, BBC Ukraine in Kyiv",
      "The Ukrainian people feel their future is as uncertain as it was back in February 2022.",
      "Ukrainians want peace - so as not to wake up to the sounds of sirens and not lose loved ones on the battlefield and in frontline cities.",
      "Russia occupies almost 25% of Ukraine's territory. Ukraine's defence has cost tens of thousands of lives of its citizens.",
      "The country has in the past insisted that any peace deal include the full withdrawal of Russian troops from Ukrainian territory. That includes not only areas Russia has seized in its full-scale offensive, but also the Black Sea peninsula of Crimea, which Russia annexed in 2014, and the regions of Donetsk and Luhansk, where Russia has backed separatists in fighting, also in 2014.",
      "Ukrainians are scared of a peace agreement like the one in 2014 or 2015 - heavy fighting was stopped, but crossfire on the border continued to bring losses.",
      "With no security guarantees, it would also mean a possibility of a new wave of war in a decade or so.",
      "\"Ukraine regards any talks about Ukraine without Ukraine as such that have no result, and we cannot recognise... agreements about us without us,\" Ukraine's President Volodymyr Zelensky said about the US-Russia meeting.",
      "Whatever form any peace talks take, Ukrainians want agency over their own future.",
      "Many see previous peace arrangements with Russia as having simply paved the way for its full-scale invasion. So the Ukrainian fear is that any deal agreed over its head could lead to a third round of war."

      "Numerous armed groups have competed with the central authorities for power and control of the potential fortune in this vast nation.",
      "The instability has sucked in neighbouring countries to devastating effect \u2013 notoriously in the 1990s when two huge conflicts, dubbed Africa's World Wars, resulted in the deaths of millions of people.",
      "What is happening at the moment?",
      "After a rapid advance in the east, fighters from the M23 rebel group have captured a number of key cities and towns.",
      "Their first major coup was at the end of January with the taking of Goma \u2013 a city in the North Kivu province that is home to more than a million people.",
      "Sitting on the border with Rwanda and the shores of Lake Kivu, Goma is a vital trading and transport hub that is within reach of mining towns supplying metals and minerals in high demand.",
      "When the rebels took over Goma, UN aid agencies warned of a major humanitarian crisis with shortages of food and water, hospitals overwhelmed by casualties and bodies lying on the streets.",
      "The M23 have also seized another key city in the region, South Kivu provincial capital Bukavu.",
      "Other locations now under M23 control include Masisi, Rutshuru and Katale.",
      "The rebels previously threatened to continue their offensive to the capital, Kinshasa, although analysts say this may be unlikely, as the city is 2,600km (1,600 miles) away, on the other side of this vast country.",
      "Who are the M23?",
      "The M23 are led by ethnic Tutsis, who say they needed to take up arms to protect the rights of the minority group.",
      "They say that several previous deals to end the fighting have not been respected - they take their name from a peace agreement that was signed on 23 March 2009.",
      "Shortly after its creation in 2012, the M23 rapidly gained territory and seized Goma \u2013 acts that were met with international opprobrium and accusations of war crimes and human rights violations.",
      "It was forced to withdraw from Goma, and then suffered a series of heavy defeats at the hands of the Congolese army along with a UN force that saw it expelled from the country.",

      "What is the connection with Rwanda?",
      "The origin of the current fighting can partly be traced back to the genocide in Rwanda in 1994.",
      "About 800,000 people \u2013 the vast majority from the Tutsi community - were slaughtered by ethnic Hutu extremists.",
      "The genocide ended with the advance of a force of Tutsi-led rebels commanded by Paul Kagame, who is now president.",
      "Fearing reprisals, an estimated one million Hutus then fled across the border to what is now DR Congo. This stoked ethnic tensions as a marginalised Tutsi group in the east \u2013 the Banyamulenge \u2013 felt increasingly under threat.",

    "published": "Mon, 17 Feb 2025 02:07:46 GMT",
    "summary": "Indians make up only a small share of the overall unauthorised migrant population in the US.",
    "story": [
      "Donald Trump has made the mass deportation of undocumented foreign nationals a key policy, with the US said to have identified about 18,000 Indian nationals it believes entered illegally.",
      "Last week Narendra Modi said India would take back its nationals who were in the US illegally, and also crack down on the \"human trafficking ecosystem\".",
      "\"These are children of very ordinary families, and they are lured by big dreams and promises,\" he said during his visit to Washington.",
      "Now a new paper by Abby Budiman and Devesh Kapur from Johns Hopkins University has shed light on the numbers, demographics, entry methods, locations and trends relating to undocumented Indians over time.",
      "Here are some of the more striking findings.",
      "How many illegal Indians are in the US?",
      "Unauthorised immigrants make up 3% of the US population and 22% of the foreign-born population.",
      "The number of undocumented Indians among them is contested however, with estimates varying widely due to differing calculation methods.",
      "Pew Research Center and Center for Migration Studies of New York (CMS) estimate some 700,000 people as of 2022, making them the third-largest group after Mexico and El Salvador.",
      "In contrast, the Migration Policy Institute (MPI) puts the figure at 375,000, ranking India fifth among origin countries.",
      "The official government data from the Department of Homeland Security (DHS)  offers yet another picture, reporting 220,000 unauthorised Indians in 2022.",
      "The vast differences in estimates highlight the uncertainty surrounding the true size of the undocumented Indian population, according to the study.",
      "Yet numbers have dropped from their peak",
      "Indian migrants make up only a small share of the overall unauthorised migrant population in the US.",
      "If Pew and CMS estimates are accurate, nearly one in four Indian immigrants in the US is undocumented - an unlikely scenario given migration patterns, the study says. (Indian immigrants are one of the fastest-growing groups in the US, surging from 600,000 in 1990 to 3.2 million in 2022.)",
      "The DHS estimated in 2022 that the undocumented Indian population in the US dropped 60% from its 2016 peak, falling from 560,000 to 220,000.",
      "How did the number of undocumented Indians drop so steeply from 2016 to 2022? Mr Kapur says the data doesn't provide a clear answer, but plausible explanations could be that some obtained legal status while others returned, particularly due to COVID-related hardships.",
      "However, this estimate doesn't reflect a 2023 surge in Indians at US borders, meaning the actual number could now be higher.",
      "Despite rising border encounters, US government estimates show no clear increase in the overall undocumented Indian population from the US financial year (FY) 2020 to 2022, according to the study.",
      "Encounters refer to instances where non-citizens are stopped by US authorities while attempting to cross the country's borders with Mexico or Canada.",
      "Visa overstays by Indians have remained steady at 1.5% since 2016.",
      "The number of Indian recipients of Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals (Daca) has also declined from 2,600 in 2017 to 1,600 in 2024. The Daca programme protects migrants who came to the US as children.",
      "To sum up: the undocumented Indian population grew both in numbers and as a share of all unauthorised migrants, rising from 0.8% in 1990 to 3.9% in 2015 before dropping to 2% in 2022.",
      "A surge - and shifting migration routes",
      "The US has two main land borders.",
      "The southern border along the states of Arizona, California, New Mexico and Texas bordering Mexico sees the most migrant crossings. Then there's the US-Canada border spanning 11 states.",
      "Before 2010, encounters involving Indians at the two borders were minimal, never exceeding 1,000.",
      "Since 2010, nearly all encounters involving Indians occurred along the US-Mexico southern border.",
      "In FY 2024, encounters of Indian nationals on the northern border surged to 36% of all Indian crossings, up from just 4% the previous year.",
      "Canada had become a more accessible entry point for Indians, with shorter visitor visa processing times than the US.",
      "Also, there was a surge in attempted border crossings from 2021 onwards, and the encounters at the Mexico border peaked in 2023.",
      "\"This is not specific to Indians. It is part of a larger surge of migrants trying to come into the US after Biden was elected. It is as if there was a high tide of migrants and Indians were a part of it,\" Mr Kapur told the BBC.",
      "Where are the illegal Indians staying?",
      "The study finds that the states with the largest Indian immigrant populations -California (112,000), Texas (61,000), New Jersey (55,000), New York (43,000) and Illinois (31,000) - also have the highest numbers of unauthorised Indian immigrants.",
      "Indians make up a significant share of the total unauthorised population in Ohio (16%), Michigan (14%), New Jersey (12%) and Pennsylvania (11%).",
      "Meanwhile, states where more than 20% of Indian immigrants are unauthorised include Tennessee, Indiana, Georgia, Wisconsin and California.",
      "\"We expect this because it's easier to blend in and find work in an ethnic business - like a Gujarati working for a Gujarati-American or a Punjabi/Sikh in a similar setup,\" Mr Kapur said.",
      "Who are the Indians seeking asylum?",
      "The US immigration system allows people who are detained at the border who fear persecution in their home countries to undergo credible \"fear screenings\". Those who pass can seek asylum in court, leading to a rise in asylum applications alongside rising border apprehensions.",
      "Administrative data doesn't reveal the exact demographics of Indian asylum seekers, but court records on spoken languages provide some insight.",
      "Punjabi-speakers from India have dominated Indian asylum claims since 2001. After Punjabi, Indian asylum seekers spoke Hindi (14%), English (8%) and Gujarati (7%).",
      "They have filed 66% of asylum cases from FY 2001\u20132022, suggesting Punjab and the neighbouring state of Haryana as key migrant sources.",
      "Punjabi speakers from India also had the highest asylum approval rate (63%), followed by Hindi speakers (58%). In contrast, only a quarter of Gujarati speakers' cases were approved.",
      "'Gaming the system' - why asylum claims are rising",
      "US data collected by Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) shows Indian asylum requests in the US have skyrocketed.",
      "The requests jumped tenfold in just two years, rising from about 5,000 in 2021 to over 51,000 in 2023.",
      "While this spike is most dramatic in the US, similar trends are seen in Canada, the UK and Australia, where Indians are among the largest asylum-seeking groups, the study says.",
      "Mr Kapur believes this is \"largely a way to game the asylum system rather than an objective fear of persecution, as processing takes years\".",
      "Given the large number of Punjabi-speakers who seek asylum, it's unclear what has changed in the northern Indian state ruled by the Congress party (2017-22) and latterly the Aam Aadmi Party (2022\u2013present) to drive this surge.",
      "Under Trump's second presidency, asylum requests are set to plummet.",
      "Within his first week, a key app for migrants was shut down and removed from app stores, cancelling nearly 300,000 pending appointments, including asylum cases already in progress.",
      "What do asylum seekers tell us about India?",
      "US data shows most Indian asylum seekers are Punjabi and Gujarati - groups from India's wealthier states, better able to afford high migration costs.",
      "In contrast, Indian Muslims and marginalised communities and people from conflict zones like the regions affected by Maoist violence and Kashmir, rarely seek asylum, the study says.",
      "So most Indian asylum seekers are economic migrants, not from the country's poorest or conflict-hit regions.",
      "The arduous journey to the US - whether via Latin America or as \"fake\" students in Canada - costs 30-100 times India's per capita income, making it accessible only to those with assets to sell or pledge, the study says.",
      "Not surprisingly, Punjab and Gujarat - top origin states for unauthorised Indians -  are among India's wealthier regions, where land values far exceed returns from farming.",
      "\"Even illegality takes a lot of money to pursue,\" the study says.",

    "title": "Can Europe and UK persuade Trump they're relevant to Ukraine's future?",
    "published": "Mon, 17 Feb 2025 07:41:41 GMT",
    "summary": "Europe's hastily convened security summit in Paris is proof of leaders' anxiety about their role in defending Ukraine, the BBC's Katya Adler writes.",
    "story": [
      "Europe's leaders are scrambling. Their hastily convened security summit in Paris on Monday is proof of that.",
      "They are still reeling from not being invited by the US to talks with Russia over the future of Ukraine. US President Donald Trump said on Sunday he could be meeting Russian President Vladimir Putin \"very soon\".",
      "Can Europe, under pressure, put political differences and domestic economic concerns aside, and come up with a united front on security spending and on Ukraine's future, including potentially sending troops there - to force themselves a spot at the negotiating table?",
      "They are going to try.",
      "On Monday morning, UK prime minister Sir Keir Starmer said the UK was \"ready and willing to put troops on the ground\". Even in Germany, ahead of a heated election, the foreign policy spokesman of the CDU party, expected to win the most seats, said Europe's largest country would also be willing to commit troops within an international framework.",
      "The Trump administration is clearly not 100% sure what it wants to do about Ukraine. There were a number of mixed messages over the weekend.",
      "This allows Europe a tiny window of opportunity to try to persuade the American president it's an invaluable partner.",
      "It hopes to do that via this Paris meeting, getting the ball rolling on two major issues demanded by Donald Trump: That Europe spend and do more for its own defence, and that Europe send troops to Ukraine after a ceasefire.",
      "Europe's leaders insist Kyiv be directly involved in ceasefire talks too. They've long maintained the view that \"there can be no decisions about Ukraine, without Ukraine\".",
      "But it's about even more than that for Europe.",
      "It is the cold realisation - much dreaded, but not entirely unexpected - that the Trump administration does not prioritise relations either with European partners, or their defence.",
      "Europe has relied on a security umbrella provided by the US since World War Two.",
      "Depending on the parameters of the Russia-US talks over Ukraine, and how emboldened Putin feels by them, there is also a European fear this could end up changing their continent's security architecture.",
      "Putin historically resents the spread of Nato eastwards. Russian neighbours - the tiny, former Soviet Baltic States and also Poland - now feel particularly exposed.",
      "Ukraine not invited to US-Russia peace talks, source tells BBC",
      "Five takeaways from the Munich Security Conference",
      "Trump administration's mixed messaging on foreign policy leaves world guessing",
      "Not all European countries will be at Monday's summit. Just those with military heft: the UK, France, Germany, Italy, Poland, Spain and Denmark - which is expected to represent the Baltic and Nordic nations, plus the EU Council president and the secretary general of the defence alliance, Nato.",
      "Other countries will reportedly have later, follow-up meetings.",
      "Even at the small Paris gathering, it will be hard, if not impossible, to agree concrete defence spending increases. Poland plans to spend 4.47% of its GDP on defence in 2025. The UK is struggling towards, and hasn't yet reached, 2.5% of its GDP.",
      "But leaders can pledge to coordinate better, spend more inside Nato and shoulder most of Ukraine's post-war reconstruction. The EU is expected to bolster its defence effort too.",
      "A large part of the Paris meeting will also focus on the question of sending troops to Ukraine after a ceasefire.",
      "The idea being discussed is not for peacekeeping troops but rather a \"reassurance force\", stationed behind, rather than on, any eventual ceasefire line.",
      "The aim of a European troop presence would be three-fold. To send a message to Ukrainians: that they are not alone. Another message to the US, to show that Europe is \"doing its bit\" for defence of its own continent, and the last message to Moscow, to warn that if it breaks the terms of an eventual ceasefire, it won't be dealing with Kyiv alone.",
      "But it's a controversial concept and may not be popular with voters. In Italy for example, 50% of people asked don't want to send any more weapons to Ukraine, never mind sending sons and daughters, sisters and brothers there.",
      "There are so many as yet unanswered questions:",
      "How many troops would each European country have to send, for how long, and under whose command? What would their mission statement be - for example if Russia broke the terms of an agreed ceasefire, would that mean European soldiers would be directly at war with Russia? Would the US have their back if so?",
      "Europe would want a US security guarantee before deploying soldiers to Ukraine. It may not get one.",
      "It's far too much to be decided on Monday. And leaders, including UK Prime Minister Keir Starmer, come to Paris with their own domestic concerns - can they afford extra defence spending, do they have the troops to send to Ukraine?",
      "Richard \u2013 now Lord \u2013 Dannatt is the former head of the British Army. He told the BBC that the UK military is too depleted to provide a significant proportion of troops for Ukraine. He said around 100,000 troops would probably be needed in total and the UK would be expected to provide a considerable number of those. The British Army insists it has earned a worldwide reputation for excellence.",
      "But this summit is more broad brushstrokes than fine print. The conversation can at least get started publicly.",
      "Will Donald Trump be paying attention?",
      "Hard to know.",
      "There's talk of sending an envoy to Washington after the Paris meeting to make Europe's case. Italy's Prime Minister, Giorgia Meloni, is close to the Trump administration, for example.",
      "Sir Keir Starmer has a planned visit to Washington in a few days. This could be his chance to act as a bridge between Europe and the US.",
      "The Paris meeting also offers an opportunity for the UK and other European leaders to further mend relations after the bitterness of Brexit.",
      "Mark Leonard, head of the European Council on Foreign Relations, notes that Starmer could \"demonstrate that Britain is a responsible stakeholder for European security ... Something that will be noticed and translate into goodwill when it comes to negotiations on other issues\".",
      "Issues like trade relations and law enforcement co-operation which the UK hopes to improve with the EU going forward.",
      "Host nation France is feeling confident. President Macron has long advocated that Europe be less reliant on outside countries for supply chains, tech capabilities and very much so when it comes to defence. He made headlines a year ago by first mooting the idea of troops on the ground in Ukraine.",
      "France is \"fiercely proud\" that its intelligence  and security services are not intertwined with the US, unlike the UK, says Georgina Wright, deputy director for international studies at the Institut Montaigne. That makes it less complicated to untangle, now that Trump is in the White House, demanding that Europe take care of itself.",
      "The US has sent a document to European allies consisting of six points and questions, such as which countries would be willing to deploy troops to Ukraine as part of a peace settlement, and which governments would be prepared to increase sanctions on Russia, including more strictly enforcing existing ones.",
      "But Julianne Smith, until recently the US ambassador to Nato, says this kind of complicated diplomatic work normally takes weeks of meetings and can't be organised by filled-in forms.",
      "She adds that whatever Europe's leaders achieve in Paris, if they use that to demand a seat at the negotiating table over Ukraine, their hand is weak.",
      "\"If Trump blinks and says no, does Europe refuse to help altogether? They can't cut off their nose to spite their face.\"",
      "Essentially, if the US plans to turn away from Ukraine and from Europe more broadly in terms of security, they will have to significantly up their defence game anyway.",
      "If Donald Trump isn't watching, Vladimir Putin certainly is."

      "\"If the United States does not want to comply with the international agreement, why should a country like Indonesia comply with it?\" asked Hashim Djojohadikusumo, special envoy for climate change and energy of Indonesia, as reported by the country's government-run news agency Antara.",

      "Scientists have said there can be no new fossil fuel extraction and there needs to be a rapid reduction of carbon emissions (around 45% by 2030 from the 2019 level) if the world is to limit warming to 1.5 Celsius compared to the pre-industrial period.",

      "Hoppus said he was drawn to the subversion, humor and intelligence of Banksy's work and the similarities between \"skateboarding, punk rock and art.\"",

      "\"Crude Oil (Vettriano)\" is part of a 2005 series of works in which Banksy put a satirical spin on famous paintings \u2014 withering Vincent van Gogh's \"Sunflowers\" and smashing the diner window in Edward Hopper's \"Nighthawks.\" The artist said his aim was to show that \"the real damage done to our environment is not done by graffiti writers and drunken teenagers, but by big business.\"",

      "\"We loved this painting since the moment we saw it,\" said Hoppus, who bought the artwork with his wife Skye in 2011. He said the painting \u2013 \"unmistakably Banksy, but different\" \u2013 has hung in the family's homes in London and LA ever since.",

      "CBS News has sought comments from Miranda Cosgrove, Jeanette McCurdy, Ariana Grande, and Maria Sharapova on this story. Johansson declined to issue any comment, according to a representative for the actor.",
      "Under Meta's Bullying and Harassment policy, the company prohibits \"derogatory sexualized photoshop or drawings\" on its platforms. The company also bans adult nudity, sexual activity and adult sexual exploitation, and its regulations are intended to block users from sharing or threatening to share non-consensual intimate imagery. Meta has also rolled out the use of \"AI info\" labels to clearly mark content that is AI manipulated.",
      "But questions remain over the effectiveness of the tech company's policing of such content. CBS News found dozens of AI-generated, sexualized images of Cosgrove and McCurdy still publicly available on Facebook even after the widespread sharing of such content, in violation of the company's terms, was flagged to Meta.",
      "One such deepfake image of Cosgrove that was still up over the weekend had been shared by an account with 2.8 million followers.",
      "The two actors \u2014 both former child stars on the Nickelodeon show \"iCarly,\" which is owned by CBS News' parent company Paramount Global \u2014 are the most prolifically targeted for deepfake content, based on the images of public figures that CBS News has analyzed.",
      "Meta's Oversight Board, a quasi-independent body that consists of experts in the field of human rights and freedom of speech, and makes recommendations for content moderation on Meta's platforms, told CBS News in an emailed statement that the company's current regulations around sexualized deepfake content are insufficient.",
      "The Oversight Board cited recommendations it has made to Meta over the past year,\u00a0 including urging the company to make its rules clearer by updating its prohibition against \"derogatory sexualized photoshop\" to specifically include the word \"non-consensual\" and to encompass other photo manipulation techniques such as AI.",
      "The board has also recommended that Meta fold its ban on \"derogatory sexualized photoshop\" into the company's Adult Sexual Exploitation regulations, so moderation of such content would be more rigorously enforced.",
      "Asked Monday by CBS News about the board's recommendations, Meta pointed to the guidelines on its transparency website, which show the company is assessing the feasibility of three of four recommendations from the oversight board and is implementing one of its suggestions, though Meta noted in its statement on its site that it is currently ruling out changing the language of its \"derogatory sexualized photoshop\" policy to include the phrase \"non consensual.\" Meta also says it is currently unlikely   to move its \"derogatory sexualized photoshop\" policy to within its Adult Sexual Exploitation regulations.",
      "Meta noted in its statement that it was still considering ways to signal a lack of consent in AI-generated images. Meta also said it was considering reforms to its Adult Sexual Exploitation policies, to \"capture the spirit\" of the board's recommendations.",
      "\"The Oversight Board has made clear that non-consensual deepfake intimate images are a serious violation of privacy and personal dignity, disproportionately harming women and girls. These images are not just a misuse of technology \u2014 they are a form of abuse that can have lasting consequences,\" Michael McConnell, an Oversight Board co-chair, told CBS News on Friday.",
      "\"The Board is actively monitoring Meta's response and will continue to push for stronger safeguards, faster enforcement, and greater accountability,\" McConnell said.",
      "Meta is not the only social media company to face the issue of widespread, sexualized deepfake content.",
      "Last year, Elon Musk's platform X temporarily blocked Taylor Swift-related searches after AI-generated fake pornographic images in the likeness of the singer circulated widely on the platform and garnered millions of views and impressions.",
      "\"Posting Non-Consensual Nudity (NCN) images is strictly prohibited on X and we have a zero-tolerance policy towards such content,\" the platform's safety team said in a post at the time.",
      "A study published earlier this month by the U.K. government found the number of deepfake images on social media platforms expanding at a rapid rate, with the government projecting that 8 million deepfakes would be shared this year, up from 500,000 in 2023.",

Now, actor Brandon Sklenar is promising even darker waters ahead for the troubled Dutton heir in the hit series' second season premiering this Sunday on Paramount +, which is part of the same corporate family as CBS News.",
      "Sklenar  told \"CBS Mornings\" on Monday that creator Taylor Sheridan foreshadowed the depth of Spencer's story in Season 1. Sheridan was also the director of the series \"Yellowstone.\" \"1923\" is the \"Yellowstone\" prequel.",
      "\"You're kind of giving glimpses into what Spencer's capable of, and what demons he's sort of running from, and what he's fighting for. And I think he [Sheridan] really lets the cat out of the bag in Season 2,\" said Sklenar.",
      "The actor also praised the emotional impact of the season finale, describing it as \"profoundly beautiful.\" The second season promises more hurdles for Dutton and his love interest, Alex, as they continue their struggle to be reunited.",
      "Sklenar also discussed his experience working with Hollywood legends Harrison Ford and Helen Mirren, who play his parents in the show. Though Sklenar couldn't confirm whether they share the screen in the new season, he spoke highly of the two, describing them as \"living icons.\"",
      "\"They're just so sweet, so kind, and they're human beings before all else, and it's a testament to why they have lasted as long as they have,\" Sklenar said.",
      "The actor also opened up about his own background, sharing how his blue-collar upbringing and background in martial arts helped him connect with Dutton. \"Spencer has like a physicality to him, that he uses his body and he's not afraid to take it to extreme places, and I can relate to that for sure,\" he said.",

      "Sklenar, who is also known for his role in \"It Ends With Us,\" said despite a legal battle between actress Blake Lively and director and actor Justin Baldoni, he remains focused on the movie's intended message.",
      "\"I just want people to remember why we made the movie in the first place, and what it stands for, and just keeping the focus on that,\" Sklenar said. \"That movie meant so much to me, and I have someone very, very close to me in my life who's gone through what Lily's going through for a long time, and I've been on the front lines helping her navigate that space, so that movie meant a lot to me, and it means a lot to her, this person in my life.\"",
      "\"It's unfortunate that things get taken away from what the ethos of that thing is and it gets convoluted,\" he said.",
      "As far as whether he is Team Blake or Team Justin, Skelnar said he is Team \"It Ends With Us.\"",

      "The show had its typical ending, with all involved looking exhilarated and exhausted on the studio stage. This night it was so crowded with luminaries it looked like it might break. Led by Short, they all applauded in tribute to Michaels, who created the show and has run it for 45 of its 50 years.",

    "summary": "The actor, who received his fourth Oscar nomination for his portrayal of the legendary folk singer, talks about cultivating authenticity in his performances.",
    "story": [
      "The fires that ravaged Southern California last month turned too many of Malibu's most treasured places to ash. But some, like the legendary Shangri-La Studios, still stand. Over the years, Shangri-La has been used by some of the biggest names in the music business, like Eric Clapton and Adele. But it's also known as the house that Bob Dylan built. Even the old bus out back, legend has it, was used by Dylan on tour.",
      "Dylan even camped out on the lawn. \"I actually think it's in Clapton's biography that there was a period where Dylan had a tent in the rose garden here,\" said actor Edward Norton.",
      "For him, this is hallowed ground \u2013 and in a way, so is his latest movie role. In \"A Complete Unknown,\" Norton is folk music legend Pete Seeger, playing opposite Timoth\u00e9e Chalamet as the young Bob Dylan.",
      "Norton says playing a music legend like Seeger was both sublime, and terrifying. \"I think every actor, some part of 'em wants to be a rock star, you know?\" he said. \"I think every actor holds the dream in some sense. I mean, I almost started crying at the idea of it, because, well, I was nervous about it. I was nervous about the whole enterprise. Because I thought the idea of a biopic about Dylan \u2013 if you just said it that way, I was, like, Oooh, like, I'm not sure. 'Cause to me, it has a mythical kind of place in me, and I thought, this could be really, really a bad idea.\"",
      "And here's just one of the challenges: Pete Seeger was an accomplished banjo player, so Norton had to become one as well, and the banjo's a tough one to learn.",
      "I said, \"We did an interview with Steve Martin, and he played the banjo for us, and watching him play the banjo, I mean, it's so complex and it's so fast.\"",
      "\"Yeah, I made the joke that I googled, you know, 'Is there an AI that can replace my hands with Steve Martin's?'\" Norton laughed. \"Or, you know, that thing where you put your arms behind your back and Steve Martin puts his hands under my armpits and does the playing for me? Which I'm not saying is not what happened, you know? It might have. Who knows?\"",
      "In the finished film, his playing looks and sounds authentic, because it is:",
      "That authenticity is something that Norton has always worked for, starting with his very first movie role, as a calculating killer in the 1996 thriller \"Primal Fear.\" Norton, who was raised in Maryland, cultivated an Appalachian accent so real that people thought he was actually from Kentucky, and he wound up with his first Oscar nomination. Three years later he was fighting it out with Brad Pitt in \"Fight Club,\" a film that has now become embedded in our culture.",
      "And although it has a huge following now, it was not successful when it was released. \"No, not at all,\" Norton said. \"And it was polarizing. I would say, there were those who absolutely, like, it hit them right in the center of their sense of their own selves. And then there were people who just absolutely thought it was garbage \u2013 panned it.\"",
      "In fact, it was roundly booed at the Venice Film Festival. But that didn't bother Norton, or his co-star Pitt. \"As the credits rolled, Brad looked at me in the dark crying, and he said, 'That's the best film we'll ever be in.' And I said, 'Me, too, and I think so, too.' And we were hugging each other and crying because we were so happy with, like, boos rising around us, you know what I mean? I think sometimes you just gotta, you know, let your own freak flag fly, and people will figure it out, or not.\"",
      "Norton has let his own freak flag fly in more than 40 films, like a mild-mannered police captain in \"The Grand Budapest Hotel.\" He was an ego-driven Broadway actor in \"Birdman\"; and he nailed the eccentric billionaire part in \"Glass Onion.\"",
      "Watching him on-screen, it's hard to believe Norton was once told he didn't have what it takes to make it as an actor. There was once a casting director who told him, \"Find another profession.\"",
      "\"Yeah, I had one of those, like, someone sits you down and says, 'You should do something else,'\" he said. \"Very, very, very well-known casting director in New York. One of the ones you hoped to get in front of. But look, if you don't run into moments where people lay some fundamental uncertainty around you [about] the path you've chosen, and you can't push through it, then you probably don't belong.\"",
      "There's little doubt he belongs in all of this: Norton has an Oscar nomination for every decade of his career, and he's in the running now for his work in \"A Complete Unknown.\" But he says that, for him, it's not about the awards or the money, but the chance to channel greatness.",
      "He said, \"If channeling their frequency gets people refocused on what it looked like when people were using the talents they had to further ideas and values that were bigger than themselves, then that is what makes it worth doing. Can we get people to re-engage with and be moved by and inspired by the idea of artists as agents of change?\"",
      "And whether Edward Norton is a pure artist, or just a really great actor, it's easy to believe him.",

      "\"Lorne: The Man Who Invented Saturday Night Live,\"\u00a0by New Yorker articles editor Susan Morrison (to be published February 18 by Random House), is a biography of late-night comedy producer Lorne Michaels, who has guided \"Saturday Night Live\" for most of its 50 years. But it is also the history of a pop culture institution that has introduced phenomenal comic talents, rewritten the rules of live television, and captured or challenged the zeitgeist for a half-century.",

      "Prologue",
      "Every week at Saturday Night Live is just like every other week. Every week is the same because it's always intense, fueled by insanely hard work, full of triumphs and failures and backstage explosions, and because it's built around a guest host\u2014Jennifer Lopez or Lizzo or Elon Musk\u2014who often has no idea what they are doing. It has been Lorne Michaels's job for the last fifty years to make it seem as if they do, and to corral the egos and the talents on his staff into getting the show on the air, live. Since he created the show, in 1975, he has periodically tweaked and fine-tuned it, paying attention to how the cultural winds are drifting. But the formula has essentially remained the same. Michaels compares it to a Snickers bar: viewers expect a certain amount of peanuts, a certain amount of caramel, and a certain amount of chocolate. (\"There's a comfort level,\" he says.) The show has good years and bad years, like the New York Yankees, or the Dow, and the audience has come to feel something like ownership of it. Just about every person who has ever watched SNL believes that its funniest years were the ones when they were in high school. Michaels likes to say that everyone in the entertainment business has two jobs: their actual job and figuring out how to fix SNL. (When J. D. Salinger died, in 2010, letters surfaced in which even he griped about what was wrong with the show.)",
      "The show's cast members and writers have speculated for years about the secret behind Michaels's extraordinary tenure. \"It's him and Hitchcock,\" John Mulaney says. \"No one else has had this kind of longevity.\" Half of them believe that Michaels has repeatedly been able to remake the show for a new audience because he's a once-in-a-lifetime talent, a producer nonpareil. The other half wonders whether Michaels, gnomic and almost comically elusive, is a blank screen onto which they've all projected a lifetime of hopes and fears and dark jokes; whether he, like the cramped stages in SNL's Studio 8H, is just a backdrop for the ever-shifting brilliance of the country's best comic minds.",

    "title": "Looking back at 50 years of \"Saturday Night Live\"",
    "published": "Sun, 16 Feb 2025 10:14:56 -0500",
    "summary": "On October 11, 1975, people tuning into the debut of a late-night comedy show saw something unlike any TV variety extravaganza they'd ever seen. Today, \"Saturday Night Live,\" produced by Lorne Michaels, is now an entrenched part of pop culture.",
    "story": [
      "On Saturday night, October 11, 1975, television viewers tuned in for a comedy variety show that looked nothing like they were used to. \"It's a sketch, a very unusual sketch, kind of in a minor key, [with] John Belushi as a kind of rumpled guy with a grocery sack,\" said writer Susan Morrison. \"He's supposed to be an immigrant trying to learn English.\"",
      "Instructor (Michael O'Donoghue): \"I would like\u2026\"Belushi: \"I would like\u2026\"Instructor: \"\u2026to feed your fingertips\u2026\"Belushi: \"\u2026to feed your fingertips\u2026\"Instructor: \"\u2026to the wolverines.\"Belushi: \"\u2026to the wolverines.\"",
      "When the instructor succumbs to a heart attack and falls to the floor, Belushi mimics him. \"It's about death,\" Morrison laughed. \"And that was something that variety shows did not traffic in in 1975!\"",
      "Morrison is the author of \"Lorne\" (that would be Lorne Michaels, the man behind \"Saturday Night Live\"). For 50 years now, \"Saturday Night Live\" has been putting on a 90-minute mix of live comedy sketches, beloved commercial parodies, and musical acts, each episode headlined by a celebrity host.",
      "So, what did variety shows look like before SNL? \"They took place on a big, wide stage; it was very shiny, very blank,\" said Morrison. \"And the content of these variety shows also was kind of a throwback \u2013 very hammy, almost vaudevillian, kind of Catskill comics doing seltzer-in-the-pants bits.\"",
      "Michaels worked on several of those shows, including \"Laugh-In.\" Morrison said, \"'Laugh-In' was really the first variety show that seemed to care about youth culture and being hip. But politically, that show was relatively toothless. What passed for political humor on 'Laugh-In' was Goldie Hawn doing kind of a dumb blonde bit.\"",
      "Michaels learned a different lesson working on a cornball comedy show hosted by Phyllis Diller.\u00a0 Its premiere episode in 1968 went up against a Barbra Streisand special. \"Streisand was the hottest thing out there,\" said Morrison. \"'Funny Girl' was about to come out. And Lorne thought, 'Oh my God, we're dead. Everybody's gonna watch Streisand.' But as it turned out, the Diller show beat Streisand in the ratings by a mile.",
      "\"And Lorne recognized, I think he said, 'You know, I realized there are two audiences. You know, there's the people I know, and then there's the wider American audience.' And to this day, he's always telling his young writers and performers, 'We have audience in all 50 states. We have to remember this is broadcast. It takes in the whole country.'\"",
      "Keeping all this in mind, Michaels set about creating a show for his own generation. As it happened, NBC's then-president was thinking along the same lines. And while it's fun to knock network executives, one of the revelations in \"Lorne\" is the role that Herb Schlosser played.",
      "\"He was a visionary president of NBC who was looking to fill a hole on Saturday night, when the network had been running Johnny Carson reruns,\" said Morrison. \"And he dictated a memo that pretty much hit all the points of what SNL was to be. He wanted to do a show out of Studio 8H at 30 Rock, which had basically been dormant, you know, since the '50s. He wanted it to be live. He wanted it to be on at 11:30 Saturday night. He wanted it to have rotating hosts.\"",
      "Before Michaels even hired his cast, he hired the writers, among them, Alan Zweibel. \"If you look at those early days of SNL, the logo for the show was 'Saturday Night Live' spray-painted on the outside wall of what was then called the RCA Building,\" he said. \"It was like graffiti. And I thought it spoke volumes. Here these kids came along besmirching whatever the standard was, whatever the establishment was.\"",
      "Zweibel had been working in a deli when he got the gig: \"I gave him a book with my jokes in it. The first joke that I put, saying that the post office is about to issue a stamp commemorating prostitution in the United States. 'It's a 10-cent stamp. But if you want to lick it, it's a quarter.' And they laughed, and it was great. I was now a professional comedy writer.\"",
      "The writers were young, and the cast were unknowns. Morrison said, \"He really wanted the show to feel like it was speaking in the voice of everybody's funny, sarcastic friend, you know, grousing, wisecracking, just the way people are when they're trying to make their friends laugh.\"",
      "And over the past five decades, America has become friends with more than a hundred different cast members and the characters they've created, not to mention all those catchphrases that have seeped into our conversation, like \"Well, isn't that special,\" or \"I gotta have more cowbell.\"",
      "The writers and actors know that the best way to make the audience laugh is to make each other laugh.",
      "Rachel Dratch was on the show from 1999 to 2006. She and longtime writer Paula Pell created Debbie Downer \u2013 that friend we all have who always manages to bring the party down.",
      "Dratch recalled, \"I think it was Paula said, like, 'Let's set it somewhere really happy. So, let's put it at Disney World.' And then it started to flow. And then as we were writing we were making each other laugh a lot, but then we started going, like, wah-wah. Like, just to each other. I think it was Paula who said, like, 'What if we just put the trombone in the scene?'\"",
      "Pell said, \"And then we did it for that first time, and it was where everyone lost their minds laughing on \u2013 they were wiping their eyes with waffles. And I remember being in a dressing room watching it on the thing, and just tears coming down my d\u00e9colletage and laughing so ungodly hard. It was such a lightning-in-a-bottle moment at that show where you're, like, I will never forget this five minutes ever in my life!\"",
      "For material, the staff is encouraged to draw from their own lives. \"I was always, always wanting to be a cheerleader,\" said Pell. \"And every year, every summer, I worked on my back handsprings. I was a little chubby girl. I was very strong. I was nice and loud. I was really good at cheerleading. And every year, I didn't get it.\"",
      "So, Pell collaborated with Cheri Oteri and Will Ferrell on their Spartan cheerleaders sketch:",
      "\"So, the Spartan cheerleaders, that comes from a real place?\" I asked.",
      "\"Yeah, it comes from the place of, like, joyful loser existence,\" said Pell. \"You go, 'Oh, I didn't make it. Let's go cheer anyway. We're gonna get costumes. Let's go cheer for things nobody is gonna kick us out on,' and they still get to be dramatic cheerleaders.\"",
      "Over the run of the show, the tone of SNL has shifted away from gritty and dark, towards colorful and more, well, cheerful. Morrison writes that Lorne Michaels began directing his staff to \"do it in sunshine.\" She explained: \"Do it in sunshine means first of all, everyone should look pretty good, you know? You want the costumes to be flattering, the colors to be bright. You don't want anger. He very often counsels writers to avoid writing anger. People don't put on a television to see people yelling at each other. Fred Armisen told me that Lorne said once, 'There's enough misery in the world. People huddle around the television as if they're huddling around a fire.'\"",
      "Armisen played Libyan dictator Muammar Qaddafi. \"I try to keep it, you know, even with the dictators I've played, I've even approached them with \u2013 I can't believe I'm saying this \u2013 like, love and kindness. So, for Qaddafi I'm like, 'I'm gonna love this character. Whoever this guy is, I'm gonna love him and just imagine him as an eccentric at his very worst.'\"",
      "Armisen spent 12 seasons on \"Saturday Night Live.\" To hear him tell it, it wasn't nearly enough. \"I loved it. It was just the best existence,\" he said. \"If you're sitting out three sketches in a row and you're like, 'Oh, I'm not in these,' it is awesome to watch your castmates put something together and see that magic happen. It's fantastic.\"",

    "published": "Sun, 16 Feb 2025 09:26:15 -0500",
    "summary": "The author has spent more than 50 years finding ways to explain things, via his humorous and intricately illustrated books featuring wooly mammoth guides \u2013 his attempt to hook young readers on the wonders right before their eyes.",
    "story": [
      "Confession: I'm just mad about the mammoth, the one that wandered out of the Ice Age into one of author-illustrator David Macaulay's books \u2013 where he found his purpose in life (if that's a mammoth thing) helping Macaulay explain the way things work to kids.",
      "\"I was desperate to find a humorous way of explaining levers,\" said Macaulay, who realized levers have probably been around for a long time. \"So, I put the mammoth on the end of the log, and put the log on the rock to have a fulcrum, and the villagers on this end of the lever. The problem that had to be solved was, what does the mammoth weigh? So, it's as simple as that!\"",
      "Since it came out in 1988, \"The Way Things Work\" has sold more than a million copies around the world. Mammoth (and a whole herd of his friends) have made their way into other Macaulay books as well.",
      "Asked how many mammoths he thinks he's drawn, Macaulay replied, \"It's like 43,272, I believe. That's just a guess.\"",
      "With or without the help of mammoths, but always with a sense of humor, Macaulay has come to be known as \"America's Explainer-in-chief.\" He is a multi-award-winning star in the children's picture book world and a Macarthur \"genius grant\" recipient, having explained all kinds of things in more than two dozen books over the course of his 50+ year career: the human body \u2026 cathedrals \u2026 castles \u2026 toilets \u2026 the pyramids \u2026 ships \u2026 the city of Rome.",
      "\"I miss Rome,\" he said. \"I think about it often, and I think about particular streets and places in Rome.\"",
      "As an architecture student at the Rhode Island School of Design, Macaulay spent a year there. Born in England, he moved to the United States at the age of ten with his family.",
      "An ongoing exhibit at the National Building Museum in Washington, D.C., explores the messiness of creating a book. It is toplined, literally, as chaos: \"Chaos, that's where this process started, and in fact it's where all my books start,\" he said. \"This whole thing [depicts] the inside of my brain, and those clouds floating overhead were an attempt to sort of suggest some of that, you know, the things that go through your mind when you think, This is not going to work.\"",
      "\"Some of these look like procrastination,\" I said.",
      "\"Oh, procrastination is my gift,\" said Macaulay. \"I always find that in the end, if I'm using my imagination, if I'm asking the right questions, then the procrastination is working in my favor. I just have to keep drawing.\"",
      "And drawing \u2026 and drawing. The exhibits features just some of the drawings he produced while he was figuring out who would be the ideal tour guide of Rome with the perfect point of view. \"Why not a pigeon carrying a message from somebody who lives outside the city to someone who lives inside the city? And it took the scenic route, which was ideal.\"",
      "Early one fall morning, Macaulay brought us to the Ledyard Bridge. On one aside, Vermont; over there, New Hampshire, the Connecticut River in-between. He began sketching the bridge: \"The weight of all of this is supported on this arch, and transferred into these piers,\" he said.",
      "He wanted us to realize that, for him, sketching is seeing. Sketching is a language for understanding. \"We look at things, but do we actually see them?\" he said. \"What better way to spend time with a structure like this than with a sketchbook in your hand, looking at specific details? I think that's my goal in a way, is to have people open their eyes to the ordinary, to the everyday, to the things they take for granted.\"",
      "Like the sorts of things, both man-made and natural, that Macaulay sees when he walks his dogs, Maya and Minnow, in Norwich, Vt., where he lives.",
      "His storyboard details the objects that hold his fascination: \"Once she's stopped and I'm holding the leash, I think, 'I wonder how many pieces of wood are in that fence? Wonder how it's fastened together?'\"",
      "Walks with Stella, his beloved previous dog, are the basis for the book he's working on now. What's starting to take shape on his wall is David Macaulay's stealth attempt to hook kids on the wonder right before their eyes.\u00a0 \"I thought maybe I can create a book that will help them connect,\" he said. \"What better way to do that than to maybe use myself as an example?\"",
      "It's the first time his work has ever been this personal and introspective. At 78, this time, the point of view is his own.",
      "But why? And why now? \"My sort of conscience, perhaps a little bit, a little payback here after all these years of being able to do what I want, really, and be successful at it, be rewarded for it,\" he said. \"It's time to maybe pay that off.\"",

      "Wendy's Frosty's is a beloved treat \u2014 and a new addition to the lineup will combine the familiar frozen dairy dessert with a beloved Girl Scout cookie.",
      "Frosty's have been a staple of the Wendy's menu since the late 1960s when founder Dave Thomas decided to add a frozen treat to it. The drink has only grown in popularity. Last year, the chain served 500 per minute in the United States. The Frosty falls somewhere between soft serve and hard-packed ice cream, creating a frozen creamy treat that's stood the test of time.",
      "For decades, just one flavor \u2014 chocolate \u2014 was available. In 2006, vanilla joined the lineup. In 2022, the fast-food chain started trying new limited-edition flavors.",
      "On Feb. 21, the fast food chain will start selling Thin Mint-flavored Frostys. Fans are excited about the idea, which will combine the smooth Frosty with the mint-chocolate-chip flavors of a Thin Mint, but designing the treat was harder than people may think.",
      "The cookie didn't lend itself to a frozen treat, so the recipe had to be tweaked, according to John Li, Wendy's Vice President of Research and Development. Instead of frozen pieces or chunks of cookie, Li and his team wound up developing a fudge-like cookie butter that can be swirled into a Frosty.",
      "The cookie butter adds the flavor of a Thin Mint but makes it possible for customers to still get their Frosty quickly. The way it's swirled into the frozen treat ensures that customers get a taste of Thin Mint in every sip or bite. The swirl can be added to either chocolate or vanilla Frosty's. Li said they initially thought about only offering one flavor, but decided that the swirl worked well in both.",
      "\"You can't get more nostalgic than a Wendy Frosty and the Girls Scouts,\" said Li. \"The fact that they're coming together really pulls at the heartstrings of food lovers in this country.\"",

      "\"Morgiane\" is believed to be the oldest existing opera written by a Black American -- but despite its historic significance, the show was only performed for audiences for the first time in 2025.",
      "\"Morgiane\" was the magnum opus of New Orleans-born composer Edmond Dede. The opera, based on themes from \"Ali Baba and the 40 Thieves,\" tells the story of a mother, Morgaine, and her daughter, Amine, who fight a tyrannical ruling sultan. Behind the curtain is Dede's remarkable story.",
      "Dede was born a free Black man in New Orleans in 1827. He was educated and moved to France in 1855, leaving just before the Civil War. In France, he studied music at the Paris Conservatoire and performed at Bordeaux's Grand Theatre. He also traveled to Algeria, then a French colony, and was inspired by the struggle of the people there.",
      "Dede returned to the U.S. once, during the height of the Jim Crow era. He was not permitted to perform in theaters, and went back to Europe, vowing that he would never return to his home country.",
      "Dede went on to write 250 songs, ballets and orchestral pieces. The 545-page \"Morgaine\" was his magnum opus, but it was never performed during his lifetime.",
      "In 2014, New Orleans Opera Creole founders Givonna Joseph and Aria Mason found a digital copy of \"Morgaine.\" Opera Creole shares music by composers of African descent, and when they found the piece, they knew they needed to bring it to an audience.",
      "\"I had, you know how you get, a gut feeling that this was important,\" Joseph said. \"I didn't know exactly how.\"",
      "Patrick Quigley, the artistic director designate of Washington, D.C.'s Opera Lafayette, was eager to join the mission. He and Joseph connected in 2023, and they began working with musicians and historians from across the country to bring the never-performed opera to life. First, they transcribed almost 6,000 measures of music into modern notation. When the process was done, they heard music that hadn't been played in over a century.",
      "\"It's this fabulous combination of so many different styles of music, both European and American all together in one place,\" Quigley said.",

      "Signed on his first day in office, Mr. Trump's executive order on gender ideology stated that the U.S. recognizes two sexes, male and female, and it directed agencies to remove \"all statements, policies, regulations, forms, communications, or other internal and external messages that promote or otherwise inculcate gender ideology.\"",
      "Days after the president issued his order, the Office of Personnel Management issued a memorandum ordering all agencies by 5 p.m. on Jan. 31 to take down all websites, social media accounts and other public-facing media \"that inculcate or promote gender ideology.\" In response to the memo, the CDC and FDA took offline numerous webpages and data sets, including recommendations on how physicians should treat sexually transmitted infections and adult immunization guidance.",
      "While the wording on some websites was adjusted to adhere to Mr. Trump's directive, allowing them to stay online, other information, like data from the CDC's Youth Risk Behavior Surveillance System, was removed completely.",
      "The agency said in a banner on its main website that it was \"being modified to comply with President Trump's executive orders.\"",
      "Doctors for America filed its lawsuit against the health agencies on Feb. 4, alleging they violated a federal law that governs the agency rulemaking process and another that requires federal agencies to ensure the public has \"timely and equitable access\" to their public information.",
      "The group argued in court papers that its members relied on the scrubbed information to provide treatment, conduct research and inform public health responses on topics like youth risk behaviors, adolescent health and HIV.",
      "Doctors for America said some of its members were already experiencing challenges as a result of losing access to information from the CDC. In one instance, it said a Chicago-based physician who works at a clinic serving low-income immigrant families could not consult the CDC's website for resources on how to address a chlamydia outbreak at a local high school and bolster STI testing and prevention efforts.",
      "Another doctor, who is also a researcher at the Yale School of Medicine, said in a declaration that she lost the ability to consult CDC resources about prescribing treatments.",
      "\"These doctors' time and effort are valuable, scarce resources, and being forced to spend them elsewhere makes their jobs harder and their treatment less effective,\" Bates wrote.",
      "He said that the Department of Health and Human Services, CDC and FDA face a minimal burden if required to store access to health resources, which have been available to the public for years.",
      "\"There is nothing in either the OPM memorandum or the record, and indeed defendants proffered no information at the hearing, to suggest the restoration of the removed webpages would pose a burden on the agencies' ability to engage in their work,\" Bates wrote. \"Similarly, there is no information to suggest that restoring public access would even interfere with the agencies' ongoing efforts to conform those resources with the president's executive orders.\"",
      "The order from Bates comes as Mr. Trump has faced numerous setbacks in the courts stemming from lawsuits targeting his administration's actions. On Monday alone, five different judges took action that favored challenges to Mr. Trump's directives on birthright citizenship, a freeze on federal funding, cuts to how medical research grants are funded and his deferred resignation program.",

      "The Trump administration has presented Musk as the leader of the cost-cutting effort on several occasions. In the Oval Office last week, Mr. Trump asked Musk to detail what \"your team\" has found.",

      "Hoppus said he was drawn to the subversion, humor and intelligence of Banksy's work and the similarities between \"skateboarding, punk rock and art.\"",
      "\"I feel like street art and punk rock have the same core,\" Hoppus said. \"The left-out and overlooked making their own reality. \u2026 Just go make art. It's the same spirit. And I've loved art and especially street art ever since realizing that.\"",
      "\"Crude Oil (Vettriano)\" is part of a 2005 series of works in which Banksy put a satirical spin on famous paintings \u2014 withering Vincent van Gogh's \"Sunflowers\" and smashing the diner window in Edward Hopper's \"Nighthawks.\" The artist said his aim was to show that \"the real damage done to our environment is not done by graffiti writers and drunken teenagers, but by big business.\"",
      "The work going under the hammer is based on \"The Singing Butler,\" a painting by Scottish artist Jack Vettriano showing a couple in evening dress dancing on a beach as servants proffer sheltering umbrellas. Banksy has added a sinking oil liner and two figures lugging a barrel of toxic waste.",
      "\"We loved this painting since the moment we saw it,\" said Hoppus, who bought the artwork with his wife Skye in 2011. He said the painting \u2013 \"unmistakably Banksy, but different\" \u2013 has hung in the family's homes in London and LA ever since.",

    "story": [
      "The presence of Elon Musk's cost-cutting task force, the Department of Government Efficiency, at the IRS is sparking fresh concerns from Democratic lawmakers about the safety of taxpayer information, and whether the group's work could cause delays in taxpayers receiving their refunds.",
      "An IRS employee associated with DOGE is requesting access to the IRS' Integrated Data Retrieval System, or IDRS, which would provide the group with access to tax data for individuals and businesses, according to a Trump administration official.",
      "\"Waste, fraud, and abuse have been deeply entrenched in our broken system for far too long,\" said White House spokesman Harrison Fields. \"DOGE will continue to shine a light on the fraud they uncover as the American people deserve to know what their government has been spending their hard-earned tax dollars on.\"",
      "News of the request was first reported by\u00a0the Washington Post. The IRS didn't immediately return a request for comment.",
      "In a Feb. 17 letter to the IRS, Senators Ron Wyden and Elizabeth Warren, both Democrats, cited reports that DOGE is \"pressuring the IRS to agree to a memorandum of understanding (\"the MOU\") which would give software engineers working for Elon Musk at DOGE broad access to IRS systems, property and datasets which include the private tax return information of hundreds of millions of American citizens and businesses.\"",
      "Supporters of DOGE view its efforts as a way to cut what they see as bloated federal spending at a time when the nation's outlays are outstripping its tax revenue, pushing the federal debt to an all-time high of\u00a0$36 trillion. But the group's efforts have also sparked several lawsuits, with consumer advocates and Democratic lawmakers raising alarms earlier this month after DOGE gained access to the Treasury Department's\u00a0payment system, which stores personal data for most Americans.",
      "IRS data is particularly sensitive, given that it reflects financial details for millions of Americans and businesses, ranging from their income, employers, losses, investments, dependents and other items. Under the IRS taxpayers' bill of rights, \"information [taxpayers] provide to the IRS will not be disclosed unless authorized by the taxpayer or by law.\"",
      "\"Software engineers working for Musk seeking to gain access to tax return information have no right to hoover up taxpayer data and send that data back to any other part of the federal government and may be breaking the law if they are doing so,\" Wyden and Warren wrote in the Feb. 17 letter.",
      "The senators pointed to privacy regulations in the tax code that they said provide \"strong legal protections\" for taxpayer data, noting that violation of those laws can result in incarceration or other criminal penalties. They added that even if the DOGE employees are employed at the Treasury Department, which oversees the IRS, they may still be violating the law by accessing taxpayer data.",
      "\"There are serious statutory and regulatory restrictions on when employees outside the Treasury Department may gain access to tax return information,\" the letter said.",
      "It added, \"To date, no information on DOGE employees or any others executing orders on Musk's behalf have revealed any clear, stated purpose as to why they need access to return information, whether they have followed all required laws to gain access to IRS systems, and what steps the IRS has taken to ensure that inspection of tax return is contained to authorized personnel and not disclosed to any unauthorized parties.\"",
      "Protections for taxpayer data were increased in the 1970s after former President Nixon sought to use the IRS against his political opponents, according to New York University's Tax Law blog.",
      "\"Congress acted to put in place ironclad guarantees against such abuses and a bipartisan consensus emerged to ensure the privacy of every American's tax information,\" Robert Weissman, the co-president of consumer advocacy group Public Citizen, told CBS MoneyWatch. \"Musk and DOGE's attempt to gain access to IRS data raises profound questions about whether those protections are now being shredded.\"",
      "In an interview with Fox News, Stephen Miller, White House deputy chief of staff, said DOGE was seeking to find signs of tax fraud.",
      "\"We are talking about performing a basic anti-fraud review to ensure that people are not engaging in large scale theft of federal taxpayer benefits,\" he said. \"I mean, for example, we pay billions of dollars a year in child tax credit payments to illegal aliens, billions with a B. So these are systematic, programmatic reforms that we're talking about here.\"",
      "Delays to IRS tax refunds?",
      "Wyden and Warren also raised concerns about DOGE's impact on tax refunds this year.",
      "DOGE's work at the IRS comes as the tax agency is in the middle of the current tax season, when about 140 million individual tax returns are expected to be filed before the April 15 deadline. For many households, their tax refund check \u2014 which last year averaged more than $3,100 \u2014 is often their biggest cash influx of the year.",
      "\"We are also extremely concerned that DOGE personnel meddling with IRS systems in the middle of tax filing season could, inadvertently or otherwise, cause breakdowns that may delay the issuance of tax refunds indefinitely,\" the Feb. 17 letter said. \"Any delay in refunds could be financially devastating to millions of Americans who plan their budgets around timely refunds every spring.\"",
      "In the meantime, the IRS is preparing to fire thousands of probationary workers in the middle of tax season, the Associated Press reported, citing two sources familiar with the agency's plans. It's unclear how many IRS workers could be impacted, however, the AP noted. Federal workers in a probationary period typically have less than one year on the job and have not yet gained civil service protection.",
      "The cuts would come even as IRS employees were told they would not be able to participate in the Trump administration's earlier \"deferred resignation\" offer until after the tax filing deadline had passed.",
      "A letter sent earlier this month to IRS workers said that \"critical filing season positions in Taxpayer Services, Information Technology and the Taxpayer Advocate Service are exempt\" from the administration's buyout plan until May 15.",

After online sportsbooks became available, searches spiked to 61% over expectations and persisted for year.",

      "Meta has removed over a dozen fraudulent, sexualized images of famous female actors and athletes after a CBS News investigation found a high prevalence of AI-manipulated deepfake images on the company's Facebook platform.",
      "Dozens of fake, highly sexualized images of the actors Miranda Cosgrove, Jeanette McCurdy, Ariana Grande, Scarlett Johansson and former tennis star Maria Sharapova have been shared widely by multiple Facebook accounts, garnering hundreds of thousands of likes and many reshares on the platform.",
      "\"We've removed these images for violating our policies and will continue monitoring for other violating posts. This is an industry-wide challenge, and we're continually working to improve our detection and enforcement technology,\" Meta spokesperson Erin Logan told CBS News in a statement emailed on Friday.",
      "How to spot deepfake images online",
      "How to spot deepfake images online",
      "An analysis of over a dozen of these images by Reality Defender, a platform that works to detect AI-generated media, showed that many of the photos were deepfake images \u2014 with AI-generated, underwear-clad bodies replacing the bodies of celebrities in otherwise real photographs. A few of the images were likely created using image stitching tools that do not involve AI, according to Reality Defender's analysis.",
      "\"Almost all deepfake pornography does not have the consent of the subject being deepfaked,\" Ben Colman, co-founder and CEO of Reality Defender told CBS News on Sunday. \"Such content is growing at a dizzying rate, especially as existing measures to stop such content are seldom implemented.\"",
      "CBS News has sought comments from Miranda Cosgrove, Jeanette McCurdy, Ariana Grande, and Maria Sharapova on this story. Johansson declined to issue any comment, according to a representative for the actor.",
      "Under Meta's Bullying and Harassment policy, the company prohibits \"derogatory sexualized photoshop or drawings\" on its platforms. The company also bans adult nudity, sexual activity and adult sexual exploitation, and its regulations are intended to block users from sharing or threatening to share non-consensual intimate imagery. Meta has also rolled out the use of \"AI info\" labels to clearly mark content that is AI manipulated.",
      "But questions remain over the effectiveness of the tech company's policing of such content. CBS News found dozens of AI-generated, sexualized images of Cosgrove and McCurdy still publicly available on Facebook even after the widespread sharing of such content, in violation of the company's terms, was flagged to Meta.",
      "One such deepfake image of Cosgrove that was still up over the weekend had been shared by an account with 2.8 million followers.",
      "The two actors \u2014 both former child stars on the Nickelodeon show \"iCarly,\" which is owned by CBS News' parent company Paramount Global \u2014 are the most prolifically targeted for deepfake content, based on the images of public figures that CBS News has analyzed.",
      "Meta's Oversight Board, a quasi-independent body that consists of experts in the field of human rights and freedom of speech, and makes recommendations for content moderation on Meta's platforms, told CBS News in an emailed statement that the company's current regulations around sexualized deepfake content are insufficient.",
      "The Oversight Board cited recommendations it has made to Meta over the past year,\u00a0 including urging the company to make its rules clearer by updating its prohibition against \"derogatory sexualized photoshop\" to specifically include the word \"non-consensual\" and to encompass other photo manipulation techniques such as AI.",
      "The board has also recommended that Meta fold its ban on \"derogatory sexualized photoshop\" into the company's Adult Sexual Exploitation regulations, so moderation of such content would be more rigorously enforced.",
      "Asked Monday by CBS News about the board's recommendations, Meta pointed to the guidelines on its transparency website, which show the company is assessing the feasibility of three of four recommendations from the oversight board and is implementing one of its suggestions, though Meta noted in its statement on its site that it is currently ruling out changing the language of its \"derogatory sexualized photoshop\" policy to include the phrase \"non consensual.\" Meta also says it is currently unlikely   to move its \"derogatory sexualized photoshop\" policy to within its Adult Sexual Exploitation regulations.",
      "Meta noted in its statement that it was still considering ways to signal a lack of consent in AI-generated images. Meta also said it was considering reforms to its Adult Sexual Exploitation policies, to \"capture the spirit\" of the board's recommendations.",
      "\"The Oversight Board has made clear that non-consensual deepfake intimate images are a serious violation of privacy and personal dignity, disproportionately harming women and girls. These images are not just a misuse of technology \u2014 they are a form of abuse that can have lasting consequences,\" Michael McConnell, an Oversight Board co-chair, told CBS News on Friday.",
      "\"The Board is actively monitoring Meta's response and will continue to push for stronger safeguards, faster enforcement, and greater accountability,\" McConnell said.",
      "Meta is not the only social media company to face the issue of widespread, sexualized deepfake content.",
      "Last year, Elon Musk's platform X temporarily blocked Taylor Swift-related searches after AI-generated fake pornographic images in the likeness of the singer circulated widely on the platform and garnered millions of views and impressions.",

    "published": "Sat, 15 Feb 2025 08:48:53 -0500",
    "summary": "The Trump administration is firing thousands of federal workers on probationary status, or those without civil service protections.",
    "story": [
      "Probational federal employees who lost their jobs on Thursday as part of the Trump administration's mass\u00a0firing of government workers\u00a0expressed shock and anger at the terminations, which they contend will hurt the government's ability to provide services.",
      "President Trump is moving quickly to shrink the U.S. federal government \u2014 the nation's largest employer \u2014 saying he is slashing wasteful spending and pushing to make the nation's civil workforce more responsive to his administration's policies. Federal workers in a probationary period typically have less than one year on the job and have not yet gained civil service protection.",
      "Federal workers who received termination notices on Thursday described receiving nonpersonalized emails informing them they had been removed from their position, with little communication from their supervisors. The workers said they had entered public service because of a commitment to serve the public interest, whether by helping protect consumers from predatory financial services or by supporting veterans.",
      "\"We had all received these notices that cites probationary regulations and says we're being let go because 'you are not fit for continued employment because your ability and skills do not fit the agency's needs,'\" Elizabeth Aniskevich, an attorney with the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau, told CBS News.",
      "A termination letter provided to CBS News by a former employee at the Department of Veterans Affairs informed the worker that his job was ending because \"you have not demonstrated that your further employment at the agency would be in the public interest.\"",
      "The VA worker, who had previously held federal jobs across different agencies for more than a decade, said he was dismayed to learn that he was considered a probationary worker after taking the Veterans Affairs job last fall, as it reset his government employment.",
      "\"Basically the gist [of the termination letter] is laying out I was a probationary employee, what my rights of appeal are, but my continued employment was no longer in the public interest,\" said the VA worker, who spoke on condition of anonymity out of concern that speaking publicly could jeopardize his chances of finding another government job. \"I came into the house \u2014 probably for a couple weeks my wife and I joked, 'Did I still have a job?' \u2014 I told her, and I lost it. It's devastating.\"",
      "Another VA employee, who told CBS News his work was rated as \"outstanding\" in his most recent performance review, said receiving an impersonal termination letter was hurtful.",
      "\"It feels like a copy/paste mass firing that takes nothing into account of the people, the human cost,\" said Greg House, 34, a disabled veteran who was terminated from his job at the VA's public affairs office in Salt Lake City, a job that he started in March 2024. He added, \"The idea that the federal workforce is too bloated feels like a scapegoat more than anything else. Nobody joins the federal government to get rich.\"",
      "The U.S. Office of Personnel Management (OPM) has instructed agencies to report their final numbers of fired probationary employees by 8 p.m Eastern time on Tuesday, according to a source familiar with the matter.",
      "The White House press office didn't immediately respond to a request for comment.",
      "Unions claim firings are illegal",
      "Five unions for government employees have sued Mr. Trump and other officials in his administration over the firing of probationary workers, alleging the move is illegal because it violates procedures for making \"reductions in force,\" a formal process used by government agencies to dismiss employees.",
      "Reductions in force, or RIFs, can be made based on a number of issues, such as if there's not enough work or funding for federal workers, according to OPM.",
      "Mr. Trump's order \"directs agencies to promptly engage in RIFs for none of the specified, allowable reasons, but instead for the purpose of 'eliminating waste, bloat and insularity,'\" the lawsuit claims, citing the president's Feb. 11 executive order for widespread layoffs of government workers.",
      "Some experts are pushing back on the idea that the government workforce is too large, pointing out that federal employment has grown little since 1980. Prior to the firings, some agencies and services had already been grappling with staffing shortages, including the Veterans Health Administration.",
      "Impact on services",
      "The VA employee who was fired Thursday said he took exception to Mr. Trump's claim that the terminations would make the government more efficient, noting that his group, which had been trying to fill several empty positions, had more work than they could handle.",
      "\"We are under-resourced as it is, so cutting jobs won't do it,\" he said, adding that the firings will directly impact veterans. \"We have ongoing projects to try to construct and repair facilities to help veterans \u2014 we're already behind.\"",
      "A Food and Drug Administration employee \u2014 who also requested anonymity because she's in a probationary period in her job but hasn't received a termination letter \u2014 expressed concern that the firings would slow essential work, both because of the loss of skilled employees and a hit to employee morale.",
      "\"We're rather leanly staffed \u2014 the people on some of these teams have a tremendous workload,\" she said. \"It'll slow down things like drugs approvals ... it'll have a tremendous, terrible impact on access to drugs and generic drugs.\"",
      "Because many of the probationary workers are younger employees, the firings could add to long-term problems facing the federal workforce, where twice as many workers are over age 60 than under 30, said Elizabeth Linos, the Emma Bloomberg associate professor of public policy and management at Harvard's Kennedy School.",
      "\"This will exacerbate the existing human capital crisis if probationary employees are more likely to be young, and more likely to have the skills that a 21st century government operation needs,\" she said.",
      "Where jobs are getting cut",
      "As of May 2024, the most recent data available, about 216,000 federal employees had been in their jobs for less than one year, according to government data from the U.S. Office of Personnel Management.",
      "The government agency with the most probationary employees is the VA, with about 56,000 workers bearing that designation, OPM data shows. The VA on Friday said it had fired more than 1,000 employees. The agency didn't respond to a request for comment about whether more firings could be coming.",
      "\"Make no mistake \u2014 Trump is looking to fire probationary employees because it is easy, not because it is good for veterans or cost-effective,\" Sen. Richard Blumenthal, a Democrat from Connecticut who serves on the Senate Committee on Veterans' Affairs, told CBS News in a statement. \"In fact, it is a massive waste of taxpayer dollars to fire employees the department just invested months into recruiting, vetting and training.\"",
      "Department of Health and Human Services officials expect most of the agency's roughly 5,200 probationary employees to be fired Friday, Feb. 14, under the Trump administration's move to get rid of nearly all probationary employees, according to an audio recording of a National Institutes of Health department meeting obtained by the Associated Press.",
      "In that meeting, an NIH office director told employees that some probationary staff with specialized skills might retain their positions. Probationary staff being terminated would receive an email Friday afternoon, the AP reported, citing the recording.",

    "story": [
      "Washington \u2014 The Trump administration on Thursday intensified its sweeping efforts to\u00a0shrink the size of the federal workforce, the nation's largest employer, by ordering agencies to lay off nearly all probationary employees who hadn't yet gained civil service protection \u2014 potentially affecting hundreds of thousands of workers.",
      "In addition, workers at some agencies were warned that large workplace cuts would be coming.",
      "The decision on probationary workers, who generally have less than a year on the job, came from the Office of Personnel Management, which serves as a human resources department for the federal government. The notification was confirmed by a person familiar with the matter, who spoke on condition of anonymity because they weren't authorized to discuss it publicly.",
      "Even workers in the personnel office itself weren't immune: Dozens of probationary employees at OPM were told on a Thursday afternoon group call that they were being dismissed and then instructed to leave the building within a half-hour, according to another person who likewise spoke on condition of anonymity.",
      "It's expected to be the first step in sweeping layoffs. President Trump signed an executive order Tuesday that told agency leaders to plan for \"large-scale reductions in force.\"",
      "Elon Musk, to whom the president has given wide leeway to slash government spending with his Department of Government Efficiency, called Thursday for the elimination of whole agencies.",
      "\"I think we do need to delete entire agencies as opposed to leave a lot of them behind,\" Musk said via a videocall to the World Governments Summit in Dubai, United Arab Emirates. \"If we don't remove the roots of the weed, then it's easy for the weed to grow back.\"",
      "Everett Kelley, the president of the American Federation of Government Employees representing federal workers, said the administration \"abused\" the probation status of workers \"to conduct a politically driven mass firing spree, targeting employees not because of performance, but because they were hired before Trump took office.\"",
      "Thursday's order was an expansion of previous directions from OPM, which told agencies earlier this week that probationary employees should be fired if they weren't meeting high standards. It's not clear how many workers are currently in a probationary period. According to government data maintained by OPM, as of March 2024, 220,000 workers had less than a year on the job \u2014 the most recent data available.",
      "The firing of probationary employees began earlier this week and has included the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau and the Department of Education workers.",
      "At least 39 were fired from the Education Department on Wednesday, according to a union that represents agency workers, including civil rights workers, special education specialists and student aid officials.",
      "The layoffs also hit Department of Veterans Affairs researchers working on cancer treatment, opioid addiction, prosthetics and burn pit exposure, Sen. Patty Murray, a Washington state Democrat, said Thursday.",
      "Murray said in a statement that she heard from VA researchers in her state who were told to stop their research immediately, \"not because their work isn't desperately needed, but because Trump and Elon have decided to fire these researchers on a whim.\"",
      "The VA announced Thursday that it had laid off more than 1,000 non-\"mission critical\" probationary workers and the move would \"save the department more than $98 million per year, and VA will redirect all of those resources back toward health care, benefits and services for VA beneficiaries.\"",
      "Half of the Centers of Disease Control and Prevention's Epidemic Intelligence Service officers \u2014 a group known as\u00a0the CDC's \"disease detectives\" \u2014 were among the cuts made Friday, multiple health officials tell CBS News.",
      "The Trump administration also moved Friday to fire more than 400 employees at the Department of Homeland Security.",
      "Public Employees for Environmental Responsibility, a group that defends government workers, said the Agriculture Department's Food Safety and Inspection Service would be hit especially hard by laying off probationary employees because it has trouble recruiting inspectors required to be present at all times at most slaughterhouses.",
      "The civilian federal workforce, not including military personnel and postal workers, is made up of about 2.4 million people. While about 20% of the workers are in Washington D.C. and the neighboring states of Maryland and Virginia, more than 80% live outside the Capitol region.",
      "Layoffs are unlikely to yield significant deficit savings. When the Congressional Budget Office looked at the issue, it found the government spent $271 billion annually compensating civilian federal workers, with about 60% of that total going to workers employed by the departments of Defense, Homeland Security and Veterans Affairs.",
      "The government could, in theory, cut all those workers and still run a deficit of over $1 trillion that would continue to grow as tax revenues are needed to keep up with the growing costs of Social Security and Medicare.",
      "Elaine Kamarck, a senior fellow at the Brookings Institution, said firing employees on probation is flawed because it targets younger workers.",
      "\"Baby Boomers are retiring right and left, so actually the people you want to keep are probably most of the people who are right now on probation,\" said Kamarck, who worked in former President Bill Clinton's Democratic administration when about 426,000 federal jobs were cut over more than eight years in a deliberative effort aimed at reinventing government. \"They're younger and presumably have better skills, and that's who you want.\"",
      "Mr, Trump's initial attempt to downsize the workforce was the deferred resignation program, commonly described as a \"buyout,: which offered to pay people until Sept. 30 if they agreed to quit. The White House said 75,000 people signed up, and a federal judge cleared a legal roadblock for the program Wednesday.",
      "However, the number of workers who took the offer was less than the administration's target, and Mr. Trump has made it clear he would take further steps.",
      "Employees at the National Science Foundation and Housing and Urban Development Department were told this week that large reductions, in some cases a halving of the workforce, would be coming, according to a person familiar with the situation who spoke on condition of anonymity because they were not authorized to discuss it.",
      "The order the president signed Tuesday stipulated that government functions not required by law would be prioritized for cuts and hiring will be restricted. With exceptions for functions such as public safety, only one employee can be added for every four who leave. In addition, new hires would generally need approval from a representative of the DOGE, expanding the influence of Musk's team.",
      "Mr. Trump has praised Musk's work to slash federal spending.",
      "The Republican president has also been sharply critical of federal workers, especially those who want to keep working remotely, though his administration is simultaneously working to cut federal office space and ordering the termination of worksite leases throughout the government.",
      "\"Nobody is gonna work from home,\" Mr. Trump said Monday. \"They are gonna be going out, they're gonna play tennis, they're gonna play golf, they're gonna do a lot of things. They're not working.\"",

      "\"In absolute terms, the federal workforce is slightly smaller than it was 50 years ago, even though the U.S. population has increased by two-thirds during that time period,\" noted Elaine Kamarck, a senior fellow at the Brookings Institution who managed the Clinton Administration's National Performance Review, an effort to cut government spending in the 1990s, in a Jan. 28 report.",
      "In the 1940s, the federal workforce represented 4.5% of non-farm workers, a share that's dwindled to 1.5% today, according to CEPR's analysis.",
      "How efficient is the federal workforce?",
      "There's no overarching measure of the efficiency of the federal workforce, Linos of Harvard's Kennedy School noted. But agencies typically review their own operations to identify gaps that affect their ability to provide services.",
      "The federal workforce's efficiency should be measured on whether agencies are delivering the services they've been tasked to handle, she added. In recent years, many agencies have added data-driven measurements to determine whether they are providing those services to Americans.",
      "For instance, the Social Security Administration's most recent annual performance report identified long wait times for callers as a trouble spot, and added that it would like to shave the hold times to 12 minutes on average from its 34 minute on-hold time for fiscal year 2024. But that \"aspirational goal\" was being evaluated amid a hiring freeze, the report added.",
      "The Social Security Administration, which last year served a record 68 million beneficiaries, is working with its smallest staff in 50 years, former Social Security Commissioner Martin O'Malley said in November congressional testimony.",
      "To be sure, the U.S. government suffers from various types of inefficiencies, with a 2024 U.S. Government Accountability Office\u00a0report\u00a0estimating that as much as $521 billion annually is lost to fraud, or about 8% of federal spending.",
      "Federal spending also has ballooned in recent years, although much of the increase is due to higher spending on Social Security and paying interest on federal debt,\u00a0according\u00a0to the Committee for a Responsible Federal Budget.",
      "What agencies have the most federal workers?",
      "The U.S. Department of Veterans Affairs has the most federal workers, with more than 487,000 employees, according to data from the U.S. Office of Personnel Management, or OPM. That's followed by the Department of Homeland Security, with more than 222,000 workers; and the U.S. Army, with 221,000 employees.",
      "Some of the agencies that have been targeted by Mr. Trump are relatively small by comparison. For instance, the president is considering an executive order to dismantle the U.S. Department of Education, which has about 4,200 employees.",
      "Where are federal workers based geographically?",
      "Only about 7% of federal workers are located in Washington, D.C., proper, according to a 2024 Congressional Research Service report. But when adding the federal workers located in Virginia and Maryland, the larger Washington, D.C., metro area represents about 20% of the entire government workforce.",
      "Roughly 80% of federal workers are located outside the Washington, D.C., metropolitan area, and civil service employees are employed in every U.S. state, the CRS report noted.",
      "While Washington, D.C., proper has the largest number of federal workers, at about 162,000, other states aren't far behind: California employs about 147,000 federal workers, while Texas has about 130,000.",
      "Additional states with sizable federal workforces include Florida, at about 94,000, and Georgia, with almost 80,000 federal workers, the analysis found.",
      "What does the typical federal worker earn?",
      "The average annual salary of federal workers tops $106,000, Pew Research Center found, citing OPM data.",
      "Federal salaries skew into the six figures because many civil service workers hold college or professional degrees, and are highly trained. The largest share of federal workers are employed in the medical field \u2014 physicians and nurses who work for the VA, for instance.",
      "Others are professionals such as accountants and attorneys who might be able to earn more if they worked for private employers. For instance, the Commodity Future Trading Commission, which regulates futures contracts and other derivatives, pays its employees an average of $235,910. About 40% of its workforce is comprised of attorneys, Pew found.",
      "How could a much smaller federal workforce affect Americans?",
      "Services could degrade if enough federal workers are cut or resign, Harvard's Linos said. But Americans would still expect a certain level of service, such as getting their benefits paid on time or getting a passport on a timely basis.",
      "To address that issue, the federal government could turn to private-sector contractors to pick up the slack, she added. \"That's more costly \u2014 you end up paying a higher wage to private sector workers with less accountability,\" she noted.",
      "A hit to public services could heighten negative public sentiment about the federal government, Linos added. Public trust in the federal government has declined for decades, falling from about 77% of people in the 1960s who trust the government to do what is right to about 22% today, according to the Pew Research Center.",
      "\"We tell people the government is bloated, the day-to-day experience gets worse, and that feeds the narrative that the government is useless,\" she said.",

    "summary": "America's trading partners keep their markets to closed to U.S. exports, White House says in ordering up plan to impose global tariffs.",
    "story": [
      "President Trump on Thursday signed a memorandum directing his administration to weigh reciprocal tariffs, threatening to impose levies on U.S. imports from nations that put higher duties on American products.",
      "\"I've decided for purposes of fairness that I will charge a reciprocal tariff,\" Mr. Trump said in the Oval Office at a proclamation signing. \"It's fair to all. No other country can complain.\"",
      "The Trump administration has argued that its tariff policies would level the competitive playing field for U.S. and foreign manufacturers, although the new taxes would probably be shouldered by U.S. shoppers and businesses either directly or indirectly.",
      "Tariffs, which act as a tax on foreign goods, could lead to higher prices, which are rarely if every welcomed by Americans, and having more import duties on the horizon comes against a backdrop of inflation flaring up once again. Consumer prices in January\u00a0accelerated\u00a0to 3% on an annual basis, signaling the Federal Federal's push to drive inflation down to a 2% annual rate has petered out, at least for now.",
      "Deutsche Bank analysts said in a research note earlier this week that proceeding with reciprocal U.S. tariffs poses \"additional upside risks to the inflation outlook.\"",
      "Trade negotiations",
      "The tariff hikes would vary for affected countries, with a goal of starting new trade negotiations, the Associated Press reported. A senior White House official who spoke to the wire service on condition of anonymity said the reviews required to move forward with the tariffs could be finished within a number of weeks, although the process could take longer.",
      "The plan \"will seek to correct long-standing imbalances in international trade and ensure fairness across the board,\" the White House said in a statement about the tariffs. \"Gone are the days of America being taken advantage of: this plan will put the American worker first, improve our competitiveness in every area of industry, reduce our trade deficit, and bolster our economic and national security,\" it proclaimed.",
      "The announcement came before a meeting between Mr. Trump and Narendra Modi, prime minister of India, a country that could be targeted by U.S. tariffs. Modi has recently sought to assuage the Trump administration's concerns regarding trade issues, moving to cut import India's tariffs on some motorbikes and bourbon whiskey, while also agreeing to receive planes carrying undocumented migrants.",
      "President Trump has placed an additional tariff on Chinese imports for what he says is that nation's role in producing opioid fentanyl. He has also readied tariffs on Canada and Mexico that could take effect next month, after being paused 30 days. Mr. Trump also this week announced 25% tariffs on steel and aluminum that are scheduled to take effect in March.",
      "Applying a matching tariff against select U.S. trading partners is likely an alternative to imposing a more sweeping levy, according to economists. Argentina, Brazil, India and Turkey have the biggest gaps in tariffs with the U.S., trade data shows.",
      "\"While most developed markets would come out relatively unscathed, emerging markets would suffer a greater loss of competitiveness, with India, Brazil and Turkey looking among the most exposed,\" Shilan Shah, deputy chief emerging markets economist with Capital Economics, told investors in a report. \"It is probable that their governments (among others) would provide concessions to President Trump in an attempt to prevent reciprocal tariffs from being imposed.\"",

      "Indeed, as many as 3 in 4 U.S. homeowners could be underinsured, reports CBS News national consumer correspondent Ash-har Quraishi. That means more Americans should get to know their insurance policies, said Jennifer Gray Thompson, CEO of the nonprofit After the Fire USA.",
      "\"Well, the first thing you have to do is actually read your policy, and most of us don't do that, and so really encourage you to either sit down with somebody who is an expert in insurance \u2014 your underwriter [the insurance company] will be able to do this with you,\" Thompson told Quraishi.",
      "How much coverage do I need?",
      "Determining how much insurance you have, versus what you need to rebuild your a home in case of a disaster, is relatively straighforward. Start by taking the dollar amount of your policy coverage limit and dividing that by the square footage of your house or apartment.",
      "The resulting figure should equal the average construction cost per square foot in your area \u2014 a dollar amount Quraishi said you can find by doing an online search for \"construction cast per square foot,\" along with your zip code.",
      "For those who discover they have no protection of any kind of natural disaster, or after doing the math find that they're not sufficiently covered, the next step should be to get the maximum amount of coverage they can.",
      "\"Do go to your underwriter and ask,\" Thompson said. \"Max out on your insurance \u2014 it does cost us a little bit more every single month, but it's just incredibly important. Some people won't call because they're afraid of being dropped. Do not do that.\"",
      "Make a list of all your things",
      "Your home insurance policy should also cover possessions, also known as contents insurance. To be sure you're fully covered, make a list of all of your belongings, along with their estimated value.

    "summary": "Senate Majority Leader John Thune announced that the upper chamber will move forward with a vote on a budget proposal focused on border security, defense and energy.",
    "story": [
      "Washington \u2014 Senate Majority Leader John Thune announced Tuesday that the Senate will move forward with a vote on a budget proposal to begin enacting President Trump's agenda this week, moving ahead of Republicans in the House who are pursuing a competing plan.",
      "\"It's time to act on the decisive mandate the American people gave to President Trump in November,\" Thune said in a post on X Tuesday afternoon, adding that \"[s]ecuring the border, rebuilding our defense, and unleashing American energy\" will begin \"this week.\"",
      "The Senate's budget resolution is the first of two the chamber intends to pursue under the reconciliation process. The first is focused on border security, defense and energy, while the second will address the extension of the 2017 tax cuts.",
      "The House is also moving forward with its own budget resolution, which would address the border security, defense, energy and tax priorities in a single bill. That could see a vote on the House floor as soon as next week.",
      "The Senate Budget Committee marked up its resolution last week, voting to advance it to the floor on Wednesday. During the committee meeting, the panel's chairman Sen. Lindsey Graham of South Carolina touted the legislation, outlining that it would allow $175 billion to be spent on border security and $150 billion on military capabilities, while instructing committees to find reconciliation-compliant offsets to cut mandatory spending outside of Social Security.",
      "Graham acknowledged that while \"there's been a bit of debate between the House and the Senate about what to do and why,\" he decided to move forward with the budget resolution due to a \"sense of urgency\" about implementing Mr. Trump's immigration agenda.",
      "\"The problem we have now is that ICE is running out of money,\" Graham said. \"And to my colleagues in the House, I hope you can pass one big beautiful bill meeting the priorities of President Trump and what we've been promising to do as a party. But we've got to move on this issue.\"",
      "The House also advanced its own budget proposal out of committee last week, which includes up to $4.5 trillion in tax cuts, spending cuts of at least $1.5 trillion and an increase of the debt ceiling by $4 trillion. The House is away this week on recess and plans to bring its own resolution when lawmakers return next week.",
      "Thune's announcement on Tuesday that the Senate will vote on the proposal as soon as this week marks a step forward. But approving the budget resolution is just one hurdle in the reconciliation process.",
      "Reconciliation allows lawmakers to bypass the 60-vote threshold in the Senate that makes advancing partisan legislation extremely difficult. But in order to use it, lawmakers must first approve identical budget resolutions through both chambers and direct committees to craft bills reconciling spending with the new budget goals. The legislation can ultimately include only provisions dealing with taxes, spending or the debt limit, and any new spending must be paid for. The Senate parliamentarian must also sign off on the package, and settles disputes over whether a provision has direct budgetary consequences.",
      "Despite support among Senate Republicans for a two-bill approach, House Republicans have argued that passing two pieces of legislation carries a wider margin for error, given the narrow GOP majority in the lower chamber.",
      "Senate Democrats have expressed opposition to the budget resolution. During the committee markup, Sen. Patty Murray of Washington called the resolution \"pro-billionaire, anti-middle class,\" while Sen. Ron Wyden of Oregon warned of potential cuts to Medicaid, saying he expects an \"effort to keep the Medicaid cuts hidden behind the curtain, but they're going to come sooner or later.\"",

      "Washington \u2014 The head of the criminal division in the U.S. Attorney's Office in Washington, D.C, has resigned her post, the latest in a string of Justice Department officials to leave under the Trump administration.",
      "In an email obtained by CBS News, Denise Cheung notified her colleagues Tuesday morning that she is stepping down. \"I took an oath of office to support and defend the Constitution and I have executed this duty faithfully during my tenure, which has spanned through numerous Administrations,\" the email said.",
      "Cheung did not specify a reason for her departure in her email.",
      "Her decision follows a flurry of resignations by prosecutors in New York and officials at Justice Department headquarters last week, who stepped down to protest a directive from the acting deputy attorney general to drop the case against New York Mayor Eric Adams.",
      "As leader of the criminal division at the D.C. U.S. Attorney's Office, Cheung had sweeping oversight over national security cases, violent crimes prosecutions and other major investigations, including many of the cases related to the attack on the Capitol on Jan. 6, 2021.",

    "story": [
      "Riyadh, Saudi Arabia \u2014 Senior officials from Russia and the U.S. met in Saudi Arabia Tuesday to begin talks on improving ties and negotiating an end to the war in Ukraine. As CBS News correspondent Holly Williams reports, some felt the Trump administration had granted Vladimir Putin some degree of victory just by agreeing to hold the high-level meeting with his regime as the war he ignited with his full-scale invasion of Ukraine on Feb. 24, 2022, grinds on.",
      "That sentiment may be felt most acutely by the leaders of Ukraine, who were not invited to participate in the initial discussion about the fate of their nation.",
      "Delegations led by U.S. Secretary of State Marco Rubio and Russian Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov met behind closed doors at the Diriyah Palace in Riyadh. The meeting marked another significant step in President Trump's move to reverse three years of U.S. policy focused on isolating Russia over its war on Ukraine, and it is meant to pave the way for a likely meeting between Mr. Trump and Putin.",
      "Speaking to reporters after the meeting, U.S. State Department spokesperson Tammy Bruce said the U.S. and Russian delegations had agreed to establish a \"consultation mechanism to address irritants to our bilateral relationship,\" and Rubio told reporters that would include a re-staffing of the two nations' respective embassies.",
      "Bruce said Rubio and Lavrov had agreed to appoint \"high-level teams to begin working on a path to ending the conflict in Ukraine as soon as possible in a way that is enduring, sustainable, and acceptable to all sides.\" Rubio said the respective embassies in Washington and Moscow would need to be re-staffed, as \"we're going to need to have vibrant diplomatic missions that are able to function normally in order to be able to continue these conduits.\"",
      "Neither Bruce's statement nor a full read-out on the meeting provided by the State Department said anything about involving Ukraine or its European neighbors in the negotiations. The State Department said only that Mr. Trump was, \"the only leader in the world who can get Ukraine and Russia to agree to\" a ceasefire.",
      "Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy said Monday that his country wouldn't accept the outcome of any negotiations conducted without Kyiv's involvement.",
      "Speaking to reporters after the meeting, Waltz suggested Ukraine's government would have a say, calling it \"common sense\" that \"if you're going to bring both sides together, you have to talk to both sides.\"",
      "\"We are absolutely talking to both sides,\" Waltz said, noting Mr. Trump's recent phone call with Zelenskyy, right after he spoke with Putin last week. He also noted Rubio's recent meetings with European officials and the fact that British Prime Minister Keir Starmer is due in Washington next week, saying, \"the facts will continue to push back on this notion that our allies haven't been consulted... they are being consulted, literally, almost on a daily basis, and we'll continue to do so.\"",
      "Rubio told the reporters the European Union was \"going to have to be at the table at some point, because they have sanctions [against Russia] as well.\"",
      "Mr. Trump earlier this month upended U.S. policy toward Ukraine and Russia by saying he and Putin had agreed in a phone call to begin negotiations on ending the war, leaving many Ukrainians feeling betrayed as they seemingly had no say in the matter.",
      "Rubio was accompanied Tuesday by U.S. national security adviser Mike Waltz and Special Envoy Steve Witkoff, while Lavrov sat next to the Kremlin's foreign affairs adviser, Yuri Ushakov.",
      "The talks marked a significant expansion of U.S.-Russian contacts nearly three years into a war that has seen relations fall to the lowest level in decades.",
      "\"The economic aspect of the discussions\"",
      "Bruce said Rubio and Lavrov had also agreed Tuesday to ongoing cooperation toward economic and investment opportunities \"which will emerge from a successful end to the conflict in Ukraine.\"",
      "In a possible indication of how significant a factor those \"opportunities\" could be in the negotiations, senior Russian businessman Kirill Dmitriev, a Western-educated banker who now heads a government-created investment fund, was also expected to take part in the talks on Tuesday, according to Russian media.",
      "\"I will be responsible for the economic aspect of the discussions,\" Dmitriev was quoted as saying by the Interfax news agency ahead of the talks in Riyadh. \"The figure that we are voicing for the first time now is that American business has lost more than $300 billion by leaving the Russian market,\" he said, apparently referring to the impact of sanctions imposed on Russia under former President Biden.",
      "\"Finding joint economic paths, positive solutions to issues, is extremely important, mainly for the U.S. and for many other countries that are beginning to understand that the Russian market is extremely attractive and that it is necessary to be present in it,\" he said, adding that he hoped for \"a positive dialogue.\"",
      "\"We see that President Trump is very actively solving a large number of problems in the world and we hope that the Russian Federation's position will be heard very clearly and the dialogue will continue,\" Dmitriev said, according to Interfax.",
      "Dmitriev, who studied at Stanford and Harvard before working early in his career at Goldman Sachs, previously served as an interlocutor between Moscow and Washington during Mr. Trump's first term in office.",
      "Ukrainians, Europeans sidelined from talks",
      "The recent U.S. diplomatic blitz on the war has sent Kyiv and key allies scrambling to ensure a seat at the table amid concerns that Washington and Moscow could press ahead with a deal that won't be favorable to them.",
      "France called an emergency meeting of European Union countries and the U.K. on Monday to decide how to respond. French President Emmanuel Macron on Tuesday said he spoke by phone to Mr. Trump and Zelenskyy following the meeting.",
      "\"We seek a strong and lasting peace in Ukraine,\" Macron wrote on X. \"To achieve this, Russia must end its aggression, and this must be accompanied by strong and credible security guarantees for the Ukrainians,\" he said as he vowed to \"work on this together with all Europeans, Americans, and Ukrainians.\"",
      "Before that meeting, Starmer said for the first time Monday that the U.K. could deploy troops to Ukraine to help secure an eventual peace. Sweden also indicated a willingness Monday to deploy forces to Ukraine to keep an eventual peace.",
      "While other European powers declined to make explicit commitments, calling discussions about deploying peacekeepers to Ukraine premature, Poland's Prime Minister Donald Tusk ruled out sending Polish troops to the neighboring nation.",
      "Ahead of the meeting in France, Tusk did stress that European powers should immediately spend more on defense.",
      "\"If we, Europeans, fail to spend big on defense now, we will be forced to spend 10 times more if we don't prevent a wider war,\" Tusk said on social media.",
      "A boost for \"the status of Saudi Arabia\"?",
      "Ahead of the Riyadh talks, Kirill Dmitriev, the head of the Russian Direct Investment Fund who the Kremlin said might join the meeting, underscored their importance in comments to The Associated Press.",
      "\"Good U.S.-Russia relations are very important for the whole world. Only jointly can Russia and the U.S. address lots of world problems, resolve for global conflicts and offer solutions,\" Dmitriev, who said he and his team would focus on economic issues at the talks, told the AP.",
      "The Saudi-owned satellite channel Al Arabiya, citing the Russian delegation, described Moscow's priority as \"real normalization with Washington.\"",
      "Diriyah Palace sits across the street from Riyadh's Diplomatic Quarter. It's also just next to the Ritz Carlton hotel, which became famous in 2017 after de facto leader Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman detained other princes and the country's elite there as part of what the royal court called a crackdown on corruption that also sidelined any potential challenge to his taking control of the kingdom.",
      "Hosting the talks is a major step toward a goal Prince Mohammed has pursued throughout the war \u2014 putting the kingdom in the middle of diplomatic negotiations. The Saudis helped in prisoner negotiations and hosted Zelenskyy for an Arab League summit in the kingdom in 2023. Zelenskyy likely will travel to Saudi Arabia later this week.",
      "For Prince Mohammed, once described as a \"pariah\" by former President Joe Biden over the 2018 killing of Washington Post journalist Jamal Khashoggi, hosting such talks burnish the otherwise-tarnished image the West has of him.",
      "Ahead of the summit, the Saudi daily newspaper Okaz described the moment as the \"world's eye on Riyadh.\"",
      "Writing in the London-based but Saudi-owned newspaper Asharq Al Awsat, journalist Mishari al-Dhaidi described the summit as \"a major step on the international political chess arena, revealing the status of Saudi Arabia and its positive influence for the benefit of all the people.\"",
      "The prince also has maintained close relations to Russia throughout its war on Ukraine, both through the OPEC+ oil cartel and diplomatically.",
      "Hosting the summit also balances the harsh criticism recently levied by the kingdom's tightly controlled media at Mr. Trump over his repeated comments that he wants the U.S. to \"own\" the Gaza Strip, which has been devastated by the Israeli military offensive there since the Oct. 7, 2023, Hamas attack. The Palestinians want Gaza and the West Bank for a future state, something backed by the wider Arab world and nearly all of the international community.",

      "In Florida and California, local media outlets reported on hundreds of protesters carrying out \"Not my Presidents Day\" protests. The \"No Kings\" theme was orchestrated by the 50501 Movement and marked the second set of protests criss-crossing the nation in less than two weeks. A similar nationwide event on Feb. 5 drew participants in dozens of cities. Both sets of rallies denounced Mr. Trump and billionaire adviser Elon Musk, the head of the White House's Department of Government Efficiency, known as DOGE, which the administration says is designed to slash federal spending.",
      "Nearly 1,000 people marched in the snow from the Statehouse in Boston to City Hall, chanting \"Elon Musk has got to go\" and other slogans. The temperature was below freezing, with wind chills in the teens.",

      "\"I thought it was important to be here on Presidents Day to demonstrate for what America stands for,\" said Emily Manning, 55, a Boston engineer who came to the rally with her two teenage sons. \"American values are not the values of the plutocracy or the limited few rich people.\"",
      "Organizers of Monday's protests, which were focused on state capitals and major cities including Washington, D.C.; Orlando, Florida; and Seattle, said they were targeting \"anti-democratic and illegal actions of the Trump administration and its plutocratic allies.\"",
      "One sign at the rally that attracted hundreds in the nation's capital said, \"Deport Musk Dethrone Trump.\"",
      "Many demonstrations were slated for cities where temperatures were well below freezing as a polar vortex worked its way across the country.",
      "The rallies followed a series of executive orders from Mr. Trump and came just days after\u00a0job cuts across federal agencies as part of an effort to reduce the government workforce. Many of those administration actions are facing legal challenges.",
      "In Phoenix, hundreds of protesters gathered in front of the Capitol carrying signs reading \"No Kings\" and \"Resist Fascism.\" Security barred protesters from entering the building after a few tried to get inside. Demonstrators were seeking access to a state Senate committee hearing on legislation that would require law enforcement officers across the state to support federal immigration policy.",
      "Protest organizer December Archer said her goal was to keep the event civil. She quickly came between someone trying to enter the Statehouse and a security guard who pushed the protester back through the doorway.",
      "\"We're trying to make sure everything stays civil and stays respectable because again, we're here to make a statement, not be the statement,\" Archer said.",
      "A state Senate committee heard the measure in a packed room and it passed in a party-line vote,\u00a0CBS Phoenix affiliate KPHO-TV reports.",
      "The station quoted the bill's sponsor, Senate President Warren Petersen, as saying, \"After the past four years of lawlessness at our border, it is imperative that every level of government supports efforts to safeguard our communities from the harms of illegal immigration. Arizona is a border state, and as such, we need to empower our sworn agents to enforce our laws and assist the Trump Administration's efforts on this front.\"",
      "Critics say the measure, and several other anti-illegal immigration bills, promote racial profiling and family separation and waste taxpayer dollars.",

Altman was told King had been resistant to giving DOGE officials access to the database.",

    "story": [
      "In Fresno, California, social media rumors about impending immigration raids at the city's schools left some parents panicking - even though the raids were all hoaxes. In Denver, a real immigration raid at an apartment complex led to scores of students staying home from school, according to a lawsuit. And in Alice, Texas, a school official incorrectly told parents Border Patrol agents might board school buses to check immigration papers.",
      "President Trump's immigration policies are already affecting schools across the country, as officials find themselves responding to rising anxiety among parents and their children, including those who are here legally. Mr. Trump's executive actions vastly expanded who is eligible for deportation and lifted a ban on immigration enforcement in schools.",
      "While many public and school officials have been working to encourage immigrants to send their children to school, some have done the opposite. Meanwhile, Republicans in Oklahoma and Tennessee have put forward proposals that would make it difficult - or even impossible - for children in the country illegally and U.S.-born children of parents without documentation to attend school at all.",
      "As they weigh the risks, many families have struggled with separating facts from rumor.",
      "Anxiety spreading",
      "In the Alice Independent School District in Texas, school officials told parents that the district \"received information\" that U.S. Border Patrol agents could ask students about their citizenship status during field trips on school buses that pass through checkpoints about 60 miles from the Texas-Mexico border. The information ended up being false.",
      "Angelib Hernandez of Aurora, Colorado, began keeping her children home from their schools a few days a week after Mr. Trump's inauguration. Now she doesn't send them at all.",
      "She's worried immigration agents will visit her children's schools, detain them and separate her family.",
      "\"They've told me, 'Hopefully we won't ever be detained by ourselves,'\" she said. \"That would terrify them.\"",
      "Hernandez and her children arrived about a year ago and applied for asylum. She was working through the proper legal channels to remain in the U.S., but changes in immigration policies have made her status tenuous.",
      "In the past week, her fears have intensified. Now, she says, her perception is \"everyone\" - from Spanish-language media to social media to other students and parents - is giving the impression that immigration agents plan to enter Denver-area schools. The school tells parents that kids are safe. \"But we don't trust it.\"",
      "Immigration and Customs Enforcement agents aren't known to have entered schools anywhere. But the possibility has alarmed families enough that some districts are pushing for a change in the policy allowing agents to operate in schools.",
      "Denver Public Schools has sued the Department of Homeland Security, accusing the Trump administration of interfering with the education of young people in its care. Denver took in 43,000 migrants from the southern border last year, including children who ended up in the city's public schools. Attendance at schools where migrant kids are concentrated has fallen in recent weeks, the district said in the lawsuit, saying the immigration raid at a local apartment complex was a factor.",
      "The support Denver schools have given to students and families to help through the uncertainty involves \"tasks that distract and divert resources from DPS's core and essential educational mission,\" lawyers for the district said in the lawsuit.",
      "Some pushing tougher stands",
      "Around the country, conservatives have been questioning whether immigrants without legal status should even have the right to a public education.",
      "Oklahoma's Republican state superintendent, Ryan Walters, pushed a rule that would have required parents to show proof of citizenship - a birth certificate or passport - to enroll their children in school. The rule would have allowed parents to register their children even if they couldn't provide proof, but advocates say it would have strongly discouraged them from doing so. Even the state's Republican governor, Kevin Stitt, thought the rule went too far - and vetoed it.",
      "In Tennessee, Republican lawmakers have put forward a bill that would allow school districts to decide whether to admit students without papers. They say they hope to invite legal challenges, which would give them a chance to overturn a four-decade-old precedent protecting the right of every child in the country to get an education",
      "The implications of immigration policy for U.S. schools are enormous. Fwd.us, a group advocating for criminal justice and immigration reform, estimated in 2021 that 600,000 K-12 students in the U.S. lacked legal status. Nearly 4 million students - many of them born in the U.S. - have a parent living in the country illegally.",
      "Afraid to go to school",
      "Immigration raids have been shown to impact academic performance for students - even those who are native-born. In North Carolina and California, researchers have found lower attendance and a drop in enrollment among Hispanic students when local police participate in a program that deputizes them to enforce immigration law. Another study found test scores of Hispanic students dropped in schools near the sites of workplace raids.",
      "In Fresno, attendance has dropped since Mr. Trump took office by anywhere from 700 to 1,000 students a day. Officials in the central California district have received countless panicked calls from parents about rumored immigration raids - including about raids at schools, said Carlos Castillo, chief of diversity, equity and inclusion at the Fresno Unified School District. The feared school raids have all been hoaxes.",
      "\"It goes beyond just the students who ... have citizenship status or legal status,\" Castillo said. Students are afraid for their parents, relatives and friends, and they're terrified that immigration agents might raid their schools or homes, he said.",
      "A school principal recently called Castillo in tears after a family reached out to say they were too afraid to go buy groceries. The principal went shopping for the family and delivered $100 in groceries to their home - and then sat with the family and cried, Castillo said.",
      "The district has been working with families to inform them of their rights and advise them on things like liquidating assets or planning for the custody of children if the parents leave the U.S. The district has partnered with local organizations that can give legal advice to families and has held almost a dozen meetings, including some on Zoom.",

    "title": "Trump administration begins FAA firings weeks after fatal D.C. plane crash",
    "published": "Tue, 18 Feb 2025 05:51:43 -0500",
    "summary": "The Trump administration has begun firing several hundred Federal Aviation Administration employees, upending staff on a busy air travel weekend.",
    "story": [
      "Washington \u2014 The Trump administration has begun firing several hundred Federal Aviation Administration employees, upending staff on a busy air travel weekend just weeks after a fatal mid-air collision at Ronald Reagan Washington National Airport in January.",
      "Probationary workers were targeted in late night emails on Friday notifying them they had been fired, David Spero, president of the Professional Aviation Safety Specialists union, said in a statement.",
      "\"It is shameful to toss aside dedicated public servants who have chosen to work on behalf of their fellow Americans,\" Spero said. \"These employees were devoted to their jobs and the safety critical mission of the FAA. This draconian action will increase the workload and place new responsibilities on a workforce that is already stretched thin.\"",
      "The impacted workers include systems specialists, safety inspectors, maintenance mechanics, administrative staff and more, the union said.",
      "Spero said messages began arriving after 7 p.m. on Friday and continued late into the night. More might be notified over the long weekend or barred from entering FAA buildings on Tuesday, he said.",
      "The employees were fired \"without cause nor based on performance or conduct,\" Spero said, and the emails were \"from an 'exec order' Microsoft email address\" \u2014 not a government email address.",
      "Transportation Secretary Sean Duffy said Monday in a post on X that \"the FAA alone has a staggering 45,000 employees. Less than 400 were let go, and they were all probationary, meaning they had been hired less than a year ago. Zero air traffic controllers and critical safety personnel were let go.\"",
      "In addition, a\u00a0Transportation Department spokesperson said in a statement that, \"The FAA continues to hire and onboard air traffic controllers and safety professionals, including mechanics and others who support them.\"",
      "News of the firings hit the FAA when it faces a shortfall in controllers. Federal officials have been raising concerns about an overtaxed and understaffed air traffic control system for years, especially after a series of close calls between planes at U.S. airports. Among the reasons they have cited for staffing shortages are noncompetitive pay, long shifts, intensive training and mandatory retirements.",
      "In the Jan. 29 fatal crash between a U.S. Army Black Hawk helicopter and American Airlines passenger jet, which is still under investigation, one controller was handing both commercial airline and helicopter traffic at the busy airport.",
      "Just days before the collision, President Trump had already fired all the members of the Aviation Security Advisory Committee, a panel mandated by Congress after the 1988 PanAm 103 bombing over Lockerbie, Scotland. The committee is charged with examining safety issues at airlines and airports.",
      "One FAA employee who was fired over the weekend suggested he was targeted for his views on Tesla and X, formerly Twitter, not as part of a general probationary-level sweep. Both are owned by Elon Musk, who is leading the president's effort to cut the federal government.",
      "Charles Spitzer-Stadtlander posted on LinkedIn that he was fired just after midnight Saturday, days after he started getting harassing messages on Facebook.",
      "\"The official DOGE Facebook page started harassing me on my personal Facebook account after I criticized Tesla and Twitter,\" Spitzer-Stadtlander wrote. \"Less than a week later, I was fired, despite my position allegedly being exempted due to national security.\"",
      "He added: \"When DOGE fired me, they turned off my computer and wiped all of my files without warning.\"",
      "Spitzer-Stadtlander said he was supposed to be exempted from the probationary firings because the FAA office he worked in focused on national security threats such as attacks on the national airspace by drones.",
      "The Musk-led Department of Government Efficiency did not immediately respond to the AP's request for comment.",
      "Duffy wrote on X on Sunday that a team from Musk's SpaceX would visit the FAA's command center in Virginia on Tuesday to get a first-hand look at the current system. Duffy also said he would be traveling to Oklahoma later in the week to visit the FAA's air traffic control training center \"to learn more about their education and how we can ensure that only the very best guide our aircrafts.\"",

    "story": [
      "The Trump administration wants the Supreme Court to permit the firing of the head of the federal agency dedicated to protecting whistleblowers, according to documents obtained Sunday that would mark the first appeal to the justices since President Trump took office.",
      "The emergency appeal is the start of what probably will be a steady stream from lawyers for the Republican president and his administration seeking to undo lower court rulings that have slowed his second-term agenda.",
      "The Justice Department's filing obtained by The Associated Press asks the conservative-majority court to lift a judge's court order temporarily reinstating Hampton Dellinger as the leader of the Office of Special Counsel.",
      "Dellinger has argued that the law says he can only be dismissed for problems with the performance of his job, none of which were cited in the email dismissing him.",
      "The petition came hours after a divided appeals court panel refused on procedural grounds to lift the order, which was filed Wednesday and expires on Feb. 26.",
      "The case is not expected to be docketed until after the Supreme Court returns from the Presidents Day holiday weekend. The justices would not act until Tuesday at the earliest.",
      "It's not clear what reception Mr. Trump will get from the conservative-dominated court that includes three justices he nominated in his first term.",
      "The case began last week when Dellinger sued over his removal as head of the Office of Special Counsel, which is responsible for guarding the federal workforce from illegal personnel actions, such as retaliation for whistleblowing. He was appointed by Democratic President Joe Biden and confirmed by the Senate to a five-year term in 2024.",
      "Dellinger said the office's work \"needed now more than ever,\" noting the \"unprecedented\" number of firings, without cause, of federal employees with civil service protections in recent weeks by the Trump administration.",
      "The administration argues that the order reinstating Dellinger for two weeks while the judge considers the case is an unacceptable intrusion on executive power. The brief cites the Supreme Court decision that gave Mr. Trump immunity from criminal prosecution and reflected a muscular view of executive power.",
      "The independent Office of Special Counsel is separate from Justice Department special counsels such as\u00a0Jack Smith, who are appointed by the attorney general for specific investigations, such as Smith's criminal investigation of Mr. Trump before he returned to the White House.",
      "Dellinger's firing was the latest move in Mr. Trump's sweeping effort to shrink and reshape the federal government, testing the limits of well-established civil service protections by\u00a0moving to dismantle federal agencies\u00a0and push out staffers.",

    "summary": "Britain and Sweden have become the first European nations to say they could send troops to help secure Ukraine after an end to the war there.",
    "story": [
      "European leaders gathered Monday in Paris for a hastily organized meeting to discuss how to react to recent diplomatic moves by the Trump administration pertaining to Ukraine. The leaders of Poland, Germany, the United Kingdom, Denmark, the Netherlands, Spain and the EU were among those attending.",
      "The talks were organized after U.S. Secretary of Defense Pete Hegseth announced the U.S. would be shifting its security priorities away from Europe, and President Trump said the U.S. would engage in unilateral talks with Russia aimed at ending the war in Ukraine.",
      "Ahead of the meeting, Britain's Prime Minister Keir Starmer said for the first time that the U.K. could deploy troops to Ukraine to help secure an eventual peace. He said he'd stress to other European leaders that, \"we have got to show we are truly serious about our own defense and bearing our own burden.\"",
      "\"We are facing a once-in-a-generation moment for the collective security of our continent,\" Starmer said in a weekend editorial in Britain's Telegraph newspaper. \"This is not only a question about the future of Ukraine \u2014 it is existential for Europe as a whole.\"",
      "He said the U.K. was prepared to \"play a leading role in accelerating work on security guarantees for Ukraine,\" including more military support and putting British troops on the ground as part of a peacekeeping force if necessary.",
      "\"I do not say that lightly. I feel very deeply the responsibility that comes with potentially putting British servicemen and women in harm's way. But any role in helping to guarantee Ukraine's security is helping to guarantee the security of our continent, and the security of this country,\" Starmer said, adding that \"U.S. support will remain critical and a U.S. security guarantee is essential for a lasting peace.\"",
      "\"The end of this war, when it comes, cannot merely become a temporary pause before Putin attacks again,\" Starmer said.",

      "Sweden also indicated a willingness Monday to deploy forces to Ukraine to keep an eventual peace, with the country's Foreign Minister Maria Malmer Stenergard stressing in a radio interview the need to first \"negotiate a fair and sustainable peace that respects international law, that respects Ukraine and that ensures above all else that Russia can't just withdraw and regroup and attack Ukraine or another country within a few years.\"",
      "\"When we have such a peace in place, it will need to be maintained, and for that our government is not ruling out anything,\" Stenergard said, according to the French news agency AFP.",
      "While other European powers declined to make explicit commitments, calling discussions about deploying peacekeepers to Ukraine premature, Poland's Prime Minister Donald Tusk ruled out sending Polish troops to the neighboring nation.",

    "summary": "The Trump administration has halted DOGE's firings of hundreds of federal employees working on the nation's nuclear weapons programs.",
    "story": [
      "The Trump administration has paused the firings of hundreds of federal employees working on the nation's nuclear weapons programs, in a reversal that has left workers confused and experts cautioning that DOGE's blind cost cutting will put communities at risk.",
      "Late Thursday afternoon, a number\u00a0probationary employees of the National Nuclear Security Administration were fired, a source in the Energy Department confirmed. This is the entity within the department that manages the nation's nuclear weapons stockpile, among other responsibilities. Three U.S. officials told The Associated Press up to 350 employees at the NNSA were abruptly laid off, with some losing access to email even before they'd learned they were fired, only to try to enter their offices on Friday morning to find they had been locked out. The officials spoke on the condition of anonymity for fear of retaliation.",
      "One of the hardest hit offices was the Pantex Plant near Amarillo, Texas, which saw about 30% of the cuts. Those employees work on reassembling warheads, one of the most sensitive jobs across the nuclear weapons enterprise, with the highest levels of clearance.",
      "The hundreds let go at NNSA were part of a DOGE purge across the Department of Energy that targeted about 2,000 employees.",
      "\"The DOGE people are coming in with absolutely no knowledge of what these departments are responsible for,\" said Daryl Kimball, executive director of the Arms Control Association, referencing Elon Musk's Department of Government Efficiency team. \"They don't seem to realize that it's actually the department of nuclear weapons more than it is the Department of Energy.\"",
      "By late Friday night, the agency's acting director, Teresa Robbins, issued a memo rescinding the firings for all but 28 of those hundreds of fired staff members.",
      "\"This letter serves as formal notification that the termination decision issued to you on Feb. 13, 2025 has been rescinded, effective immediately,\" said the memo, which was obtained by the AP.",
      "The accounts from the three officials contradict an official statement from the Department of Energy, which said fewer than 50 National Nuclear Security Administration staffers had been let go, referring to them as \"probationary employees\" who \"held primarily administrative and clerical roles.\"",
      "But that wasn't the case. The firings prompted one NNSA senior staffer to post a warning and call to action.",
      "\"This is a pivotal moment. We must decide whether we are truly committed to leading on the world stage or if we are content with undermining the very systems that secure our nation's future,\" deputy division director Rob Plonski posted to LinkedIn. \"Cutting the federal workforce responsible for these functions may be seen as reckless at best and adversarily opportunistic at worst.\"",
      "While some of the Energy Department employees who were fired dealt with energy efficiency and the effects of climate change, issues not seen as priorities by the Trump administration, many others dealt with nuclear issues, even if they didn't directly work on weapons programs. This included managing massive radioactive waste sites and ensuring the material there doesn't further contaminate nearby communities.",
      "That incudes the Savannah River National Laboratory in Jackson, South Carolina; the Hanford Nuclear Site in Washington state, where workers secure 177 high-level waste tanks from the site's previous work producing plutonium for the atomic bomb; and the Oak Ridge Reservation in Tennessee, a Superfund contamination site where much of the early work on the Manhattan Project was done, among others.",
      "Rep. Marcy Kaptur of Ohio and Sen. Patty Murray of Washington, both Democrats, called the firings last week \"utterly callous and dangerous.\"",
      "Not all of the NNSA staff who had been reinstated could be reached after they were fired, and some were reconsidering whether to return to work, given the uncertainty created by DOGE.",
      "Many federal employees who had worked on the nation's nuclear programs had spent their entire careers there, and there was a wave of retirements in recent years that cost the agency years of institutional knowledge.",
      "But it's now in the midst of a major $750 billion nuclear weapons modernization effort \u2014 including new land-based intercontinental ballistic missiles, new stealth bombers and new submarine-launched warheads. In response, the labs have aggressively hired over the past few years: In 2023, 60% of the workforce had been there five years or less.",
      "Edwin Lyman, director of nuclear power safety at the Union of Concerned Scientists, said the firings could disrupt the day-to-day workings of the agency and create a sense of instability over the nuclear program both at home and abroad.",
      "\"I think the signal to U.S. adversaries is pretty clear: throw a monkey wrench in the whole national security apparatus and cause disarray,\" he said. \"That can only benefit the adversaries of this country.\"",

    "summary": "President Trump has terminated the heads of the National Labor Relations Board and the Merit Systems Protection Board, sparking legal challenges over their removal.",
    "story": [
      "Washington \u2014 President Trump's firings of the members of independent agencies and boards have prompted a string of legal fights that could set the Supreme Court up to reconsider and potentially overturn a 90-year-old decision that shields certain executive branch officials from being removed after political shifts in the White House.",
      "Since returning to the presidency, Mr. Trump has terminated the heads of the National Labor Relations Board and the Merit Systems Protection Board, as well as the director of the Office of Government Ethics and the special counsel, Hampton Dellinger, who oversees the office that investigates whistleblower complaints.",
      "The officials learned of their firings through emails stating that they had been removed from their respective positions at their agencies, according to court filings.",
      "But in subsequent lawsuits challenging their removal, some of the officials have alleged that Mr. Trump violated federal laws passed by Congress that created the agencies and limited the president to removing their members only for cause \u2014 in cases of neglect of duty or malfeasance.",
      "The president has said the heads of executive branch agencies should share his administration's objectives, but the firings may have also been aimed at provoking these very legal challenges, with the ultimate goal of addressing the question to the Supreme Court.",
      "\"It really was kind of a matter of time before a test case made its way to the court, where the court would have a chance to overrule Humphrey's,\" Joel Alicea, a law professor at the Catholic University of America, told CBS News.",
      "Alicea was referring to the Supreme Court's 1935 decision in the case Humphrey's Executor v. United States, in which the court carved out an exception to the president's power to remove executive officers. William Humphrey, appointed to a second term on the Federal Trade Commission by President Herbert Hoover, was asked to resign by President Franklin Roosevelt. The new president then fired him, citing their policy differences, rather than dismissing him for cause. The case is referred to a Humphrey's Executor because he died not long after his firing, but the executors of his estate brought the case to pursue his back pay.",
      "In Humphrey's Executor, the Supreme Court found that Congress could impose for-cause removal protections to multi-member commissions of experts that are balanced along partisan lines and do not exercise any executive power. The high court recognized another exception in 1988, which applies to certain inferior officers who have limited duties and lack policymaking or significant administrative authority.",
      "In recent years, though, the Supreme Court has chipped away at its 1935 ruling and reasserted the president's power to remove executive branch officers at will. Most notably in 2020, the Supreme Court ruled that the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau's structure of a single leader removable only for inefficiency, neglect or malfeasance is unconstitutional.",
      "\"In our constitutional system, the executive power belongs to the president, and that power generally includes the ability to supervise and remove the agents who wield executive power in his stead,\" Chief Justice John Roberts wrote for the court's conservative majority. \"While we have previously upheld limits on the president's removal authority in certain contexts, we decline to do so when it comes to principal officers who, acting alone, wield significant executive power.\"",
      "Now, nearly five years later, the high court is on track to revisit the issue of the president's removal power and could overturn the nearly century-old ruling allowing Congress to protect the members of independent agencies from being fired at will.",
      "In what is likely to be the Trump administration's first\u00a0Supreme Court\u00a0emergency appeal of his second term, the solicitor general is expected to ask the high court to\u00a0permit Dellinger's firing, according to documents obtained Sunday.",
      "Two justices, Clarence Thomas and Neil Gorsuch, who was appointed by Mr. Trump, have already indicated that it's time for the Supreme Court to scrap its 1935 precedent.",
      "\"The decision in Humphrey's Executor poses a direct threat to our constitutional structure and, as a result, the liberty of the American people,\" Thomas wrote in a concurring opinion to its 2020 decision on the CFPB, which was joined by Gorsuch.",
      "Thomas, the longest-serving member of the court, said that in a future case, he \"would repudiate what is left of this erroneous precedent.\"",
      "Three more members of the court, Roberts and Justices Brett Kavanaugh and Samuel Alito, all have experience working in the executive branch that could have shaped their views on executive power.",
      "\"This has nothing to do with the justices' ideological leanings or which president appointed them,\" Alicea said. \"This has to do with deeply held views about the nature of presidential removal under Article II of the Constitution, and these are views that some of these justices have had for decades.\"",
      "At least one of the officials fired by Mr. Trump recognized that she may be part of a broader plan to target the Supreme Court's 1935 ruling. Gwynne Wilcox, the chair of the National Labor Relations Board, received an email on behalf of the president on Jan. 27 informing her and the agency's general counsel that they had been \"removed from the office of members of the National Labor Relations Board.\"",
      "But the National Labor Relations Act, passed by Congress in 1935, restricts the reasons for removal of board members to \"neglect of duty or malfeasance in office,\" and requires that they receive \"notice and hearing.\"",
      "Mr. Trump's firing of Wilcox was a \"blatant violation\" of that law, she wrote in a lawsuit challenging her removal. But Wilcox also said that the president's action was \"apparently designed to test Congress's power to create independent agencies like the board.\"",
      "\"Although Ms. Wilcox has no desire to aid the president in establishing a test case, she is also cognizant of the fact that, if no challenge is made, the president will have effectively succeeded in rendering the NLRA's protections \u2014 and, by extension, that of other independent agencies \u2014 nugatory,\" her lawyers wrote.",
      "Citing Humphrey's Executor, Wilcox's legal team wrote that Congress has relied on that decision for decades when structuring independent agencies and warned that \"abandoning it now could cast a cloud over a wide variety of agency decision-making.\"",
      "But Alicea said that if Humphrey's Executor is reversed, it would bring these agencies under the direction of the president.",
      "\"The American people will have more control over their own government by having a president who they elect that superintends the entire federal bureaucracy, and I think that's a much better and much healthier constitutional structure than what we've had since the New Deal, where you have agencies that are largely insulated from direct presidential control and oversight, and therefore less politically accountable to the American people,\" he said.",
      "The Trump administration, too, has laid out its roadmap: It plans to urge the Supreme Court to overrule Humphrey's Executor.",
      "In a letter to Sen. Dick Durbin, the top Democrat on the Judiciary Committee, dated Wednesday, acting Solicitor General Sarah Harris said the Justice Department believes certain for-cause removal provisions that apply to members of multi-member commissions are unconstitutional.",
      "The department, she wrote, will no longer defend the constitutionality of those provisions. Harris specifically pointed to the protections for members of three agencies that the Trump administration believes violate the Constitution: the Federal Trade Commission, the National Labor Relations Board and the Consumer Product Safety Commission.",
      "\"To the extent that Humphrey's Executor requires otherwise, the department intends to urge the Supreme Court to overrule that decision, which prevents the president from adequately supervising principal officers in the executive branch who execute the laws on the president's behalf, and which has already been severely eroded by recent Supreme Court decisions,\" Harris wrote.",
      "As acting solicitor general, Harris represents the federal government before the Supreme Court. Mr. Trump has nominated D. John Sauer, his former defense attorney, for the role but he has not yet been confirmed.",
      "Durbin, an Illinois Democrat, said in response to Harris' letter that it's been the law of the land for decades that members of bipartisan, independent agencies are protected from removal by the president and can only be terminated for cause.",
      "\"But under President Trump, the Justice Department will no longer defend these duly-enacted laws and will instead push the Supreme Court to overturn a nearly-century-old Supreme Court precedent upholding the constitutionality of these statutes,\" he said in a statement. \"This is a striking reversal of the Justice Department's longstanding position under Republican and Democratic presidents alike, but not surprising from an administration that is only looking out for wealthy special interests \u2014 not the American people.\"",

      "\"We stand ready to follow the president's lead on this and begin to explore ways, if those opportunities present itself, to begin a process toward peace,\" Rubio said on \"Face the Nation with Margaret Brennan\" on Sunday.",
      "On Monday morning, State Department spokesperson Tammy Bruce confirmed that Rubio, along with two other senior Trump administration officials, would meet the following day in Riyadh with a Russian delegation.",
      "Mr. Trump said last week that he had a \"lengthy and highly productive phone call\" with Russian President Vladimir Putin. The president announced that he was directing Rubio and other members of his national security team to \"immediately\" begin negotiations aimed at ending Russia's war with Ukraine. Mr. Trump also spoke with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy.",

      "Transcript: Secretary of State Marco Rubio on \"Face the Nation with Margaret Brennan\"",
      "Rubio, speaking from Israel where he met Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu on Sunday, landed in Saudi Arabia Monday. The top U.S. diplomat noted that his trip had been scheduled before Mr. Trump's calls with Putin and Zelenskyy. He was joined by national security adviser Mike Waltz and Steve Witkoff, Mr. Trump's Middle East envoy.",
      "The secretary of state said Putin had \"expressed his interest in peace\" during his call with Mr. Trump, whom he said had made clear, \"his desire to see an end of this conflict in a way that was enduring and that protected Ukrainian sovereignty.\"",
      "On Sunday, Mr. Trump told reporters that\u00a0Putin wants to end the war, adding that he was expecting to meet with the Russian leader in Saudi Arabia \"very soon.\"",
      "Asked whether he believes Putin is ready to negotiate and make concessions to bring an end to the fighting, Rubio said the call must be followed by action, and that \"the next few weeks and days will determine whether it's serious or not.\"",
      "\"One phone call does not solve a war as complex as this one,\" Rubio said. \"But I can tell you that Donald Trump is the only leader in the world that could potentially begin that process.\"",
      "Rubio, who also met Zelenskyy at the Munich Security Conference on Friday, said \"we'll see what happens over the next few days.\"",
      "\"A process towards peace is not a one-meeting thing. This war has been going on for a while,\" Rubio said. \"It's difficult, it's complicated, it's been bloody, it's been costly. So it will not be easy to end a conflict like this, and there are other parties at stake that have opinions on this as well.\"",
      "The comments come as retired Lt. Gen. Keith Kellogg, the U.S. special envoy for Ukraine and Russia, who would be involved in any potential peace talks, indicated that there would be parallel tracks of negotiations, with different parties handling talks with Russia and Ukraine separately.

      "MARGARET BRENNAN: I'm Margaret Brennan in Washington.",
      "And this week on Face the Nation: President Trump's national security team takes his MAGA movement to Europe. We will talk to Secretary of State Marco Rubio in his first Sunday show interview since taking office.",
      "Newly confirmed Trump administration officials took the president's shock- and-awe tour overseas last week. In Munich, the vice president blasted some of America's closest allies about their style of democracy.",
      "(Begin VT)",
      "J.D. VANCE (Vice President of the United States): The threat that I worry the most about vis-a-vis Europe is not Russia. It's not China. It's not any other external actor. And what I worry about is the threat from within.",
      "(End VT)",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Also on the agenda, pushing those same allies to make Europe great again by stepping up their efforts to protect Ukraine, while the administration says they will begin direct talks with Russia to end the war.",
      "Secretary of State Marco Rubio joins us from Israel, as the negotiations with Hamas to end that conflict enter a crucial stage.",
      "Back home, more pink slips for federal employees go out and the scrutiny of Elon Musk's role as the hatchet man for those agencies intensifies.",
      "Meanwhile, inflation is up. We will talk with the president's chief economic adviser about what the administration can do to curb it.",
      "It's all just ahead on Face the Nation.",
      "Good morning, and welcome to \"Face the Nation.\"",
      "We want to begin today with Secretary of State Marco Rubio, who is in Jerusalem on the second leg of his trip through Europe and the Middle East.",
      "Mr. Secretary, I know it's the evening hours there, and you've had a long day. We appreciate your time. You've got quite a busy schedule.",
      "You met earlier with Prime Minister Netanyahu. He said he's lockstep with the Trump administration, but he can't share details on \u2013 quote \u2013 \"when the gates of hell will be open if all our hostages are not released.\"",
      "Did he tell you he wants to keep talks going to get to phase two of this hostage deal?",
      "MARCO RUBIO (U.S. Secretary of State): Well, I think we share a common goal. We want to see every hostage released.",
      "Frankly, I think \u2013 and the president has said this \u2013 we want to see them out as soon as we possibly can. And \u2013 and, certainly, you know, the world has watched these images of people \u2013 and it's just heartbreaking to remember that some of them have been now almost two years there. It's a horrifying situation.",
      "So we coordinate and work very close with them. We share the goal that every hostage needs to come home, every single one, without delay. Obviously, the \u2013 there are details of how we're pursuing that and coordinating that we're not going to share publicly because we don't want to endanger the hostages and we don't want to endanger this process.",
      "But suffice it to say that, if it was up to us, every one of these hostages would be home right now, and we want it to happen as soon as possible.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: OK. So, the deal stands?",
      "SECRETARY MARCO RUBIO: Again, we want every hostage out as soon as possible.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: OK.",
      "SECRETARY MARCO RUBIO: We will \u2013 and we want to see them home.",
      "There are some that are supposed to \u2013 under the deal, there are some that are supposed to be released coming up next weekend. We expect that to happen, but we'd like to see them all come out. We're not going to \u2013 we're not in favor of waiting weeks and weeks.",
      "Now, that may be the process that's in place because of the deal, but we would like to see them all out as soon as possible, and we continue to coordinate. And that \u2013 that's what we'd like to see as the outcome.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Yes.",
      "SECRETARY MARCO RUBIO: Who wouldn't want all these hostages to be home and with their families?",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Understood.",
      "Want to ask you about Iran as well. President Trump has said he wants a diplomatic deal with Iran. Are you reaching out to them? And alongside that, does the U.S. support a preemptive strike by Israel on Iran to take out its nuclear program?",
      "SECRETARY MARCO RUBIO: Well, first of all, Israel will always have to act in what they believe is their national interest and their national defense.",
      "And so I'm not going to speak about whatever strategies they may have on this or any other topic. I will say that we don't have any outreach from Iran. We haven't seen any. And, ultimately, we've seen in the past that efforts that Iran has undertaken diplomatically have been only about how to extend the time frame that \u2013 but continue to enrich and re \u2013 and \u2013 and in addition to sponsor terrorism, in addition to build these long-range weapons, in addition to sow instability throughout the region.",
      "But let's be clear. There's been zero outreach or interest to date from Iran about any negotiated deal. Ideally, yes, I would love to wake up one day and hear the news that Iran has decided not to pursue a nuclear weapon, not to sponsor terrorism, and reengage in the world as a \u2013 as a \u2013 as a normal government.",
      "We've had no indication of any of that, not just now, but for 30 years.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: So you head from Israel to Saudi Arabia next. I know you'll be talking about Gaza, but we've also learned that Saudi Arabia is trying to facilitate this diplomacy with Russia about Ukraine.",
      "Which Russian officials do you expect to be meeting with? And what will the focus of your talks there be? Do you actually believe Vladimir Putin is ready to negotiate and make concessions?",
      "SECRETARY MARCO RUBIO: Well, here's what I know.",
      "I know President Trump spoke to Vladimir Putin last week. And, in it, Vladimir Putin expressed his interest in peace, and the president expressed his desire to see an end to this conflict in a way that was enduring and that protected Ukrainian sovereignty, and that was an enduring peace, not that we're going to have another invasion in three or four years.",
      "That's a good call. Now, obviously, it has to be followed up by action. So, the next few weeks and days will determine whether it's serious or not. Ultimately, one phone call does not make peace. One phone call does not solve a war as complex as this one.",
      "But I can tell you that Donald Trump is the only leader in the world that could potentially begin that process. Other leaders have tried. They have not been able to do so. When he ran in his campaign and he was elected as president, one of his promises was, he would work to bring an end to this conflict in a way that's sustainable and fair.",
      "And, obviously, you know, this is the first step in that process, but we have a long ways to go. Again, one call doesn't make it. One meeting wouldn't make it. This \u2013 there's a lot of work to be done. But I \u2013 I thought it has \u2013 you know, even the longest journey begins with the first step.",
      "So we'll see what happens from here, hopefully good things.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Who will you be meeting with?",
      "SECRETARY MARCO RUBIO: Well, nothing's been finalized yet. I was scheduled to be in Saudi Arabia anyways.",
      "We invited \u2013 we announced that trip a week ago, and \u2013 a week-and-a-half ago. So, ultimately, look, if at any point in time there's an opportunity to continue the work that President Trump started last week to begin to create an opening for a broader conversation, that it would involve Ukraine and would involve the end of the war, and would involve our allies all over the world, particularly in Europe, we're going to explore it, if that opportunity presents itself.",
      "I don't have any details for you this morning, other than to say that we stand ready to follow the president's lead on this and begin to explore ways, if those opportunities present itself, to begin a process towards peace.",
      "Now, a process towards peace is not a one-meeting thing. This war has been going on for a while.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Right.",
      "SECRETARY MARCO RUBIO: It's difficult. It's complicated. It's been bloody. It's been costly. So it will not be easy to end the conflict in this.",
      "And there are other parties at stake that have opinions on this as well. The European Union has sanctions as well. The Ukrainians are obviously fighting this war. It's their country, and they're on the front lines. So, one meeting isn't going to solve it.",
      "But I want to reiterate the president made clear he wants to end this war, and if opportunities present themselves to further that, we're going to take them if they present themselves. We'll see what happens over the next few days.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: But, to be clear, Keith Kellogg, who is the envoy appointed to help with these talks, says these are going to be parallel negotiations, meaning the Ukrainians and Russians aren't talking to each other yet.",
      "When you meet with your Russian counterpart, whoever that is, are you going to be sitting there arguing Ukraine's position?",
      "SECRETARY MARCO RUBIO: Well, first of all, I think that we have to understand is, right now, there is no process.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Right.",
      "SECRETARY MARCO RUBIO: What \u2013 what we have right now is a call between Putin and President Trump in which both sides expressed an interest in ending this conflict.",
      "I imagine there will be follow-up conversations to figure out what a process to talk about that would look like. And then, at that point, perhaps we can begin to share more details. So it's a bit premature. I know there's been a lot of reaction to it, because there's been no conversation about it, any serious conversation.",
      "But I want to go back to the point I made. President Trump ran. He was very clear. He thinks this war needs to end. And if he sees an opportunity to end it, which is what he's looking for, whether there is an opportunity or not, we're going to pursue it.",
      "Ultimately, it will reach a point when you are \u2013 if it's real negotiations, and we're not there yet, but if that were to happen, Ukraine will have to be involved, because they're the one that were invaded, and the Europeans will have to be involved because they're the \u2013 they have sanctions on Putin and Russia as well, and \u2013 and they've contributed to this effort.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Yes.",
      "SECRETARY MARCO RUBIO: We're just not there yet. We really aren't, but hopefully we will be, because we'd all like to see this war end.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: No doubt.",
      "The last administration did have contact through the intelligence agencies with Russia, but they didn't believe there was any proof that Vladimir Putin was interested in talks. You know the history with Vladimir Putin. He likes to use diplomacy as a cover to distract while he continues to wage war.",
      "Do you trust that this time is different?",
      "SECRETARY MARCO RUBIO: Yes, I don't think, in geopolitics, anyone should trust anyone. I think these things have to be verified through actions.",
      "I said yesterday that peace is not a noun. It's a verb. It's an action. You have to take concrete steps towards it. What I can tell you is, I know of no better negotiator in American politics than President Trump.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Yes.",
      "SECRETARY MARCO RUBIO: I don't \u2013 I think President Trump will know very quickly whether to say, is this a real thing or whether this is an effort to buy time.",
      "But I don't want to prejudge that. I don't want to foreclose the opportunity to end a conflict that's already cost the lives of hundreds of thousands and continues every single day to be increasingly a war of attrition on both sides.",
      "I think everyone should be celebrating the fact that we have an American president that is seeking to promote peace in the world, not start wars, but end them, in a way that's enduring.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Right.",
      "SECRETARY MARCO RUBIO: That's something we should be happy about. Whether it's possible or not, we're certainly willing, but it's not entirely up to us, obviously, but we'll find out.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Well, you did speak in a phone call with Russia's top diplomat, Sergey Lavrov. The Russian side claimed that you discussed restoring trade, which seemed to be a nod to sanctions, easing restrictions on diplomats, and other gestures like a high-level leaders meeting.",
      "Are you actually considering, is the Trump administration considering lifting sanctions on Russia?",
      "SECRETARY MARCO RUBIO: Well, the phone call was to establish communications that are consistent with the call the president made last week with Vladimir Putin, because if we are \u2013 if there is going to be the possibility of \u2013 of progress here towards peace, we are going to need to talk to the Russians.",
      "I mean, that is going to have to happen, and we're going to have to be able to be able to do it across our channels.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: About lifting sanctions, though?",
      "SECRETARY MARCO RUBIO: I also raised in that conversation concerns that \u2013 well, we didn't go into any details.",
      "I mean, what we just discussed is basically the ability to begin communicating. I had never spoken to Mr. Lavrov in my life, so it was an opportunity for us to begin to open that channel of communication, which, again, if there's the potential for peace here, that's a channel that has to exist.",
      "But let me add one more thing. I also raised the issue of our embassy in Moscow, which operates under very difficult conditions. I raised that because it's important. It's going to be very difficult to engage in communication with Russia about anything if our embassy is not functioning. And he raised concerns about his diplomatic mission in the United States.",
      "So, at a very basic level, if, in fact, there is going to be an opportunity here to pursue peace by engaging with the Russians, we're going to need to have functional embassies in Moscow and in Washington, D.C., and that's certainly something foreign ministers would talk about as a matter of normal course.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: I want to ask you about what happened in Munich, Germany, at the Security Conference.",
      "Vice President Vance gave a speech, and he told U.S. allies that the threat he worries about the most is not Russia. It is not China. He called it the threat from within, and he lectured about what he described as censorship, mainly focusing, though, on including more views from the right.",
      "He also met with the leader of a far-right party known as the AfD, which, as you know, is under investigation and monitoring by German intelligence because of extremism. What did all of this accomplish, other than irritating our allies?",
      "SECRETARY MARCO RUBIO: Why would our allies or anybody be irritated by free speech and by someone giving their opinion?",
      "We are, after all, democracies. The Munich \u2013 Munich Security Conference is largely a conference of democracies, in which one of the things that we cherish and value is the ability to speak freely and provide your opinions.",
      "And so I think if anyone's angry about his words, they don't have to agree with him, but to be angry about it, I think, actually makes his point. I thought it was actually a pretty historic speech. Whether you agree with him or not, I think the valid points he's making to Europe is, we are concerned that the true values that we share, the values that bind us together with Europe are things like free speech and democracy and our shared history in winning two World Wars and defeating Soviet communism and the like.",
      "These are the values that we shared in common. And, in that Cold War, we fought against things like censorship and oppression and so forth.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Right.",
      "SECRETARY MARCO RUBIO: And when you see backsliding, and you raise that, that's a very valid concern.",
      "We can't tell them how to run their countries. We are \u2013 he simply expressed in a speech his view of it, which a lot of people, frankly, share. And I thought he said a lot of things in that speech that needed to be said. And, honestly, I don't know why anybody would be upset about it.",
      "People are allowed \u2013 you know, you don't have to agree on someone's speech. I happen to agree with a lot of what he said, but you don't have to agree with someone's speech to \u2013 to at least appreciate the fact they have a right to say it and that you should listen to it and see whether those criticisms are valid.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Yes.",
      "SECRETARY MARCO RUBIO: I assure you, the United States has come under withering criticism on many occasions from many leaders in Europe, and we don't go around throwing temper tantrums about it.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Well, he was standing in a country where free speech was weaponized to conduct a genocide.",
      "And he met with the head of a political party that has far right views and some historic ties to extreme groups. The context of that was changing the tone of it. And you know that, that the censorship was specifically about the right.",
      "SECRETARY MARCO RUBIO: Well, I have to disagree with you. No, I have \u2013 I have to disagree with you.",
      "Free speech was not used to conduct a genocide. The genocide was conducted by an authoritarian Nazi regime that happened to also be genocidal because they hated Jews and they hated minorities and they hated those that they \u2013 they had a list of people they hated, but primarily the Jews. There was no free speech in Nazi Germany. There was none.",
      "There was also no opposition in Nazi Germany. They were a sole and only party that governed that country. So that's not an accurate reflection of history.",
      "I also think it's wrong \u2013 again, I go back to the point of his speech. The point of his speech was basically that there is an erosion in free speech and intolerance for opposing points of view within Europe, and that's of concern, because that is eroding. That's not an erosion of your military capabilities. That's not an erosion of your economic standing.",
      "That's an erosion of the actual values that bind us together in this transatlantic union that everybody talks about. And I think allies and friends and partners that have worked together now for 80 years should be able to speak frankly to one another in open forums without being offended, insulted, or upset.",
      "And I spoke to Foreign Ministers from multiple countries throughout Europe. Many of them probably didn't like the speech or didn't agree with it, but they were continuing to engage with us on all sorts of issues that unite us.",
      "So, again, at the end of the day, I think that, you know, people give all - - that is a forum in which you're supposed to be inviting people to give speeches, not basically a chorus where everyone is saying the exact same thing. That's not always going to be the case when it's a collection of democracies where leaders have the right and the privilege to speak their minds in forums such as these.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Mr. Secretary, I'm told that we are out of time. A lot to get through with you. We appreciate you making time today.",
      "SECRETARY MARCO RUBIO: Yes.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: We'll be back in a minute.",
      "(ANNOUNCEMENTS)",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: We want to turn now to the economy and inflation, which, compared to last January, ticked up about 3 percent last week.",
      "Kevin Hassett is the director of the National Economic Council, and he joins us now. Good morning to you, Director.",
      "KEVIN HASSETT (Director, National Economic Council): Good morning, Margaret. Good morning.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: So, I don't have to tell you, but the rest of the country saw their egg prices at the grocery store go up. We're now at a record high due to that bird flu outbreak, but also labor costs, and that's contributing to food costs overall.",
      "When will the administration get that outbreak under control?",
      "KEVIN HASSETT: Right.",
      "Well, what's going on, right, as you know, is that there is an inflation problem that's very large. We saw the Consumer Price Index come out, and we found out that the stagflation that was created by the policies of President Biden was way worse than we thought.",
      "Over the last three months, across all goods, including eggs, the average inflation rate was 4.6 percent, way above target, and an acceleration at the end of the Biden term.",
      "And, you know, this is really not just us. You could go look at Jason Furman, Larry Summers, economic advisers of President Biden kept saying, don't do this. You're going to cause massive inflation. In fact, Jason Furman has a very thought-provoking peace in \"Foreign Affairs\" right now calling the Biden economic record a tragedy.",
      "And this is them, not us, right? It's \u2013 so, now we've got a lot of things that we're doing to get ahold of it.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: You're talking about fiscal spending there.",
      "KEVIN HASSETT: Excuse me. Yes, that's right.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: You were talking about fiscal spending there. But\u2026",
      "KEVIN HASSETT: Well, where does inflation come from, right? And so what we're doing now is, we've \u2013 we've got, really, a multi-multi-faceted plan to end inflation.",
      "And I will go quickly, because I want to end with what we're doing with egg prices. But we're going to have a macroeconomic change that has supply-side tax cuts, so we have more supply, and we're going to reduce government spending, both through what DOGE is doing, and through congressional action.",
      "And so, therefore, the macroeconomic forces that Jason Furman said were a tragedy are going to be reversed. That's a good thing. Then we're also going to have a lot of energy production, a lot of deregulation. And then, finally, when needed, we're going to focus on the individual thing-by-thing pieces.",
      "And so, for example, you mentioned avian flu. President Biden didn't really have a plan for avian flu. Well, Brooke Rollins and I have been working with all the best people in government, including academics around the country and around the world, to have a plan ready for the president next week on what we're going to do with avian flu.",
      "In fact, I was editing the thing with them tomorrow. But \u2013 but the final thing \u2013 and then I will give it back to you. I promise not to filibuster.",
      "(LAUGHTER)",
      "KEVIN HASSETT: The question is, like, why did we do this? Why did we do this? That's what everybody's talking about.",
      "But the thing that I always start with when I'm looking at what we're doing, what the president wants us to do, is, why did they do that? Why did they do that?",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Right. Right.",
      "KEVIN HASSETT: And \u2013 and there are too many times where it feels like nobody thought about that in the press, or maybe\u2026",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Oh, gosh.",
      "KEVIN HASSETT: \u2026 the left wing economists. Why did they do that? Why did Biden print so much money and cause so much inflation? Why did he do it?",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Oh, Kevin.",
      "KEVIN HASSETT: That's \u2013 that's what I'm thinking about.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Kevin, you know, we talked about that on Face the Nation quite a lot. Quite a lot.",
      "KEVIN HASSETT: I don't want \u2013 mean to criticize you. OK, good for you.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: No, no, no.",
      "KEVIN HASSETT: Yes.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: So, next week, we'll see the plan on how to get avian flu \u2013 how to get bird flu, under\u2026",
      "KEVIN HASSETT: I could talk about it right now if you'd like to, yes.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Well, sure. What \u2013 what is the plan? Are you going to - - what are you going to do?",
      "KEVIN HASSETT: Yes, so \u2013 so, again, the \u2013 the Biden plan was to just, you know, kill chickens. And they spent billions of dollars just randomly killing chickens within a perimeter where they found a sick chicken.",
      "And so you go \u2013 I just went to the grocery store. I shop for our family, in part because I love to look at prices. And there were no eggs at the store yesterday, just a few. And \u2013 and so that happened because they killed all the chickens.",
      "And so what we need to do is have better ways, with biosecurity and medication and so on, to make sure that the perimeter doesn't have to kill the chickens, have a better, smarter perimeter. And so having a smart perimeter is what we're working on. And we're finalizing the ideas about how to do that with the best scientists in government.",
      "And that's the kind of thing that should have happened a year ago. And if it had, then egg prices would be, you know, a lot better than they are now.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: OK.",
      "KEVIN HASSETT: But the avian flu is a real thing.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Yes.",
      "KEVIN HASSETT: And, by the way, it's spread mostly by ducks and geese. And so think about it. They're killing chickens to stop the spread, but chickens don't really fly. The \u2013 the spread is happening from the geese and the ducks.",
      "And so why does it make any sense to have a big perimeter of dead chickens, when it's the \u2013 the ducks and the geese that are spreading it?",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Well, the Department of Agriculture policy has been to kill those chickens, as you know.",
      "KEVIN HASSETT: Right.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: But we'll watch the details of that.",
      "KEVIN HASSETT: Sure.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: But let's get back to something the president said.",
      "Higher interest rates, as you know, are part of that battle against inflation that the Federal Reserve has been waging. But, this past week, the president called for interest rates to be lowered. Why does he think that's going to lower your grocery prices?",
      "KEVIN HASSETT: Well, first of all, I \u2013 I want to say that I, just this weekend, have arranged to begin once again regular lunches with Jay Powell at the Federal Reserve.",
      "And Jay and I have a long and collegial relationship. And I'm going to go over there with him and the other governors. So we're going to talk about our views about what's going on, and listen to his. And that collegiality has been going on for four years when I was here before, and the president very much values that.",
      "I think that the \u2013 the thing about\u2026",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: But that's not to influence?",
      "KEVIN HASSETT: \u2026 lower interest rates \u2013 no, I'm going to talk about \u2013 well, Jay is going to \u2013 Jay is an independent person.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Right.",
      "KEVIN HASSETT: The Fed independence is respected. And \u2013 and the point is, the president's opinion is also \u2013 can be heard. He's the president of the United States.",
      "But here's the thing that I think is interesting, that if we get inflation under control, then that takes the pressure off the Fed. And one way to tell whether markets think, are we getting inflation under control, is to look at longer-term interest rates that the Fed doesn't affect directly.",
      "And if you look at it, the 10-year Treasury rate has dropped about 40 basis points\u2026",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Yes.",
      "KEVIN HASSETT: \u2026 over the last couple of weeks while we announced our plan to control inflation.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Well\u2026",
      "KEVIN HASSETT: That saved the American people about $40 billion, about $40 billion, just from talking about the stuff that we're about to do.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: OK.",
      "KEVIN HASSETT: That's pretty good.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Right, but the president's statement contradicts economic policy. As you know\u2026",
      "KEVIN HASSETT: No. Inflation \u2013 no. Inflation rates are already \u2013 I'm saying the interest rates are already lower by 40 basis points. So, Interest rates are lower. The one that matters\u2026",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: You're briefing the president on it. OK.",
      "KEVIN HASSETT: \u2026 the most for the economy is maybe the 5- or 10- year rate.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: But on\u2026",
      "KEVIN HASSETT: Those the ones that matter the most. And those are down already. So the president's right about that.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Before we run out of time, I really want to make sure I get to you on tariffs.",
      "KEVIN HASSETT: OK, sure.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Because there's concern that that will add to prices.",
      "KEVIN HASSETT: Sure.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Because they'll be added on to consumers and what they pay.",
      "How are these reciprocal tariffs going to work? The president was tweeting he wants to put them on, like, 175 different countries that have a VAT tax, a value-added tax.",
      "KEVIN HASSETT: You know, we're talking to leaders of other countries all the time.",
      "Last night, into the wee hours of their morning and kind of a late night for me, I was talking to Minister Reynolds from the U.K. about this very matter. But here's the way I would like to think about it, that, right now, U.S. companies are spending \u2013 are paying foreign governments about $370 billion a year in tax, and foreign companies are paying the U.S. government about $57 billion in tax.",
      "And a lot of it is because of the VAT. But if we didn't have to pay the foreign governments tax, over 10 years, it'd be about $5 trillion of tax that U.S. citizens don't have to pay. That would more than pay for the tax cuts that we're debating right now.",
      "And so if we get some of that money back, either through tariffs, or for \u2013 obviously, if they reduce the tariffs of that, then that's good for Americans. It's going to put more money in their pockets.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Yes.",
      "KEVIN HASSETT: And \u2013 and that's what President Trump is \u2013 is trying to do.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Kevin Hassett, I would like to have you come back, sit at the table\u2026",
      "KEVIN HASSETT: Always.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: \u2026 and talk through this in \u2013 in more detail at another time. We have to leave it there for today.",

      "The Munich Security Conference is an annual gathering of heads of state and international security policymakers. It's one of the biggest conferences. And one of the biggest topics this year was the war in Ukraine.",
      "We spoke to two lawmakers earlier from Munich, including House Intelligence Committee Republican Dan Crenshaw. We asked him about President Zelenskyy's views regarding what's needed in a potential peace deal.",
      "(BEGIN VT)",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: I understand that he has asked not just for continued military support now, but security assurances in the event of a peace deal. What can you tell him about what to expect from America?",
      "REPRESENTATIVE DAN CRENSHAW (R-TX): Well, I just - I just came from a lunch where General Kellogg spoke. He's the special envoy leading this effort to establish peace. And he's very clear that the kind of peace we're talking about is a lasting peace, which, of course, involves security assurances.",
      "And part of that process is figuring out exactly what that means. Even the Ukrainians are talking about what that means. There's a variety of options, per se.",
      "I think the Europeans have to play a huge role in that. One of the things that gets talked about a lot is where do - European forces actually acting as a peacekeeping force.",
      "The Ukrainians clearly have a seat at the table and then the United States will be the intermediary as we try to establish a peace deal.",
      "But the Europeans need to demand a seat at the table by being uncomfortably aggressive, which is something they haven't done. You should be threatening things to Putin that actually make you uncomfortable because that's how - that's the only language Putin speaks is power. And when General Kellogg is at that table with Putin, he's only got a finite amount of leverage. And there's only so much more leverage that the U.S. can - can impose. And if anybody can do it, I think it's Donald Trump. And he's already - he's already said that, that nothing is off the table. Vice President Vance said that, nothing is off the table, economic, military. They will use the amount of leverage they can.",
      "My message to European leaders is, if we want to win, if we want a better outcome for Ukraine at the end of these peace talks, you need to be uncomfortably aggressive. You need to, not just bolster your own defense spending, I mean because that's a long-term issue, that's a long-term investment -",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Yes.",
      "REPRESENTATIVE DAN CRENSHAW: You need to be talking about where you're going to be putting actual troops on the ground. Stop following our lead and actually take the lead. Let us be actually holding you back. That would be an ideal situation and vastly change the power dynamic when dealing with Putin.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: There already is a military security alliance known as NATO. You are saying you think there should be something else or some other entity providing security assurances for Ukraine?",
      "REPRESENTATIVE DAN CRENSHAW: European soldiers. I mean, look, Europeans send aid, right? They send weapons. They do the same things we do. They - they - they match it, barely. My argument to them is you shouldn't be matching it, you should be doubling it. You should be tripling it. It's your continent.",
      "Zelenskyy had a - gave a speech today. He talked about a European army, right? So, there's - there's a lot of talk about this. Of course, there's NATO. That's - that's a security - that's a - that's a defensive alliance.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Right.",
      "REPRESENTATIVE DAN CRENSHAW: That's - that's - that's some - that's not an army. That's - they did this - we're talking about different things here.",
      "The Europeans need to come together, in my opinion, and have just a much stronger message towards Putin instead of finger wagging at us about what we're willing to give or not give in a peace deal.",
      "Again, I tell them, look, if you want a seat at the table, earn it. The Ukrainians have earned it. The Ukrainians have impressed everybody for the last three years. They've fought valiantly and courageously. They've earned my respect. They earned that seat at the table. We need to listen to their - to what they want. We listened to Zelenskyy.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: OK. You said that both President Trump and Vice President Vance were clear, nothing is off the table. However, the defense secretary, Pete Hegseth, did seem, in Brussels, to take things quite explicitly off the table. He said the U.S. does not want Ukraine in NATO and that Ukraine would not return to its pre-2014 borders, which acknowledges giving up some of Crimea and potentially the east.",
      "Do you think offering concessions before negotiations begin is a good strategy here?",
      "REPRESENTATIVE DAN CRENSHAW: Yes, the - I think you have to listen to the White House as a whole. They walked - they walked those back and -",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Yes.",
      "REPRESENTATIVE DAN CRENSHAW: And - and made it clear that nothing is off the - nothing is off the table. So, no, you walk into a negotiation with everything on the table and I think that's exactly what this White House is doing.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Yes.",
      "REPRESENTATIVE DAN CRENSHAW: It's less than a month since this administration has been in power and they want to move fast. And everybody's a little nervous. But I think they should be much more optimistic than they should be nervous.",
      "You needed a seismic shift here. This was not a sustainable operation in Ukraine. If Kamala Harris had been president, you'd be going along the same lines, which is basically funding this war until every Ukrainian is dead. That's not an end that we can accept.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: So -",
      "REPRESENTATIVE DAN CRENSHAW: There has to be some talk of negotiation. And I'll remind the American people, too, from our perspective, from American strategic deterrent's perspective, even getting Putin to that table to talk about an end to the war is -",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Yes.",
      "REPRESENTATIVE DAN CRENSHAW: Is a massive strategic win for us because it establishes back our deterrents over time.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Well, do you know that he is actually committing to come to the table? We don't have a commitment to actually negotiate from Vladimir Putin.",
      "REPRESENTATIVE DAN CRENSHAW: No, we don't.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: OK.",
      "REPRESENTATIVE DAN CRENSHAW: You know what would be really helpful? What I said before, if the EU was uncomfortably aggressive about it.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: OK. Got it.",
      "REPRESENTATIVE DAN CRENSHAW: Again, Putin only responds to power. And this is - this is what I remind western leaders here, too. Western - westerners don't speak that language. Westerns talk about negotiations and, you know, and good moral values that we share and we believe each other.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Yes.",
      "REPRESENTATIVE DAN CRENSHAW: That's not how the east works. They only respond to power.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: So, OK, on that point, Vladimir Putin, it sounds like you would agree, is an accused war criminal. He is a dictator. There is a warrant out for his arrest, as you know. He invaded Ukraine. He is clearly a U.S. adversary.",
      "But this past week President Trump said he'd love to have Putin back in the G-8, which would make him, again, a peer global leader. President Trump floated inviting him to the U.S. or even visiting Russia himself. Do you think any of that is appropriate?",
      "REPRESENTATIVE DAN CRENSHAW: It's more appropriate than not talking to him for the last two years, which is what President Biden did. Who did that help? It hasn't - it hasn't gotten us anywhere.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Talking is different than inviting him to the United States.",
      "REPRESENTATIVE DAN CRENSHAW: Right. Sure. I mean, you can parse it out however you like. But the reality is, is you're going to have to get him to the table somehow, right? And there's a carrot and a stick approach. Trump can use a lot - can use a lot of leverage. And then the Europeans can use a lot more leverage. But you also have that carrot approach. And Trump is good at that. He's good at flattering people in order to get them to the table. That is what we need. Whether we like it or not, that's what we need.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: But flattering a very brutal dictator who is pretty cunning, frankly, you really think that's a winning strategy?",
      "REPRESENTATIVE DAN CRENSHAW: I mean, he's not that cunning. He's fought a - it was a war that has destroyed his society, killed hundreds of thousands of Russians. He's made a massive mistake and miscalculation. He's not - he's not as clever as maybe we are giving him credit for.",
      "I think let Trump do his campaign promise and play this out. Look, nobody is going to take advantage of Donald Trump. And General Kellogg made that very clear because that was a question Europeans asked him, you know, are we - are you going to sell out just to get a deal, just to get a deal because of the campaign promise. Kellogg just laughed at that. He's like, there is no way. There is absolutely no way that Donald Trump will be seen - he will not let himself go down in history as having sold out to Putin. He will not let that happen. He believes - just for the sake of his own legacy.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Right.",
      "REPRESENTATIVE DAN CRENSHAW: But he does care about lasting peace here and lasting European peace.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: But I think you know some of the things Europeans point to is the fact that the United States cut out our allied government in Afghanistan from the negotiation Donald Trump cut with the Taliban. They point back to that and say, don't do this again.",
      "REPRESENTATIVE DAN CRENSHAW: Sure. And I criticized that decision, too.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: OK.",
      "REPRESENTATIVE DAN CRENSHAW: But that's just not what's happening now. This is a vastly different situation. I mean Europeans have all sorts of opinions. The Ukrainians, I think, are very optimistic, as they should be. We've had some very good conversations. Some very realistic conversations. And I'm very excite and optimistic about what can happen here.",

      "(ANNOUNCEMENTS)",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: We also spoke with New Hampshire Democrat Jeanne Shaheen while she was in Munich, focusing on the negotiations to end the war in Ukraine, as well as bipartisan efforts in the Senate to help Ukraine.",
      "(BEGIN VT)",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: In terms of negotiations, there were some comments made by President Trump this week. The defense secretary said returning to Ukraine's pre-2014 borders is unrealistic. He's suggesting that maybe the east and another part of Ukraine and Crimea will be taken by Russia. Why do you think there was this plan to give concessions before talks begin?",
      "SENATOR JEANNE SHAHEEN (D-NH): Well, I think it was a mixed message coming from the administration. On the one hand you heard Secretary Hegseth saying they were going to take NATO off the table, that Ukraine needed to give up territory, and on the other hand you had Vice President Vance saying that everything should be on the table, including the possibility of putting boots on the ground in Ukraine.",
      "So, it's a mixed message. I hope that the upshot of that is that we are going to do everything we can to support Ukraine.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: In terms of what Congress can do, are your hands tied here or are some of your Republican colleagues willing to put something, perhaps, in an upcoming defense bill, for example, that might help Ukraine?",
      "SENATOR JEANNE SHAHEEN: Well, I think that's one option. One of the things that we're talking about doing right away is making some statements on the - the repossession of assets by Russia that are held in the United States and in Europe and the importance of having those assets go to Ukraine to help both with the execution of the military conflict, but also to think about rebuilding.",
      "Again, there's bipartisan support. There was bipartisan support for the bill and there's bipartisan support to continue to try and ensure that those assets from Russia get repaid to Ukraine because Russia is really the aggressor here and we need to hold Vladimir Putin accountable.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: You know, your Republican counterpart, Roger Wicker, he is the chair of the Armed Services Committee, was really sharp in his comments at Munich. He was saying, he was puzzled, he was disturbed by what the defense secretary, a member of his own party, had said about Ukraine. He was very clear that what Vladimir Putin is doing, he said, is absolutely out of Adolf Hitler's playbook. Those are sharp words considering the president of the United States says he wants to meet face-to-face to Vladimir Putin and possibly bring him to the White House.",
      "SENATOR JEANNE SHAHEEN: Well, they are sharp words and they are very much justified. Regardless of what President Trump may be doing to try and lay the groundwork for any future negotiations, the fact is there is strong bipartisan support in Congress to help Ukraine in this unfair war that Russia has initiated. And I think Senator Wicker's comments are very important.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: At the conference you're at, you were able to speak with European leaders. What are they saying to you about their view of America now?",
      "SENATOR JEANNE SHAHEEN: Well, we had a chance to meet with representatives from Britain, from Canada, not a European country but also very concerned about Ukraine, with people from the Balkan countries, with President Zelenskyy, obviously. And there is a great deal of concern about the U.S. position on Ukraine.",
      "At the panel that we had with President Zelenskyy, we talked about the importance of Europe and the United States acting in concert so that we can hold Putin accountable with sanctions so that we can - so that there is no daylight between the United States and our NATO allies and our European allies. Clearly that's what Vladimir Putin has been trying to do throughout this conflict, and we need to make it clear that that is not going to happen, that we are going to work together, and we are going to support Ukraine.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Does Congress need to be any part of approving this deal President Trump says he wants to take possession of some of the critical minerals that Ukraine has inside their territory? He says he wants to use that as sort of repayment for what the U.S. has spent on weapons.",
      "SENATOR JEANNE SHAHEEN: Well, I think there are some benefits to having the United States have some investments in Ukraine. That's part of what a critical minerals deal would do. It's not at all clear who - who has possession of those critical minerals. Some of them are in the eastern part of Ukraine where Russia controls the territory. Some of them are owned by private - actually oligarchs. There are several oligarchs who own a number of those critical mineral sites. So, I think those are details that have not yet been worked out and I have not seen the agreement that's been put in front of President Zelenskyy.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Well, we know Zelenskyy will be discussing that with other members of the administration. We'll stay tuned on that. But I do want to bring up something that we -",
      "SENATOR JEANNE SHAHEEN: He -",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Sorry. Go ahead.",
      "SENATOR JEANNE SHAHEEN: One of the things that, in our conversations with President Zelenskyy, President Zelenskyy reiterated nothing about Ukraine without Ukraine. And I - he got reassurances from the bipartisan senators that he met with that we agree Ukraine absolutely must be part of any negotiations between Russia and the United States.",

      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Last week seven federal prosecutors resigned in objection after the Justice Department directed them to drop the investigation into New York City Mayor Eric Adams, who is facing charges, including bribery and conspiracy. In her resignation letter, Danielle Sassoon, the acting U.S. attorney overseeing the case, said a dismissal amounted to a quid pro quo and that the DOJ, quote, \"proposes dismissing the charges against Adams in return for his assistance in enforcing the federal immigration laws.\"",
      "In response, then Acting Deputy Attorney General Emil Bove threatened her with an investigation into her conduct.",
      "Joining us now is Maryland Democrat Jamie Raskin. He's the top Democrat on the House Judiciary Committee.",
      "This episode is highly unusual. Is there anything that you, in your role, can do about this episode and what's happening inside Attorney General Bondi's Justice Department?",
      "REPRESENTATIVE JAMIE RASKIN (D-MD): Well, the Justice Department is at war with its own attorneys, its own prosecutors. And the whole episode is just saturated with corruption. It was a corruption prosecution and investigation, which led to a grand jury indictment against Eric Adams for bribery, conspiracy, other corruption charges. And then the new Department of Justice decided to squash the whole thing, basically saying to Adams, well, we will drop this case against you if you engage in certain kinds of political or policy accommodations with us.",
      "And then, in order to complete that deeply corrupt bargain, they had to try to coerce their own lawyers to do it. But, of course, the prosecutors were saying, nothing has changed in the facts of the case and nothing has changed in the law. In fact, additional evidence was found, meaning that they were going to revise and expand the original indictment, but instead they were told to kill it for political reasons.",
      "And so, you know, this is an outrageous violation of the rules of prosecutors and an offense against due process in a very dangerous first move for the Department of Justice to be making under the Trump people.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Mayor Adams, of course, claims there was no quid pro quo and that none of this was wrong, but there was the lead prosecutor, as well, on this case who resigned in objection to what's happening. But it's moving forward here. This is all now in the hands of a judge. Does he have leeway to prosecute?",
      "REPRESENTATIVE JAMIE RASKIN: So, first of all, just about Danielle Sassoon. I mean that's a very conservative U.S. attorney, and she couldn't take it. I mean you have the most conservative prosecutors in the country resigning in opposition to this steam roller on behalf of corruption. But it's not over yet because Judge Dale Ho does not have to accept the withdrawal of the charges, the dismissal of the charges, which seven Department of Justice attorneys resigned rather than be involved in. The head of the public integrity section, the head of the criminal division, five other lawyers said, no way, and they wrote very stinging rebukes of the attorney general and the Department of Justice in this case.",
      "So, Judge Ho has to accept this dismissal, but he may not. He may go ahead and try to appoint another prosecutor to go ahead and, you know, go through with the indictment that was handed down by a grand jury.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Well, Attorney General Bondi says there's nothing wrong here, saying it was President Biden's weaponized DOJ that went after Adams for political reasons, and only after he criticized President Biden's immigration policies.",
      "This is a fellow Democrat. Do you think he should be prosecuted? And how do you respond to that allegation?",
      "REPRESENTATIVE JAMIE RASKIN: Well, first of all, the attorney general did not cite any changes in the facts of the case. She did not cite any changes in the law, because neither occurred, nor did she cite any irregularities in the investigation or the prosecution.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: She's saying it's all made up.",
      "REPRESENTATIVE JAMIE RASKIN: Well, then she's - she's mimicking her boss then, who just lies as a matter of course. One would expect more from the attorney general of the United States.",
      "And, you know, this whole corruption attack that is an attack on the Department of Justice for engaging in corruption prosecutions could be impeachable in a different political environment. But the fact that Mayor Adams is a Democrat is neither here nor there for me. I'm against corruption across the board. It seems like Donald Trump wants to attract all of the corrupt politicians in America to his side.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: So in the Oval Office President Trump - you may have seen this image - he has hung a picture, a framed picture of the front page of \"The New York Post,\" that has his mugshot in it from that criminal case in New York. Yesterday he also tweeted, \"he who saves his country does not violate any law.\"",
      "He seems to believe that all those prosecutions against him were politically motivated and voters apparently didn't think it mattered. He was elected with a mandate. How do you convince the public that it does matter?",
      "REPRESENTATIVE JAMIE RASKIN: The dominant objective of this administration is corruption and lawlessness. The first thing that they did was they sacked 17 inspectors general. Those are the people who are actual corruption fighters within the departments and agencies. These are the people who ferreted out $91 billion worth of waste, fraud and abuse in the government.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: They argue it's within their political power to do so.",
      "REPRESENTATIVE JAMIE RASKIN: Oh, it - there's no doubt it is, but they sacked them. Actually, it's not within their political power to do so in a lawless way. They have to notify Congress first, 30 days in advance, and they have to set forth the specific reasons for why an inspector general is being fired. They never did that.",
      "And the reason, of course, is because they want to pursue agendas of corruption across the board. They're saying they're not going to enforce the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act. They are shutting down the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau, which has saved American consumers $31 million in bank overdraft charges, credit card late fees from corporations completely inflated and having nothing to do with the actual charges and so on. They're getting rid of anything in the government that supports consumers, that supports citizens against the rip-off artists who are their friends.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: And there's little Democrats can do to push back because you don't have any political power.",
      "REPRESENTATIVE JAMIE RASKIN: Well, we're winning in court. More than a dozen federal injunctions and temporary restraining orders have been issued against everything from their illegal seizure of computer data and every Americans' private data at the Treasury Department.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: OK.",
      "REPRESENTATIVE JAMIE RASKIN: To their illegal attempt to ban birthright citizenship in America.",

      "Last week, Acting Deputy Attorney General Emil Bove sent a memo that instructed prosecutors in Manhattan to abandon the indictment that charged Adams with\u00a0bribery, conspiracy and campaign finance violations, which he denied. Bove justified the decision by saying the case \"has unduly restricted Mayor Adams' ability to devote full attention and resources to the illegal immigration and violent crime.\" He also alleged that the prosecution was politically motivated due to Adams' criticism of the Biden administration.",
      "The directive prompted a revolt at the Justice Department that burst into public view when Danielle Sassoon, the acting head of the U.S. Attorney's Office in the Southern District of New York, resigned in protest rather than file a motion seeking to drop the case. She was soon joined by other top Justice Department officials. Different prosecutors ultimately filed a motion late Friday to abandon the charges.",
      "Sassoon alleged in her resignation letter that the Justice Department proposed dismissing the charges against Adams in return for his assistance in enforcing the federal immigration laws. Adams' attorney denied that he offered to help enact the president's deportation agenda in exchange for having his case dropped, saying the mayor's team \"offered nothing and the department asked nothing of us.\" In response to Sassoon's resignation, Bove also denied there was any quid pro quo, writing in a letter that Sassoon's allegation was \"false.\"",
      "On Sunday, Raskin said the Justice Department had to \"try to coerce their own workers\" to file the motion to drop the case, adding that \"they were told to kill it for political reasons\" although they said nothing had changed in the facts of the case.",
      "\"The Justice Department is at war with its own attorneys, its own prosecutors, and the whole episode is just saturated with corruption,\" Raskin continued.",
      "Adams, who pleaded not guilty to the charges, was set to stand trial in April, and faced up to 45 years in prison if convicted. He and Mr. Trump met in Florida before the president was sworn in last month.",
      "Raskin, who taught constitutional law for decades, noted that the back and forth is \"not over yet.\" He noted that Judge Dale Ho, who is overseeing the case, doesn't have to agree to withdraw the charges.",
      "\"He may not,\" Raskin said. \"He may go ahead and try to appoint another prosecutor to go ahead and go through with the indictment that was handed down by a grand jury.\"",
      "The Maryland Democrat said the fact that Adams is a member of his party is \"neither here nor there for me.\" He said he's \"against corruption across the board,\" while accusing the president of seeking to \"attract all of the corrupt politicians in America to his side.\"",

      "Washington \u2014 Rep. Dan Crenshaw, a Texas Republican, said European leaders need to have a \"much stronger message\" toward Russian President Vladimir Putin on Ukraine amid efforts to kickstart peace talks and an eventual deal to end the war.",
      "\"If we want to win, if we want a better outcome for Ukraine, at the end of these peace talks, you need to be uncomfortably aggressive,\" Crenshaw said of his message to European leaders on \"Face the Nation with Margaret Brennan.\"",
      "Crenshaw, speaking from the Munich Security Conference, was among a bipartisan group of lawmakers who met with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy at the annual security summit in recent days. They also heard from retired Lt. Gen. Keith Kellogg, the U.S. special envoy for Ukraine and Russia who is involved with handling the peace talks.",

      "Transcript: Rep. Dan Crenshaw on \"Face the Nation with Margaret Brennan\"",
      "The Texas Republican said Kellogg was \"very clear that what the kind of peace we're talking about is a lasting peace,\" which he said will involve security assurances. Crenshaw said exactly what that looks like is still being determined, while arguing that Europe must be a major player.",
      "Crenshaw said European countries need to not only bolster their defense spending, but also talk about \"where you're going to be putting actual troops on the ground.\"",
      "\"Stop following our lead and actually take the lead,\" Crenshaw said. \"Let us be actually holding you back. That would be an ideal situation, and vastly change the power dynamic when dealing with Putin.\"",
      "Crenshaw argued that if European leaders want a seat at the table, they should \"earn it.\"",
      "\"We listen to Zelenskyy,\" Crenshaw said. \"And I want to listen to other European leaders as well, but I want them to be uncomfortably aggressive, because that gives us more leverage in order to help Ukraine come out with a better outcome.\"",
      "The comments come as Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth has drawn criticism even among some Republicans in recent days for suggesting it was unrealistic for Ukraine to expect NATO membership. He also cast doubt that the country will be able to return to its pre-2014 borders, before Russia first invaded Ukraine and annexed Crimea. Hegseth later walked back those comments, saying that \"everything is on the table.\"",
      "Sen. Jeanne Shaheen of New Hampshire, the ranking Democrat on the Senate Foreign Relations Committee who also appeared on \"Face the Nation\" on Sunday, said the administration is sending a \"mixed message\" on Ukraine. She said she's hopeful that \"the upshot of that is that we are going to do everything we can to support Ukraine.\"",
      "But Crenshaw defended the White House's posture toward the possible peace talks, saying \"you have to listen to the White House as a whole,\" noting that the administration made clear that \"nothing is off the table.\"",
      "\"You walk into a negotiation with everything on the table. And I think that's exactly what this White House is doing,\" Crenshaw said, adding that \"there's a path forward here,\" although the details aren't yet clear.",
      "Crenshaw acknowledged that the U.S. hasn't yet received a commitment to negotiate from Putin, reiterating his request of European leaders to get \"uncomfortably aggressive\" with the Russian leader, who he said \"only responds to power.\"",

      "The following is the transcript of an interview with Democratic Rep. Jamie Raskin of Maryland\u00a0that aired on \"Face the Nation with Margaret Brennan\" on Feb. 16, 2025.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Last week, seven federal prosecutors resigned in objection after the Justice Department directed them to drop the investigation into New York City Mayor Eric Adams, who is facing charges including bribery and conspiracy. In her resignation letter, Danielle Sassoon, the acting U.S. Attorney overseeing the case, said a dismissal amounted to a quid pro quo, and that the DOJ, quote, \"proposes dismissing the charges against Adams in return for his assistance in enforcing the federal immigration laws.\" In response, then-acting Deputy Attorney General Emil Bove threatened her with an investigation into her conduct. Joining us now is Maryland Democrat Jamie Raskin. He is the top Democrat on the House Judiciary Committee. This episode is highly unusual. Is there anything that you in your role can do about this episode and what's happening inside Attorney General Bondi's Justice Department?",
      "REP. JAMIE RASKIN: Well, the Justice Department is at war with its own attorneys, its own prosecutors, and the whole episode is just saturated with corruption. It was a corrupt- corruption prosecution and investigation which led to a grand jury indictment against Eric Adams for bribery, conspiracy, other corruption charges, and then the new Department of Justice decided to squash the whole thing, basically saying to Adams, well, we will drop this case against you if you engage in certain kinds of political or policy accommodations with us. And then, in order to complete that deeply corrupt bargain, they had to try to coerce their own lawyers to do it. But of course, the prosecutors were saying nothing has changed in the facts of the case, and nothing has changed in the law. In fact, additional evidence was found, meaning that they were going to revise and expand the original indictment, but instead they were told to kill it for political reasons. And so, you know, this is an outrageous violation of the rules of prosecutors and an offense against due process and a very dangerous first move for the Department of Justice to be making under the Trump people.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Mayor Adams, of course, claims there was no quid pro quo and that none of this was wrong. But, there was the lead prosecutor as well on this case who resigned in objection to what's happening. But, it's moving forward here. This is all now in the hands of a judge. Does he have leeway to prosecute?",
      "REP. RASKIN: So- first of all, just about Danielle Sassoon, I mean, that's a very conservative U.S. attorney, and she couldn't take it. I mean, you have the most conservative prosecutors in the country resigning in opposition to this steamroller on behalf of corruption. But it's not over yet, because Judge Dale Ho does not have to accept the withdrawal of the charges, the dismissal of the charges, which seven Department of Justice attorneys resigned rather than be involved in. The head of the Public In- Integrity section, the head of the Criminal Division, five other lawyers said, no way, and they wrote very stinging rebukes of the Attorney General and the Department of Justice in this case. So Judge Ho has to accept this dismissal, but he may not. He may go ahead and try to appoint another prosecutor to go ahead and go through with the indictment that was handed down by grand jury.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Well, Attorney General Bondi says there's nothing wrong here, saying it was President Biden's weaponized DOJ that went after Adams for political reasons, and only after he criticized President Biden's immigration policies. This is a fellow Democrat. Do you think he should be prosecuted? And how do you respond to that allegation?",
      "REP. RASKIN: Well, first of all the Attorney General did not cite any changes in the facts of the case. She did not cite any changes in the law, because neither occurred, nor did she cite any irregularities in the investigation or the prosecution--",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: --You're saying it's all made up?",
      "REP. RASKIN: Well, then she's mimicking her boss, then, who just lies as a matter of course, one would expect more from the Attorney General of the United States. And- you know, this whole corruption attack- that is an attack on the Department of Justice for engaging in corruption prosecutions, could be impeachable in a different political environment, but the fact that Mayor Adams is a Democrat is neither here nor there, for me. I'm against corruption across the board. It seems like Donald Trump wants to attract all of the corrupt politicians in America to his side.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: So in the Oval Office, President Trump- you may have seen this image, he has hung a picture, a framed picture, of the front page of the \"New York Post\" that has his mug shot in it from that criminal case in New York. Yesterday, he also tweeted \"He who saves his country does not violate any law.\" He seems to believe that all those prosecutions against him were politically motivated, and voters apparently didn't think it mattered. He was elected with a mandate. How do you convince the public that it does matter?",
      "REP. RASKIN: The- the dominant objective of this administration is corruption and lawlessness. The first thing that they did was they sacked 17 inspectors general. Those are the people who are actual corruption fighters within the departments and the agencies. These are the people who ferreted out $91 billion worth of waste, fraud and abuse in the government.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: They argue it's within their political power to do so.",
      "REP. RASKIN: Oh it- there's no doubt it is, but they sacked them- actually, it's not within their political power to do so in a lawless way. They have to notify Congress first, 30 days in advance, and they have to set forth the specific reasons for why an Inspector General is being fired. They never did that. And the reason, of course, is because they want to pursue agendas of corruption across the board. They're saying they're not going to enforce the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act. They are shutting down the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau, which has saved American consumers $31 million in bank overdraft charges, credit card late fees from corporations completely inflated and having nothing to do with actual charges and so on. They're getting rid of anything in the government that supports consumers, that supports citizens, against the rip off artists who are their friends.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: And there's little Democrats can do to push back because you don't have any political power.",
      "REP. RASKIN: Well, we're winning in court. More than a dozen federal injunctions and temporary restraining orders have been issued against everything from their illegal seizure of computer data and every American's private data at the Treasury Department, to their illegal attempt to ban birthright citizenship in America, we're winning across the board. We are a country--",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: We will watch--",
      "REP. RASKIN: --based on law.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: --what happens in those court decisions. Thank you, Congressman Raskin, we'll be right back.",
      "REP. RASKIN: You bet.",

      "The following is the transcript of an interview with Kevin Hassett, director of the National Economic Council,\u00a0that aired on \"Face the Nation with Margaret Brennan\" on Feb. 16, 2025.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: We want to turn now to the economy and inflation, which, compared to last January, ticked up about 3% last week. Kevin Hassett is the director of the National Economic Council, and he joins us now. Good morning to you, Director.",
      "KEVIN HASSETT, DIRECTOR, NATIONAL ECONOMIC COUNCIL: Good morning, Margaret, good morning.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: So, I don't have to tell you, but the rest of the country saw their egg prices at the grocery store go up. We're now at a record high due to that bird flu outbreak, but also labor costs, and that's contributing to food costs overall. When will the administration get that outbreak under control?",
      "HASSETT: Right, well, what's going on, right, as you know, is that there is an inflation problem that's very large. We saw the consumer price index come out, and we found out that the stagflation that was created by the policies of President Biden was way worse than we thought. Over the last three months, across all goods, including eggs, the average inflation rate was 4.6%, way above target, and an acceleration at the end of the Biden term. And, you know, this is really not just us. You could go look at Jason Furman, Larry Summers, economic advisers of President Biden kept saying, don't do this. You're going to cause massive inflation. In fact, Jason Furman has a very thought provoking peace in \"Foreign Affairs\" right now, calling the Biden economic record a tragedy. And this is them, not us, right? It's- so, now we've got a lot of things that we're doing to get ahold of it--",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: You're talking about fiscal spending there.",
      "HASSETT: Excuse me? Yeah, that's right.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: You were talking about fiscal spending there. But--",
      "HASSETT: Well, where does inflation come from, right? And so what we're doing now is, we've- we've got, really, a multi- multi-faceted plan to end inflation, and I'll go quickly, because I want to end with what we're doing with egg prices, but we're going to have a macroeconomic change that has supply side tax cuts so we have more supply, and we're going to reduce government spending, both through what DOGE is doing, and through congressional action. And so therefore, the macroeconomic forces that Jason Furman said were a tragedy are going to be reversed. That's a good thing. Then we're also going to have a lot of energy production, a lot of deregulation. And then finally, when needed, we're going to focus on the individual thing-by-thing pieces. And so, for example, you mentioned avian flu. President Biden didn't really have a plan for avian flu. Well, Brooke Rollins and I have been working with all the best people in government, including academics around the country and around the world, to have a plan ready for the president next week on what we're going to do with avian flu. In fact, I was editing the thing with them tomorrow, but- but the final thing- and then I'll give it back to you, I promise not to filibuster- that, the question is like, why did we do this? Why did we do this? That's what everybody's talking about. But the thing that I always start with when I'm looking at what we're doing, what the President wants us to do, is, why did they do that? Why did they do that? And- and there are too many times where it feels like nobody thought about that in the press, or maybe--",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Oh, gosh--",
      "HASSET: --the left wing \"Economist,\" why did they do that? Why did Biden print so much money and cause so much inflation? Why did he do it?",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Oh, Kevin--",
      "HASSETT: That's- that's what I'm thinking about.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Kevin, you know, we talked about that on \"Face the Nation\" quite a lot. Quite a lot.",
      "HASSETT: I don't mean to criticize you. Okay, good for you.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN:\u00a0 No, no, no. So next week, we'll see the plan on how to get avian flu- how to get bird flu, under--",
      "HASSETT: I could talk about it right now if you'd like to, yes.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: --well, sure, what- what is the plan you're going to- what are you going to do?",
      "HASSETT: Yeah, so- so again, the- the Biden plan was to just, you know, kill chickens, and they spent billions of dollars just randomly killing chickens within a perimeter where they found a sick chicken. And so you go- I just went to the grocery store. I shop for our family, in part because I love to look at prices. And there were no eggs at the store yesterday, just a few. And- and so that happened because they killed all the chickens. And so what we need to do is have better ways, with biosecurity and medication and so on, to make sure that the perimeter doesn't have to kill the chickens. Have a better, smarter perimeter. And so having a smart perimeter is what we're working on, and we're finalizing the ideas about how to do that with the best scientists in government. And that's the kind of thing that should have happened a year ago, and if it had, then egg prices would be, you know, a lot better than they are now. But the avian flu is a real thing--",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Yes.",
      "HASSETT: --and by the way, it's spread mostly by ducks and geese. And so- think about it, they're killing chickens to stop the spread, but chickens don't really fly. The- the spread is happening from the geese and the ducks. And so, why does it make any sense to have a big perimeter of dead chickens, when it's the- the ducks and the geese that are spreading it?",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Well, the Department of Agriculture policy has been to kill those chickens, as you know, but we'll watch the details of that. But let's get back to something the president said. Higher interest rates, as you know, are part of that battle against inflation that the Federal Reserve has been waging, but this past week, the President called for interest rates to be lowered. Why does he think that's going to lower your grocery prices?",
      "KEVIN HASSETT: Well, first of all, I- I want to say that- I, just this weekend, have arranged to begin, once again, regular lunches with Jay Powell at the Federal Reserve. And Jay and I have a long and collegial relationship, and I'm going to go over there with him and the other governors. So we're going to talk about our views about what's going on, and listen to his and that collegiality has been going on for four years when I was here before, and the President very much values that. I think that the- the thing about--",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: But that's not to influence--",
      "HASSETT: --lower interest rates, no, I'm going to talk about- well, Jay is going to- Jay is an independent person. The Fed- independence is respected. And- and the point is, the President's opinion is also- can be heard. He's the president of the United States. But here's the thing that I think is interesting, that if we get inflation under control, then that takes the pressure off the Fed. And one way to tell whether markets think, are we getting inflation under control, is to look at longer term interest rates that the Fed doesn't affect directly. And if you look at it, the 10 year treasury rate has dropped about 40 basis points over the last couple of weeks while we announced our plan to control inflation. That saved the American people about $40 billion, about $40 billion, just from talking about the stuff that we're about to do.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Okay.",
      "HASSETT: It's pretty good.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Right. But the President's statement contradicts economic policy, as you know--",
      "KEVIN HASSETT: No, inflation- no, inflation rates are already- I'm saying the interest rates are already lower by 40 basis points. So, in- interest rates are lower. The one that matters--",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: You're briefing the president on it. Okay--",
      "HASSETT: --the most for the economy is maybe the 5 or 10, year rate. Those the ones that matter the most. So those are down already. So the President's right about that.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Before we run out of time, I really want to make sure I get to you on tariffs--",
      "HASSETT: Okay, sure.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: --because there's concern that that will add to prices, because they'll be added on to consumers and what they pay. How are these reciprocal tariffs going to work? The President was tweeting he wants to put them on, like 175 different countries that have a VAT tax, a value added tax.",
      "KEVIN HASSETT: You know, we're talking to leaders of other countries all the time. Last night into the wee hours of their morning and kind of a late night for me, I was talking to Minister Reynolds from the UK about this very matter. But here's the way I'd like to think about it, that right now, U.S. companies are spending, are paying, foreign governments about $370 billion a year in tax, and foreign comp- companies are paying the U.S. government about $57 billion in tax, and a lot of it is because of the VAT. But if we didn't have to pay the foreign government's tax, over 10 years, it'd be about $5 trillion of tax that U.S. citizens don't have to pay. That would more than pay for the tax cuts that we're debating right now. And so if we get some of that money back, either through tariffs, or for, obviously, if they reduce the tariffs of that, that that's good for Americans, it's going to put more money in their pockets, and- and that's what President Trump is trying to do.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Kevin Hassett, I'd like to have you come back, sit at the table and talk through this in- in more detail at another time. We have to leave it there for today.",
      "HASSETT: Thanks. Happy, happy to be here.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Take care. A lot more \"Face the Nation\" in a moment.",

    "story": [
      "The following is the transcript of an interview with Secretary of State Marco Rubio that aired on \"Face the Nation with Margaret Brennan\" on Feb. 16, 2025.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Good morning and welcome to \"Face the Nation.\" We want to begin today with Secretary of State Marco Rubio, who is in Jerusalem on the second leg of his trip through Europe and the Middle East. Mr. Secretary, I know it's the evening hours there, and you've had a long day. We appreciate your time. You've got quite a busy schedule. You met earlier with Prime Minister Netanyahu. He said he's lock step with the Trump administration, but he can't share details on, quote, \"when the gates of hell will be open\u2026if all our hostages are not released.\" Did he tell you he wants to keep talks going to get to phase two of this hostage deal?",
      "SECRETARY OF STATE MARCO RUBIO: Well, I think we share a common goal. We want to see every hostage released. Frankly, I think, and the President has said this, we want to see them out as soon as we possibly can. And- and certainly, you know, the world has watched these images of people, and it's just heartbreaking to remember that some of them have been now almost two years there. It's a horrifying situation. So we coordinate and work very close with them. We share the goal that every hostage needs to come home, every single one, without delay. Obviously, the- there are details of how we're pursuing that and coordinating that we're not going to share publicly because we don't want to endanger the hostages and we don't want to endanger this process. But suffice it to say that if it was up to us, every one of these hostages would be home right now, and we want it to happen as soon as possible.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: OK, so the deal stands?",
      "SECRETARY RUBIO: Again, we want every hostage out as soon as possible, and- and we want to see them home. There are some that are supposed to- under the deal, there are some that are supposed to be released coming up next weekend. We expect that to happen, but we'd like to see them all come out. We're not going to- we're not in favor of waiting weeks and weeks. Now, that may be the process that's in place because of the deal, but we would like to see them all out as soon as possible, and we continue to coordinate. That- that's what we'd like to see as the outcome. Who wouldn't want all these hostages to be home and with their families?",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Understood. I want to ask you about Iran as well. President Trump has said he wants a diplomatic deal with Iran. Are you reaching out to them? And alongside that, does the U.S. support a preemptive strike by Israel on Iran to take out its nuclear program?",
      "SECRETARY RUBIO: Well, first of all, Israel will always have to act in what they believe is their national interest and their national defense. And so I'm not going to speak about whatever strategies they may have on this or any other topic. I will say that we don't have any outreach from Iran. We haven't seen any, and ultimately, we've seen in the past that efforts that Iran has undertaken diplomatically have been only about how to extend the time frame that- but continue to enrich and rep- and- and in addition to sponsored terrorism, in addition to build these long range weapons, in addition to sow instability throughout the region. But let's be clear, there's been zero outreach or interest to date from Iran about any negotiated deal. Ideally, yeah, I would love to wake up one day and hear the news that Iran has decided not to pursue a nuclear weapon, not to sponsor terrorism, and re-engage in the world as a- as a- as a normal government. We've had no indication of any of that, not just now, but for 30 years.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: So you head from Israel to Saudi Arabia next, I know you'll be talking about Gaza, but we've also learned that Saudi Arabia is trying to facilitate this diplomacy with Russia about Ukraine. Which Russian officials do you expect to be meeting with, and what will the focus of your talks there be? Do you actually believe Vladimir Putin is ready to negotiate and make concessions?",
      "SECRETARY RUBIO: Well, here's what I know. I know President Trump spoke to Vladimir Putin last week, and in it, Vladimir Putin expressed his interest in peace, and the President expressed his desire to see an end to this conflict in a way that was enduring and that protected Ukrainian sovereignty, and that was an enduring peace, not that we're going to have another invasion in three or four years. That's a good call. Now, obviously it has to be followed up by action, so the next few weeks and days will determine whether it's serious or not. Ultimately, one phone call does not make peace. One phone call does not solve a war as complex as this one. But I can tell you that Donald Trump is the only leader in the world that could potentially begin that process. Other leaders have tried, they have not been able to do so. When he ran in his campaign and he was elected as president, one of his promises was, he would work to bring an end to this conflict in a way that's sustainable and fair. And obviously, you know, this is the first step in that process, but we have a long ways to go. Again, one call doesn't make it, one meeting wouldn't make it. This- there's a lot of work to be done. But I- I thought it has- you know, even the longest journey begins with the first step. So we'll see what happens from here, hopefully good things.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Who will you be meeting with?",
      "SECRETARY RUBIO: Well, nothing's been finalized yet. I was scheduled to be in Saudi Arabia anyways, we invited- we announced that trip a week ago, and- a week and a half ago. So ultimately, look, if at any point in time there's an opportunity to continue the work that President Trump started last week, to begin to create an opening for a broader conversation, that it would involve Ukraine and would involve the end of the war, and would involve our allies all over the world, particularly in Europe, we're going to explore it, if that opportunity presents itself. I don't have any details for you this morning, other than to say that we stand ready to follow the president's lead on this and begin to explore ways, if those opportunities present itself, to begin a process towards peace. Now, a process towards peace is not a one-meeting thing. This war has been going on for a while. It's difficult, it's complicated. It's been bloody, it's been costly, so it will not be easy to end a conflict- and there are other parties at stake that have opinions on this as well. The European Union has sanctions as well. The Ukrainians are obviously fighting this war. It's their country, and they're on the front lines. So, one meeting isn't going to solve it, but I want to reiterate, the President made clear he wants to end this war, and if opportunities present themselves to further that, we're going to take them if they present themselves. We'll see what happens over the next few days.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: But to be clear, Keith Kellogg, who is the envoy appointed to help with these talks, says these are going to be parallel negotiations, meaning the Ukrainians and Russians aren't talking to each other yet. When you meet with your Russian counterpart, whoever that is, are you going to be sitting there arguing Ukraine's position?",
      "SECRETARY RUBIO: Well, first of all, I think the- we have to understand is, right now there is no process. What- what we have right now is a call between Putin and President Trump in which both sides expressed an interest in ending this conflict. I imagine there will be follow up conversations to figure out what a process to talk about that would look like, and then at that point, perhaps we can begin to share more details. So it's a bit premature. I know there's been a lot of reaction to it, because there's been no conversation about it, any serious conversation, but I want to go back to the point I made. President Trump ran, he was very clear, he thinks this war needs to end, and if he sees an opportunity to end it, which is what he's looking for, whether there is an opportunity or not, we're going to pursue it. Ultimately, it will reach a point when you are- if it's real negotiations, and we're not there yet, but if that were to happen, Ukraine will have to be involved, because they're the one that were invaded, and the Europeans will have to be involved because the oth- they have sanctions on Putin and Russia as well, and- and they've contributed to this effort. We're just not there yet. We really aren't, but hopefully we will be, because we'd all like to see this war end.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: No doubt, the last administration did have contact through the intelligence agencies with Russia, but they didn't believe there was any proof that Vladimir Putin was interested in talks. You know the history with Vladimir Putin. He likes to use diplomacy as a cover to distract while he continues to wage war. Do you trust that this time is different?",
      "SECRETARY RUBIO: Yeah, I don't think in geopolitics, anyone should trust anyone. I think these things have to be verified through actions. I said yesterday that peace is not a noun, it's a verb. It's an action. You have to take concrete steps towards it. What I can tell you is, I know of no better negotiator in American politics than President Trump. I don't- I think President Trump will know very quickly whether they say- is this a real thing, or whether this is an effort to buy time. But I don't want to prejudge that. I don't want to foreclose the opportunity to end a conflict that's already cost the lives of hundreds of thousands and continues every single day to be, increasingly, a war of attrition on both sides. I think everyone should be celebrating the fact that we have an American president that is seeking to promote peace in the world, not start wars, but end them, in a way that's enduring. That's something we should be happy about. Whether it's possible or not, we're certainly willing, but it's not entirely up to us, obviously, but we'll find out.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Well, you did speak in a phone call with Russia's top diplomat, Sergei Lavrov. The Russian side claimed that you discussed restoring trade, which seemed to be a nod to sanctions, easing restrictions on diplomats, and other gestures like a high level leaders meeting. Are you actually considering- is the Trump administration considering lifting sanctions on Russia?",
      "SECRETARY RUBIO: Well, the phone call was to establish communications that are consistent with the call the President made last week with Vladimir Putin. Because if- we are- if there is going to be the possibility of- of progress here towards peace, we are going to need to talk to the Russians. I mean, that is going to have to happen, and we're going to have to be able to be able to do it across our channels--",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: About lifting sanctions, though?",
      "SECRETARY RUBIO: --I also raised in that conversation concerns that- well, we didn't go into any details. I mean, what we just discussed is basically the ability to begin communicating. I'd never spoken to Mr. Lavrov in my life, so it was an opportunity for us to begin to open that channel of communication, which, again, if there's the potential for peace here, that's a channel that has to exist. But let me add one more thing. I also raised the issue of our embassy in Moscow, which operates under very difficult conditions. I raised that because it's important, it's going to be very difficult to engage in communication with Russia about anything if our embassy is not functioning. And he raised concerns about his diplomatic mission in the United States. So at a very basic level, if, in fact, there is going to be an opportunity here to pursue peace by engaging with the Russians, we're going to need to have functional embassies in Moscow and in Washington, D.C., and that's certainly something foreign ministers would talk about as a matter of normal course.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: I want to ask you about what happened in Munich, Germany, at the Security Conference. Vice President Vance gave a speech, and he told U.S. allies that the threat he worries about the most is not Russia, it is not China. He called it the \"threat from within,\" and he lectured about what he described as censorship, mainly focusing, though, on including more views from the right. He also met with the leader of a far-right party known as the AfD, which, as you know, is under investigation and monitoring by German intelligence because of extremism. What did all of this accomplish, other than irritating our allies?",
      "SECRETARY RUBIO: Why would our allies or anybody be irritated by free speech and by someone giving their opinion? We are, after all, democracies. The Munich- Munich Security Conference is largely a conference of democracies in which one of the things that we cherish and value is the ability to speak freely and provide your opinions. And so, I think if anyone's angry about his words, they don't have to agree with him, but to be angry about it, I think actually makes his point. I thought it was actually a pretty historic speech, whether you agree with him or not. I think the valid points he's making to Europe is, we are concerned that the true values that we share, the values that bind us together with Europe, are things like free speech and democracy and our shared history in winning two world wars and defeating Soviet communism and the like. These are the values that we shared in common, and in that cold war we fought against things like censorship and oppression and so forth, and when you see backsliding, and you raise that, that's a very valid concern. We can't tell them how to run their countries. We are- he simply expressed in a speech his view of it, which a lot of people, frankly, share. And I thought he said a lot of things in that speech that needed to be said. And honestly, I don't know why anybody would be upset about it. People are- you know, you don't have to agree on someone's speech. I happen to agree with a lot of what he said, but you don't have to agree with someone's speech to- to at least appreciate the fact they have a right to say it and that you should listen to it and see whether those criticisms are valid. I assure you, the United States has come under withering criticism on many occasions from many leaders in Europe, and we don't go around throwing temper tantrums about it.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Well, he was standing in a country where free speech was weaponized to conduct a genocide, and he met with the head of a political party that has far-right views and some historic ties to extreme groups. The context of that was changing the tone of it. And you know that. That the censorship was specifically about the right--",
      "SECRETARY RUBIO: -- Well I have to disagree with you. No- I have- I have to disagree with you. Free speech was not used to conduct a genocide. The genocide was conducted by an authoritarian Nazi regime that happened to also be genocidal because they hated Jews and they hated minorities and they hated those that they- they had a list of people they hated, but primarily the Jews. There was no free speech in Nazi Germany. There was none. There was also no opposition in Nazi Germany, they were a sole and only party that governed that country. So that's not an accurate reflection of history. I also think it's wrong- again, I go back to the point of his speech. The point of his speech was basically that there is an erosion in free speech and intolerance or opposing points of view within Europe, and that's of concern because that is eroding. That's not an erosion of your military capabilities, that's not an erosion of your economic standing, that's an erosion of the actual values that bind us together in this transatlantic union that everybody talks about, and I think allies and friends and partners that have worked together now for 80 years, should be able to speak frankly to one another in open forums without being offended, insulted, or upset. And I spoke to Foreign Ministers from multiple countries throughout Europe. Many of them probably didn't like the speech or didn't agree with it, but they were continuing to engage with us on all sorts of issues that unite us. So again, at the end of the day, I think that, you know, people give all- that is a forum in which you're supposed to be inviting people to give speeches, not basically a chorus where everyone is saying the exact same thing. That's not always going to be the case when it's a collection of democracies where leaders have the right and the privilege to speak their minds in forums such as these.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Mr. Secretary, I'm told that we are out of time. A lot to get through with you. We appreciate you making time today. We'll be back in a minute.",

      "The following is the transcript of an interview with GOP Sen. Jeanne Shaheen of New Hampshire that aired on \"Face the Nation with Margaret Brennan\" on Feb. 16, 2025.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: And joining me now is Senator Jeanne Shaheen, the ranking Democrat on the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, joining us from Munich Security Conference. Senator, you were on stage with Ukraine's President Zelenskyy Friday, discussing the future of U.S. and Ukraine security cooperation. He said he hopes President Trump will help Ukraine. Can Congress? Can senators like yourself give him any assurances that U.S. support in his fight with Russia will continue?",
      "SEN. JEANNE SHAHEEN: Well, we had a bipartisan panel participating with President Zelenskyy, two Democrats, two Republicans, and I think it's fair to say that we were unanimous in our support for Ukraine, for continuing the fight against Russia, for thinking about how we hold Vladimir Putin accountable, and for providing as much leverage as we can to Ukraine before any kind of negotiations start to end the war.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Well, in terms of negotiations, there were some comments made by President Trump this week. There were also comments made by his Defense Secretary that I know got a lot of attention among our European counterparts. The Defense Secretary said returning to Ukraine's pre 2014 borders is unrealistic. He's suggesting that maybe the east and another part of Ukraine and Crimea will be taken by Russia. Why do you think there was this plan to give concessions before talks begin?",
      "SEN. SHAHEEN: Well, I think it was a mixed message coming from the administration. On the one hand, you heard Secretary Hegseth saying they were going to take NATO off the table, that Ukraine needed to give up territory, and on the other hand, you had Vice President Vance yesterday, or at the conference, saying that everything should be on the table, including the possibility of putting boots on the ground in Ukraine. So it's a mixed message. I hope that the upshot of that is that we are going to do everything we can to support Ukraine.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: In terms of what Congress can do, are your hands tied here? Or are some of your Republican colleagues willing to put something perhaps in an upcoming defense bill, for example, that might help Ukraine?",
      "SEN. SHAHEEN: Well, I think that's one option. One of the things that we're talking about doing right away is making some statements on the the repossession of assets by Russia that are held in the United States and in Europe, and the importance of having those assets go to Ukraine to help both with the execution of the military conflict, but also to think about rebuilding.\u00a0 Again, there's bipartisan support, there was bipartisan support for the bill, and there's bipartisan support to continue to try and ensure that those assets from Russia get repaid to Ukraine, because Russia is really the aggressor here, and we need to hold Vladimir Putin accountable.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: You know, your Republican counterpart, Roger Wicker, He is the chair of the Armed Services Committee was really sharp in his comments at Munich. He was saying he was puzzled. He was disturbed by what the Defense Secretary, a member of his own party, had said about Ukraine. He was very clear that what Vladimir Putin is doing, he said, is absolutely out of Adolf Hitler's playbook. Those are sharp words, considering the President of the United States says he wants to meet face to face to Vladimir Putin and possibly bring him to the White House.",
      "SEN. SHAHEEN: Well, they are sharp words, and they are very much justified, regardless of what President Trump may be doing to try and lay the groundwork for any future negotiations. The fact is, there is strong bipartisan support in Congress to help Ukraine in this unfair war that Russia has initiated. And I think Senator Wicker's comments are very important. We need to make sure that the world knows that we want to hold Vladimir Putin and Russia accountable for what, for what they've done.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: At the conference you're at, you are able to speak with European leaders. What are they saying to you about their view of America now?",
      "SEN. SHAHEEN: Well, we're here in Munich, which is one of the biggest security conferences worldwide, and we have leaders from all over the world, a lot of European leaders. And we had a chance to meet with representatives from Britain, from Canada, not a European country, but also very concerned about Ukraine. With- people from the Balkan countries, with President Zelenskyy, obviously, and there is a great deal of concern about the U.S. position on Ukraine. At the panel that we had with President Zelenskyy, we talked about the importance of Europe and the United States acting in concert so that we can hold Putin accountable with sanctions, so that we can- so that there is no daylight between the United States and our NATO allies and our European allies. Clearly, that's what Vladimir Putin has been trying to do throughout this conflict, and we need to make it clear that that is not going to happen, that we are going to work together and we are going to support Ukraine.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Does Congress need to be any part of approving this deal President Trump says he wants, to take possession of some of the critical minerals that Ukraine has inside their territory? He says he wants to use that as sort of repayment for what the U.S. has spent on weapons.",
      "SEN. SHAHEEN: Well, I think there are some benefits to having the United States have some investments in Ukraine. That's part of what a critical minerals deal would do. It's not at all clear who- who has possession of those critical minerals. Some of them are in the eastern part of Ukraine, where Russia controls the territory, some of them are owned by private- actually, oligarchs. There are some oligarchs who own a number of those critical mineral sites. So I think those are details that have not yet been worked out, and I have not seen the agreement that's been put in front of President Zelenskyy.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Well, we know Zelenskyy will be discussing that with other members of the administration. We'll stay tuned on that, but I do want to bring up something that we--",
      "SEN. SHAHEEN: He--",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Sorry, go ahead.",
      "SEN. SHAHEEN: Well, I just- I wanted to- one of the things that in our conversations with President Zelenskyy, that we talked about, that I know that he's got to be concerned about, is making sure that Ukraine is at the table, whether literally, or however those negotiations work out, for any conversations about what happens in Ukraine, and President Zelenskyy reiterated, nothing about Ukraine without Ukraine. And I- he got reassurances from the bipartisan senators that he met with, that we agree, Ukraine absolutely must be part of any negotiations between Russia and the United States.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: But you know, for this administration, they have made the argument time and again that Europe needs to do more to defend itself, that the U.S. can't be responsible for it. Senator Lindsey Graham, who was alongside you with Zelenskyy, defended President Trump's phone call earlier this week with Vladimir Putin, saying, \"All the people worried about the phone call, where were you when we needed to stop Putin?\" He was talking about going all the way back to 2014, in the Obama administration. What do you think- you know, how do you respond to this idea that this was just a conversation, and that if people were truly worried about security, they should have done more earlier?",
      "SEN. SHAHEEN: Well, I think we should have done more earlier. In 2014 I was in the group that said we needed to give lethal weapons to Ukraine so that they could fight back. Unfortunately, that didn't happen, but- but now the issue is, what are we going to do to ensure that they can continue to protect their territorial integrity, that we don't allow Vladimir Putin, or any other dictator, to unilaterally invade a country just because they want to get the territory? And we know that China and President Xi are watching very closely what happens in Ukraine. We've seen North Korea send troops, and they're losing thousands of North Koreans in this battle. We know Iran is watching. So this is not just about Russia and Ukraine. It's also about our other adversaries, and whether both our allies and our adversaries understand that we are going to stand up and support our allies and do everything we can to ensure that they are successful, that the United States is not going to walk away.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: I want to ask you about China. You wrote a letter along with your Republican colleague, Susan Collins, stating concern that this so-called buyout program the Trump administration is offering would leave at risk a Navy shipyard in the Northeast that helps to service submarines. You pointed right at the nuclear threat posed by China to the United States. Have you responded- have you received a response from the Navy, and how significant of an impact will this have?",
      "SEN. SHAHEEN: Well, we haven't received a response. That was in- with concern about a shipyard, the Portsmouth Naval Shipyard that New Hampshire and Maine shares. So the delegations from both New Hampshire and Maine are very concerned about what happens at the shipyard. They do maintenance and repair on our nuclear submarine fleet. It's one of the areas where we have an advantage over China. We need to ensure that our submarine fleet is maintained, that it's out and sea worthy, and we need to ensure that we have the workers that it takes to do all of that work, that we are able to make the investments in our public shipyards so they can do the repairs and make sure that those nuclear submarines are patrolling our seas and keeping America safe.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Before I let you go, I need to ask you about this freeze on foreign assistance. I know one of your colleagues has put a hold on all the picks to go to the State Department to work under Secretary Rubio because of these objections, do you support putting a freeze on getting Secretary Rubio's team in place? Is that in the best interest of the country right now?",
      "SEN. SHAHEEN: Listen, I think we need to get all of our diplomatic officials on the ground as quickly as possible. But what Elon Musk and this administration have done is to unilaterally stop our programs that are providing critical foreign assistance that help keep America safe, that help blunt China, that help address- I mean, in Ukraine, we know that there are programs that have been stopped because of what's happening. We have commodities that are from U.S. farmers that are sitting in ports around the world and in the U.S. that can't get to the people. These are commodities that have been paid for and they can't get unloaded because of the stop work orders and this freeze. That doesn't make sense. That's not efficient. And what we're doing is leaving a vacuum for China and Russia and our adversaries to move into and really eliminate the trust that has been built over years because of all of the good work that has been done by these foreign assistance efforts.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Senator Shaheen, thank you for your time today.",

    "summary": "Archaeologists in Egypt have found of the tomb of King Thutmose II - the first discovery of an ancient royal tomb since King Tutankhamun's in 1922.",
    "story": [
      "Egyptian officials announced Tuesday the discovery of the tomb of King Thutmose II, the last of the lost tombs of the kings of ancient Egypt's Eighteenth Dynasty, which reigned for over two centuries between about 1550 BC and 1292 BC. It's the first royal Egyptian tomb to be discovered since King Tutankhamun's final resting place was found in 1922.",
      "A joint Egyptian-British archaeological mission discovered Thutmose II's tomb in the mount of Thebes area, west of Luxor and the renowned Valley of the Kings. The team and the Egyptian Ministry of Tourism and Antiquities, which made the announcement, said evidence was discovered that clearly indicates it was King Thutmose II's tomb during excavations of what had previously been known only as tomb No. C4.",
      "The entrance and main passage into the structure were discovered in 2022, and internal excavations have continued meticulously since then.",
      "Dr. Mohamed Ismail Khaled, Secretary-General of Egypt's Supreme Council of Antiquities, said when the mission first found the entrance to the tomb and its main passage almost three years ago, the team believed it could belong to one of the wives of the kings, given its proximity to the tomb of the wives of King Thutmose III and its proximity to the tomb of Queen Hatshepsut, which was prepared for her as a royal wife before she became ruler of the ancient kingdom. She ended up being buried in the Valley of the Kings, due to her ascent to the throne.",
      "As the excavation work and examination of artifacts continued, the mission found new evidence that identified the owner of the mysterious tomb as King Thutmose II, suggesting also that his burial rites were carried out by Queen Hatshepsut, who was his wife and half-sister.",
      "Khaled said parts of alabaster vessels found in the ruins have inscriptions bearing the name of King Thutmose II and identifying him as the \"deceased king,\" along with the name of his wife, Hatshepsut, all of which he said had helped to confirm Thutmose II as the owner of the tomb.",
      "He described the discovery as one of the most important archaeological finds in recent years. The artifacts discovered are important additions to the body of knowledge around the history of the area and the reign of King Thutmose II.",
      "The mummy of King Thutmose II was discovered during the 19th century, not far away at another archaeological site known as the Deir el-Bahari Cachette, to which the it was likely moved centuries after being looted by tomb raiders, according to the\u00a0relatively new National Museum\u00a0of Egyptian Civilization. His mummy is now on display, among those of other ancient royals, at the museum.",
      "The tomb is in a poor state of preservation due largely to exposure to floods shortly after Thutmose II's death, according to Mohamed Abdel Badie, Head of the Egyptian Antiquities Sector at the Supreme Council of Antiquities and Head of the Egyptian team that has worked on the dig. Abdel Badie said initial studies also indicate much of the original contents of the tomb were moved to another location after the ancient floods.",
      "He said the teams had discovered mortar in the tomb with remnants of blue inscriptions and yellow stars, and some paragraphs from the book of \"Imydwat,\" which is one of the most important funerary books found in ancient Egyptian tombs, written to help guide the late royals through their underworld journey.",
      "Dr. Piers Litherland, head of the English team at the site, said the tomb is characterized by a simple architectural design typical of those chosen by the successive rulers of Egypt who came after Thutmose II.",
      "Litherland said the mission would continue its survey work and try to determine where the rest of the contents from Thutmose II's tomb were relocated to, and to uncover any further secrets that may have been locked beneath the earth for millennia.",

    "published": "Mon, 17 Feb 2025 10:42:43 -0500",

    "story": [
      "Human brains contain higher concentrations of microplastics than other organs, according to a new study, and the amount appears to be increasing over time.",
      "In the study, published in early February in the journal\u00a0Nature Medicine, University of New Mexico Health Sciences researchers found microplastics in human brains have increased 50% over the past 8 years. They also found that people with dementia had up to 10 times as much plastic in their brains as everyone else.",
      "Microplastics are tiny fragments of degraded polymers that are found in the environment, including our air, water and soil, a news release explained. Previous studies have already shown these substances have made their way into the human body.",
      "The lead researcher, toxicologist Matthew Campen, said the rate of accumulation they found mirrors the increasing amounts of plastics waste on the planet. And he said in the news release that their findings should trigger alarm about the potential impact on human health.",
      "\"I have yet to encounter a single human being who says, 'There's a bunch of plastic in my brain and I'm totally cool with that,'\" he said.",
      "The study compared liver, kidney and brain tissue samples from autopsies conducted in 2016 and 2024, and found \"substantially higher concentrations\" in the 2024 brain tissue. The researchers also conducted similar analysis on older and more recent autopsies for people who died with confirmed dementia diagnoses, and found \"far greater\" concentrations.",
      "While it's unclear how particles are actually being transported into the brain, Campen said the size of the micro- and nanoplastics, measuring 200 nanometers or less, are not much larger than viruses and therefore small enough to cross the blood-brain barrier.",
      "In the study, researchers detected 12 different polymers, the most common of which was polyethylene, widely used for packaging and containers, including bottles and cups, the release noted.",
      "Campen suspects most microplastics in the body are ingested through food, particularly meat.",
      "\"The way we irrigate fields with plastic-contaminated water, we postulate that the plastics build up there,\" he said. \"We feed those crops to our livestock. We take the manure and put it back on the field, so there may be a sort of feed-forward biomagnification.\"",
      "The team also found high concentrations of plastic in meat bought at grocery stores.",
      "As for the higher levels found in the brains of dementia patients, the researchers noted the study was not designed to prove whether that was the cause of symptoms \u2014 it may be the reverse, that the disease process allows more accumulation to happen.",
      "\"Atrophy of brain tissue, impaired blood\u2013brain barrier integrity and poor clearance mechanisms are hallmarks of dementia and would be anticipated to increase [micro- and nanoplastic] concentrations,\" they wrote.",
      "Dr. C\u00e9line Gounder, CBS News medical contributor and editor-at-large for public health at KFF Health News, said the research on the health impact of microplastics is still in its infancy, but there are important questions being asked.",
      "\"There are concerns that this could be causing any number of conditions. Could it be increasing the risk of stroke or heart attack? Could it be increasing the risk of cancer, inflammatory bowel disease, infertility?\" she said\u00a0on \"CBS Mornings.\"",
      "For those looking to reduce exposure to microplastics, Gounder suggests switching from plastic bottles to stainless steel or glass and making some other changes in the kitchen.",
      "\"Do not reheat your food in contact with plastic \u2014 that is really important. So move it to a glass dish or your plate, not in plastic,\" she said \"And then finally switch out your cutting boards. Don't use plastic cutting boards, use either wood or stone.\"",

    "summary": "The head of planetary defense at the European Space Agency discusses 2024 YR4, an asteroid with a small chance of striking Earth eight years from now.",
    "story": [
      "An asteroid capable of flattening a mid-sized city could potentially collide with Earth eight years from now, as its orbit around the sun briefly intersects the path of our planet. Named 2024 YR4, the space rock carries with it very slim odds of striking land \u2014 either on Earth or, even less likely, the moon \u2014 and astronomers have so far set the probability of a crash at around 2%.",
      "International space organizations like NASA are taking the possible threat seriously, however small it might be. Richard Moissl, the head of the European Space Agency's planetary defense office, said their attentiveness shouldn't unduly raise public concern. He shared key facts about the asteroid with CBS News during the below conversation,\u00a0 which has been edited for clarity.",
      "When would the asteroid hit Earth?",
      "This asteroid passes us by every four years. Every time we go four times around the sun, it has almost precisely completed one turn. It has just recently had a flyby in December 2024, which means the next flyby is in December 2028, and we know already that this one is no problem.",
      "The critical one is in 2032, on the 22nd of December, somewhere around the middle of the day in Universal Time. That is when the asteroid is passing, really, through a part of the orbit of the Earth. So, it's really going through the path of Earth, so to speak.",
      "And the question is, whether Earth will be there at this point in time, or whether it will have already passed or is still approaching that point. It's the question, where will it pass by? There's an uncertainty region that spans, right now, the entire Earth-Moon system \u2014 which is not to say that we don't know a lot about it. In fact, we know a lot about it.",
      "Now, we're looking at a closing moment in time on the 22nd of December, 2032, and the question is about fractions of a meter per second, which will make all the difference.",
      "There's about a 20-something-minute window in which the Earth can be in the way of this before it's no longer in the path of the asteroid, or the asteroid cannot come in contact with the Earth anymore.",
      "How is the asteroid risk being managed?",
      "Until recently, we did daily measurements with different telescopes. Then, we had to pause a little bit for one or two days because of the full moon, and the object being too close to the full moon, and the moon illuminating the sky too much to see it.",
      "From now on, we will not monitor it daily, but it will be constantly monitored in the best way possible, with ever larger telescopes. And the idea is to measure its path around the sun in ever higher positions, so you will see this uncertainty region shrink, and shrink, and shrink. And we are trying to constrain the uncertainty so much that we can say whether it passes by Earth safely, or whether there is still some chance left in the middle of April.",
      "What happens in April?",
      "We will be so far away from the object that we cannot observe it from Earth anymore. And then, the James Webb Telescope will take measurements. It will actually take one in March, primarily infrared observations that give us more insight about the size of the object, and then one more in May to do additional measurements. The most likely scenario is that, by that time, you will be able to say, look, we can prove it's not going to hit Earth, but there is a chance that we cannot eliminate it completely. And that will be the more interesting bit, because then we have to wait until mid-2028, when we can observe it again. We will not let that time pass by without action.",
      "When was the last time an asteroid had similar odds of hitting Earth?",
      "This is only the second time that impact prediction systems have rated any asteroid with an impact probability of more than 1%. The last time was about 20 years ago, with the asteroid Apophis in 2004, which reached a couple of percent for a brief period in time before the uncertainty region could be constrained.",
      "That shows how unusual 1% is, and that means that we, as experts, have to take this seriously. However, with the current probability estimated at around 2%, it's still around 98% likely that nothing bad will happen at all. So, that needs to be kept in mind all the time. This is something that merits attention, but it's not perceived as an imminent threat. It's just, we need to find out more about it.",
      "Have asteroids this size actually crashed into Earth?",
      "We are aware of a recent example in history where this has happened. It was 1908 in Siberia. There was an event where 2,000 square kilometers of forest had been flattened by a big explosion, high up in the atmosphere. And this is very consistent with a body about 50 meters in diameter, plus or minus 10 meters, entering Earth's atmosphere.",
      "The body itself was, then, likely not a solid piece of rock. It was more like, what we call a pile of smaller pieces of rock. And this burst several kilometers above the surface and had this effect, that 2,000 square kilometers of forest was flattened, that seismic waves went out from this and could be detected far away, that people witnessed this event, also from very far away.",
      "We don't know if anyone was hurt in that accident. Nothing is reported. But the size, the footprint of the destruction is comparable to a major urban area, or a big city on Earth. So, this is basically the scenario that we would expect from this.",
      "Another example not recorded in human history was an object believed to have been about 50 meters in diameter, a massive chunk of iron that formed the Barringer meteor crater in Arizona. It's a 1.2-kilometer crater. If you look at this and think about it, if that were to hit in a city, the city would look very, very different afterward.",
      "The estimated size of this asteroid ranges from about 40 to 90 meters. Wouldn't there also be a big difference between the damage caused by something 40 meters wide versus 90 meters?",
      "Absolutely. I mean, the 40 to 90 meters is a standard estimate, because we cannot know at this point in time what the surface brightness is. Current data indicate it's more toward the 40- or 50-meter size. So, luckily, on the smaller size range, which is why I cited these popular examples for this.",
      "But, indeed, size matters for asteroids. Size matters a lot. If we're talking about the doubling of the radius of an asteroid, that means eight times the mass, eight times the energy, and that is a significant difference, of course. While on the lower end of the scale, with about 40 meters, it would be threatening to, let's say, a middle-sized city, on the 90-meter edge, it might be comparable to the biggest urban areas.",
      "Why has the probability of 2024 YR4 hitting Earth increased since it was first discovered?",
      "The good news is, this increase does not mean that the asteroid has become more dangerous. The path of the asteroid is defined by physical laws. It's already clear. It's just our knowledge of where that path would be, in reality, is not perfect yet.",
      "The percentage can be compared to the size of the uncertainty area, compared with the size of the Earth. If you look at the fraction, the size of the Earth \u2014   which is inside the uncertainty area \u2014   is compared to the entire area of the uncertainty of where the asteroid could be in that critical moment in time. This equated to about 1% when we reached this threshold for international awareness.",
      "Since then, the size of the uncertainty region has basically shrunk by half. And the size of Earth, luckily, remains the same. So, that means Earth is now occupying twice the amount of space in the uncertainty region. And it means our estimate for the impact risk has risen from 1% to 2%. It doesn't mean that anything has changed.",
      "Again, 2% is a 98% chance of missing. So what will happen is, with our gaining knowledge, uncertainty will shrink further and further and further, and the expected case is that we will manage to shrink it so much that Earth is no longer inside this uncertainty region, and then the impact probability will drop to zero.",
      "In the case of this being a close flyby to Earth, if it's reasonably close, it's entirely possible that the impact probability will continue to rise a little bit on a modest path. This is still no cause for alarm.",
      "The asteroid has been assigned a Level 3 ranking, out of 10, on the Torino Impact Hazard Scale. How uncommon is that?",
      "It's the first time ever that an object is officially classified as a Level 3 on the Torino scale. The only other object that was ever classified with a level higher than 1 was Apophis. Because of its larger size, Apophis has been classified as a 4 on the Torino scale, which is really just indicating that it's a larger object. [Apophis has an estimated diameter of 350 meters, which is much larger than the asteroid 2024 YR4.]",
      "What else should people know?",
      "Well, the most important thing is, don't panic. Always good advice, but it's definitely applicable advice in this situation. I think this gives us a chance to prove that we, as a planet, can still rise above things on Earth that are between people, between countries, between parts of Earth. That if we are facing a completely outside threat, that we can all come together, join forces and face these kinds of threats together.",
      "This one is a manageable challenge. Even if it were to be headed towards Earth, which is by no means certain, 98% it's clear that it will miss us. So, not much to be afraid of, but a good chance to show that we can stand united on this planet.",

    "published": "Wed, 12 Feb 2025 14:06:03 -0500",
    "summary": "The clouds contain carbon dioxide and only form high in Mars' atmosphere.",
    "story": [
      "New images captured by NASA's Curiosity rover show colorful clouds in the sky over Mars.",
      "The images were captured by the rover's Mastcam, which NASA's Jet Propulsion Laboratory compared to the rover's eyes. The clouds were spotted on Jan. 17, and the photos were taken over the course of 16 minutes, the space agency said in a news release.",
      "The clouds, known as noctilucent or twilight clouds, contain frozen carbon dioxide, or dry ice. They are tinted with colors when the setting Sun scatters light. That color has led to them being nicknamed \"mother-of-pearl\" clouds.",
      "While Mars' atmosphere is 95% carbon dioxide, few of its clouds are at a high enough atmosphere and low enough temperature to contain frozen carbon dioxide. Most clouds on the planet are made of water ice. The clouds photographed by Curiosity are at an altitude of 37 to 50 miles above the planet's surface. Other images show the clouds as white plumes falling through the atmosphere, before evaporating about 31 miles above Mars.",
      "Did you know that Mars has *iridescent* clouds?Spotted by the @MarsCuriosity rover, these unique clouds are made of carbon dioxide ice and are only observed at twilight. What this helps us learn about the Red Planet: https://t.co/Snqyo49n1W pic.twitter.com/anXG7hf61K",
      "The twilight clouds have only been spotted in some areas of Mars' southern hemisphere. NASA's Perseverance Rover, which landed on Mars' northern hemisphere in 2021, has not seen the clouds since it landed, but Curiosity has seen them in the southern hemisphere in four different Mars years.",
      "Mark Lemmon, an atmospheric scientist with the Space Science Institute in Boulder, Colorado, told NASA that he believes certain regions of the planet are more likely to form the clouds. Gravity waves, which cool a planet's atmosphere, could be a factor, he said.",
      "\"Carbon dioxide was not expected to be condensing into ice here, so something is cooling it to the point that it could happen,\" Lemmon said in NASA's news release. \"But Martian gravity waves are not fully understood and we're not entirely sure what is causing twilight clouds to form in one place but not another.\"",
      "Even though researchers don't totally understand how the clouds are formed, they can predict when and where they will appear. Lemmon, who was a lead researcher on a 2024 paper detailing Curiosity's first two years of cloud observations, said the phenomenon has \"become so predictable that we can plan our shots in advance.\"",
      "The new cloud photos aren't the only data Curiosity has sent back to NASA in recent weeks. The rover recently investigated a place called the Gediz Vallis channel, the space agency said.",
      "It also visited an impact crater nicknamed \"Rustic Canyon\" to take photos and study the rocks around the crater. The 67-foot wide crater likely formed millions of years ago, based on the erosion of the site, NASA said.",
      "The rover will continue on to a new location that includes what NASA called \"boxwork,\" or fractures in the planet's surface formed by groundwater. When seen from space, the fractures look like giant spiderwebs, NASA said.",

    "story": [
      "New images captured by NASA's Curiosity rover show colorful clouds in the sky over Mars.",
      "The images were captured by the rover's Mastcam, which NASA's Jet Propulsion Laboratory compared to the rover's eyes. The clouds were spotted on Jan. 17, and the photos were taken over the course of 16 minutes, the space agency said in a news release.",
      "The clouds, known as noctilucent or twilight clouds, contain frozen carbon dioxide, or dry ice. They are tinted with colors when the setting Sun scatters light. That color has led to them being nicknamed \"mother-of-pearl\" clouds.",
      "While Mars' atmosphere is 95% carbon dioxide, few of its clouds are at a high enough atmosphere and low enough temperature to contain frozen carbon dioxide. Most clouds on the planet are made of water ice. The clouds photographed by Curiosity are at an altitude of 37 to 50 miles above the planet's surface. Other images show the clouds as white plumes falling through the atmosphere, before evaporating about 31 miles above Mars.",
      "Did you know that Mars has *iridescent* clouds?Spotted by the @MarsCuriosity rover, these unique clouds are made of carbon dioxide ice and are only observed at twilight. What this helps us learn about the Red Planet: https://t.co/Snqyo49n1W pic.twitter.com/anXG7hf61K",
      "The twilight clouds have only been spotted in some areas of Mars' southern hemisphere. NASA's Perseverance Rover, which landed on Mars' northern hemisphere in 2021, has not seen the clouds since it landed, but Curiosity has seen them in the southern hemisphere in four different Mars years.",
      "Mark Lemmon, an atmospheric scientist with the Space Science Institute in Boulder, Colorado, told NASA that he believes certain regions of the planet are more likely to form the clouds. Gravity waves, which cool a planet's atmosphere, could be a factor, he said.",
      "\"Carbon dioxide was not expected to be condensing into ice here, so something is cooling it to the point that it could happen,\" Lemmon said in NASA's news release. \"But Martian gravity waves are not fully understood and we're not entirely sure what is causing twilight clouds to form in one place but not another.\"",
      "Even though researchers don't totally understand how the clouds are formed, they can predict when and where they will appear. Lemmon, who was a lead researcher on a 2024 paper detailing Curiosity's first two years of cloud observations, said the phenomenon has \"become so predictable that we can plan our shots in advance.\"",
      "The new cloud photos aren't the only data Curiosity has sent back to NASA in recent weeks. The rover recently investigated a place called the Gediz Vallis channel, the space agency said.",
      "It also visited an impact crater nicknamed \"Rustic Canyon\" to take photos and study the rocks around the crater. The 67-foot wide crater likely formed millions of years ago, based on the erosion of the site, NASA said.",

    "summary": "Astronomers will use the Webb telescope to closely monitor the size and trajectory of an asteroid that has a slim chance of hitting Earth in 2032.",
    "story": [
      "An asteroid has a small chance of hitting Earth less than eight years from now, and astronomers are enlisting the help of NASA's James Webb Space Telescope to study it. Characterized as a potential \"city-killer,\" the asteroid was first detected in December and its odds of impacting our planet have increased slightly since then, according to the European Space Agency.",
      "The space rock is formally named 2024 YR4. Scientists say it currently carries a 2% risk of making contact with Earth when it eventually reaches this part of the solar system on Dec. 22, 2032. Although the asteroid will most likely pass by without issue, those tasked with monitoring its physical attributes and potential have shifted upward the probability of a crash since 2024 YR4 was initially discovered.",
      "The European Space Agency in January placed the asteroid's odds of hitting Earth at roughly 1%, before NASA's Jet Propulsion Laboratory estimated the risk was more like 1.6% at the tail end of the month. Officials at both agencies acknowledge the unlikelihood of 2024 YR4 causing problems, with the ESA saying that current risk estimates are probably unnecessarily high because the people studying it are still uncertain about some of the asteroid's key features.",
      "Right now, astronomers estimate the asteroid is between 40 meters and 90 meters wide, which is roughly 130 to 295 feet wide. For reference, an American football field measures 100 yards \u2014 or 300 feet \u2014 long.",
      "\"It is very important that we improve our size estimate for 2024 YR4,\" the ESA said in a statement Monday, which noted \"the hazard represented by a 40 m asteroid is very different from that of a 90 m asteroid.\"",
      "On the slim chance the asteroid does strike Earth in 2032, its impacts would be localized. But 2024 YR4 has nonetheless received a Level 3 rating, out of 10, on the Torino Impact Hazard Scale, which is a fairly rare distinction meant to represent \"a close encounter\" that warrants public and scientific attention.",
      "\"An asteroid this size impacts Earth on average every few thousand years and could cause severe damage to a local region,\" the ESA said\u00a0a previous statement\u00a0about 2024 YR4.",
      "If the asteroid does hit the planet, NASA said its potential impact sites could include areas over the eastern Pacific Ocean, northern South America, the Atlantic Ocean, Africa, the Arabian Sea and South Asia.",
      "CBS News space consultant Bill Harwood said if it landed in a populated area, it would \"be truly catastrophic,\" but the effects would be localized.",
      "\"It wouldn't be something like the rock that killed the dinosaurs,\" Harwood said. \"It wouldn't affect the global climate, but it would certainly be a disaster of every proportion. So we're all hoping that doesn't happen.\"",
      "In order to gain a greater understanding of the asteroid and better prepare for whatever is to come, astronomers will use the Webb Telescope to collect data on its size that could not be observed as accurately without the telescope's technology, the ESA said.",
      "Where scientists are generally limited to observing the asteroid based on the amount of visible light it reflects from the sun, with brighter light typically signaling a larger asteroid, the Webb telescope can calculate its infrared emissions, allowing for more accurate estimates.",
      "Webb will begin studying the asteroid in March, when it appears brightest, and again in May, according to the ESA. 2024 YR4 will disappear from view for a while after that, and astronomers will take time to interpret the telescope's data and determine what it could mean for the asteroid's route before it shows itself again in 2028.",

      "Musk's startup, xAI, claimed in a livestream announcement on Musk-owned social media platform X that Grok 3 is superior to competitors including OpenAI's GPT-4o, Alphabet's Google Gemini, DeepSeek's V3 model and Anthropic's Claude.",

      "\"We've removed these images for violating our policies and will continue monitoring for other violating posts.

      "How to spot deepfake images online",
      "An analysis of over a dozen of these images by Reality Defender, a platform that works to detect AI-generated media, showed that many of the photos were deepfake images \u2014 with AI-generated, underwear-clad bodies replacing the bodies of celebrities in otherwise real photographs. A few of the images were likely created using image stitching tools that do not involve AI, according to Reality Defender's analysis.",
      "\"Almost all deepfake pornography does not have the consent of the subject being deepfaked,\" Ben Colman, co-founder and CEO of Reality Defender told CBS News on Sunday. \"Such content is growing at a dizzying rate, especially as existing measures to stop such content are seldom implemented.\"",
      "CBS News has sought comments from Miranda Cosgrove, Jeanette McCurdy, Ariana Grande, and Maria Sharapova on this story. Johansson declined to issue any comment, according to a representative for the actor.",
      "Under Meta's Bullying and Harassment policy, the company prohibits \"derogatory sexualized photoshop or drawings\" on its platforms. The company also bans adult nudity, sexual activity and adult sexual exploitation, and its regulations are intended to block users from sharing or threatening to share non-consensual intimate imagery. Meta has also rolled out the use of \"AI info\" labels to clearly mark content that is AI manipulated.",
      "But questions remain over the effectiveness of the tech company's policing of such content. CBS News found dozens of AI-generated, sexualized images of Cosgrove and McCurdy still publicly available on Facebook even after the widespread sharing of such content, in violation of the company's terms, was flagged to Meta.",
      "One such deepfake image of Cosgrove that was still up over the weekend had been shared by an account with 2.8 million followers.",
      "The two actors \u2014 both former child stars on the Nickelodeon show \"iCarly,\" which is owned by CBS News' parent company Paramount Global \u2014 are the most prolifically targeted for deepfake content, based on the images of public figures that CBS News has analyzed.",
      "Meta's Oversight Board, a quasi-independent body that consists of experts in the field of human rights and freedom of speech, and makes recommendations for content moderation on Meta's platforms, told CBS News in an emailed statement that the company's current regulations around sexualized deepfake content are insufficient.",
      "The Oversight Board cited recommendations it has made to Meta over the past year,\u00a0 including urging the company to make its rules clearer by updating its prohibition against \"derogatory sexualized photoshop\" to specifically include the word \"non-consensual\" and to encompass other photo manipulation techniques such as AI.",
      "The board has also recommended that Meta fold its ban on \"derogatory sexualized photoshop\" into the company's Adult Sexual Exploitation regulations, so moderation of such content would be more rigorously enforced.",
      "Asked Monday by CBS News about the board's recommendations, Meta pointed to the guidelines on its transparency website, which show the company is assessing the feasibility of three of four recommendations from the oversight board and is implementing one of its suggestions, though Meta noted in its statement on its site that it is currently ruling out changing the language of its \"derogatory sexualized photoshop\" policy to include the phrase \"non consensual.\" Meta also says it is currently unlikely   to move its \"derogatory sexualized photoshop\" policy to within its Adult Sexual Exploitation regulations.",
      "Meta noted in its statement that it was still considering ways to signal a lack of consent in AI-generated images. Meta also said it was considering reforms to its Adult Sexual Exploitation policies, to \"capture the spirit\" of the board's recommendations.",
      "\"The Oversight Board has made clear that non-consensual deepfake intimate images are a serious violation of privacy and personal dignity, disproportionately harming women and girls. These images are not just a misuse of technology \u2014 they are a form of abuse that can have lasting consequences,\" Michael McConnell, an Oversight Board co-chair, told CBS News on Friday.",
      "\"The Board is actively monitoring Meta's response and will continue to push for stronger safeguards, faster enforcement, and greater accountability,\" McConnell said.",
      "Meta is not the only social media company to face the issue of widespread, sexualized deepfake content.",
      "Last year, Elon Musk's platform X temporarily blocked Taylor Swift-related searches after AI-generated fake pornographic images in the likeness of the singer circulated widely on the platform and garnered millions of views and impressions.",

      "Elon Musk has debuted a new version of his artificial intelligence chatbot, called Grok 3, days after rival OpenAI rejected the billionaire's bid for the company, which he cofounded with Sam Altman and others in 2015.",
      "Musk's startup, xAI, claimed in a livestream announcement on Musk-owned social media platform X that Grok 3 is superior to competitors including OpenAI's GPT-4o, Alphabet's Google Gemini, DeepSeek's V3 model and Anthropic's Claude.",
      "With its latest AI chatbot, xAI's mission according to Musk, is to \"understand the universe,\" including by answering questions such as, \"Where are the aliens?\" \"How does the universe end?\" and \"How did it start?\"",
      "Grok 3 surpasses the computer power of its previous iteration, Grok 2 by more than 10 times, xAI engineers said in an hour-long, livestreamed presentation on X.",
      "The company's claims about the AI's computing power and capabilities across categories such as mathematical reasoning, science and coding have not been independently verified.",
      "During the X livestream, xAI demoed Grok 3, asking the chatbot to plot a launch from earth to planet Mars, and back to earth at a future launch date. Musk and his engineers also asked it to create a game that is a hybrid between Tetris and Bejeweled, and to \"make it insanely great.\"",

    "summary": "Indigenous activist Leonard Peltier has been released from a high-security Florida prison. For nearly half a century, Peltier's imprisonment has symbolized systemic injustice for Native Americans who believe in his innocence.",
    "story": [
      "Indigenous activist Leonard Peltier was released from a Florida prison Tuesday morning after former President Joe Biden commuted his life sentence for the 1975 killings of two FBI agents, a decision that elated Peltier's supporters while angering law enforcement officials who believe in his guilt.",
      "\"Today I am finally free! They may have imprisoned me but they never took my spirit,\" Leonard Peltier said Tuesday. \"Thank you to all my supporters throughout the world who fought for my freedom. I am finally going home. I look forward to seeing my friends, my family, and my community. It's a good day today.\"",
      "For nearly half a century, Peltier's imprisonment has symbolized systemic injustice for Native Americans across the country who believe in his innocence. The decision to release the 80-year-old to home confinement was celebrated by supporters.",
      "\"He represents every person who's been roughed up by a cop, profiled, had their children harassed at school,\" said Nick Estes, a professor of American Indian Studies at the University of Minnesota and a member of the Lower Brule Sioux Tribe who has advocated for Peltier's release.",
      "Peltier was\u00a0denied parole\u00a0as recently as last July and wasn't eligible for parole again until 2026.",
      "The last-minute move as Biden was leaving office also prompted criticism from those who say Peltier is guilty, including former FBI Director Christopher Wray, who called him \"a remorseless killer\" in a private letter to Biden obtained by The Associated Press.",
      "\"Granting Peltier any relief from his conviction or sentence is wholly unjustified and would be an affront to the rule of law,\" Wray wrote.",
      "The commutation was not a pardon for crimes committed, something Peltier's advocates have hoped for since he has always maintained his innocence.",
      "A group of supporters gathered outside the Coleman federal prison Tuesday morning in anticipation of Peltier's release. One of his attorneys, Jenipher Jones said Peltier was looking forward to going home.",
      "\"We're so excited for this moment,\" Jones said. \"He is in good spirits. He has the soul of a warrior.\"",
      "After being released from USP Coleman, a high-security prison, Peltier planned to return to North Dakota, where a celebration and community feed was planned Wednesday with family and friends. NDN Collective will be hosting the event.",
      "\"Peltier's liberation is invaluable in and of itself \u2013 yet just as his wrongful incarceration represented the oppression of Indigenous Peoples everywhere, his release today is a symbol of our collective power and inherent freedom,\" Nick Tilsen, NDN Collective Founder and CEO, said.",
      "Biden commuted Peltier's sentence Jan. 20, noting he had spent most of his life in prison and was now in ill health.",
      "\"We never thought he would get out,\" Ray St. Clair, a member of the White Earth Band of the Minnesota Chippewa Tribe, said shortly before Peltier's release. \"It shows you should never give up hope. We can take this repairing the damage that was done. This is a start.\"",
      "Peltier, an enrolled member of the Turtle Mountain Band of Chippewa in North Dakota, was active in the American Indian Movement, which beginning in the 1960s fought for Native American treaty rights and tribal self-determination.",
      "The group grabbed headlines in 1969, when activists occupied the former prison island of Alcatraz in the San Francisco Bay, and again in 1972, when they presented presidential candidates with a list of demands including the restoration of tribal land. After they were ignored, they seized the headquarters of the Bureau of Indian Affairs.",
      "From then on the group was subject to FBI surveillance and harassment under a covert program that sought to disrupt activism and was exposed in 1975.",
      "Peltier's conviction stemmed from a confrontation that same year on the Oglala Sioux Indian Reservation in Pine Ridge, South Dakota, in which FBI agents Jack Coler and Ronald Williams were killed. According to the FBI, the agents were there to serve arrest warrants for robbery and assault with a dangerous weapon.",
      "Prosecutors maintained at trial that Peltier shot both agents in the head at point-blank range. Peltier acknowledged being present and firing a gun at a distance, but said he fired in self-defense. A woman who claimed to have seen Peltier shoot the agents later recanted her testimony, saying it had been coerced.",
      "He was convicted of two counts of first-degree murder and given two consecutive life sentences.",
      "Two other movement members, co-defendants Robert Robideau and Dino Butler, were acquitted on the grounds of self-defense.",
      "\"Leonard Peltier's release is the right thing to do given the serious and ongoing human rights concerns about the fairness of his trial, his nearly 50 years behind bars, his health and his age,\" said Paul O'Brien, executive director with Amnesty International USA in a statement. \"While we welcome his release from prison, he should not be restricted to home confinement.\"",
      "Prominent Native American groups like the National Congress of the American Indian have called for Peltier's release for decades, and Amnesty International considered him a political prisoner. Prominent supporters included South African Archbishop Desmond Tutu, civil rights icon Coretta Scott King, actor and director Robert Redford and musicians Pete Seeger, Harry Belafonte and Jackson Browne.",
      "The\u00a0fight for Peltier's freedom\u00a0is entangled with the Indigenous rights movements. Nearly half a century later, his name remains a rallying cry.",
      "\"President Biden took an enormous step toward healing and reconciliation with the Native American people in this country,\" Peltier's former attorney Kevin Sharp said in a statement in January, following Biden's decision. \"It took nearly 50 years to acknowledge the injustice of Leonard Peltier's conviction and continued incarceration, but with the president's act of mercy Leonard can finally return to his reservation and live out his remaining days.\"",
      "Former Interior Secretary Deb Haaland, a member of the Pueblo of Laguna and the first Native American to hold the secretary's position, praised Biden's decision.",
      "\"I am grateful that Leonard can now go home to his family,\" she said Jan. 20 in a post on the social platform X. \"I applaud President Biden for this action and understanding what this means to Indian Country.\"",
      "As a young child, Peltier was taken from his family and sent to a boarding school. Thousands of Indigenous children over decades faced the same fate, and were in many cases subjected to systemic physical, psychological and sexual abuse.",
      "\"He hasn't really had a home since he was taken away to boarding school,\" said Nick Tilsen, who has been advocating for Peltier's release since he was a teen and is CEO of NDN Collective, an Indigenous-led advocacy group based in South Dakota. \"So he is excited to be at home and paint and have grandkids running around.\"",

      "There were 80 people on board Flight 4819 \u2014 76 passengers and four crew members \u2014 all of whom survived. Authorities said 21 people were injured. Two of the injured passengers, a 40-year-old woman and 60-year-old man, were initially said to be critically hurt and were airlifted to a hospital, while the others' injuries were considered mild to moderate, according to a regional paramedics service that responded to the scene. Delta said two people remained hospitalized Tuesday, CBS News Minnesota reported.",
      "One of the passengers speaking out about his experience is Pete Carlson, who boarded the plane Monday morning at Minneapolis-St. Paul International Airport to attend a paramedics conference in Canada.",
      "In an interview with Canadian broadcaster CBC News, Carlson recalled the sounds of \"cement and metal\" and the scent of gasoline as the plane skidded down the icy runway in Toronto, losing both wings and its tail and turning over completely so its wheels faced the sky.",
      "\"As we made our descent and made touchdown, it was just a very forceful event, where all of a sudden everything just kind of went sideways,\" Carlson told CBC News. \"And then, next thing I know, it was kind of a blink and I'm upside down, still strapped in.\"",
      "Carlson had fastened his seatbelt, as instructed, prior to landing. When he unlatched the belt to evacuate the plane, he said he \"crashed down onto the ceiling, which had become the floor.\"",
      "Emergency workers at the airport were able to reach the site of the crash \"within minutes,\" said Deborah Flint, president and CEO of Toronto Pearson International Airport, at a news conference Monday night. They quickly helped evacuate everyone on board. Flint said 22 of the passengers were Canadian and the rest were multinational, but did not provide details on how many were American or other nationalities.",
      "\"The most powerful part of today was, there was just people. No countries, no nothing,\" Carlson said. \"There was just people together helping each other.\"",
      "Another passenger, John Nelson, captured video of the plane, charred and overturned, as people climbed out of it into the freezing cold.",
      "Nelson described the plane making a hard landing before screeching over the pavement on its side and ultimately flipping onto its back,\u00a0CBS News Minnesota\u00a0reported.",
      "\"There was, like, a big fireball outside the left side of the plane and when we got finished we were upside down, everybody else was there as well,\" Nelson said. \"We tried to get out of there as quickly as possible.\"",
      "Several additional videos emerged online as passengers began to film the evacuation. In one video shared on Snapchat, passenger Ashley Zook appeared to dangle upside down from her seat inside the plane with her seatbelt fastened, AFP reported. The crash seemed to have knocked out the lights inside the plane, and it was dark.",
      "That same social media video showed harsh winds whipping past Zook after she exited the plane.",
      "\"I was just in a plane crash, oh my god,\" she said in the video.",
      "Another passenger, skier and sports influencer Pete Koukov, shared another video of the crash-landing on Instagram. A flight attendant wearing an Endeavor Air uniform is seen helping people evacuate the plane one by one through an emergency exit door, which Koukov climbed through himself. Endeavor Air is a subsidiary of Delta Air Lines headquartered in Minneapolis.",
      "The flight attendant can be heard directing passengers to \"drop everything\" and urging them to \"come on.\"",
      "\"Holy f***!\" Koukov repeatedly exclaims in the recording after getting of the plane. His Instagram post includes the message: \"Being alive feels pretty cool today.\"",
      "Koukov later told CNN that \"we were upside down hanging like bats\" inside the plane before evacuating. He said he \"didn't know anything was the matter\" until the plane hit the ground.",

      "A painting by street artist Banksy with an environmental message and an estimate of up to 5 million pounds ($6.3 million) is going up for auction, with some of the proceeds helping victims of the Los Angeles wildfires.",
      "Sotheby's auction house said Tuesday that \"Crude Oil (Vettriano)\" is being sold by Sotheby's in London on March 4 from the collection of Mark Hoppus, bassist with California skate-punk band Blink-182, who sees Banksy as a kindred spirit.",
      "Hoppus said he was drawn to the subversion, humor and intelligence of Banksy's work and the similarities between \"skateboarding, punk rock and art.\"",
      "\"I feel like street art and punk rock have the same core,\" Hoppus said. \"The left-out and overlooked making their own reality. \u2026 Just go make art. It's the same spirit. And I've loved art and especially street art ever since realizing that.\"",
      "\"Crude Oil (Vettriano)\" is part of a 2005 series of works in which Banksy put a satirical spin on famous paintings \u2014 withering Vincent van Gogh's \"Sunflowers\" and smashing the diner window in Edward Hopper's \"Nighthawks.\" The artist said his aim was to show that \"the real damage done to our environment is not done by graffiti writers and drunken teenagers, but by big business.\"",
      "The work going under the hammer is based on \"The Singing Butler,\" a painting by Scottish artist Jack Vettriano showing a couple in evening dress dancing on a beach as servants proffer sheltering umbrellas. Banksy has added a sinking oil liner and two figures lugging a barrel of toxic waste.",
      "\"We loved this painting since the moment we saw it,\" said Hoppus, who bought the artwork with his wife Skye in 2011. He said the painting \u2013 \"unmistakably Banksy, but different\" \u2013 has hung in the family's homes in London and LA ever since.",
      "Hoppus said he would use the proceeds of the sale to buy work by upcoming artists. Some will go to the California Fire Foundation, Children's Hospital Los Angeles and Cedars Sinai Hematology Oncology Research,",
      "Banksy, who has never confirmed his full identity, began his career spray-painting buildings in Bristol, England, and has become one of the world's best-known artists.

    "summary": "\"I am the defender of your public lands and waters ... I am the highlight of your child's school day ... I am tired of waking up every morning at 2am wondering how I am going to provide for my family if I lose my job,\" Brian Gibbs wrote.",
    "story": [
      "When Brian Gibbs woke up on Valentine's Day on Friday, it was just another morning of getting to do what he loved at his \"dream job\" as an education park ranger at Effigy Mounds National Monument in Iowa. By that afternoon, the father and husband said he was \"absolutely heartbroken and completely devastated\" to have been one of hundreds of National Park Service employees suddenly fired from their jobs.",
      "\"Access to my government email was denied mid-afternoon and my position was ripped out from out under my feet after my shift was over at 3:45pm on a cold snowy Friday,\" Gibbs wrote in a viral Facebook post. \"Additionally, before I could fully print off my government records, I was also locked out of my electronic personal file that contained my secure professional records.\"",
      "About 3,400 recently hired employees with the U.S. Forest Service and 1,000 employees with the National Park Service were fired from their jobs over the weekend under the Trump administration, accounting for 10% and 5% of those workforces, respectively. Seasonal employees will be exempt from a hiring freeze for the National Park Service.",
      "Gibbs' post, featuring images of him, his wife and son has been shared more than 220,000 times. Signed \"Ranger Brian,\" the post goes on to pen an emotional tribute to the role, of which he called himself a \"dedicated civil servant ... a work evaluation that reads 'exceeds expectations' ... a United States flag raiser and folder\" among other things.",
      "\"I am of the place where I first told my spouse I loved her. I am a college kid's dream job,\" he wrote. \"...I am a voice for 19 American Indian cultures. I am the protector of 2500 year old American Indian burial and ceremonial mounds. I am the defender of your public lands and waters.\"",
      "The father went on to describe the impact that he and other park rangers have on children who frequent national parks. At Iowa's Effigy Mounds, the National Park that's home to spaces that are sacred to 20 culturally associated Indigenous tribes, provides educational programs for students, including tours and demonstrations, according to the park's website.",
      "Gibbs has long shared his love for the land he tends. In November, the Department of the Interior shared a photo of the Northern Lights that Gibbs took from the park, showcasing pink lights cascading through the star-filled sky. Effigy Mounds has shared other photos Gibbs has taken of the Northern Lights in previous occurrences.",
      "\"I am the highlight of your child's school day. I am the band aid for a skinned knee. I am the lesson that showed your children that we live in a world of gifts- not commodities, that gratitude and reciprocity are the doorway to true abundance, not power, money, or fear,\" Gibbs wrote. \"I am the one who taught your kid the thrush's song and the hawk's cry. I am the wildflower that brought your student joy. I am the one who told your child that they belong on this planet. That their unique gifts and existence matters.\"",
      "But then, Gibbs' words became those of exasperation. He spoke of being \"the resistance,\" but also of experiencing loss and fatigue.",
      "\"I am tired of waking up every morning at 2am wondering how I am going to provide for my family if I lose my job. I am tired of wiping away my wife's tears and reassuring her that things will be ok for us and our growing little family that she's carrying,\" he said. \"Things are not ok. I am not ok.  (This is the second time in under five years a dream job I worked has been eliminated. Now I may need to uproot my FAMILY again.)\"",
      "Gibbs' family is not alone in the heartache and disappointment of the job cuts.",
      "National Parks Conservation Association President and CEO Theresa Pierno said in a statement on Friday that while seasonal staff is essential, \"staffing cuts of this magnitude will have devastating consequences for parks and communities.\"",
      "\"With peak season just weeks away, the decision to slash 1,000 permanent, full-time jobs from national parks is reckless and could have serious public safety and health consequences,\" Pierno said. \"Years of budget cuts are already weakening the agency's ability to protect and preserve these incredible places.\"",
      "\"National Park Service employees dedicate their careers to preserving our nation's most treasured landscapes and historic sites,\" Phil Francis, chair of The Coalition to Protect America's National Parks wrote in a statement. \"We should be supporting them \u2014 not jeopardizing their livelihoods or discouraging their commitment to public service.\"",

    "summary": "\"No Kings on Presidents Day\" rallies in cities nationwide, many in bitter cold, protested against President Trump, adviser Elon Musk, DOGE, the administration's immigration policies and more.",
    "story": [
      "Protesters against President Trump and his policies braved frigid temperatures in parts of the U.S. Monday, shouting \"No kings on Presidents Day\" in East Coast cities and attempting to enter the Arizona Statehouse to oppose a bill that would bolster fast-changing federal immigration enforcement.",
      "In Florida and California, local media outlets reported on hundreds of protesters carrying out \"Not my Presidents Day\" protests. The \"No Kings\" theme was orchestrated by the 50501 Movement and marked the second set of protests criss-crossing the nation in less than two weeks. A similar nationwide event on Feb. 5 drew participants in dozens of cities. Both sets of rallies denounced Mr. Trump and billionaire adviser Elon Musk, the head of the White House's Department of Government Efficiency, known as DOGE, which the administration says is designed to slash federal spending.",
      "Nearly 1,000 people marched in the snow from the Statehouse in Boston to City Hall, chanting \"Elon Musk has got to go\" and other slogans. The temperature was below freezing, with wind chills in the teens.",
      "Boston protesters, some dressed in Revolutionary War-style clothing, carried signs saying such things as \"This is a Coup\" and \"Cowards Bow to Trump, Patriots Stand Up.\" One sign had a depiction of Uncle Sam saying \"I Want You to Resist.\"",
      "\"I thought it was important to be here on Presidents Day to demonstrate for what America stands for,\" said Emily Manning, 55, a Boston engineer who came to the rally with her two teenage sons. \"American values are not the values of the plutocracy or the limited few rich people.\"",
      "Organizers of Monday's protests, which were focused on state capitals and major cities including Washington, D.C.; Orlando, Florida; and Seattle, said they were targeting \"anti-democratic and illegal actions of the Trump administration and its plutocratic allies.\"",
      "One sign at the rally that attracted hundreds in the nation's capital said, \"Deport Musk Dethrone Trump.\"",
      "Many demonstrations were slated for cities where temperatures were well below freezing as a polar vortex worked its way across the country.",
      "The rallies followed a series of executive orders from Mr. Trump and came just days after\u00a0job cuts across federal agencies as part of an effort to reduce the government workforce. Many of those administration actions are facing legal challenges.",
      "In Phoenix, hundreds of protesters gathered in front of the Capitol carrying signs reading \"No Kings\" and \"Resist Fascism.\" Security barred protesters from entering the building after a few tried to get inside. Demonstrators were seeking access to a state Senate committee hearing on legislation that would require law enforcement officers across the state to support federal immigration policy.",
      "Protest organizer December Archer said her goal was to keep the event civil. She quickly came between someone trying to enter the Statehouse and a security guard who pushed the protester back through the doorway.",
      "\"We're trying to make sure everything stays civil and stays respectable because again, we're here to make a statement, not be the statement,\" Archer said.",
      "A state Senate committee heard the measure in a packed room and it passed in a party-line vote,\u00a0CBS Phoenix affiliate KPHO-TV reports.",
      "The station quoted the bill's sponsor, Senate President Warren Petersen, as saying, \"After the past four years of lawlessness at our border, it is imperative that every level of government supports efforts to safeguard our communities from the harms of illegal immigration. Arizona is a border state, and as such, we need to empower our sworn agents to enforce our laws and assist the Trump Administration's efforts on this front.\"",
      "Critics say the measure, and several other anti-illegal immigration bills, promote racial profiling and family separation and waste taxpayer dollars.",
      "\"These types of bills are created and put forth to politicize with an issue of our humanity,\" ex-state lawmaker Raquel Ter\u00e1n told KPHO. \"That is the last priority of the voters in Arizona.\"",
      "Among many other cities, demonstrators turned out in Denver; Dallas;\u00a0Annapolis, Maryland; Oakland and San Francisco; Los Angeles and Miami.",
      "CBS News Miami reports that counter-demonstrations were held in support of Mr. Trump in West Palm Beach, including a gathering outside Trump International Golf Club.",
      "\"50501,\" which stands for \"50 protests, 50 states, one day,\" is a grassroots attempt to protest the policies and actions of the second Trump administration.",

In the meantime, the agency will be led by a career Social Security anti-fraud expert as the acting commissioner.\"",
      "The White House did not provide a specific reason for King's departure. CBS News has reached out to the SSA for comment.",
      "Nancy Altman, the president of the advocacy group Social Security Works, told CBS News they heard from SSA employees that officials from the Department of Government Efficiency, or DOGE, had been trying to get access to the Enterprise Data Warehouse \u2014 a centralized database that serves as the main hub for personal, sensitive information related to social security benefits such as beneficiary records and earnings data. Altman was told King had been resistant to giving DOGE officials access to the database.",
      "\"She was standing in the way and they moved her out of the way. They put someone in who presumably they thought would cooperate with them and give them the keys to all our personal data,\" Altman said.",
      "The Washington Post first reported King's departure.",
      "King's exit from the administration is one of several departures of high-ranking officials concerned about DOGE staffers' potential unlawful access to private taxpayer information.",
      "DOGE has accessed Treasury payment systems and is attempting to access Internal Revenue Service databases.",

      "The dramatic scene, captured on video by air traffic controllers and, later, the passengers on board, left 21 people injured \u2014 two critically. What caused it remains under investigation by the Canadian Transportation Safety Board and multiple transit agencies in the United States. Here's what we know so far.",
      "The ceiling of the plane \"had become the floor\"",
      "Delta Air Lines Flight 4819 departed Minneapolis-St. Paul International Airport in Minnesota on Monday morning, carrying 76 passengers and four crew members.",
      "The plane, operated by Minneapolis-based Delta Air Lines subsidiary Endeavor Air, struck the landing strip as it arrived at Toronto Airport at about 1:15 p.m. CST, according to Delta. Images and video of the accident showed the CRJ-900 aircraft catch fire when it hit the pavement and proceeded to turn sideways while sliding across the airfield, losing its tail and both wings along the way.",
      "It eventually flipped over and came to a halt. Passengers on the plane have since described hanging upside down, suspended by their fastened seatbelts, with one person recalling how he \"crashed down onto the ceiling, which had become the floor\" after unbuckling.",
      "Emergency teams rushed to the site of the crash, extinguishing the blaze and then evacuating the passengers who were still inside. At a news conference Tuesday, Toronto International Airport president and CEO Deborah Flint praised the Delta flight crew and emergency workers at the airport for launching a \"textbook\" response to the accident that got underway \"within minutes.\"",
      "\"The crew of Delta Flight 4819 heroically led passengers to safety, evacuating a jet that had overturned on the runway on landing that was amidst, smoke and fire,\" Flint said. \"Thank you for all that you do every day and every night in service of safe air travel.\"",
      "Two people were critically injured",
      "All 80 passengers and crew members on the Delta flight survived the crash. Emergency responders and the flight crew themselves ushered passengers down the aisle of the overturned jet and helped evacuate them through an emergency exit door. More footage from the crash showed passengers climbing out of the aircraft and stepping out onto a snowy tarmac, where powerful winds whipped past.",
      "Officials originally reported that 19 people suffered injuries in the accident, but the number was revised up to 21 between Monday and Tuesday. Flint said 19 people were taken to hospitals in the area for medical treatment immediately after the crash, and two more were admitted later on. Corey Tkatch, commander of operations for Peel Regional Paramedic Services, said some people suffered back sprains, head injuries, anxiety and \"nausea and vomiting due to the fuel exposure.\"",
      "Nineteen of the injured people had been released by Tuesday, according to Delta Air Lines, while two remained hospitalized and their conditions were listed as critical. The exact nature of their situations has not been publicized, but Flint told reporters the people hurt on Flight 4819 had a range of injuries considered minor to critical, none of which are life-threatening.",
      "Peel Regional Paramedic Services at first classified a child as injured and in critical condition, but the Hospital for Sick Children later said the child was in good condition. Reporters pressed airport officials and responders Tuesday for answers as to whether the two people still hospitalized with critical injuries included any children, but the officials said they did not know.",
      "Toronto was experiencing rough and frigid weather",
      "Evacuees from the plane crash were met with harsh wintry conditions when they exited onto the airfield, with one person likening the environment to tundra weather. Snow and ice coated the tarmac, and powerful, blustery winds could be seen on video.",
      "Meteorologists said Toronto was experiencing blowing snow when the accident occurred, and visibility had been reduced to 6 miles. Winds were gusting up to 37 miles per hour and temperatures dropped far below freezing to just 17 degrees Fahrenheit.",
      "But Toronto International Airport Fire Chief Todd Aitken said Monday that the airport runway was dry at the time of the crash, and there were no crosswind conditions as the Delta flight arrived.",
      "Flint on Tuesday said the crash occurred on \"an operational day\" at the Toronto airport, which canceled hundreds of flights over the weekend as a result of heavy snowfall. By Monday, more than 1,000 flights were scheduled, and they resumed at the airport just about three hours after the accident.",
      "Almost two dozen members of Transportation Safety Board of Canada are leading an investigation into the crash and what may have caused it. The United States National Transportation Safety Board and Federal Aviation Administration will also send people from both U.S. agencies to assist in the probe.",

      "The 88-year-old pope has been\u00a0hospitalized since Friday at Rome's Gemelli hospital after coming down with bronchitis the week before, and officials said he is suffering from a \"polymicrobial respiratory tract infection.\"",
      "Here's a look at the Pope's diagnosis and what his treatment could involve.",
      "What is a polymicrobial respiratory tract infection?",
      "Essentially, it means there's a mix of bacteria, viruses, fungi or parasites growing in someone's lungs.",
      "\"Often times, people will get a bronchitis or an airway infection and that can often start a cascade of multiple problems, including infections in the lungs,\" said Dr. Maor Sauler, who specializes in adult pulmonary and critical care medicine at Yale University's School of Medicine. He said such issues were common in older people whose immune systems might be weaker or had complex health issues.",
      "\"It likely means he has more than one organism in his lungs,\" Sauler said, explaining that the pope's doctors might have to adjust his treatment to make sure the antibiotics attack all the various organisms.",
      "Pneumonia is a diagnosis of inflammation or fluid in the lungs, which can caused by a viral, bacterial or fungal infection. \"Bilateral\" pneumonia means the infection has developed in both lungs.",
      "How serious is polymicrobial respiratory tract infection?",
      "For someone with the pope's medical history \u2014 he lost part of his right lung decades ago and has previously had pneumonia \u2014 it's worrying that he's been hospitalized.",
      "Dr. Nick Hopkinson, medical director of Asthma + Lung UK, said most healthy people would likely recover quickly from bronchitis.",
      "But in people whose lungs are already damaged, \"bacteria can come and colonize the airways \u2026 and you start to see infections which makes it more difficult to treat.\" In people with lungs that have been previously compromised, they might need help breathing, including oxygen support or chest physiotherapy to help them clear fluids building up in their lungs.",
      "Still, Hopkinson said that getting the pope on the right medications should help.",
      "\"If they've identified particular things to treat, they can treat those and he'll start to recover.\"",
      "How long might this take?",
      "That depends. Antibiotic treatments typically take from a few days up to about two weeks. Hopkinson said the pope might be given various medicines, including ones that people typically take for asthma or conditions like chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, in addition to getting physiotherapy to help keep his chest as clear as possible.",
      "\"Some infections require prolonged treatment because they're just harder to clear from the system,\" Hopkinson said. \"It sounds like they've identified the bugs that are responsible and they'll be able to treat those\u2026but we'll just have to wait and see.\"",
      "Dr. Peter Openshaw, a lung expert at Imperial College London, said the presence of multiple organisms wasn't unusual in people with complex medical histories but could be hard to manage.",
      "Are there other issues doctors might be concerned about?",
      "Pneumonia\u00a0was a likely worry given the pope's medical condition.",
      "\"Even though we can treat pneumonias with antibiotics, pneumonias are also one of the leading causes of death,\" said Sauler of Yale University. He said antibiotics don't work in isolation and that a person's immune system is also critical to fighting off pneumonia, pointing out that the immune systems in older people aren't usually as resilient.",
      "\"When you're 88 years old, the age of the pope, then all of a sudden you have risk factors that make the situation tougher than just a routine pneumonia.\"",
      "What will doctors be monitoring next?",
      "Sauler said the biggest thing to watch out for in the coming days is any sign that the pope is getting worse.",
      "\"I'd be most interested in making sure he's not worsening despite the best efforts (of his doctors). That's usually a bad prognostic sign,\" he said, adding that they would likely review his condition in a few days to see whether or not the prescribed drugs are working.",
      "\"I have optimism and hope that he can pull through with the right antibiotic.\"",
      "What are the pope's other health issues?",
      "Pope Francis has been treated for a number of health issues in recent years, including two abdominal surgeries\u00a0and several previous\u00a0respiratory infections, including one that hospitalized him days before Holy Week in 2023. Knee trouble\u00a0led him to cut back on travel, and he often uses a wheelchair.",
      "He said in 2022, \"I think at my age and with these limitations, I have to save (my energy) to be able to serve the church, or on the contrary, think about the possibility of stepping aside.\"",
      "But in a rare\u00a0interview\u00a0with CBS News' Norah O'Donnell in 2024, the pope described his health as \"fine\" and said he had no plans to leave the papacy.",
      "\"Maybe if the day comes when my health can go no further,\" Francis said. \"Perhaps because the only infirmity I have is in my knee, and that is getting much better. But it never occurred to me.\"",

      "There were 80 people on board Flight 4819 \u2014 76 passengers and four crew members \u2014 all of whom survived. Authorities said 21 people were injured. Two of the injured passengers, a 40-year-old woman and 60-year-old man, were initially said to be critically hurt and were airlifted to a hospital, while the others' injuries were considered mild to moderate, according to a regional paramedics service that responded to the scene. Delta said two people remained hospitalized Tuesday, CBS News Minnesota reported.",
      "One of the passengers speaking out about his experience is Pete Carlson, who boarded the plane Monday morning at Minneapolis-St. Paul International Airport to attend a paramedics conference in Canada.",
      "In an interview with Canadian broadcaster CBC News, Carlson recalled the sounds of \"cement and metal\" and the scent of gasoline as the plane skidded down the icy runway in Toronto, losing both wings and its tail and turning over completely so its wheels faced the sky.",
      "\"As we made our descent and made touchdown, it was just a very forceful event, where all of a sudden everything just kind of went sideways,\" Carlson told CBC News. \"And then, next thing I know, it was kind of a blink and I'm upside down, still strapped in.\"",
      "Carlson had fastened his seatbelt, as instructed, prior to landing. When he unlatched the belt to evacuate the plane, he said he \"crashed down onto the ceiling, which had become the floor.\"",
      "Emergency workers at the airport were able to reach the site of the crash \"within minutes,\" said Deborah Flint, president and CEO of Toronto Pearson International Airport, at a news conference Monday night. They quickly helped evacuate everyone on board. Flint said 22 of the passengers were Canadian and the rest were multinational, but did not provide details on how many were American or other nationalities.",
      "\"The most powerful part of today was, there was just people. No countries, no nothing,\" Carlson said. \"There was just people together helping each other.\"",
      "Another passenger, John Nelson, captured video of the plane, charred and overturned, as people climbed out of it into the freezing cold.",
      "Nelson described the plane making a hard landing before screeching over the pavement on its side and ultimately flipping onto its back,\u00a0CBS News Minnesota\u00a0reported.",
      "\"There was, like, a big fireball outside the left side of the plane and when we got finished we were upside down, everybody else was there as well,\" Nelson said. \"We tried to get out of there as quickly as possible.\"",
      "Several additional videos emerged online as passengers began to film the evacuation. In one video shared on Snapchat, passenger Ashley Zook appeared to dangle upside down from her seat inside the plane with her seatbelt fastened, AFP reported. The crash seemed to have knocked out the lights inside the plane, and it was dark.",
      "That same social media video showed harsh winds whipping past Zook after she exited the plane.",
      "\"I was just in a plane crash, oh my god,\" she said in the video.",
      "Another passenger, skier and sports influencer Pete Koukov, shared another video of the crash-landing on Instagram. A flight attendant wearing an Endeavor Air uniform is seen helping people evacuate the plane one by one through an emergency exit door, which Koukov climbed through himself. Endeavor Air is a subsidiary of Delta Air Lines headquartered in Minneapolis.",
      "The flight attendant can be heard directing passengers to \"drop everything\" and urging them to \"come on.\"",
      "\"Holy f***!\" Koukov repeatedly exclaims in the recording after getting of the plane. His Instagram post includes the message: \"Being alive feels pretty cool today.\"",
      "Koukov later told CNN that \"we were upside down hanging like bats\" inside the plane before evacuating. He said he \"didn't know anything was the matter\" until the plane hit the ground.",
      "The crash is under investigation by the Transportation Safety Board of Canada, which confirmed it is leading the probe. The U.S. National Transportation Safety Board and Federal Aviation Administration said they would send investigators as well.",
      "Meteorologists said there was blowing snow in Toronto when the crash happened, and visibility was down to 6 miles. Winds were gusting up to 37 mph and temperatures were well below freezing, at 17 degrees Fahrenheit.",
      "But Toronto Pearson International Airport Fire Chief Todd Aitken said Monday night that the runway was dry at the time of the crash, and there were no crosswind conditions.

    "published": "Tue, 18 Feb 2025 12:29:53 -0500",
    "summary": "Archaeologists in Egypt have found of the tomb of King Thutmose II - the first discovery of an ancient royal tomb since King Tutankhamun's in 1922.",
    "story": [
      "Egyptian officials announced Tuesday the discovery of the tomb of King Thutmose II, the last of the lost tombs of the kings of ancient Egypt's Eighteenth Dynasty, which reigned for over two centuries between about 1550 BC and 1292 BC. It's the first royal Egyptian tomb to be discovered since King Tutankhamun's final resting place was found in 1922.",
      "A joint Egyptian-British archaeological mission discovered Thutmose II's tomb in the mount of Thebes area, west of Luxor and the renowned Valley of the Kings. The team and the Egyptian Ministry of Tourism and Antiquities, which made the announcement, said evidence was discovered that clearly indicates it was King Thutmose II's tomb during excavations of what had previously been known only as tomb No. C4.",
      "The entrance and main passage into the structure were discovered in 2022, and internal excavations have continued meticulously since then.",
      "Dr. Mohamed Ismail Khaled, Secretary-General of Egypt's Supreme Council of Antiquities, said when the mission first found the entrance to the tomb and its main passage almost three years ago, the team believed it could belong to one of the wives of the kings, given its proximity to the tomb of the wives of King Thutmose III and its proximity to the tomb of Queen Hatshepsut, which was prepared for her as a royal wife before she became ruler of the ancient kingdom. She ended up being buried in the Valley of the Kings, due to her ascent to the throne.",
      "As the excavation work and examination of artifacts continued, the mission found new evidence that identified the owner of the mysterious tomb as King Thutmose II, suggesting also that his burial rites were carried out by Queen Hatshepsut, who was his wife and half-sister.",
      "Khaled said parts of alabaster vessels found in the ruins have inscriptions bearing the name of King Thutmose II and identifying him as the \"deceased king,\" along with the name of his wife, Hatshepsut, all of which he said had helped to confirm Thutmose II as the owner of the tomb.",
      "He described the discovery as one of the most important archaeological finds in recent years. The artifacts discovered are important additions to the body of knowledge around the history of the area and the reign of King Thutmose II.",
      "The mummy of King Thutmose II was discovered during the 19th century, not far away at another archaeological site known as the Deir el-Bahari Cachette, to which the it was likely moved centuries after being looted by tomb raiders, according to the\u00a0relatively new National Museum\u00a0of Egyptian Civilization. His mummy is now on display, among those of other ancient royals, at the museum.",
      "The tomb is in a poor state of preservation due largely to exposure to floods shortly after Thutmose II's death, according to Mohamed Abdel Badie, Head of the Egyptian Antiquities Sector at the Supreme Council of Antiquities and Head of the Egyptian team that has worked on the dig. Abdel Badie said initial studies also indicate much of the original contents of the tomb were moved to another location after the ancient floods.",
      "He said the teams had discovered mortar in the tomb with remnants of blue inscriptions and yellow stars, and some paragraphs from the book of \"Imydwat,\" which is one of the most important funerary books found in ancient Egyptian tombs, written to help guide the late royals through their underworld journey.",
      "Dr. Piers Litherland, head of the English team at the site, said the tomb is characterized by a simple architectural design typical of those chosen by the successive rulers of Egypt who came after Thutmose II.",
      "Litherland said the mission would continue its survey work and try to determine where the rest of the contents from Thutmose II's tomb were relocated to, and to uncover any further secrets that may have been locked beneath the earth for millennia.",

    "story": [
      "Cairo\u00a0\u2014 In a surprise announcement, a top Hamas leader said Tuesday that the U.S. and Israeli-designated terrorist group would release six living Israeli hostages on Saturday and the bodies of four others on Thursday, including the remains of the Bibas family, who for many Israelis have embodied the captives' plight in Gaza.",
      "Israel has said it is gravely concerned about Shiri Bibas and her two young sons, Ariel and Kfir, but has not confirmed their deaths. Hamas said they were killed in an Israeli airstrike early in the war.",
      "Kfir, who was 9 months old at the time, was the youngest hostage taken in the Hamas-orchestrated Oct. 7, 2023 terrorist attack that triggered the war in Gaza. Israel's retaliatory war in Gaza has killed more than 48,000 people, according to the Hamas-run Health Ministry in the Palestinian territory.",
      "A video of the abduction on Oct. 7 showed Shiri swaddling her redheaded boys in a blanket and being whisked away by armed men.",
      "Hamas leader Khalil al-Hayya, in prerecorded remarks on Tuesday, said the \"Bibas family\" would be included in the handover of four bodies. They will be the first hostage remains released by the group under the current ceasefire, which took effect on January 19.",
      "The six to be released on Saturday are the last of the 33 living hostages to be freed during the ceasefire's first phase, according to the terms of the agreement brokered by the U.S., Qatar and Egypt. The group that represents the hostages' families in Israel welcomed the news Tuesday and named the six set to be released as Eliya Cohen, Tal Shoham, Omer Shem Tov, Omer Wenkert, Hisham Al-Sayed and Avera Mengistu.",
      "The terms of the deal called for only three more hostages to be freed in this next exchange, and it was not immediately clear why Hamas had changed the plan.",
      "An Israeli official, speaking on condition of anonymity in line with regulations, said however that Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu had agreed to allow long-requested mobile homes and construction equipment into Gaza as part of efforts to accelerate the hostages' release.",
      "Hamas last week threatened to delay its ongoing releases of hostages, citing the refusal to allow in mobile homes and heavy equipment among other alleged Israeli violations of the truce, but an agreement was reached ahead of the Saturday handover, which went ahead without incident.",
      "An American-Israeli dual national, Sagui Dekel-Chen, was among the three hostages released on Feb. 15 \u2014 the second U.S. national freed by Hamas during this ceasefire after Keith Siegel was handed over earlier in the month.",
      "The hostages have been freed in exchange for the release of hundreds of Palestinian prisoners from Israeli prisons \u2013 including some who were serving long sentences for serious crimes.",
      "The ceasefire has paused the deadliest fighting ever between Israel and Hamas, enabled a surge of aid into the devastated Gaza Strip and allowed hundreds of thousands of Palestinians to return to their homes, or what is left of them, as Israeli forces have withdrawn from much of the territory.",
      "The sides have yet to negotiate the second and more difficult phase, in which Hamas would release dozens more hostages in exchange for a lasting ceasefire and an Israeli withdrawal.",
      "Major challenges are ahead. Israel's government says it wants to eliminate Hamas' military and governing capabilities in Gaza. But the terrorist group quickly reasserted its control over the territory during the ceasefire despite losing leaders and many fighters.",
      "In addition, President Trump's new proposal to relocate the Palestinians out of Gaza so the U.S. can redevelop the territory has been rejected by the Arab world and by the Palestinians, whom Mr. Trump \u00a0has said would not be allowed to return. But Israel has embraced the plan and, along with the Trump administration, has emphasized they share the same goals in the war.",
      "Israelis were horrified by the sight of three emaciated hostages in an earlier release this month, and revelations about hostages being held alone, barefoot or in chains have increased the pressure on Netanyahu's government to push ahead with the ceasefire's next stage.",

    "story": [
      "A painting by street artist Banksy with an environmental message and an estimate of up to 5 million pounds ($6.3 million) is going up for auction, with some of the proceeds helping victims of the Los Angeles wildfires.",
      "Sotheby's auction house said Tuesday that \"Crude Oil (Vettriano)\" is being sold by Sotheby's in London on March 4 from the collection of Mark Hoppus, bassist with California skate-punk band Blink-182, who sees Banksy as a kindred spirit.",
      "Hoppus said he was drawn to the subversion, humor and intelligence of Banksy's work and the similarities between \"skateboarding, punk rock and art.\"",
      "\"I feel like street art and punk rock have the same core,\" Hoppus said. \"The left-out and overlooked making their own reality. \u2026 Just go make art. It's the same spirit. And I've loved art and especially street art ever since realizing that.\"",
      "\"Crude Oil (Vettriano)\" is part of a 2005 series of works in which Banksy put a satirical spin on famous paintings \u2014 withering Vincent van Gogh's \"Sunflowers\" and smashing the diner window in Edward Hopper's \"Nighthawks.\" The artist said his aim was to show that \"the real damage done to our environment is not done by graffiti writers and drunken teenagers, but by big business.\"",
      "The work going under the hammer is based on \"The Singing Butler,\" a painting by Scottish artist Jack Vettriano showing a couple in evening dress dancing on a beach as servants proffer sheltering umbrellas. Banksy has added a sinking oil liner and two figures lugging a barrel of toxic waste.",
      "\"We loved this painting since the moment we saw it,\" said Hoppus, who bought the artwork with his wife Skye in 2011. He said the painting \u2013 \"unmistakably Banksy, but different\" \u2013 has hung in the family's homes in London and LA ever since.",
      "Hoppus said he would use the proceeds of the sale to buy work by upcoming artists. Some will go to the California Fire Foundation, Children's Hospital Los Angeles and Cedars Sinai Hematology Oncology Research,",
      "Banksy, who has never confirmed his full identity, began his career spray-painting buildings in Bristol, England, and has become one of the world's best-known artists. His mischievous and often satirical images include two male police officers kissing, armed riot police with yellow smiley faces and a chimpanzee with a sign bearing the words, \"Laugh now, but one day I'll be in charge.\"",
      "Several of his works have sold for multiple millions at auction. The record is almost 18.6 million pounds ($25.4 million at the time) paid at Sotheby's in October 2021 for \"Love is in the Bin\" \u2013 an image of a girl with a balloon that partially self-destructed during an auction three years earlier thanks to a shredder hidden in the frame.",

      "Nine ships sunk by German torpedoes during World War I have been found off the coast of Morocco, experts announced Monday, marking the latest in a string of shipwrecks from the war to be found in recent months.",
      "The nine wrecks \u2014 which include Japanese, Norwegian, French, British, Portuguese and Italian vessels \u2014 are all located along the coast of southern Morocco, according to the Assalam Association for the Protection of Maritime Heritage, a nonprofit focused on preserving underwater archaeological sites in the region.",
      "The association did not say whether it was able to identify the ships but it\u00a0posted a video on social media of a news broadcast showing historic photos of various ships and divers exploring artifacts on the ocean floor.",
      "\"German submarines targeted commercial and military ships of allied countries, resulting in the loss of many ships off the southern provinces,\" the association said.",

    "summary": "Senior officials from the U.S. and Russia meet in Saudi Arabia on improving ties and ending the war in Ukraine - but Ukraine isn't invited.",
    "story": [
      "Riyadh, Saudi Arabia \u2014 Senior officials from Russia and the U.S. met in Saudi Arabia Tuesday to begin talks on improving ties and negotiating an end to the war in Ukraine. As CBS News correspondent Holly Williams reports, some felt the Trump administration had granted Vladimir Putin some degree of victory just by agreeing to hold the high-level meeting with his regime as the war he ignited with his full-scale invasion of Ukraine on Feb. 24, 2022, grinds on.",
      "That sentiment may be felt most acutely by the leaders of Ukraine, who were not invited to participate in the initial discussion about the fate of their nation.",
      "Delegations led by U.S. Secretary of State Marco Rubio and Russian Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov met behind closed doors at the Diriyah Palace in Riyadh. The meeting marked another significant step in President Trump's move to reverse three years of U.S. policy focused on isolating Russia over its war on Ukraine, and it is meant to pave the way for a likely meeting between Mr. Trump and Putin.",
      "Speaking to reporters after the meeting, U.S. State Department spokesperson Tammy Bruce said the U.S. and Russian delegations had agreed to establish a \"consultation mechanism to address irritants to our bilateral relationship,\" and Rubio told reporters that would include a re-staffing of the two nations' respective embassies.",
      "Bruce said Rubio and Lavrov had agreed to appoint \"high-level teams to begin working on a path to ending the conflict in Ukraine as soon as possible in a way that is enduring, sustainable, and acceptable to all sides.\" Rubio said the respective embassies in Washington and Moscow would need to be re-staffed, as \"we're going to need to have vibrant diplomatic missions that are able to function normally in order to be able to continue these conduits.\"",
      "Neither Bruce's statement nor a full read-out on the meeting provided by the State Department said anything about involving Ukraine or its European neighbors in the negotiations. The State Department said only that Mr. Trump was, \"the only leader in the world who can get Ukraine and Russia to agree to\" a ceasefire.",
      "Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy said Monday that his country wouldn't accept the outcome of any negotiations conducted without Kyiv's involvement.",
      "Speaking to reporters after the meeting, Waltz suggested Ukraine's government would have a say, calling it \"common sense\" that \"if you're going to bring both sides together, you have to talk to both sides.\"",
      "\"We are absolutely talking to both sides,\" Waltz said, noting Mr. Trump's recent phone call with Zelenskyy, right after he spoke with Putin last week. He also noted Rubio's recent meetings with European officials and the fact that British Prime Minister Keir Starmer is due in Washington next week, saying, \"the facts will continue to push back on this notion that our allies haven't been consulted... they are being consulted, literally, almost on a daily basis, and we'll continue to do so.\"",
      "Rubio told the reporters the European Union was \"going to have to be at the table at some point, because they have sanctions [against Russia] as well.\"",
      "Mr. Trump earlier this month upended U.S. policy toward Ukraine and Russia by saying he and Putin had agreed in a phone call to begin negotiations on ending the war, leaving many Ukrainians feeling betrayed as they seemingly had no say in the matter.",
      "Rubio was accompanied Tuesday by U.S. national security adviser Mike Waltz and Special Envoy Steve Witkoff, while Lavrov sat next to the Kremlin's foreign affairs adviser, Yuri Ushakov.",
      "The talks marked a significant expansion of U.S.-Russian contacts nearly three years into a war that has seen relations fall to the lowest level in decades.",
      "\"The economic aspect of the discussions\"",
      "Bruce said Rubio and Lavrov had also agreed Tuesday to ongoing cooperation toward economic and investment opportunities \"which will emerge from a successful end to the conflict in Ukraine.\"",
      "In a possible indication of how significant a factor those \"opportunities\" could be in the negotiations, senior Russian businessman Kirill Dmitriev, a Western-educated banker who now heads a government-created investment fund, was also expected to take part in the talks on Tuesday, according to Russian media.",
      "\"I will be responsible for the economic aspect of the discussions,\" Dmitriev was quoted as saying by the Interfax news agency ahead of the talks in Riyadh. \"The figure that we are voicing for the first time now is that American business has lost more than $300 billion by leaving the Russian market,\" he said, apparently referring to the impact of sanctions imposed on Russia under former President Biden.",
      "\"Finding joint economic paths, positive solutions to issues, is extremely important, mainly for the U.S. and for many other countries that are beginning to understand that the Russian market is extremely attractive and that it is necessary to be present in it,\" he said, adding that he hoped for \"a positive dialogue.\"",
      "\"We see that President Trump is very actively solving a large number of problems in the world and we hope that the Russian Federation's position will be heard very clearly and the dialogue will continue,\" Dmitriev said, according to Interfax.",
      "Dmitriev, who studied at Stanford and Harvard before working early in his career at Goldman Sachs, previously served as an interlocutor between Moscow and Washington during Mr. Trump's first term in office.",
      "Ukrainians, Europeans sidelined from talks",
      "The recent U.S. diplomatic blitz on the war has sent Kyiv and key allies scrambling to ensure a seat at the table amid concerns that Washington and Moscow could press ahead with a deal that won't be favorable to them.",
      "France called an emergency meeting of European Union countries and the U.K. on Monday to decide how to respond. French President Emmanuel Macron on Tuesday said he spoke by phone to Mr. Trump and Zelenskyy following the meeting.",
      "\"We seek a strong and lasting peace in Ukraine,\" Macron wrote on X. \"To achieve this, Russia must end its aggression, and this must be accompanied by strong and credible security guarantees for the Ukrainians,\" he said as he vowed to \"work on this together with all Europeans, Americans, and Ukrainians.\"",
      "Before that meeting, Starmer said for the first time Monday that the U.K. could deploy troops to Ukraine to help secure an eventual peace. Sweden also indicated a willingness Monday to deploy forces to Ukraine to keep an eventual peace.",
      "While other European powers declined to make explicit commitments, calling discussions about deploying peacekeepers to Ukraine premature, Poland's Prime Minister Donald Tusk ruled out sending Polish troops to the neighboring nation.",
      "Ahead of the meeting in France, Tusk did stress that European powers should immediately spend more on defense.",
      "\"If we, Europeans, fail to spend big on defense now, we will be forced to spend 10 times more if we don't prevent a wider war,\" Tusk said on social media.",
      "A boost for \"the status of Saudi Arabia\"?",
      "Ahead of the Riyadh talks, Kirill Dmitriev, the head of the Russian Direct Investment Fund who the Kremlin said might join the meeting, underscored their importance in comments to The Associated Press.",
      "\"Good U.S.-Russia relations are very important for the whole world. Only jointly can Russia and the U.S. address lots of world problems, resolve for global conflicts and offer solutions,\" Dmitriev, who said he and his team would focus on economic issues at the talks, told the AP.",
      "The Saudi-owned satellite channel Al Arabiya, citing the Russian delegation, described Moscow's priority as \"real normalization with Washington.\"",
      "Diriyah Palace sits across the street from Riyadh's Diplomatic Quarter. It's also just next to the Ritz Carlton hotel, which became famous in 2017 after de facto leader Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman detained other princes and the country's elite there as part of what the royal court called a crackdown on corruption that also sidelined any potential challenge to his taking control of the kingdom.",
      "Hosting the talks is a major step toward a goal Prince Mohammed has pursued throughout the war \u2014 putting the kingdom in the middle of diplomatic negotiations. The Saudis helped in prisoner negotiations and hosted Zelenskyy for an Arab League summit in the kingdom in 2023. Zelenskyy likely will travel to Saudi Arabia later this week.",
      "For Prince Mohammed, once described as a \"pariah\" by former President Joe Biden over the 2018 killing of Washington Post journalist Jamal Khashoggi, hosting such talks burnish the otherwise-tarnished image the West has of him.",
      "Ahead of the summit, the Saudi daily newspaper Okaz described the moment as the \"world's eye on Riyadh.\"",
      "Writing in the London-based but Saudi-owned newspaper Asharq Al Awsat, journalist Mishari al-Dhaidi described the summit as \"a major step on the international political chess arena, revealing the status of Saudi Arabia and its positive influence for the benefit of all the people.\"",
      "The prince also has maintained close relations to Russia throughout its war on Ukraine, both through the OPEC+ oil cartel and diplomatically.",
      "Hosting the summit also balances the harsh criticism recently levied by the kingdom's tightly controlled media at Mr. Trump over his repeated comments that he wants the U.S. to \"own\" the Gaza Strip, which has been devastated by the Israeli military offensive there since the Oct. 7, 2023, Hamas attack. The Palestinians want Gaza and the West Bank for a future state, something backed by the wider Arab world and nearly all of the international community.",

    "story": [
      "Over the Scarborough Shoal, South China Sea\u00a0\u2014 A Chinese navy helicopter flew within 10 feet of a Philippine patrol plane Tuesday in a disputed area of the South China Sea, prompting the Filipino pilot to warn by radio: \"You are flying too close, you are very dangerous.\"",
      "The Chinese helicopter was attempting to force a Cessna Caravan turboprop plane belonging to the Philippine Bureau of Fisheries and Aquatic Resources out of what China claims is its airspace over the hotly disputed Scarborough Shoal off the northwestern Philippines.",
      "An Associated Press journalist and other invited foreign media on the plane witnessed the tense 30-minute standoff as the Philippine plane pressed on with its low-altitude patrol around Scarborough with the Chinese navy helicopter hovering close above it or flying to its left in cloudy weather.",
      "\"You are flying too close, you are very dangerous and endangering the lives of our crew and passengers,\" the Philippine pilot told the Chinese navy helicopter by radio at one point. \"Keep away and distance your aircraft from us, you are violating the safety standard set by FAA and ICAO.\"",
      "The pilot was referring to the standard distance between aircraft required by the U.S. Federal Aviation Administration and the International Civil Aviation Organization to prevent air disasters.",
      "There was no sign that the Philippine plane had to alter its planned path and altitude to avoid a collision.",
      "The Philippine Coast Guard and the Bureau of Fisheries said in a statement that they remain \"committed to asserting our sovereignty, sovereign rights and maritime jurisdiction in the West Philippine Sea, despite the aggressive and escalatory actions of China.\"",

      "The Philippines \"confused right and wrong and spread false narratives,\" the statement said.",
      "Why the Philippines-China standoff matters to the U.S.",
      "Tuesday's encounter, which is expected to be protested by the Philippine government, is the latest flashpoint in a decades-long territorial standoff in one of the world's busiest trade routes, which involves China, the Philippines, Vietnam, Malaysia, Brunei and Taiwan .",
      "Confrontations on the high seas have spiked between Chinese and Philippine coast guards in the last two years at Scarborough and Second Thomas Shoal, where a grounded Philippine navy ship has served as a military territorial outpost since 1999 but has since been closely surrounded by Chinese coast guard, navy and other ships.",
      "While most analysts believe the most likely origin of any potential military conflict between the United States and China would be an attempt by China to invade Taiwan, the escalating tension between Beijing and the Philippines is also a possible contact point, as the U.S. has a mutual defense treaty with the Philippines, which could mean American intervention.",
      "China claims virtually all of the South China Sea as its territory. It is one of the world's most vital waterways, with more than $3 trillion in goods passing through its waters per year. As CBS News Cecelia Vega reported for 60 Minutes last year, to assert its claim over the sea, China has used tactics just short of war, sometimes leading to violent confrontations, in what has been called \"the most dangerous conflict no one is talking about.\"",
      "In December, the Philippines announced plans to acquire the Typhon missile system from the U.S. as part of a push to secure its maritime interests, drawing warnings from China of a regional \"arms race.\"",
      "The U.S. has said it's obligated to defend the Philippines \u2014 its oldest treaty ally in Asia \u2014 if Filipino forces, ships or aircraft come under armed attack, including in the South China Sea. China has warned the U.S. and its allies not to meddle in what it calls a purely Asian dispute.",
      "The history of the Philippines-China dispute",
      "China deployed its naval force around Scarborough after a tense standoff with Philippine ships in 2012.",
      "The following year, the Philippines brought its disputes with China to international arbitration. A 2016 decision by a United Nations-backed arbitration panel invalidated China's expansive claim in the South China Sea based on the U.N. Convention on the Law of the Sea.",
      "China, a signatory to the UNCLOS like the Philippines, refused to participate in the arbitration, rejected its outcome and continues to defy it.",
      "Faced by China's military might, the Philippines under President Ferdinand Marcos Jr. has resorted to a shame campaign \u2014 embedding Philippine and foreign journalists in its sea and air patrols in a bid to expose Beijing's increasingly assertive actions.",

      "European leaders gathered Monday in Paris for a hastily organized meeting to discuss how to react to recent diplomatic moves by the Trump administration pertaining to Ukraine. The leaders of Poland, Germany, the United Kingdom, Denmark, the Netherlands, Spain and the EU were among those attending.",
      "The talks were organized after U.S. Secretary of Defense Pete Hegseth announced the U.S. would be shifting its security priorities away from Europe, and President Trump said the U.S. would engage in unilateral talks with Russia aimed at ending the war in Ukraine.",
      "Ahead of the meeting, Britain's Prime Minister Keir Starmer said for the first time that the U.K. could deploy troops to Ukraine to help secure an eventual peace. He said he'd stress to other European leaders that, \"we have got to show we are truly serious about our own defense and bearing our own burden.\"",
      "\"We are facing a once-in-a-generation moment for the collective security of our continent,\" Starmer said in a weekend editorial in Britain's Telegraph newspaper. \"This is not only a question about the future of Ukraine \u2014 it is existential for Europe as a whole.\"",
      "He said the U.K. was prepared to \"play a leading role in accelerating work on security guarantees for Ukraine,\" including more military support and putting British troops on the ground as part of a peacekeeping force if necessary.",
      "\"I do not say that lightly. I feel very deeply the responsibility that comes with potentially putting British servicemen and women in harm's way. But any role in helping to guarantee Ukraine's security is helping to guarantee the security of our continent, and the security of this country,\" Starmer said, adding that \"U.S. support will remain critical and a U.S. security guarantee is essential for a lasting peace.\"",
      "\"The end of this war, when it comes, cannot merely become a temporary pause before Putin attacks again,\" Starmer said.",
      "On Monday, a British official confirmed to CBS News that the prime minister would visit Washington at the end of next week, where he will become the first European leader to meet in-person with the president since Mr. Trump moved back into the White House.",
      "Sweden also indicated a willingness Monday to deploy forces to Ukraine to keep an eventual peace, with the country's Foreign Minister Maria Malmer Stenergard stressing in a radio interview the need to first \"negotiate a fair and sustainable peace that respects international law, that respects Ukraine and that ensures above all else that Russia can't just withdraw and regroup and attack Ukraine or another country within a few years.\"",
      "\"When we have such a peace in place, it will need to be maintained, and for that our government is not ruling out anything,\" Stenergard said, according to the French news agency AFP.",

    "summary": "Italian archaeologists have uncovered a complex, ancient necropolis that may shed new light on the elite members of an ancient Alpine society.",
    "story": [
      "Italian archaeologists recently uncovered a \"monumental necropolis\" that appeared to honor an elite class of people thousands of years ago, provincial officials announced this month.",
      "The ancient cemetery found in Trento, a northern Alpine city, includes at least 200 individual tombs, which experts believe date back to the early Iron Age, a pre-Roman period between the 9th and 6th centuries B.C.E., shedding new light on the history of the region. Excavators discovered the necropolis while carrying out restoration and development work on a historic building in the area, a project spearheaded by Trento's archaeological heritage office, said the city's provincial council in a news release unveiling what officials called an \"exceptional\" find.",
      "Prehistoric flooding from nearby rivers likely helped preserve the sprawling grave site, effectively sealing the sediment and allowing the burial ground to stay remarkably intact over the course of millennia, the council said. Archaeologists unearthed graves filled with \"grave goods,\" objects that in some cultures were traditionally buried with the dead as a sort of sacrificial gesture, as well as cremated human remains, about 8 meters, or around 24 feet, underground.",
      "Francesca Gerosa, the vice president and provincial councilor of culture in Trento, said the necropolis \"shows us a new history of the city\" in a statement translated from Italian. Gerosa noted the discovery offers a deeper look into Trento's past, as more than \"just a Roman city.\"",
      "\"We know how important the commitment to research and protection of the heritage of our roots is ... and here we are working intensely to bring to light a piece of history unknown to the city,\" she said.",
      "The complexity of the necropolis particularly intrigued archaeologists and researchers studying the burial ground. Tall limestone pillars were arranged vertically to mark individual graves, like headstones, each of which corresponded to a lithic box that served as the actual tomb. Archaeologists identified one \"main\" tomb, covered by a mound structure, along with the numerous others that concentrated the surrounding area over time.",
      "Earth and calcined bones were found inside the boxes, although not always in the ossuary vases that Roman civilizations were known to typically use for cremated remains. In some tombs, archaeologists also uncovered fibers that likely came from fabric originally wrapped around the ashes of the dead.",
      "Officials said the \"grave goods\" included decorative objects, weapons constructed from metal and other items made from amber and glass, which indicate the people who built the Trento necropolis were culturally influenced by, or otherwise connected to, other Italic groups of the time. Franco Marzatico, who led the excavation, suggested the still-unknown settlers may have contributed to the rise of the Etruscan civilization that thrived in the Alps later on.",
      "\"We have the possibility of recognizing the elite of a society that was evidently settled in the Trento basin,\" \u00a0Marzatico said in a statement, adding that the burial rituals represent power, privilege and status.",

      "\"Well, for me, it\u2019s always principles first. It\u2019s not personal,\" Pence said in an interview with The Associated Press.",
      "Despite publicly falling out with Trump in the wake of the Jan. 6, 2021, riot at the U.S. Capitol, Pence said he would support the new Trump administration on issues he agreed with, but would challenge others.",

      "The former vice president said he and those who work for him received \"a lot of quiet encouragement\" in opposing Kennedy. Pence described finding it necessary to speak out on finding the \"nomination of an abortion rights supporter to be secretary of HHS to be a dramatic departure from 50 years of strong pro-life leadership at HHS under Republican administrations.\"",
      "Asked why Republicans might be reluctant to oppose Trump publicly, Pence said, \"I never speculate on motives. You know, I\u2019m not new to town. I\u2019ve waged lonely battles before.\"",
      "\"But you know, you have to be willing to step out and lead,\" the former vice president said. \"My hope is that when the next issue of life comes up, that people will have been encouraged, emboldened to know that they\u2019re not alone.\"",
      "Regarding RFK Jr.'s nomination, Advancing American Freedom President Tim Chapman told Fox News Digital that the group believed \"it would be an abdication of duty and responsibility if nobody said anything about the life issue in particular, let alone some of the other concerns.\"",
      "\"I think it's more likely now that he's better on life than if we had not engaged in the issue at all,\" Chapman said. \"Part of being constructive is weighing in and sending a market signal when the administration or Republican leadership might try to go in a direction that's not tethered to conservative principles. And so you're not always going to win all those fights. And in fact, we don't even view it as our job to win all those fights. We view it as our job to start the conversation.\"",
      "In the second Trump term, Chapman argued, \"there is a far stronger echo chamber on the outside that is currently encouraging and sometimes, you know, doing more than encouraging Republicans and outside groups to stay in line with the administration.\" He said it's \"creating an atmosphere where some people who may disagree with a nominee or with a policy decision are choosing to bide their time and not make that disagreement public.\"",
      "\"Time will tell whether that environment remains permanent and time will also tell whether that echo chamber serves the president well or ends up not serving him well. For various reasons, we don't feel the pressure from that echo chamber to stay silent if we disagree,\" Chapman told Fox News Digital. \"We'll do our best to constructively, you know, make our points. And when we disagree, try to pull the administration towards our view on policy. But then, you know, when we agree, be totally there running beside them and trying to help them push their priorities over the finish line.\"",
      "Advancing American Freedom is now lobbying against Lori Chavez-DeRemer, Trump's pick for labor secretary, accusing her of being pro-union. While Pence's group plans to spend the coming months pushing to increase military spending, shrink the deficit, and make permanent the Trump 2017 tax cuts, as well as trying to convince Trump to stop implementing tariffs on allies, the former vice president and those who work for him insist they won't take on the \"Never Trump\" mantle.",
      "Pence has been delivering speeches urging Trump to stand with long-standing foreign allies and lobbying members of Congress, while his aides write letters and opinion columns. Advancing American Freedom says they intend to praise the administration when they agree with it, while raising concerns when they don't, advocating for longtime conservative principles that they believe have taken a back seat to Trump's \"Make America Great Again\" brand of populism.",
      "\"We\u2019re calling balls and strikes here,\" Pence told the AP. \"I think that the way we want to approach this is with integrity to principle. And I\u2019m very encouraged. I think the Trump administration is off to a great start... I\u2019m very pleased about the president undoing Biden\u2019s border policies and putting back into place the policies that we had negotiated and established that secured the border.\"",
      "Pence said he believes \"some of the prominent voices in the party have embraced a more populist thinking\" but that \"the overwhelming majority of people that ever vote Republican think any differently than they thought during our administration when we hewed to a conservative agenda or the years before or since.\" To support his opinion, the former vice president recalled an interaction he had with a farmer at a campaign stop in Iowa in the wake of the Oct. 7, 2023, attacks in Israel.",
      "President-elect Donald Trump greets former Vice President Mike Pence at the state funeral for former President Jimmy Carter at Washington National Cathedral on Jan. 9, 2025. (Chip Somodevilla/Getty Images)",
      "Despite the farmer saying he agreed with \"absolutely everything\" that Pence stumped about regarding \"strong American support for Israel, strong American leadership in the world, continued support for Ukraine in their fight and limited government and bringing about reforms to put our fiscal house in order and right to life,\" the former vice president recalled how the farmer said he could not vote for him in 2024 and that \"I got to be for Trump this time.\"",
      "\"And he goes, \u2018But I\u2019ll see you in four years. You\u2019re going to be a great president someday,'\" said Pence, who briefly pursued the 2024 GOP presidential nomination. \"I said, \u2018Would you mind telling me, you know, why?\u2019 And he said words I never forgot, which was in effect: He lamented Biden\u2019s failed record. And I saw that he was drawn to the need for a rematch. And then he said, \u2018Plus, if they can do that to a former president, they can do that to me.\u2019 And the \u2018lawfare\u2019 stuff went into higher relief.\"",
      "MIKE PENCE, OTHER FORMER TOP TRUMP OFFICIALS FEATURED IN HARRIS CAMPAIGN AD SLAMMING TRUMP AS 'DANGEROUS'",
      "\"So I didn\u2019t see in this last election a Republican Party that was embracing big government or a vision to pull back from America\u2019s commitments on the world stage or marginalizing the right to life,\" Pence told the AP. \"I didn\u2019t see that traveling all over the country and I still don\u2019t see it. I think there were other factors that gave the former president a decided advantage in the election. He\u2019d earned it. He\u2019d won it. And then he won it in the fall. But I don\u2019t think the party\u2019s changed.\"In his interview with Fox News Digital, Chapman agreed. \"I think he's seen firsthand, and all of us have who've traveled the country, when you look at Republican voters and what they believe just on the issues, there's not a lot of change going on in the party,\" Chapman said. \"The average Republican voter still feels very strongly about limited government, feels very strongly about traditional values and about pushing back against the left's, you know, progressive attack on traditional values and feels very strong about a strong national defense. Like these are baseline concepts for conservative voters that have not changed in any way, shape or form.\"\u00a0\"Many of the reasons that they wanted Trump back were because of how successful the first Trump administration was on those issues,\" he continued. \"The policy set has not changed\u2026 there was a reaction to the left's out of control lawfare and out of control cancel culture and that Trump was seen as the object of that. And so there was a very, very natural and very frankly, commendable instinct from the American people and Republican voters to say, you know what? We're going to stick it to him. We're not taking this anymore.",
      "Pence told the AP that he went to Trump's inauguration last month and \"was very moved in the outpouring of kind words and expressions of appreciation from former colleagues, including many members of the new administration who I encountered in hallways.\" When he saw Trump's new secretary of state, Marco Rubio, Pence said he gave him a hug and \"told him how proud I was of him.\"",
      "\"We had praised him from here when he was selected,\" Pence told the AP. \"I must have seen or interacted with about half the incoming Cabinet.\"",
      "At the funeral of former President Jimmy Carter, Pence said he had a \"very cordial exchange\" with Trump. When Trump was coming down the front row of the National Cathedral in Washington, D.C., Pence recalled him saying, \"Hi, Mike.\" Pence said he extended his hand to Trump and said, \"Congratulations, Mr. President,\" and \"I could see his countenance softened. And he said, \u2018Thanks.\u2019\" Pence said he also congratulated first lady Melania Trump.",

      "\"You know, the people that know me know it\u2019s not personal,\" Pence told the AP. \"I\u2019ve long since forgiven the president for any differences that we had at the end of our administration. We still have those differences as the president still holds the view that, to my knowledge, that I had some authority that I did not have under the Constitution or laws of the country. But from my heart, I've prayed often for the president.\"",
      "The AP also asked Pence about the viral moment at the funeral in which his wife, former second lady Karen Pence, refused to acknowledge President-elect Trump or shake Melania Trump\u2019s hand.",
      "\"My wife loves her husband. And I love my wife and I have great respect for her. And so \u2013 but I\u2019ve been really moved at how many people around the country have thanked us both for that day,\" Pence said. \"But again, you know, I want to emphasize, we\u2019re eyes forward here. You know, I\u2019d always thought the president was going to come around on the position he took on Jan. 6.\"",
      "In his book, Pence said, he describes how he and Trump \"actually parted on very amicable terms, very good terms,\" but in the spring, when Trump \"returned to the rhetoric about how I could have done something that neither the Constitution nor the law would ever permit any vice president to do, then I just decided it was important to go our separate ways.\"",
      "CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP",
      "\"But hope springs eternal,\" Pence said. \"And we want to be a constructive force for the conservative agenda. I think that\u2019s good for the administration. It\u2019s good for the Congress. More importantly, it\u2019s good for America.\"",
      "Chapman reiterated to Fox News Digital that Pence's work during Trump's second term was not personal in nature, pointing to Pence back when he served in Congress \"was often a lone voice, you know, agitating against Republican leadership for a course correction to a more conservative vision for governing.\"",
      "\"What you're seeing him do now is almost a return to form,\" Chapman said. \"So I definitely think there's nothing personal there.\"",

      "Tech support scams have been around for years, but a new variant called the Phantom Hacker scam is rapidly gaining traction. It has cost victims, primarily older Americans, over $500 million since 2023. This scam is particularly deceptive because it unfolds in three carefully orchestrated phases and uses AI-powered social engineering tactics to avoid detection. Attackers leverage caller ID spoofing and AI-generated voices to make their scheme more persuasive, but there are ways to protect yourself.",

      "How the phantom hacker scam works",
      "As\u00a0highlighted by the FBI, the scam begins with the tech support impostor phase. You might receive a call, email, text or even a pop-up on your computer warning you that your device has been compromised. The message urges you to call a customer support number for assistance. Once you do, a scammer posing as\u00a0tech support claims that hackers have targeted your accounts. To \"help,\" they instruct you to download remote access software, allowing them to take control of your computer. Under the guise of scanning for threats, they trick you into revealing your financial accounts, setting up the next phase of the scam.",
      "Next comes the financial institution impostor phase. Another scammer, pretending to be from your bank or investment firm, calls to warn that a foreign hacker has infiltrated your accounts. They advise moving your money to a \"safe\" government-protected account, often using wire transfers, cryptocurrency or cash deposits. They might also insist on keeping the transaction confidential, claiming it\u2019s necessary for security reasons.",
      "In the final U.S. government impostor phase, a third scammer impersonates a federal official \u2013 often from the Federal Reserve \u2013 who pressures you to act quickly. If you start doubting the scheme, they may send you an official-looking email or document to convince you that the transfer is legitimate. By the time victims realize they\u2019ve been tricked, their money is gone, often sent overseas beyond the reach of U.S. authorities.",

      "SPOTIFY PLAYLISTS ARE BEING HIJACKED TO PROMOTE PIRATED SOFTWARE AND SCAMS",
      "How AI is making things worse",
      "AI is making scams like the Phantom Hacker scam more deceptive and harder to spot. Scammers are using AI-powered chatbots to automate their schemes. Instead of relying on human operators, they can now deploy AI-driven responses that sound natural and convincing.",
      "AI-generated\u00a0deepfake voices are also being used to impersonate bank officials and government representatives. With just a short audio sample, scammers can clone a voice to make their calls seem even more authentic. This means a victim might hear what sounds like their bank manager or an official from the Federal Reserve.",
      "Email scams are also becoming more sophisticated. AI tools can craft messages that mimic the tone and style of official communications. Scammers can even generate fake but realistic-looking documents with official letterheads to convince victims that the scam is legitimate.",

      "9 WAYS SCAMMERS CAN USE YOUR PHONE NUMBER TO TRY TO TRICK YOU",
      "7 ways to protect yourself",
      "The best way to defend yourself against the Phantom Hacker scam is to stay informed, be cautious and follow these steps:",
      "1) Ignore unsolicited messages: Scammers often send pop-ups, text messages or emails claiming that your computer is infected or that your bank account is at risk. These messages may look official, but they are designed to create panic and pressure you into taking immediate action. Never click on links or attachments from unknown senders, as they may contain malware or lead to phishing websites that steal your personal information.",
      "2)\u00a0Have strong antivirus software:\u00a0The best way to safeguard yourself from malicious links that install malware, potentially accessing your private information, is to have antivirus software installed on all your devices. This protection can also alert you to phishing emails and ransomware scams, keeping your personal information and digital assets safe.\u00a0Get my picks for the best 2025 antivirus protection winners for your Windows, Mac, Android and iOS devices.",
      "3) Verify phone numbers before calling: If you receive an unexpected message urging you to call tech support, do not use the number provided in the message. Instead, visit the official website of the company in question and find their customer support contact information. Scammers often create fake websites or use\u00a0caller ID spoofing to make their phone numbers appear legitimate, so always double-check before making a call.",
      "4) Avoid downloading unknown software: No reputable company will ever ask you to install remote access tools unless you have specifically reached out for tech support. Scammers use these programs to take control of your computer, monitor your activity and access sensitive information. If someone unexpectedly asks you to download software to \"fix a problem\" or \"protect your account,\" it is likely a scam.",
      "5) Never give control of your device to a stranger: If you allow a scammer to remotely access your computer, they can view your personal files, log your keystrokes and manipulate your accounts without your knowledge. Legitimate customer support representatives will never request remote access unless you have initiated the support request through an official company channel. If someone insists on taking control of your device, hang up immediately.",
      "6) Be skeptical of urgent financial warnings: The U.S. government will never contact you unexpectedly and demand that you move your money to a \"safe account.\" They will also never ask you to wire funds, purchase gift cards or send cryptocurrency as a form of payment. Scammers create a false sense of urgency to trick victims into acting before they can think critically about the situation. If someone claims to be from a bank or government agency and pressures you to move money, stop and verify their identity through official channels.",
      "7) Invest in personal data removal services: Scammers often gather information from data broker websites to make their scams more convincing. Your name, phone number, home address and even financial history may be publicly available without your knowledge. Consider using a data removal service to regularly scan and request the removal of your personal information from these databases. This reduces the chances of scammers targeting you with highly personalized attacks. You can also manually opt out of major data broker sites, but using a service automates the process and keeps your information protected over time.\u00a0Check out my top picks for data removal services here.",

      "The rise of cyberattacks on Apple devices",
      "Mac malware is not what it used to be. For years, the biggest threats were annoying adware and browser hijackers, more of a nuisance than a real danger. But that is changing fast. As highlighted by\u00a0Malwarebytes, a new wave of information stealers is taking over, and they are far more dangerous, going after passwords, authentication cookies, credit card details and even cryptocurrency.",
      "This shift started in mid-2023 with the arrival of\u00a0Atomic Stealer, also known as AMOS, a piece of malware that looked much more like something you would see on Windows than the typical Mac threats. AMOS was not just effective. It was easy to use and sold as a service \u00a0for $1,000 a month with a slick web-based control panel. That success led to the rise of even more dangerous variants.",
      "WHAT IS ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE (AI)?",
      "One of them,\u00a0Poseidon, launched in mid-2024 and quickly became the dominant Mac stealer, responsible for 70% of infections. It can drain over 160 different cryptocurrency wallets, steal passwords from browsers and password managers and even grab VPN credentials.",
      "At the same time, cybercriminals have doubled down on\u00a0malvertising, using fake ads on Google and Bing to trick users into downloading malware instead of real software. These campaigns are highly targeted, allowing attackers to pinpoint Mac users and serve fake downloads based on their searches. With AI now being used to create and execute many of these attacks, they are likely to increase in scale.",

      "While Mac malware is evolving, the situation on Android is even more alarming. Phishing attacks on the platform have reached staggering levels, with thousands of malicious apps designed to steal credentials and bypass security measures.",
      "So far in 2024, researchers have detected 22,800 phishing-capable apps, alongside 3,900 apps designed to read OTPs from notification bars and 5,200 apps capable of extracting OTPs from SMS messages. These numbers highlight how widespread and effective Android phishing malware has become.",
      "Just like phishing emails, phishing apps trick users into handing over their usernames, passwords and two-factor authentication codes. Once stolen, these credentials can be sold or used for fraud,\u00a0identity theft or further\u00a0cyberattacks. Because phishing apps require minimal code and fewer permissions than traditional malware, they are much easier to sneak onto app stores, including Google Play.",
      "Many phishing apps look like regular, fully functional software. Some impersonate games or utilities, while others appear as cracked versions of popular apps like TikTok, WhatsApp or Spotify. Some stay dormant for days to avoid detection before launching their attacks. Others rely on ad functionality to redirect users to phishing sites, making the malicious code harder to trace.",

Have strong antivirus software:\u00a0The best way to safeguard yourself from malicious links that install malware, potentially accessing your private information, is to have strong antivirus software installed on all your devices. This protection can also alert you to phishing emails and ransomware scams, keeping your personal information and digital assets safe.\u00a0Get my picks for the best 2025 antivirus protection winners for your Windows, Mac, Android and iOS devices.",
      "2. Be cautious with downloads and links: Only download software from reputable sources such as the Mac App Store, Google Play Store or official websites of trusted developers. Be wary of unsolicited emails or messages prompting you to download or install updates, especially if they contain links.\u00a0Phishing attempts often disguise themselves as legitimate update notifications or urgent messages.",
      "3. Keep your software updated: Ensure that both macOS, Android and all installed applications are up to date. Apple and Android frequently release security patches and updates that address vulnerabilities. Enable automatic updates for macOS, Android and your apps to stay protected without having to manually check for updates. If you need more help, see my\u00a0guide on keeping all your devices updated.",
      "4. Use strong and unique passwords:\u00a0To protect your Mac from malware, it\u2019s also crucial to use strong, unique passwords for all your accounts and devices. Avoid reusing passwords across different sites or services. A\u00a0password manager can be incredibly helpful here. It generates and stores complex passwords for you, making them difficult for hackers to crack.",
      "It also keeps track of all your passwords in one place and automatically fills them in when you log into accounts, so you don\u2019t have to remember them yourself. By reducing the number of passwords you need to recall, you\u2019re less likely to reuse them, which lowers the risk of security breaches. Get more details about my\u00a0best expert-reviewed Password Managers of 2025 here.",
      "5. Use two-factor authentication (2FA): Enable\u00a02FA for your important accounts, including your Apple ID, Google account, email and any financial services. This adds an extra step to the login process, making it harder for attackers to gain access even if they have your password.",
      "HOW TO REMOVE YOUR PRIVATE DATA FROM THE INTERNET",
      "Kurt\u2019s key takeaways",
      "The days when Mac users could assume they were safe are long gone. Cybercriminals are evolving their tactics, with Mac malware shifting from simple adware to advanced information stealers. Android phishing apps are also becoming harder to detect and more widespread than ever. From stealing passwords and authentication cookies to intercepting OTPs and draining cryptocurrency wallets, these threats are growing in both sophistication and scale. No platform is immune, and as cybercriminals continue refining their techniques, users and organizations must stay ahead with strong security measures.",

      "The financial toll is staggering \u2014 scams cost Americans over $159 billion annually, with average individual losses now exceeding $3,500 per victim. This epidemic is not just a financial crisis but also a human rights issue, as many scams originate from forced labor operations in Southeast Asia.",

      "The mechanics of \"pig butchering\"",
      "One of the most pervasive scams today is the so-called \"pig butchering\" scheme. Originating in China and spreading across Southeast Asia, this scam involves criminals building trust with victims through social media or messaging apps. Once trust is established, victims are lured into fraudulent cryptocurrency investment schemes. These scams are meticulously crafted to appear legitimate, often involving fake trading platforms and simulated profits. Victims are encouraged to invest more until they are \"slaughtered,\" losing their\u00a0entire savings when the scammers vanish with their funds.",
      "9 WAYS SCAMMERS CAN USE YOUR PHONE NUMBER TO TRY TO TRICK YOU",
      "Forced labor behind these scam centers",
      "What makes these scams even more horrifying is their reliance on human trafficking. Criminal syndicates in countries like Myanmar, Cambodia and Laos force trafficked individuals to run these operations under threat of violence. These \"scam centers\" operate in lawless regions controlled by rebel groups or corrupt officials, making international intervention challenging.

      "BEST PRESIDENT\u2019S DAY DEALS",
      "Why America is a prime target",
      "Cyberscams have taken hold in the U.S. for several reasons that make it particularly vulnerable. As an American, you\u2019re likely connected to the digital world through social media platforms, messaging apps and other online tools. This high level of connectivity makes it easier for scammers to reach you directly, whether through a text message, email or social media chat. The sheer number of people online in the U.S. creates a vast pool of potential targets for cybercriminals.",
      "Additionally, the growing popularity of cryptocurrency in the U.S. has made it a\u00a0prime medium for fraud. Cryptocurrency transactions are fast, anonymous and difficult to trace, which makes them ideal for scammers looking to steal funds without leaving a trail. Many scams are designed to exploit this lack of transparency, leaving victims with little chance of recovering their money once it\u2019s gone.",
      "Another major issue is the lack of a centralized reporting system for cyberscams in the U.S. If you\u2019ve ever been scammed or know someone who has, you might have noticed how confusing it can be to figure out where to report the crime \u2014 whether to the FBI, the Federal Trade Commission (FTC) or another agency. This fragmented system not only makes it harder for victims to seek help but also prevents authorities from gathering comprehensive data to tackle the problem effectively. These factors combined have made Americans some of the most targeted individuals in the world when it comes to cyberscams.",

      "Several countries have implemented innovative measures to combat cyberscams, offering valuable lessons for the U.S. Singapore, for instance, has introduced a mandatory SMS Sender ID Registry (SSIR) that requires organizations to register their alphanumeric Sender IDs. This system effectively blocks unregistered SMS senders, significantly reducing impersonation scams. In fact, cases involving scam SMSes in Singapore fell by 70% over three months after mandating the SSIR.",
      "Britain has taken a different approach by establishing a dedicated \"159\" hotline, allowing residents to instantly verify suspicious calls. This simple yet effective system provides a quick way for individuals to check the legitimacy of unexpected communications, potentially preventing many scams before they occur.",
      "WHAT IS ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE (AI)?",
      "Many nations have also implemented stricter authentication measures, such as biometric checks and in-app verifications, which have proven highly effective in reducing fraud. For example, Singapore has required facial verification for higher-risk transactions through Singpass since 2022, resulting in no further reports of malware-enabled scams involving unauthorized CPF withdrawals since its implementation in June 2023.",
      "Some countries are exploring ways to slow down cryptocurrency transactions or cap transfer amounts, which could significantly hinder scammers who rely on quick, anonymous transfers. These measures, combined with a coordinated global response involving major victim nations like the U.S. and China, could prove instrumental in dismantling criminal networks more effectively.

      "4. Enable two-factor authentication (2FA) wherever possible:\u00a02FA adds an extra layer of security by requiring a secondary verification method, such as a code sent to your phone or biometric authentication. This ensures that even if your password is compromised, unauthorized access remains highly unlikely.",

      "Kurt 'CyberGuy' Knutsson walks you through the process.",
      "Every tech expert will tell you the App Store is safer than Google Play Store. Some might even claim it is impossible to download a malicious app from the App Store, but they are wrong.",
      "While I admit the App Store is a secure and tightly controlled ecosystem, it cannot completely shield you. Security researchers have found that hackers are targeting several apps on the App Store to spread malware that steals information from screenshots saved on a device.",
      "The issue also affects those downloading apps from the Google Play Store.",

      "A person holding an iPhone. (Kurt \"CyberGuy\" Knutsson\u00a0)",
      "How the malware works and what makes it different",
      "According to\u00a0researchers at Kaspersky, this malware campaign is more advanced than typical info stealers, both in how it works and how it spreads. Instead of relying on social engineering tricks to get users to grant permissions like most banking trojans or spyware, this malware hides inside seemingly legitimate apps and slips past Apple and Google\u2019s security checks.",
      "One of its standout features is Optical Character Recognition. Instead of stealing stored files, it scans screenshots saved on the device, extracts text and sends the information to remote servers.",
      "Once installed, the malware operates stealthily, often activating only after a period of dormancy to avoid raising suspicion. It employs encrypted communication channels to send stolen data back to its operators, making it difficult to trace. Plus, it spreads through deceptive updates or hidden code within app dependencies, an approach that helps it evade initial security screenings by app store review teams.",
      "The infection vectors vary between Apple and Google\u2019s ecosystems. On iOS, the malware is often embedded within apps that initially pass Apple\u2019s rigorous review process but later introduce harmful functionality through updates. On Android, the malware can exploit sideloading options, but even official Google Play apps have been found to carry these malicious payloads, sometimes hidden within SDKs (software development kits) supplied by third-party developers.",
      "Messaging app in the App Store designed to lure victims.",
      "THE HIDDEN COSTS OF FREE APPS: YOUR PERSONAL INFORMATION",
      "What's being stolen, and who's responsible?",
      "The scope of stolen information is alarming. This malware primarily targets crypto wallet recovery phrases but is also capable of exfiltrating login credentials, payment details, personal messages, location data and even biometric identifiers. Some versions are designed to harvest authentication tokens, allowing attackers to access accounts even if users change their passwords.",
      "The apps serving as malware carriers include ComeCome, ChatAi, WeTink, AnyGPT and more. These range from productivity tools to entertainment and utility apps. In some cases, malicious developers create these apps with full knowledge of the malware\u2019s purpose. In others, the issue appears to be a supply chain vulnerability, where legitimate developers unknowingly integrate compromised SDKs or third-party services that introduce malicious code into their applications.",
      "We reached out to Apple for a comment but did not hear back before our deadline.",
      "Messaging app in the App Store designed to lure victims. (Kaspersky)",
      "Apple's response to screenshot-scanning malware discovered in App Store",
      "Apple has removed the 11 iOS apps mentioned in Kaspersky's report from the App Store. Furthermore, they discovered that these 11 apps shared code signatures with 89 other iOS apps, all of which had been previously rejected or removed for violating Apple's policies, resulting in the termination of their developer accounts.",
      "Apps requesting access to user data such as Photos, Camera or Location must provide relevant functionality or face rejection. They must also clearly explain their data usage when prompting users for permission. iOS privacy features ensure users always control whether their location information is shared with an app. Also, starting in iOS 14, the PhotoKit API \u2014 which allows apps to request access to a user\u2019s Photos library \u2014 added additional controls to let users select only specific photos or videos to share with an app instead of providing access to their entire library.",
      "The App Store Review Guidelines mandate that developers are responsible for ensuring their entire app, including ad networks, analytics services and third-party SDKs, complies with the guidelines. Developers must carefully review and choose these components. Apps must also accurately represent their privacy practices, including those of the SDKs they use, in their privacy labels.",
      "In 2023, the App Store rejected over 1.7 million app submissions for failing to meet its stringent privacy, security and content standards. It also rejected 248,000 app submissions found to be spam, copycats or misleading and prevented 84,000 potentially fraudulent apps from reaching users.",

Use strong antivirus software:\u00a0Installing strong antivirus software can add an extra layer of protection by scanning apps for malware, blocking suspicious activity and alerting you to potential threats. The best way to safeguard yourself from malicious links that install malware, potentially accessing your private information, is to have antivirus software installed on all your devices. This protection can also alert you to phishing emails and ransomware scams, keeping your personal information and digital assets safe.\u00a0Get my picks for the best 2025 antivirus protection winners for your Windows, Mac, Android and iOS devices.",
      "2. Stick to trusted developers and well-known apps:\u00a0Even though malware has been found in official app stores, users can still minimize their risk by downloading apps from reputable developers with a long track record. Before installing an app, check its developer history, read multiple reviews and look at the permissions it requests. If an app from an unknown developer suddenly gains popularity but lacks a strong review history, approach it with caution.",
      "GET FOX BUSINESS ON THE GO BY CLICKING HERE",
      "3. Review app permissions carefully:\u00a0Many malicious apps disguise themselves as legitimate tools but request excessive permissions that go beyond their stated purpose. For example, a simple calculator app should not need access to your contacts, messages or location. If an app asks for permissions that seem unnecessary, consider it a red flag and either deny those permissions or avoid installing the app altogether. Go to your phone settings and check app permissions on your\u00a0iPhone and\u00a0Android.",
      "4. Keep your device and apps updated:\u00a0Cybercriminals exploit vulnerabilities in outdated software to distribute malware. Always\u00a0keep your operating system and apps updated to the latest versions, as these updates often contain critical security patches. Enabling automatic updates ensures that you stay protected without having to manually check for new versions.",
      "5. Be wary of apps that promise too much:\u00a0Many malware-infected apps lure users by offering features that seem too good to be true \u2014 such as free premium services, extreme battery optimizations or AI-powered functionality that appears unrealistic. If an app\u2019s claims sound exaggerated or its download numbers skyrocket overnight with questionable reviews, it\u2019s best to avoid it. Stick to apps with a transparent development team and verifiable functionalities.",
      "HOW TO REMOVE YOUR PRIVATE DATA FROM THE INTERNET",
      "Kurt\u2019s key takeaway",
      "The new malware campaign highlights the need for stricter vetting processes, continuous monitoring of app behavior post-approval and greater transparency from app stores regarding security risks. While Apple and Google have removed the malicious apps upon detection, the fact that they made it onto the platform in the first place exposes a gap in the existing security framework. As cybercriminals refine their methods, app stores must evolve just as quickly or risk losing the trust of the very users they claim to protect.",

      "\"This is a very real threat,\" he said. \"EMP is generated when a small nuclear weapon, 40 to 60 kilotons or about three times the size of a Hiroshima bomb, is detonated 200 miles out in space above the United States. It sets up an electrostatic discharge which cascades to the Earth's surface, feeds into the millions of miles of wires which become antennas, feeds this into the power grid, overloads the grid and blows it out.\"",
      "Forstchen, citing Congressional reports from 2002 and 2008, said that 80%-90% of Americans would be dead a year later if an EMP strike happened.",

      "While an EMP strike, at first glance, appears to be more science fiction than fact, Forstchen said that the potential for such an attack was recognized decades ago.",
      "\"The threat of an EMP was first realized during the 1962 Starfish Prime high-altitude nuclear test. What happened was that it blew about 500 miles away from Hawaii and 200 miles up,\" he said. \"They were able to bring the system back within a matter of days, but what would it be like if it took a month, six months, a year, or five years to fix?\"",
      "The late Peter Pry, a nuclear weapons expert, and former staff director at the Congressional EMP Commission,\u00a0agreed. Before his death in 2022, Pry warned that Kim Jung Un's launch of a high-altitude ballistic missile was a test of North Korea's EMP capabilities against the United States.",
      "\"Cars would be paralyzed,\" Pry told Fox Business in May 2017. \"Airplanes could fall out of the sky. You'd have natural gas pipeline explosions, nuclear reactor overloads. And worst of all, if you had a protracted blackout, it would be a serious threat to the survival of the American people.\"",

And I'll point out that much of the European aid is actually in the form of a loan. That is repaid. It's repaid with interest on Russian assets. So President Trump is rethinking the entire dynamic here. That has some people uncomfortable, but I think Zelenskyy would be very wise to enter into this agreement with the United States. There's no better way to secure them going forward, and further, there was a question of whether Putin would come to the table. He has now done so under President Trump's leadership, and we're going to continue those talks in the coming weeks at President Trump's direction.\"",

    "published": "Tue, 18 Feb 2025 17:55:35 GMT",
    "summary": "Layoffs, funding freezes, and executive orders spark outcry among federal researchers and university partners, fearing that science itself is under siege.",
    "story": [
      "\u201cThis is simply the end.\u201d",
      "That was the five-word message that Rick Huganir, a neuroscientist at Johns Hopkins University in Baltimore, received from a colleague just before 6 p.m. two Fridays ago, with news that would send a wave of panic through the scientific community.",
      "When Huganir clicked on the link in the email, from fellow JHU neuroscientist Alex Kolodkin, he saw a new National Institutes of Health policy designed to slash federal spending on the indirect costs that keep universities and research institutes operating, including for new equipment, maintenance, utilities and support staff.",
      "\u201cAm I reading this right 15%??\u201d Huganir wrote back in disbelief, suddenly worried the cut could stall 25 years of work.",
      "In 1998, Huganir discovered a gene called SYNGAP1. About 1% of all children with intellectual disabilities have a mutation of the gene. He\u2019s working to develop drugs to treat these children, who often have learning differences, seizures and sleep problems. He said his research is almost entirely reliant on NIH grants.",
      "The search for a cure for these rare disorders is a race against time, because researchers think treatment will be most effective if administered when patients are children.",
      "\u201cWe\u2019re developing therapeutics for the kids and may have a therapeutic that could be curing these kids in the next several years, but that research is going to be compromised,\u201d Huganir said in an interview, estimating that scientists in his field could start a Phase 1 clinical trial within the next five years. \u201cAny delay or anything that inhibits our research is devastating to the parents.\u201d",
      "From cancer researchers to those working in maternal health, Huganir\u2019s predicament is familiar to many scientists across the country right now. Less than a month into his administration, President Donald Trump has embarked on a cost cutting program that threatens to reshape the infrastructure that has made the U.S. the envy of the world in medical innovation. His administration has frozen federal grants, ordered sweeping layoffs across federal agencies, cut funding for biomedical research and issued executive orders that threaten to shutter government programs focused on gender or diversity.",
      "The NIH policy is only one piece of a dramatic overhaul of the federal agencies that has included aggressive and at-times untargeted cuts to scientific research. A judge halted the National Institutes of Health policy a little more than a week ago, at least temporarily, after 22 state attorneys general filed a lawsuit. Still, it has left some scientists, like Huganir, in fear they may have to slow or abandon research projects, potentially walking back years of progress and preventing new scientific breakthroughs. NIH did not respond to a request for comment after a request from NBC News on Friday.",
      "The new administration\u2019s blitz has provoked outcry among researchers, doctors and university leaders, many of whom are organizing for a showdown \u2014 in the courts and in public opinion \u2014\u00a0to save institutions, money and workers who have propelled research for decades.",
      "\u201cThere\u2019s a battle ahead to protect not just the funding, but the social contract that the federal government and institutions have had to enable the scientific research enterprise in America in the last 80 years,\u201d said Holden Thorp, the editor-in-chief of the Science family of scientific journals.",
      "In an emailed statement, White House spokesperson Kush Desai said the Trump administration was focused on better using taxpayer dollars on research, trimming the nation\u2019s \u201cbloated bureaucracy\u201d and streamlining government operations.",
      "\u201cThe Trump administration is committed to slashing waste, fraud, and abuse while increasing transparency of where limited taxpayer dollars from NIH are going and how exactly they\u2019re advancing scientific research and development,\u201d Desai said. \u201cContrary to the hysteria, redirecting billions of allocated NIH spending away from opaque administrative expenses means there will be more money and resources available for legitimate scientific research, not less.\u201d",
      "We\u2019re looking to hear from federal government workers. If you have more information on DOGE at your agency, please email us at\u00a0tips@nbcuni.com\u00a0or contact us through\u00a0one of these methods.",
      "Cuts to employees, funding and research",
      "The flurry of activity in recent weeks stems from Trump\u2019s executive orders that aim to shrink the federal workforce and target programs related to gender identity, environmental justice or diversity, equity and inclusion.",
      "In upending the scientific status quo, the Trump administration has focused on three main areas: cutting federal workers, slashing budgets and reversing efforts to expand diversity within science.",
      "Its most significant financial move took place on Feb. 7, when NIH announced it would limit indirect funding for laboratories that receive federal research grants to 15%. The policy, if allowed to continue, would slash billions of dollars for overhead costs that support biomedical research.",
      "Though NIH estimated that the move would save $4 billion each year, it would also leave universities and research institutes to foot much of the bill instead, and many have said they simply can\u2019t.",
      "Today, when a scientist at Johns Hopkins University receives an NIH grant for a project \u2014 say, $1 million a year \u2014 the university receives an additional 55%, or $550,000, to cover overhead costs. The rate is negotiated between NIH and Johns Hopkins, and it\u2019s based on an accounting of the university\u2019s research expenses.",
      "\u201cThis is a huge cut. Johns Hopkins Medical School would lose $200 million a year,\u201d Huganir said. \u201cIt\u2019s not a viable enterprise to do science.\u201d",
      "In a written statement supporting the lawsuit from the 22 attorneys general, Michigan State University said a reduction in funding could force the university to abandon construction of a $330 million research building designed to support the study of cancer, cardiovascular disease and neuroscience.",
      "It could also cut funding for the university\u2019s MIRACLE Center, which pilots initiatives to reduce maternal and infant death, such as home medical visits or a support app for expectant mothers.",
      "\u201cWithout the indirect cost recovery, we would have to close it down or lay off many people,\u201d Douglas Gage, the university\u2019s vice president for research and innovation, said of the center.",
      "In a separate lawsuit, the Association of American Universities argued that smaller institutions \u201cwill not be able to sustain any research at all and could close entirely.\u201d",
      "The uncertainty is affecting prospective students as well.",
      "William Tate IV, the president of Louisiana State University, said the university had to change language in acceptance letters for graduate students on Thursday.",
      "\u201cHistorically, we say, \u2018Welcome to LSU. You have a graduate assistantship. We\u2019ll see you in August,\u2019\u201d Tate said. \u201cNow, we have to have the caveat: \u2018assuming we\u2019re funded.\u2019\u201d",
      "While many scientists aren\u2019t opposed to reducing costs within federal agencies, they have taken issue with the way the Trump administration has broadly gutted budgets and staff without considering the ripple effects within the agencies.",
      "\u201cI like the ambition of trying to identify government waste and trying to reduce regulations that are outdated or inefficient,\u201d said Stuart Buck, executive director of the Good Science Project, a nonprofit that aims to improve the funding and practice of science.",
      "\u201cBut I would worry that when the first thing out of the gate is to slash costs and slash employees, I think you end up possibly in the worst of all worlds, because now you have just as many bureaucratic hoops and regulations to jump through and not as much money or not as many people to handle it,\u201d said Buck, who has critiqued NIH\u2019s funding structure in the past.",
      "Even a brief pause in a research project due to a freeze in federal funding or uncertainty about whether a project violates the president\u2019s executive orders could cause damage.",
      "\u201cThe uncertainty creates huge disruptions,\u201d said Arati Prabhakar, former director of the White House Office of Science and Technology Policy under the Biden administration. \u201cIf it\u2019s research that involves clinical trials with patients with diseases that they are desperately hoping to have treated, that\u2019s just unethical to stop clinical trials and not be able to complete that kind of work.\u201d",
      "We might lose the lead on an entire field of research.",
      "Deborah Stine, founder of the Science and Technology Policy Academy",
      "Major reductions in scientific funding will likely have ripple effects for generations to come, according to David Stensrud, a professor of meteorology and atmospheric science at Pennsylvania State University and president of the American Meteorological Society.",
      "\u201cThe science investments that the government makes are just a few percent of the overall budget, but they are incredibly important investments in the next generation of scientists and the next generation of ideas,\u201d Stensrud said.",
      "Halting or abandoning research projects could also lead the U.S. to fall behind other countries in terms of scientific advancement, and encourage talent and investments to flow elsewhere.",
      "\u201cIf we don\u2019t keep up, then, believe me, there\u2019s plenty of work happening in Europe and in China,\u201d said Deborah Stine, founder of the Science and Technology Policy Academy, an education services company. \u201cWe might lose the lead on an entire field of research.\u201d",
      "Huganir, for instance, said he\u2019s trying to recruit 10 new faculty members in neuroscience and he thinks the odds of bringing in strong candidates from England and Germany have decreased because of the uncertainty around funding.",
      "Dr. Joshua Barocas, an associate professor at the University of Colorado School of Medicine, said meetings of the scientific council that reviews grants and makes determinations for funding are still on pause.",
      "\u201cThe entire cycle is disrupted. And when we disrupt the cycle for even a week, a month, that\u2019s thousands of scientists, thousands of experiments and thousands of nonfederal employees who are impacted,\u201d Barocas said at a media briefing hosted by the Infectious Diseases Society of America.",
      "In a news release on Friday, Sen. Tammy Baldwin, D-Wis., said the Trump administration had halted all grant funding for 10 days, which meant that research institutions had received about 3,600 fewer NIH grants and $1 billion less in total funding in comparison to previous years.",
      "Fewer workers, a more burdensome workload",
      "As the administration seeks radical changes to research funding, it has also sought to cut employees at federal scientific agencies.",
      "Wide-ranging cuts of probationary workers \u2014 who are typically in their first year of employment at federal agencies and not yet subject to the same job protections as more tenured staff members \u2014 have hit almost every corner of the government.",
      "Some employees at the Department of Energy\u2019s National Nuclear Security Administration received termination notices on Thursday, according to a source with direct knowledge of the layoffs. A spokesperson for the DOE told NBC News that \u201cless than a half of a percent of the total NNSA workforce was dismissed\u201d last week. The administration on Friday sought to reinstate some of these workers, who oversee the nation\u2019s nuclear stockpile, but struggled to get in touch.",
      "Hundreds of employees at the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention were let go as well, including a group of fellows responsible for training public health laboratory staffers and supporting outbreak response efforts.",
      "A CDC employee said researchers within the agency have not been allowed to publish new material except in rare circumstances, and have had to pull their names from papers that are due to be released and include language that violates Trump\u2019s executive orders. CDC employees must also receive approval before they can communicate with outside partners, such as nonprofits, the employee said. The CDC did not respond to a request for comment.",
      "Similar shake-ups are anticipated at other science agencies, including NASA and the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration, which manages the National Weather Service.",
      "Employees at the National Science Foundation (NSF) have been told that up to half of the agency\u2019s staff could be laid off soon. And the U.S. Forest Service on Thursday indicated that it planned to lay off at least 3,400 workers, according to a union representative, which would cut the agency\u2019s staffing by about 10%.",
      "Matt Brown, the recording secretary for NIH Fellows United, a union that represents about 5,000 fellows, said NIH staffers were let go on Friday. He did not know how many had been terminated.",
      "\u201cFrom my understanding it\u2019s likely to be in the hundreds to thousands,\u201d Brown said.",
      "The Environmental Protection Agency earlier this month placed about 170 staffers on administrative leave who worked on environmental justice, which refers to the idea that people should have equitable access to clean and healthy environments and that some underserved communities have historically faced disproportionate environmental harms. The agency last month notified another 1,100 probationary employees they could be let go at any moment. Some of those employees received termination notices on Friday, but it was not immediately clear how many employees were affected in total and the agency did not respond to questions.",
      "EPA Administrator Lee Zeldin said in a news release that the Biden administration \u201cused DEI and Environmental Justice to advance ideological priorities, distributing billions of dollars to organizations in the name of climate equity.\u201d",
      "\u201cThis ends now,\u201d he added. \u201cWe will be good stewards of tax dollars and do everything in our power to deliver clean air, land, and water to every American, regardless of race, religion, background, and creed.\u201d",
      "One EPA staffer, who was placed on administrative leave last week, said staffers were given only 24 hours\u2019 notice that they might be placed on leave, which left them little time to finish ongoing projects. The notices went out by email. Direct managers seemed to be in the dark about what was happening.",
      "\u201cThey\u2019re not able to provide answers to our questions. They don\u2019t have answers either,\u201d the staffer said on condition of anonymity.",
      "The agency also ruffled staff on Wednesday by telling most remote and telework employees \u2014 including those who live more than 50 miles from the nearest EPA office \u2014 that they could no longer work from home. Union representatives said the EPA never bargained over the change.",
      "\u201cThis is another step in the psychological abuse of federal employees,\u201d said Marie Owens Powell, president of the American Federation of Government Employees Council 238, a union that represents about 8,500 EPA staffers.",
      "Desai, the White House spokesman, said President Trump had been \u201cgiven a mandate by the American people to streamline our bloated bureaucracy.\u201d",
      "\u201cCuts to the federal workforce, especially relating to the domains of science and research, were calculated decisions made to make our government more efficient without sacrificing on our ability to advance research and keep Americans safe,\u201d Desai said.",
      "Some federal employees who remained were compelled to spend their time looking for newly verboten words or ideas.",
      "At the NSF, employees were enlisted to comb through tens of thousands of research grants in search of keywords that violated Trump\u2019s executive orders. Employees also scrubbed the keywords from project proposals and announcements.",
      "An NSF media officer said the agency is \u201cworking expeditiously to conduct a comprehensive review of our projects, programs and activities to be compliant with the existing executive orders.\u201d",
      "Three NSF employees told NBC News that the list of forbidden words was unnecessarily broad, meaning new research projects could potentially exclude a large swath of study participants, including people of color or those with disabilities. They feared that some existing projects wouldn\u2019t be allowed to continue at all under the Trump administration, particularly since the Biden administration\u2019s CHIPS and Science Act instructed the NSF to broaden participation in STEM (science, technology, engineering and mathematics) research and education to underrepresented groups.",
      "Two of the employees added that the assignment to scrub keywords distracted from people\u2019s normal workload.",
      "Meanwhile, at the EPA, a group of about 40 employees was tasked with reviewing more than 6,000 agency webpages, screening for terms like \u201cEJ\u201d or \u201cEnvironmental Justice.\u201d",
      "\u201cThere is so much of this useless busywork, the opposite of government efficiency,\u201d one worker wrote in a message to NBC News.",
      "CDC scientists were also told to remove terms such as \u201cgender,\u201d \u201ctransgender\u201d or \u201cpregnant people\u201d from the agency\u2019s webpages, one employee said. Indeed, references to diversity and gender \u2014 including HIV-related content \u2014 have been widely purged from the agency\u2019s website.",
      "The Trump administration has also shuttered diversity programs that some viewed as important gateways to careers in science, including NIH\u2019s F31 program and NSF Advance, which focused on developing a more diverse bench.",
      "\u201cThose programs have allowed lots of people to come into science that didn\u2019t realize it was for them, and that\u2019s a lot of talent we\u2019re not going to be getting,\u201d Thorp said. \u201cThe irony there is, part of the goal is to get more American-born scientists. If you want to do that, the last thing you\u2019d do is cut off these programs.\u201d",
      "Desai, the White House spokesman, said in a statement that the White House sought to restore \u201cthe primacy of merit and competence\u201d and that the president had a mandate from voters to scrap diversity, equity and inclusion efforts he said were \u201cchoke-holding\u201d institutions.",
      "\u201cFinite resources can\u2019t be spent on advancing vague social goals but must be invested in cutting-edge research being undertaken by our best and brightest minds to expand our understanding of the universe and apply scientific breakthroughs to elevate our material well being,\u201d Desai said.",
      "\u201cPlenty of government time, money, and resources were wasted on the front end of enforcing DEI policies that did nothing to advance scientific research. Undoing the damage inflicted by the prior administration is a necessary step in the Trump administration\u2019s plan to streamline our government to best advance scientific research and development.\u201d",
      "A fight to defend scientific research",
      "The Trump administration\u2019s actions will be tested in the courts and fought by unions. But scientists and university leaders said they have another fight ahead:\u00a0They need to convince Americans \u2014 and Congress \u2014 that science is worth the investment.",
      "Three NSF employees said most people within the agency have declined to accept buyout offers from the Trump administration in an effort to protect their research.",
      "Last week, Stensrud sent a letter to members of the American Meteorological Society urging them to contact their elected officials in Congress to discuss the importance of scientific research, weather forecasting and climate science to the American public.",
      "The idea, Stensrud said, was to \u201cget out ahead\u201d of expected changes at NOAA and other agencies, and to \u201cseparate fact from fiction.\u201d",
      "The funding cuts at NIH have prompted concern across the political spectrum.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s not going to only impact blue states, it\u2019s going to impact red states and people who need these cures and therapies,\u201d Huganir said, adding that the court\u2019s restraining order gives scientists time to make a case to stem the funding cut.",
      "\u201cWe\u2019ve put it off for a while and have time to lobby,\u201d he said, speaking for researchers like himself.",
      "Sen. Katie Britt, R-Ala., Sen. Susan Collins, R-Maine, and Sen. Bill Cassidy, R-La., have all gently pushed back against Trump\u2019s plan to cap indirect costs at NIH, with Collins calling it \u201cpoorly conceived.\u201d Universities in red Southern states such as Alabama and Louisiana have also put out statements decrying the funding shortfalls.",
      "\u201cIn the state of Louisiana, we have some of the highest cancer disparities in the United States of America,\u201d said Tate, the president of LSU, adding that the university could lose hundreds of research jobs if the cuts are effected. \u201cThis is not a political issue. This is an issue of life and death.\u201d"

      "\u201cEach day has brought a new constellation of suffering,\u201d the worker said, describing the administration\u2019s directives as conflicting, confusing and cruel. \u201cBecause of the stress and strain of the constant onslaught by my employer in recent weeks my wife has repeatedly been in the hospital with a life-threatening condition and stress-related complications.\u201d",
      "The worker said the couple was told they must evacuate because the medical complications had placed the mother at high risk for hemorrhaging. But despite twice having received approval for a medical evacuation, the State Department in Washington canceled the transports on Feb. 4 and Feb. 6 with a message stating, \u201cthere is no USAID funding for Medevacs.\u201d",
      "The worker said they called everyone they could think of for help before finally finding a sympathetic senator who intervened. But by then the worker\u2019s spouse had begun hemorrhaging and needed emergency hospitalization at their overseas post. She must now remain on bed rest, as they were told it would be too risky to move the mother and unborn child, the filing said.",
      "The worker said the events that led to the life-threatening situation were due to the administration's rushed desire to shut down an agency. \u201cOur lives are acceptable collateral damage for their political gain,\" the worker said.",
      "The White House did not immediately respond to NBC News' for comment.",
      "Trump and tech billionaire Elon Musk, who heads the president's government downsizing initiative, dubbed the Department of Government Efficiency, abruptly announced earlier this month that USAID would be shut down.",
      "The agency delivers billions of dollars in humanitarian aid overseas, funding that advocates say provides a critical lifeline to more than 100 countries at a small fraction of the overall federal budget."

    "summary": "SKAMANIA COUNTY, Wash. \u2014 A freeze on the hiring and onboarding of thousands of federal firefighters could have deadly consequences as the national wildfire response operates at a \"diminished capacity,\" a federal firefighting captain told NBC News.",
    "story": [
      "SKAMANIA COUNTY, Wash. \u2014 A freeze on the hiring and onboarding of thousands of federal firefighters could have deadly consequences as the national wildfire response operates at a \"diminished capacity,\" a federal firefighting captain told NBC News.",
      "The federal hiring freeze ordered last month by President Donald Trump will hinder the U.S. Forest Service's ability to \"deliver the lifesaving service that Americans deserve,\u201d said Capt. Ben McLane, who serves in the Gifford Pinchot National Forest, in southern Washington.",
      "The U.S. Forest Service, the Bureau of Land Management and the National Park Service employ more than 15,000 career and temporary seasonal firefighters who conduct fuel management, fight wildland fires and assist other agencies in emergencies under the National Incident Management System.",
      "Hiring federal firefighters is a lengthy process because federal background checks are required, raising concerns among McLane and other high-ranking firefighters that the federal force will be understaffed going into the 2025 fire season, which technically begins next month but in practicality has become year-round.",
      "\u201cI have firefighters who I should be bringing on, and I\u2019m not able to because our HR practices have stopped until the hiring freeze is lifted, or they\u2019re given permission to continue,\u201d McLane said in an interview last week at the site of the 2023 Tunnel 5 Fire, which burned over 500 acres. \u201cIt\u2019s as simple as that.\u201d",
      "McLane toured the area with NBC News as a winter storm blanketed the Columbia River Gorge with snow, which fell on the remains of homes destroyed by fire.",
      "\u201cThis is the time of year where we\u2019re training, we\u2019re preparing, we\u2019re getting the qualifications that we need to answer the call to service when the summer does come,\u201d said McLane, who serves on the board of the nonprofit Grassroots Wildland Firefighters, an advocacy group.",
      "As snowflakes covered his hair and jacket bearing a patch from his time working as an elite \u201chotshot\u201d firefighter in Lake County, California, McLane dismissed the notion that fighting fires \u2014 and preparing to fight fires \u2014 was a part-time job.",
      "\u201cThe only place fire season still exists is in our administrative practices,\u201d he said.",
      "McLane said his work as a senior hotshot had taken him to fires throughout the United States, \u201cfrom Alabama to New Hampshire to California, Alaska and everywhere in between.\u201d He was part of the Forest Service's \u201cinitial attack response\u201d to the 2018 Camp Fire in Paradise, California, the deadliest in the state\u2019s history.",
      "Officials with the U.S. Department of Agriculture, which oversees the Forest Service, did not respond to a request for comment Tuesday.",
      "But the newly confirmed secretary of the U.S. Department of Agriculture, which oversees the Forest Service, thanked firefighters in a video released Friday for their mutual aid response to last month's deadly Los Angeles wildfires.",
      "\u201cThe U.S. Department of Agriculture has the largest and most sophisticated wildland firefighting workforce in the world,\u201d said Agriculture Secretary Brooke Rollins, \u201cand I am committed to ensuring that you have the tools and resources you need to safely and effectively carry out your mission.\u201d",
      "She did not address the hiring freeze nor its impact on the firefighters she was speaking to.",
      "A seasonal firefighter who has worked for the federal government for six years and on a hotshot crew for four told NBC News that while he had completed a drug test and background check, and received correspondence from the federal government indicating he would be re-hired, an official offer has yet to arrive.",
      "\u201cThere are a lot of talented people who said, \u2018Screw it, I\u2019m going to take a county job or state job,'\" said the firefighter, who spoke on condition of anonymity because he feared retribution from the so-called Department of Government Efficiency, which has been tasked with downsizing the federal government.",
      "\u201cMy deeper concern with the hiring freeze is if it doesn\u2019t get resolved in time for fire season, just where will that leave us?\u201d he said. \u201cI\u2019ve spent somewhere in the ballpark of 400 days fighting wildfires. We are wildfire specialists. That is all we do, and we\u2019re good at it.",
      "\"If our workforce continues to be gutted, the experience that will be lost is irreplaceable.\u201d",
      "More than a dozen Democratic senators have called for firefighters to be exempted from the hiring freeze to no avail.",
      "\u201cPausing the hiring and onboarding of federal seasonal firefighters \u2014 while historic wildfires destroy communities and upend livelihoods across the West \u2014 is simply irresponsible and dangerous,\u201d they wrote in a letter last week to the Trump administration.",
      "As more than 3,000 of his Forest Service colleagues were being laid off last week, McLane said it was important he speak out: \u201cOur nation\u2019s wildfire response system transcends politics, because wildfire transcends politics, and it\u2019s the right thing to do to bring on firefighters and ensure that the public is getting the service that they deserve and that they pay for.\u201d"

      "White House spokesperson Harrison Fields confirmed in a statement that King was no longer the head of the agency.",
      "\u201cPresident Trump has nominated the highly qualified and talented Frank Bisignano to lead the Social Security Administration, and we expect him to be swiftly confirmed in the coming weeks. In the meantime, the agency will be led by a career Social Security anti-fraud expert as the acting commissioner. President Trump is committed to appointing the best and most qualified individuals who are dedicated to working on behalf of the American people, not to appease the bureaucracy that has failed them for far too long,\u201d Fields said.",
      "The Washington Post first reported King\u2019s departure.",
      "One of the sources familiar with the situation, Nancy Altman, president of Social Security Works, a left-leaning group focused on protecting and expanding Social Security, Medicare and Medicaid,\u00a0told NBC News she learned of the situation after having spoken with several current officials at the agency.",
      "Altman said some of the information involved in the dispute included Americans\u2019 bank information, Social Security numbers, earnings records, marital statuses, dates of birth and, in some cases, medical records if people have applied for disability benefits.",
      "\u201cShe was replaced as acting commissioner because she would not give access to the sensitive information,\u201d Altman said of King. \u201cSo she was replaced with someone who presumably will. But she was not forced to leave the agency. That was her choice. It was the White House\u2019s choice to not let her be head of the agency anymore.\u201d",

      "\u201cI don\u2019t think you can overstate how serious this breach is,\u201d Altman said. \u201cThe information that the Social Security Administration has is a lot of personal data that most people would like to keep private and they entrusted to the government through tax returns and through their employers\u2019 sending in earning statements. The assumption is that the government will be very careful with it.\u201d",
      "King, who has worked at the Social Security Administration for decades, has chosen to retire, Altman said.",
      "The SSA did not immediately reply to a request for comment.",
      "It is the latest in a wave of exits from senior officials whose agencies have come into DOGE\u2019s crosshairs.",
      "The agency is in charge of managing payments for more than 70 million Americans. Trump has vowed not to cut retirement benefits.",
      "In an interview with Fox News, White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt confirmed that Trump \"has directed Elon Musk and the DOGE team to identify fraud at the Social Security Administration.\" She said that while the team had not \"dug into the books,\" it suspected that widespread fraud was occurring.",
      "The SSA's inspector general released a report in July that found that from 2015 to 2022, only 0.84% of benefits payments were improper.",
      "It is not the first time DOGE has drawn scrutiny over attempts to access sensitive information. A DOGE-affiliated employee at the IRS is expected to seek access to an IRS system housing sensitive taxpayer information, an administration official told NBC News on Sunday.",
      "DOGE this month also accessed the Treasury Department\u2019s payment system, which stores Social Security numbers and other confidential financial information. Several lawsuits were then filed claiming DOGE\u2019s access to the data violated federal privacy laws. Justice Department attorneys agreed to temporarily restrict DOGE\u2019s access to the Treasury Department\u2019s systems, except for two employees given \u201cread only\u201d access \u201cas needed.\u201d",
      "A judge later temporarily blocked political appointees and special government employees \u2014 including those who work at DOGE \u2014 from accessing sensitive and confidential information stored within the Treasury.",

      "Guy Pearce says that Kevin Spacey \"targeted\" him while the actors worked together on the set of \"L.A. Confidential.\"",
      "The Oscar-nominated star of \"The Brutalist\" was a guest on The Hollywood Reporter's \"Awards Chatter\" podcast released Monday, where he choked up while recounting being allegedly pursued by Spacey during filming of the 1997 Academy Award-winning film.",
      "\"I was sort of scared of Kevin because he\u2019s quite an aggressive man,\" Pearce, 57, said. \"He\u2019s extremely charming and brilliant at what he does \u2014 really impressive, etc. He holds a room remarkably. But I was young and susceptible, and he targeted me, no question.\u201d",
      "Pearce did not disclose the details or dates of which the alleged encounters occurred. He added that he had a \u201ccouple of confrontations with Kevin\u201d that \u201cgot ugly\u201d\u00a0since filming \u201cL.A. Confidential.\u201d",
      "A law firm representing Spacey did not immediately return an NBC News request for comment.",
      "Spacey, 65, has spent the better part of the last decade fighting off allegations of sexual harassment and assault, all of which he has denied.",
      "In 2017, actor\u00a0Anthony Rapp accused Spacey of sexually assaulting him when Rapp was 14 and Spacey was 26. Rapp sued Spacey in federal civil court in 2020. Spacey was\u00a0found not liable\u00a0on all counts.",
      "The disgraced \"House of Cards\" star and Oscar winner was also accused of groping an 18-year-old at a Massachusetts bar in 2016. Charges were dropped in 2019 after the accuser refused to testify.",
      "Spacey was acquitted again last year after a U.K. jury found him not guilty of sexually assaulting four men while working as the artistic director of London's Old Vic Theatre. The accusations dated from 2004 to 2013. An additional lawsuit alleging sexual abuse was filed against Spacey and Old Vic Theatre in the U.K. last week.",
      "In the Monday interview, Pearce recalled the moment he first heard about the allegations against Spacey in 2017.",
      "\u201cI was in London working on something, and I heard this and I broke down and sobbed, and I couldn\u2019t stop,\" Pearce said. \"I think it really dawned on me the impact that had occurred and how I sort of brushed it off and how I had either shelved it or blocked it out or whatever. That was a really incredible wake-up call I suppose.\u201d",
      "Pearce first suggested he had unwanted encounters with Spacey on an Australian talk show in 2018, calling Spacey \"a handsy guy.\" Shortly afterward, he issued a statement clarifying that he \"wasn\u2019t sexually assaulted or molested, I was made to feel uncomfortable.\"",
      "The Australian actor said that today he is \"more honest about it now,\" but still hesitates to call himself a victim.",
      "\u201cEven though I probably was a victim to a degree, I was certainly not a victim by any means to the extent that other people have been to sexual predators,\" Pearce said."

    "story": [
      "Leonard Peltier, the Native American activist who has always maintained his innocence in the killing of two FBI agents 50 years ago, was released Tuesday morning from a federal prison in Florida after then-President Joe Biden commuted his two life sentences.",
      "The act of clemency permits Peltier, who is 80 and has been in declining health for years, to serve his remaining days in home confinement.",
      "Peltier is being transferred to his birthplace in North Dakota, where he is a citizen of the Turtle Mountain Band of Chippewa, and will be welcomed with celebrations to \"reconnect with his home community and adjust back into life among his people,\" the NDN Collective, an Indigenous-led advocacy organization, said in a statement.",
      "\"We made a commitment to free Leonard Peltier and bring him back to his homelands \u2014 this is us fulfilling that commitment,\"\u00a0Nick Tilsen, the organization's founder, said.",
      "The federal Bureau of Prisons declined to comment prior to Peltier's release, citing security and privacy reasons, or discuss the conditions of his confinement. The BOP said generally that individuals released to home confinement are required to be tracked via electronic monitoring, must remain in their homes when not involved in approved activities and may have their progress reviewed by halfway house services.",
      "The extent of the rules on Peltier were still being worked out, but his age and health should be taken into consideration, said Jenipher Jones, the lead lawyer in his case.",
      "She added that he would be receiving medical attention upon his release as he struggles with ailments, such as diabetes, hypertension and partial blindness from a stroke.",
      "\"He's been subjected to medical negligence for nearly 50 years,\" Jones said. His release \"gives him a chance at a life, at a humane existence, and the ability to more acutely engage with his culture, with his religious practices and with his sacred practices.\"",
      "Over the decades, Peltier's case has drawn prominent support from international human rights groups and civil rights icons, including Coretta Scott King; religious leaders, such as Pope Francis and the Dalai Lama; and congressional lawmakers and celebrities.",
      "But Biden's decision, which came on his final day in office, was also condemned by law enforcement groups who said Peltier was unremorseful in the deaths of FBI agents Jack Coler and Ron Williams.",
      "\"Mr. President, I urge you in the strongest terms possible: Do not pardon Leonard Peltier or cut his sentence short,\" then-FBI Director Christopher Wray wrote to Biden in early January as the president weighed whether to grant clemency.",
      "Wray also opposed Peltier's request during a hearing last year to be released on parole. The bid was denied.",
      "A nonprofit group representing FBI agents reaffirmed its criticism of Peltier's release Tuesday. Coler's family previously said it was \"frustrated and very angry after years of fighting to keep Peltier incarcerated.\"",
      "Coler, 28, and Williams, 27, were killed in June 1975 while on the Pine Ridge Indian Reservation\u00a0in South Dakota, where they were attempting to arrest a man on a federal warrant in connection with the theft of a pair of cowboy boots, according to the\u00a0FBI's investigative files.",
      "Peltier was a member of the American Indian Movement,\u00a0a grassroots activist organization that began in Minneapolis in the 1960s to challenge police brutality and the oppression of Indigenous rights. He was at Pine Ridge in the wake of a drawn-out protest two years earlier at Wounded Knee, South Dakota, where armed AIM activists and Oglala Sioux tribal members had occupied the town and clashed with federal law enforcement officers. Two\u00a0activists were killed.",
      "On the day Coler and Williams arrived at Pine Ridge, they radioed that they had come under fire in a shootout that lasted 10 minutes, the FBI said. Both men were fatally shot at close range.",
      "Peltier was identified as the only person on the reservation in possession of an AR-15 rifle that could fire the type of bullet that killed the agents, according to investigators.",
      "But dozens of people had participated in the gunfight; at trial, two co-defendants were acquitted after they claimed self-defense. When Peltier was tried separately in 1977, no witnesses who could identify him as the shooter were presented, and unknown to his defense lawyers at the time, the federal government had withheld a ballistics report indicating the fatal bullets didn't come from his weapon, according to\u00a0court documents Peltier filed\u00a0on appeal.",
      "The FBI contended a subsequent testing of shell casing evidence did match extractor marks from a casing retrieved from the trunk of Coler's car with the AR-15 associated with Peltier.",
      "Jimmy Carter was president when Peltier was convicted at trial in 1977 for the agents' murders. Two years later, Peltier was involved in a prison escape in which he received an additional five-year sentence.",
      "James Reynolds, the U.S. attorney whose office had handled the prosecution and appeal of Peltier's case, later became an advocate for his release, writing to various presidents, including Biden, to grant clemency.",
      "He said he altered his views after taking into account the questionable evidence in such a chaotic setting when the crime occurred, the acquittal of Peltier's co-defendants in their own trial and the historic mistreatment of Native Americans by the federal government.",
      "\"The case is just a tremendous miscarriage of justice, in my opinion,\" Reynolds, who was appointed by Carter, said in a phone interview. \"I realized that it wasn't right what they did to Leonard. Enough was enough.\"",
      "Peltier told NBC News in 2022 that he wanted to clear his name in a new trial.",
      "Jones, the lead lawyer, said she believes \"any detention of Leonard is unlawful,\" and would move forward with appeals in his case.",
      "Peltier's oldest son, Chauncey Peltier, was among those on Tuesday awaiting official word that he was out of prison.",
      "Chauncey Peltier, who lives in Oregon, said he plans to reunite with his father next month in North Dakota after last seeing him during a prison visit in 2015.",
      "He said he was grateful for those who worked behind the scenes to push for his father's release, and ultimately, to Biden for intervening.",
      "\"He corrected an injustice,\" Chauncey Peltier said. \"He doesn't know how much this has meant to the family.\""

      "The 34-year-old mother was arrested last week, the Oakland County Sheriff\u2019s Office said in a news release on Sunday. To protect the identity of the children \u2014 aged 15, 13 and 12 \u2014 her name was not released.",
      "Sheriff Michael Bouchard\u00a0called the children's living conditions \"abuse of the highest order.\" Human waste and mold were found inside the home, garbage was thrown everywhere, and the children survived on weekly drop-offs of prepared food, the sheriff's office said.",
      "\"This situation would be deemed deplorable and intolerable for an animal, and it is utterly unacceptable for three children,\" Bouchard said in a statement.",
      "\"They have been deprived of any interaction with their mother and have not received an education for years,\" he continued. \"The far-reaching consequences of this abuse must be acknowledged.\"",
      "Deputies were called to the home on Friday afternoon to conduct a welfare check after the landlord said he had not heard from the mother since December, the news release states. The landlord said the mother had last paid rent in October and he was concerned that something may have happened.",
      "When deputies arrived, they found the home in \"deplorable shape,\" the news release states. The children, a 15-year-old boy, a 13-year-old girl, and a 12-year-old girl, were inside.",
      "\"Garbage was piled as high as four feet in some rooms, mold and human waste was found throughout, with the toilet overflowing and feces in the bathtub,\" the sheriff's office said. \"Deputies checked the residence for occupants and found the boy and his sisters.\"",
      "The girls had locked themselves in the bathroom but opened the door when asked, authorities said.",

      "Prepared food was left on the front porch each week for the children to survive on, the sheriff's office. Bouchard said the mother or a delivery driver would leave the food.",
      "The last time investigators believe the mother left hygiene items was in 2020, when she dropped off garbage bags, gloves and Febreze, the sheriff said.",
      "\"Towards the end, the children apparently were getting a loaf of bread dropped off that was supposed to last three to four days,\" he said at the news conference.",
      "The boy slept on a mattress on the floor and the girls on pizza boxes.",
      "The condition inside the home was so bad that an evidence technician had to wear a hazmat suit to process the scene, authorities said.",
      "The sheriff's office said the mother had contact with the boy, \"but it appeared she had not seen the girls in years.\" None of the children had attended school since they were abandoned, the sheriff's office said.",
      "Bouchard told reporters that a school district received a request for records from another school in Pontiac, but it was never verified that the children moved to the new school. When they did not show up to the new school, they were removed from enrollment.",
      "\"No one knew that they were nowhere,\" he said.",
      "It appeared as if the girls had not been outside for several years. The boy had come outside twice, once because he wanted to \"feel the grass\" and another time to check the mail,\" the sheriff said.",
      "\"Just to hear that he came out to touch the grass is soul-crushing on so many levels,\" he said, noting that the children were \"scared\" to leave the home.",
      "They passed the time by watching television or playing games, the news release states. When they were found, they were wearing soiled clothing, their hair was matted and their toenails were so long it made it difficult for them to walk.",

      "A bunch of bananas at a New Hampshire grocery store was hiding a slithering stowaway last week, a scaly story that might get adapted for the big screen as \"Snakes on a Plantain.\"",
      "Employees at a Market Basket in Manchester got an unexpected surprise on Saturday when they discovered a hissing hitchhiker nestled among their shipment of bananas, according to a news release from the New Hampshire Fish and Game Law Enforcement Division.",
      "Lt. Adam Cheney of NH Fish and Game told NBC News that his team is used to dealing with domestic reptiles, but this little one was an unexpected encounter.",
      "\"We're lucky enough that one of the workers at Market Basket was very familiar with reptiles,\" Cheney said.",
      "The unwelcome traveler was an approximately 1.5-foot-long snake, a mildly venomous species native to Ecuador, according to NH Fish and Game Law Enforcement Division.",
      "Cheney describes the uncommon encounter as similar to \"opening a Christmas present.\"",
      "\"I've never seen an Ornate cat-eyed snake before in 25 years,\" Cheney said. \"Everybody's kind of interested if you're into reptiles because you've never seen one, you don't get the opportunity to unless you go down to South America.\"",
      "NH Fish and Game Law Enforcement Division said that the snake was unharmed and has since been rehomed with their partners at Rainforest Reptile Shows Inc., an educational organization specializing in exotic animal care.",
      "Mack Ralbovsky, vice president of Rainforest Reptile Shows Inc., updated NBC News on what's next for their latest addition.",
      "\"This new hitchhiker friend will remain with Rainforest Reptile Shows and RRS Oasis for the remainder of its life,\" Ralbovsky said. \"However, it is a venomous species, so we take extreme precautions when bringing them out for these outreach events.\"",
      "Ralbovsky also assures consumers that they have nothing to worry about.",
      "\"Snakes in shipments are relatively uncommon and it's not something that consumers need to be concerned about,\" Ralbovsky explained. \"When any shipments come from tropical places, there is a chance that hitchhikers could be on board. However, it is typically small lizards, like anoles, frogs or invertebrates.\u201d",
      "Rainforest Reptile Inc. plans to post a video on their Facebook and YouTube accounts to update folks on how their newest addition is doing, and folks will have the opportunity to vote on its name.",
      "The company on Facebook thanked officials \"for ensuring a smooth and quick transition for our newest animal resident!\"",
      "\"The Cat-eyed Snake that arrived today is a specialized species from Panama, Ecuador, and Colombia that primarily feeds on amphibians and lizards,\" it said. \"As a nocturnal species, its care requires extra expertise and attention.\""

    "story": [
      "LONDON \u2014 Hundreds of prisoners will be freed in Scotland as part of a broader emergency response to ease the burden of overcrowded prisons across the United Kingdom.",
      "\u201cWe have been managing an extremely high and complex prison population for more than a year, putting considerable pressure on all those living and working in our establishments,\u201d a Scottish Prison Service spokesperson told NBC News on Tuesday via email, after the first of almost 400 prisoners were released.",
      "Scotland\u2019s prisons housed almost 8,000 prisoners every day in 2024 \u2014 a 6% increase on the previous year, according to its government statistics.",
      "\u201cIn line with trends seen elsewhere in the U.K., Scotland\u2019s prison population has significantly grown in recent years and, consequently, this rise has impacted prisons and the wider justice system,\u201d a Scottish government spokesperson told NBC News on Tuesday.",
      "Scotland is part of the United Kingdom but, like Wales and Northern Ireland, has its own semi-autonomous government with broad powers over areas including health care, education and law, meaning its government can unilaterally decide to free the prisoners without seeking the consent of the British Parliament in London.",
      "The prison population across the U.K. was just more than 97,000 people in March 2024, according the most recent British government data which projected that number to grow by around 4,500 every year while prisons remained \u201calmost full,\u201d it stated.",
      "In response, the U.K. government last year launched a major review over its sentencing laws and allowed judges to sentence offenders to house arrest. It also freed more than 1,700 prisoners across England and Wales in September.",
      "Under emergency legislation passed last November, Scottish inmates sentenced to less than four years are eligible for early release after serving 40% of their term, unless convicted of domestic abuse or sexual offenses.",
      "This means between 260 and 390 short-term prisoners are set to be freed over a six-week period starting Tuesday.",
      "The new legislation, which came into effect Feb. 11, will \u201cbring a sustained reduction to prisoner numbers so the prison estate can continue to function effectively,\u201d the government spokesperson said.",
      "The early release is expected to reduce the prison population by 5%, although the government has also acknowledged the new law is not a complete solution to overcrowded jails.",
      "Another 470 Scottish inmates were released early from prison last August, but 61 ended up back in custody before their original planned release date, according to Scottish Prison Service data.",
      "\u201cWhile not a complete solution, this Act will bring sustained reduction to prisoner numbers so the prison estate can continue to function effectively,\u201d Scottish Justice Secretary Angela Constance stated in a press release in January.",
      "But the early release could be \u201cdistressing for victims of crime\u201d and \u201craise questions and cause concern,\u201d Constance added.",
      "In response, the Scottish Police Service has urged victims to sign up for a joint scheme with Victim Support Scotland, a charity that provides support to those affected by crime, so that they will be notified if their offender\u2019s release date changes.",
      "The charity told NBC news in a statement Tuesday that there had been \u201cno improvements\u201d to the main mechanism intended to inform victims since the new legislation was passed.",
      "\u201cThe last time prisoners were released early, only 2% of victims were notified,\u201d said Kate Wallace, Victim Support Scotland's chief executive.",
      "She added that the early release would have a \u201cprofoundly damaging impact on victim confidence and trust in the justice system\u201d if the number of victims contacted did not increase this time.",
      "The spokesperson for Scottish Prison Service said it would work with the government and the justice sector to look at \u201call possible actions which will deliver a manageable population\u201d in its prisons.",
      "Support and rehabilitation of prisoners would continue to reduce \u201ctheir risk of reoffending, and helping to build safer communities across Scotland,\u201d he added."

      "While the word \u201cforce\u201d can suggest military connotations such as the U.S. Space Force, Parker said what China is establishing is more of a team for detecting planetary threats and doing something about them, \u201cincluding looking at international cooperation, which is something that, in my experience, at least the Chinese really like to try to do.\u201d",
      "The ads have been a major topic of online discussion among young people in China, who are grappling with high unemployment.",

      "The planetary defense force is part of a robust Chinese space program that includes a space station, missions to the far side of the moon and a rover on Mars.",
      "China has been a member of the International Asteroid Warning Network, a centralized hub of information coordinated by NASA, since 2018. In 2022, Wu Yanhua, deputy director of the China National Space Administration, said China would begin building a near-Earth asteroid defense system.",

      "In 2027, China is planning an asteroid-deflection test akin to the double asteroid redirection test successfully carried out by NASA in 2020. The Chinese test will be conducted on an asteroid called 2015 XF261, which is smaller than the 525-foot Dimorphos asteroid whose trajectory NASA disrupted by crashing a spacecraft into it.",

      "Sentiment among the nation\u2019s single-family homebuilders dropped to the lowest level in five months in February, largely due to concern over tariffs, which would raise their costs significantly.",
      "The National Association of Home Builders\u2019 Housing Market Index (HMI) dropped a sharp 5 points from January to a reading of 42. Anything below 50 is considered negative sentiment. Last February, the index stood at 48.",
      "\u201cWhile builders hold out hope for pro-development policies, particularly for regulatory reform, policy uncertainty and cost factors created a reset for 2025 expectations in the most recent HMI,\u201d said NAHB Chairman Carl Harris, a home builder from Wichita, Kansas.",
      "Of the index\u2019s three components, current sales conditions fell 4 points to 46, buyer traffic fell 3 points to 29 and sales expectations in the next six months plunged 13 points to 46. That last component hit its lowest level since December 2023.",
      "Builders are already facing elevated mortgage rates. The average rate on the 30-year fixed was over 7% for January and February after earlier being in the 6% range. Home prices are also higher than they were a year ago, weakening affordability further.",
      "While President Donald Trump\u2019s tariffs on Canada and Mexico, originally proposed to take effect in early February, were delayed roughly a month, builders are still expecting higher costs.",
      "\u201cWith 32% of appliances and 30% of softwood lumber coming from international trade, uncertainty over the scale and scope of tariffs has builders further concerned about costs,\u201d said NAHB chief economist Robert Dietz.",
      "Homebuilder sentiment had been gaining steadily since August on the expectation of lower mortgage rates and, as the builders noted, potential pro-development policies. Single-family housing starts are trending lower than they were a year ago, despite a lean supply of existing homes for sale.",
      "The drop in builder sentiment, coming right before the all-important spring market, signals potentially even less supply in the market. Several homebuilders have noted the pullback in buyer demand in recent earnings reports.",
      "\u201cDespite Federal Reserve actions to lower short-term interest rates, mortgage interest rates remained elevated in the fourth quarter, which impacted buyer demand as homebuyers continue to face affordability challenges,\u201d said Ryan Marshall, CEO of PulteGroup, in its fourth-quarter earnings release.",
      "The share of builders lowering prices dropped to 26% in February, down from 30% in January and the lowest share since May 2024. Other sales incentives also fell.",
      "This may be because incentives are becoming less effective at attracting buyers, since high prices and high rates have reduced the pool of buyers for whom these benefits move the needle, according to the NAHB.",
      "When a buyer is solidly priced out, no incentive helps, and with rates remaining higher, the pool of marginal buyers may be shrinking. Offering incentives to buyers who would buy regardless of price or rates is of diminishing value for builders.",

    "story": [
      "For decades, popcorn has been a staple of the movie theater experience and exhibitors\u2019 bottom lines. Now, the receptacle it comes in is becoming just as important.",
      "As recently as three years ago,\u00a0AMC Entertainment\u00a0didn\u2019t sell any merchandise. Last year it hawked novelty popcorn buckets, drink sippers and T-shirts to the tune of about $65 million in revenue.",
      "\u201cIt started with us in a big way with our own movie, \u2018Taylor Swift: The Eras Tour,\u2019 that we released in October of 2023 and we sold just an incredible number of popcorn buckets,\u201d said AMC CEO Adam Aron. \u201cThat sparked us to do it almost all the time \u2026 just literally every month.\u201d",
      "Other theater chains like\u00a0Cinemark,\u00a0Marcus, Regal and B&B Theatres have also embraced popcorn buckets, using these specialty items to drive concession purchases, create a sense of urgency to see big movies on opening weekend and add value to the theatrical experience.",
      "\u201cPost-Covid, we realized that the eventizing of cinema has never really been as important as it is now,\u201d said Paul Farnsworth, executive director of communication and content at B&B Theatres. \u201cWe recognized during that time that the greatest casualty for our industry was people just fell out of the habit of going to movies.\u201d",
      "Hollywood production issues led to fewer theatrical releases and\u00a0smaller ticket sales in 2024,\u00a0with box office receipts down 3.4% from 2023 to $8.74 billion. Farnsworth noted that unique popcorn buckets can add value to a customer\u2019s trip to the movies and creates a memory of the trip that can be taken home, propped up on a display shelf or repurposed for movie nights in.",
      "\u201cIt is very good for the bottom line,\u201d he said. \u201cThe big value for us is that people come in and there\u2019s these fun things they get to take home and they\u2019re taking pictures with them in the theater. There\u2019s immense value in that.\u201d",
      "For Cinemark, the proof of concept came with the release of \u201cScream VI\u201d in 2023.",
      "\u201cWe made a \u2018Scream\u2019 popcorn bucket and it completely caught us by surprise,\u201d said Sean Gamble, CEO of Cinemark. \u201cThis thing just had this huge uptake. We sold out of the thing immediately and we were basically selling them to people online afterwards.\u201d",
      "Not just a movie theater snack",
      "Commemorative popcorn buckets have long been a part of theme park merchandising, driving revenue of the likes of\u00a0Disney\u00a0and\u00a0Universal\u00a0both domestically and internationally. However, U.S.-based movie theaters were late to adopt the trend.",
      "Marketing and merchandise company Zinc has been designing and manufacturing branded popcorn buckets and drink sippers for over a decade internationally, but turned its attention stateside in 2016.",
      "\u201cTheaters were reticent because the cups didn\u2019t fit in the holders,\u201d said Rod Mason, vice president of business development at Zinc Group, one of the biggest players in the premium popcorn space.",
      "A shift came in 2019 with an R2-D2 popcorn bucket created for \u201cStar Wars: The Rise of Skywalker,\u201d Mason said.",
      "\u201cAMC took a punt on it,\u201d he explained. \u201cThey took multiple tens of thousands of pieces. They sold through it in about three or four days at an incredibly high price. Nothing like that had ever been done before, and it was like \u2018OK, well, this works.\u2019\u201d",
      "A revamped version of the droid popcorn bucket was re-released for the 25th anniversary screenings of \u201cStar Wars: Episode 1 \u2014 A Phantom Menace.\u201d",
      "The popcorn bucket and drink cup combo sold for $49.99.",
      "However, the true watershed moment for the niche market came nearly five years later with a now-infamous popcorn bucket in honor of \u201cDune: Part Two,\u201d released in last March. The bucket was modeled after the sandworms featured in the film but inspired crude comparisons to an adult product.",
      "\u201cThe beauty of the \u2018Dune\u2019 bucket was it just wasn\u2019t intended to be viral,\u201d Mason said.",
      "The $24.99 bucket sold out and found momentum on secondary markets. Receipts from eBay show these popcorn buckets sold for between $50 and $210 apiece on the reseller site.",
      "\u201cThe popularity of the popcorn buckets on social media combined with the perception of limited supply of the popcorn buckets leads to a feeling of \u2018fear of missing out\u2019 among consumers who are driven to buy the buckets when [they] see them available,\u201d said Lindsay Brookshier, content director at online Disney guide MickeyVist.com.",
      "The \u201cDune\u201d bucket inspired \u201cDeadpool & Wolverine\u201d actor and producer Ryan Reynolds to design a cheeky popcorn bucket for the release of his film.",
      "\u201cYears from now they will look back at 2024 as when the War of the Popcorn Buckets began,\u201d Reynolds wrote on X to promote the concession container, which was shaped like Wolverine\u2019s head with its mouth wide open to house the popcorn.",
      "The $29.99 bucket was exclusively available at AMC and was released the same weekend as San Diego Comic-Con and the \u201cDeadpool & Wolverine\u201d film release.",
      "More unique popcorn buckets to come",
      "Studios and theaters have been more proactive about working with companies like Zinc to create unique popcorn buckets for moviegoers.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s a very competitive business,\u201d said Mason. \u201cEveryone is trying to outdo, and not just the companies like us, but also the companies that are buying it. They\u2019re trying to make sure that they have the coolest item ... that competition has been magnified over the last 12 months because there\u2019s so many eyes on this segment of the business.\u201d",
      "And the movie industry is about to have an influx of blockbuster titles now that production delays from the pandemic and dual Hollywood strikes are in the rearview mirror.",
      "Following \u201cCaptain America: Brave New World,\u201d which debuted Friday, the 2025 calendar has \u201cThunderbolts*,\u201d \u201d Mission: Impossible: The Final Reckoning,\u201d \u201cHow to Train Your Dragon,\u201d \u201cJurassic World Rebirth,\u201d \u201cSuperman,\u201d \u201cFantastic Four: First Steps,\u201d \u201cWicked: For Good,\u201d \u201cZootopia 2,\u201d and \u201cAvatar: Fire and Ash.\u201d",
      "And 2026 has equally promising tie-ins for popcorn buckets with a \u201cSuper Mario Bros.\u201d sequel, \u201cAvengers: Doomsday,\u201d \u201cThe Mandalorian and Grogu,\u201d \u201cToy Story 5,\u201d \u201cSupergirl: Woman of Tomorrow,\u201d \u201cMinions 3,\u201d \u201cHunger Games: Sunrise on the Reaping,\u201d \u201cIce Age 6\u2033 and \u201cShrek 5.\u201d",
      "\u201cWe\u2019ve missed out on a couple,\u201d B&B\u2019s Farnsworth said. \u201cWe didn\u2019t have that crazy \u2018Dune\u2019 one. But that was kind of one of the hinge points for us. It was like, \u2018Alright, we really have to pay attention.\u2019\u201d",
      "B&B, the fifth-largest cinema chain in America with 58 locations, still has to be very intentional about which products it offers and how many it purchases. Films like \u201cWicked,\u201d with a massive built-in audience craving merchandise, are a safer bet. But theaters have a very short window to sell the specialty items.",
      "\u201cUnlike our normal popcorn bags, which are evergreen, if you don\u2019t sell the [product], you\u2019re probably not going to sell them a month after the movie,\u201d Farnsworth said.",
      "Meanwhile, AMC is investing more heavily.",
      "\u201cOne of the big things that we\u2019re doing in 2025 is we\u2019re significantly increasing the quantities,\u201d Aron said, noting that AMC was already placing orders for 100,000 units or more. \u201cWe\u2019re buying, because there\u2019s no need for us to sell out on opening day. There\u2019s plenty of people coming to see that movie for weeks and weeks.\u201d",

      "Coca-Cola\u00a0is launching a prebiotic soda brand called Simply Pop, taking on upstarts Olipop and Poppi.",
      "Starting in late February, consumers on the West Coast and in the Southeast will be able to try Coke\u2019s iteration of the trendy drink.",
      "Soda consumption has broadly fallen in the U.S. over the last two decades, hurt by health concerns and an increase in alternatives on the market, from cold brew to energy drinks to water. But in the last five years, sodas containing prebiotics have taken off, thanks to industry newcomers Olipop and Poppi.",
      "Olipop recently\u00a0raised $50 million\u00a0at a valuation of $1.85 billion, the company announced Wednesday. And Poppi made its second straight\u00a0Super Bowl appearance\u00a0in this year\u2019s game, shelling out up to $8 million to reach the game\u2019s record audience.",
      "Digestive health soft drinks have grown from a $197 million category in the U.S. in 2020 to one of roughly $440 million in 2024, according to Euromonitor International data. Still, it\u2019s a fraction of the overall soda market, which is worth billions of dollars.",
      "Simply Pop\u2019s first product lineup leans fruity, in a nod to Coke\u2019s Simply juice brand. Flavors include pineapple mango, lime, strawberry, fruit punch and citrus punch.",
      "\u201cWe went out and really listened to consumers. They love this space, they\u2019re really looking for stuff that tastes good, and that\u2019s something we know how to deliver on at Simply and at Coke,\u201d said Becca Kerr, CEO of Coke\u2019s North American nutrition unit, which includes its Simply and Fairlife brands.",
      "Simply Pop drinks have no added sugar and contain 25% to 30% real fruit juice, the company said. They also contain vitamin C and zinc, which can boost the immune system.",
      "They also have six grams of prebiotic fiber \u2014 triple Poppi\u2019s fiber content but less than Olipop\u2019s nine grams.",
      "Prebiotics have taken off thanks to claims that they can boost \u201cgut health\u201d by helping beneficial bacteria grow in the gut. Their health benefits\u00a0haven\u2019t been conclusively proven.",
      "\u201cWe do see that there tends to be an appetite for these type of products with younger consumers, like millennial and Gen Z,\u201d Kerr said. \u201cWe see an interest in these types of products from multicultural consumers.\u201d",
      "But health claims can prompt pushback. Poppi is in settlement talks over a\u00a0lawsuit filed\u00a0in late May that challenges the company\u2019s marketing, arguing that Poppi\u2019s products are not as healthy for the gut as advertised.",
      "Coke has had the prebiotic soda category on its radar for several years, according to Kerr. Olipop CEO and co-founder Ben Goodwin\u00a0told CNBC in 2023\u00a0that both Coke and PepsiCo had already approached the company about a potential sale. Pepsi is\u00a0reported to be planning\u00a0its own prebiotic soda launch in 2025.",
      "While it\u2019s a newcomer to the segment, Coke has some obvious advantages: more than 100 years dominating the soda category, marketing and distribution muscle, and $47 billion in revenue in 2024 \u2014 compared with the more than $400 million in sales that Olipop netted in 2024.",
      "Still, Coke has failed before when trying to chase a drink trend. It pulled its Coke Spiced flavor off the shelves in 2024 just months after declaring it a permanent addition. And in 2023, it slashed distribution of its Aha sparkling water brand after the product failed to take off with consumers.",

      "The song is a departure from the first two seasons, mostly due to the fact that there are no vocals (though the accordion is also making waves).",

      "The two forged a friendship as teacher and pupil under perilous circumstances at William Frantz Elementary School in New Orleans, and their bond is the subject of Bridges' new children's book. The activist and author is bringing her story to a new generation with \"Ruby Bridges: A Talk with My Teacher.\"",
      "Henry created a sanctuary for Bridges while white protesters outside the building railed against the school being desegregated. Bridges, who was 6 years old at the time, had to be walked into the building by federal marshals amid shouting and threats from white protesters.",
      "Many white families withdrew their children from the school due to her presence, while Bridges previously told TODAY.com that other white students were kept away from her by the school\u2019s principal.",
      "Bridges attended classes alone for a full year, with only Henry there to teach her.",
      "\"She filled my day with things to do,\" Bridges said on TODAY. \"She made school fun. I enjoyed learning. Even though the crowd was outside screaming and yelling, she would go to the window and close the window, and she\u2019s say \u2018Oh, we\u2019re going to have music today,\u2019 just to drown out everything.",
      "\u201cWe often say, both of us, she and I, that despite all the hate that was going on outside, inside that room it was filled with love.\u201d",
      "Henry, who is originally from Boston, would not be dissuaded at a time when many teachers at William Frantz Elementary School quit their jobs or refused to work while a Black child was part of the student body.",
      "\"I would not have gotten through that if it had not been for my teacher,\" Bridges said. \"And as you know, teachers really quit their jobs back then because they didn't want to teach Black kids. This one teacher came from Boston to teach me. She was amazing.\"",
      "Bridges said she was not allowed to go out for recess or eat her lunch in the school cafeteria, which led to her hiding her lunch in Henry's classroom.",
      "\"Like any 6-year-old, you want friends,\" Bridges said. \"And I remembered what kindergarten was like, that all of the kids met in the cafeteria, so I thought I\u2019m never going to make friends if I don\u2019t get to the cafeteria.",
      "\"That prompted me to hide my sandwiches, until the mice got really bad. And she found the sandwiches, and I was in a world of trouble.\"",
      "Bridges, 70, realized how important the bond was with Henry when she matriculated to the second grade in the 1961-62 school year.",
      "\"I have to say that second grade was much worse for me than first because she was my best friend,\" Bridges said. \"I didn't have any friends, and I had gotten so close to her.",
      "\"And I was so excited about going back for second grade, telling her what my summer was like, happy to see her again, and she was gone.\"",
      "More than six decades later, Henry's kindness still resonates with Bridges.",
      "\"I think that each and every one of us, we probably remember one teacher that made an impact in our lives, and she was the one for me,\" she said.",
      "Bridges' story of integration was one of many from the civil rights era, but it has particularly endured. The scene of a tiny first grader being escorted to school by federal marshals also lives on in the form of the iconic Norman Rockwell painting, \"The Problem We All Live With.\"",
      "\"It's that one lone child,\" Bridges said. \"That innocence that we all see when we see that painting. How could that have happened to a 6-year-old? Innocence. And I think that affects each and every one of us when we see it, still to this very day.\"",
      "She also believes the moment can continue to deliver a strong message to the children of today.",
      "\"And for kids, I think that they resonate with it,\" she said. \"Every kid remembers someone not wanting to play with them, not giving them a chance. And I think that resonates with them.\""

      "On Feb. 17, Momoa posted a bunch of photos from the bash that followed the \u201cSaturday Night Live\u201d 50th anniversary special on his Instagram page, including a shot of him and the Oscar winner dancing.",
      "The duo lean back with their arms out, while the \u201cAquaman\u201d star sports a playful scowl and Streep shows a hint of a smile. Fans loved the image of the unlikely pair cutting a rug.",
      "\u201cYou and Meryl is the best!\u201d one person cheered.",
      "\u201cYou and Meryl dancing \u2728\ufe0f,\u201d wrote another fan.",
      "\u201cMomoa and Meryl Streep project...someone make that happen please!\u201d begged someone else.",
      "In addition, Momoa, who also posted a picture of him and Streep smiling at the camera, shared photos from the party with Bill Murray, Chevy Chase, Jerry Seinfeld, Kristen Wiig and Anya Taylor-Joy.",
      "Momoa was featured during an audience Q&A segment of the show, when \u201cSNL\u201d alums Tina Fey and Amy Poehler called up Donna Richards to honor her for her work dressing the guest host each week since 1997.",
      "\u201cShe has seen every celebrity here in their underpants,\u201d Fey joked before asking her for her favorite.",
      "\u201cJason Momoa!\u201d she replied before Fey could even finish asking the question, drawing laughs.",
      "About four minutes later, Momoa, seated in the audience, stood up to ask a question about Donna.",
      "\u201cYeah, that Donny lady \u2014 uh, she like to travel, or, like, what\u2019s her vibe?\u201d he asked, getting laughs from the crowd.",
      "\u201cYou\u2019ll have to ask her,\u201d Fey responded. Richards, incidentally, also appeared in the carousel of photos Momoa posted on Instagram.",
      "Streep was one of the evening\u2019s breakout stars, appearing in her first-ever \u201cSaturday Night Live\u201d sketch. She played Kate McKinnon\u2019s mother in the latest \u201cClose Encounter\u201d sketch, in which they hilariously recall their experiences being abducted by aliens while being interviewed at the Pentagon.",
      "It's somewhat surprising Streep had never been on \"SNL\" before. In a sense, both she and the show came of age and grew at the same time. \"SNL\" premiered in 1975, while she notched the first of her 21 Oscar nominations for 1978's \"The Deer Hunter.\" A three-time Academy Award winner, her most recent nomination came for \"The Post,\" which was released in 2017."

      "Meghan's announcement comes two weeks before the release of her new Netflix show, \"With Love, Meghan,\" which was rescheduled amid the California wildfires.",
      "\"Then Netflix came on, not just as my partner in the show, but as my partner in my business, which was huge. I thought about it, and I've been waiting for a moment to share a name that I had secured in 2022 and this is the moment! And it's called As Ever,\" Meghan\u00a0continued.",
      "She explained that As Ever \"essentially means as it's always been\" and it pays homage to her former lifestyle blog, \"The Tig,\" which she shut down in April 2017, months before she and Prince Harry announced their engagement.",
      "\"If you followed me since 2014 with The TIG, you know I've always loved cooking and crafting and gardening,\" she said. \"This is what I do and I haven't been able to share it with you in the same way for the past few years, but now I can. So as things as starting to trickle out there, I wanted you to hear it from me first.\"",

      "Additionally, she planned to include items like body soap, body oil, cosmetics and pet shampoo in her brand as well.",
      "A month later, in April, Meghan sent samples of her strawberry jam to people like Chrissy Teigen.",
      "\"Of course there will be fruit preserves. I think it's pretty clear by now that jam is my jam,\" she said in the new video."

      "Read on to learn more about the honey in \u201cHang Tight Honey.\u201d",
      "He played football at Samford University",
      "Long before Hodges fell in love with Wilson, he fell hard for his favorite sport \u2014 football.",
      "The Kimberly, Alabama-born athlete discovered his fondness for the game back in elementary school and continued playing the sport through college.",
      "At Samford University, he was a starter for the Bulldogs and showed major potential. In 2018, his standout offensive plays earned him the coveted Walter Payton Award.",
      "He played for the Pittsburgh Steelers",
      "Hodges went pro in 2019. An undrafted free agent, he was signed by the Pittsburgh Steelers and stepped in as quarterback for Mason Rudolph when he suffered an injury.",
      "Hodges remained with the Steelers until the following season. In 2021, he signed a reserve contract with the Los Angeles Rams.",
      "These days, he\u2019s a \u2018cheerleader\u2019",
      "Hodges left the NFL later that same year, then spent some time with the Canadian Football League\u2019s Ottawa Redblacks. In 2022, he retired from professional football altogether. Now, he\u2019s a cheerleader \u2014 of sorts.",
      "While Hodges officially works in real estate now, according to Wilson, he\u2019s so happy about her success in the country music spotlight, he\u2019s genuinely content to cheer her on from the sidelines.",
      "\u201cThankfully, I have found a man that is so happy that he\u2019s with a lady that can do her own thing,\u201d she said in a 2024 interview with Billboard. \u201cHe\u2019s just my cheerleader. He makes it real easy and it\u2019s fun to be able to share this part of my life that I\u2019ve kept ... close to my chest, I guess you could say, for a while.\u201d",
      "He goes by \u2018Duck\u2019",
      "Anyone who\u2019s ever heard Wilson speak about her main man knows she refers to him exclusively by his nickname, Duck, as do many others close to him.\u00a0But why?",
      "The obvious answer might be that he earned the moniker as a result of his love of duck hunting and competitive prowess when it comes to duck calling.",
      "According to a profile published on the Mossy Oak website, Hodges has had a passion for waterfowling since childhood, learning to hunt with his father and brother. At the age of 13, Hodges won the 2009 Junior World Duck Calling Contest, followed by a win at the Alabama State Duck Calling Championship in 2018.",
      "According to Wilson, though, there\u2019s more to the nickname\u2019s story.",
      "\u201cIf you read something online, it probably ain\u2019t right,\u201d she said of Hodges\u2019 nickname during a 2023 visit to \u201cThe Bobby Bones Show.\u201d \u201cHis college football coach was like, \u2018You\u2019re one of the best quarterbacks I\u2019ve ever worked with. And you remind me a lot of one of my favorite quarterbacks I got to work with years ago, and we called him Duck.\u2019 And so, him and the team just kind of started calling him Duck.\u201d",
      "He proposed with a multi-diamond ring",
      "On Feb. 12, 2025, Wilson revealed that she and Hodges were engaged by sharing photos and a video clip on Instagram.",
      "\u201c4x4xU forever \u2764\ufe0f,\u201d she wrote in the caption, referencing her loved-up single of the same name.",
      "Though Wilson didn\u2019t reveal how Hodges proposed, she did show off the spectacular multi-diamond ring he proposed with. In the video clip, she even walks with a limp, harking back to a comment she made last fall.",
      "\u201cI don\u2019t care what shape it is, but I want to be walking with a limp,\u201d she said of her future ring on the \u201cCountry Heat Weekly\u201d podcast.",
      "Even if Hodges hadn\u2019t popped the question when he did, the couple might be engaged by now anyway. Wilson noted to Bunnie XO in a New Year\u2019s Eve chat for CMT posted to Instagram she was prepared to step up and ask him.",
      "\u201cI might have to propose to him,\u201d Wilson said with a laugh after her pal expressed hope for some engagement news soon. \u201cWe waitin\u2019!\u201d",
      "Months before, Wilson joked about the topic to Taste of Country, saying, \u201cI guess I\u2019m going to have to propose to his ass, \u2019cause he ain\u2019t proposed to me.\u201d",
      "He\u2019s the inspiration for some of her songs",
      "Those pre-proposal comments weren\u2019t the only hints Wilson was ready to lock things down with Hodges. The biggest hint of all might just be her 2024 song \u201cCounting Chickens.\u201d",
      "The track, from her fifth studio album, \u201cWhirlwind,\u201d is all about being ready for a proposal (and a wedding, home and family, too), featuring the lyrics, \u201cOh, and I ain\u2019t tryin\u2019 to scare ya/ Make you high tail fly the coop/ But I\u2019m counting on ya, baby/ Hope you\u2019re counting on me too.\u201d",
      "The song ends with a hat tip to who she\u2019s counting on: \u201cOne chicken, two chickens, three chickens/ Oh, shoot, I think that\u2019s a duck.\u201d",
      "According to Wilson, she\u2019s penned other songs about Hodges, too, though many of those aren\u2019t for fans\u2019 ears.",
      "During her chat with Taste of Country, she explained that she sings all her songs for Hodges before anyone else, including the ones \u201cI\u2019ve written for him that nobody else will hear.\u201d",
      "He\u2019s frequently her plus-one",
      "When Wilson opened up about Hodges to Billboard, she mentioned that he \u201ccan\u2019t sing a lick.\u201d But even though he\u2019s no country crooner, he\u2019s found himself at several music-award ceremonies.",
      "Since going public with their relationship, Hodges has become a fixture at many of country music\u2019s biggest events as Wilson\u2019s date."

    "story": [
      "Shortly before \"NBC's Saturday Night\" lit up American TV sets on Oct. 11, 1975, producer Lorne Michaels and seven unknown actors and comedians appeared on \"The Tomorrow Show,\" a late-night talk show with Tom Snyder, to promote their new 90-minute variety series.",
      "\"We've got eight and we're hoping for two for it to really work,\" Michaels deadpanned to Snyder about his new cast. \"So, not all of these people will become stars.\"",
      "Sitting next to him? Chevy Chase, Dan Aykroyd, Jane Curtin, Garrett Morris, Gilda Radner, John Belushi and Laraine Newman. Despite Michaels' tongue-in-cheek prediction, they would, in fact, go on to become not only stars, but legends as the original Not Ready For Prime Time Players on the soon-to-be renamed \"Saturday Night Live.\"",
      "Now, 50 years later, the sketch comedy show has gone on to become the most Emmy-decorated television show in history, receiving countless nominations, awards and accolades. And in 2017, those original cast members were inducted into the Television Academy Hall of Fame.",
      "Defined by its satirical and often censor-defying comedy, along with performances by cutting-edge musicians and artists, \"SNL\" has been a touchstone of American pop culture for five decades. In that time, more than 160 cast members have come and gone, many of them going on to become legends in their own right.",
      "In honor of \"SNL's\" golden anniversary, TODAY.com sat down with past and present cast members to learn what really goes on behind the scenes of the late night show \u2014\u00a0from the anxiety to the exhilaration \u2014 what viewers at home might be surprised to find out, along with their take on the best character breaks and sketches that didn't go quite as planned.",
      "Here's what they revealed.",
      "Answers have been edited for length and clarity.",
      "Laraine Newman (1975 to 1980)",
      "You can only be aware of the audience that's in the studio. There's no sense, at least from my experience, that there's millions of people watching.",
      "It's like everything I was trained to do at The Groundlings where we did sketches and were in place, in costume, doing the sketch, lights out, run off, change, get back down to your spot, lights up and do the next sketch. That's exactly what \"SNL\" is.",
      "What's heroic is that the set designers, they have four days to build sets for sketches that might not even make it to air. The craft of the look of the show, the work that goes into that, the thought that goes into it. The fact that the writers get to collaborate with every aspect \u2014 wardrobe, makeup, everything \u2014 to really optimize their material. I don't think there's any show like that.",
      "Lorne (Michaels) did not want us to laugh, and I never got close to laughing, except when Rodney Dangerfield hosted. We were doing a takeoff on the Woody Allen movie \"Manhattan\" called \"Manhasset.\" (Dangerfield) is saying, \"Tracy, don't go to Manhasset. I tell ya, it's rough. I got a waterbed and there was a guy at the bottom of it.\"",
      "Now, I'd heard that joke in read-through and the rehearsal and it still got me. If you watch it, you can't tell. But I am dying. It is everything I could do not to laugh.",
      "Nora Dunn (1985 to 1990)",
      "There's something about the camera coming on \u2014 you come to life. Because right before that, you're not. It's like your dead, and you're revived and it's a \"do-or-die\" situation. And you go, \"Well, I got here.\" I always tell myself, \"You got here. There's a reason that you are here.\"",
      "I don't think you do it. I think the other side does it. The lights do it. They go, \"5, 4, 3, 2, 1 ... boom!\" It just happens. You can't plan it.",
      "When you're watching a sketch, right behind that wall, someone's taking their clothes off and putting on a costume and having a wig grabbed off their head and put something else on it. You have to make those quick changes.",
      "You might be on with a guest star, the host, and you're like, \"Gotta get my clothes off!\" You're not naked, but next to naked. Every time there's a sketch on \"Saturday Night Live,\" there's all kinds of stuff going on in the background.",
      "We were not supposed to use cue cards, but we all did. But Lorne was like (imitating Michaels), \"They're there if you need them. That's why they're not there, because you don't know your lines.\"",
      "So, Jon (Lovitz) and I had to do a sketch with Charlton Heston. He needed glasses, but he said he didn't. He didn't wear glasses, so they had to make his cue cards huge. So, we had huge stacks of cue cards and we were doing an Egyptian scene. We're dressed up as a couple that's having pyramids built, and the cue card guy lost control of the cards. They spread all over the floor. Lorne was standing 15 feet away and he was furious. We just beelined away from Lorne because he was going to say (imitating Michaels), \"Well, someone didn't learn their lines.\" He was not happy with us.",
      "Kevin Nealon (1986 to 1995)",
      "It's unlike anything I've ever experienced before. It's like sitting in a rollercoaster car, right at the beginning, just anticipating and waiting for it all to happen. And it was a rollercoaster, there were ups and downs, it was crazy.",
      "I remember before I did my first sketch, it was \"Mr. Subliminal,\" and right before, Lorne Michaels comes up to me, puts his hand on my shoulder, and he said, \"Are you sure this is what you want?\" It was funny and it relaxed me a little bit.",
      "But I remember the excitement of the first show. I think The Pretenders were on, and I remember finishing a sketch, then running back to get made up and I'm hearing the band playing and I'm thinking, \"Oh my God,\" and I got filled with such energy and excitement that, \"This is it, man, this is live, this is 'Saturday Night Live.'\"",
      "I think the audience doesn't realize how small the studio is when they get there. And I don't think they realize that we're scrambling to figure out what sketches to cut from rehearsal, how to improve a sketch and what didn't work and what you're surprised that did work.",
      "But, also, I think a lot of times they don't realize how frightened we are about going out there.",
      "(Breaking character) was very rare for me and for a lot of people on our cast because, at the time, Lorne thought of that as being very \"hacky.\" Also, it was a disservice to the writer. If you put all this labor into writing a sketch and then people are breaking on it, it's like, \"Well, there goes that sketch.\"",
      "I did break with Chevy Chase on \"Weekend Update\" once, but that was one of the only times I ever broke in nine years.",
      "Molly Shannon (1995 to 2001)",
      "It's exhilaration. When I hosted, for example, right before you go on, you're in the back and you're with a stage manager and they're like, \"OK ... 5, 4, 3, 2, 1 ...\" So, you're like, \"Ugh (clutches her stomach).\"",
      "I got advice when I hosted. Steve Higgins, a wonderful producer on the show was like, \"Take your time. You don't have to run out there. It's OK.\" So, I thought that was good advice. Set yourself on stage, take a deep breath. But, definitely, there's nerves. I would say, an excited, kind of nervous feeling.",
      "I remember years ago, when I did the show, we would all have dinner after the rehearsals, before the live show. And I remember, because we had the whole week of writing comedy sketches, rehearsing them at dinner, I felt like, \"Ugh, this is time to just relax before the big comedy show live at 11:30 p.m.\"",
      "But people would still be doing comedy bits at dinner, and I remember thinking I just wanted to talk seriously and not have anybody joke around, like, have a quiet dinner before we have to go do a show. I was like, \"No comedy bits at dinner, like, please, let's just eat.\"",
      "Will Ferrell and I were characters who had recently lost 100 pounds, and we were very excited about it. We did it center stage and Will Ferrell and I always had a deal that, if you bombed, if you were tanking, and people weren't laughing, you would still have to commit as an actor, pour your heart into it even more.",
      "While we're performing it, there were crickets, no laughter at all. I remember during the scene, looking at Will, we were like (grimace), but we just kept performing it like the greatest dramatic actors, and we thought it was so funny. So, it entertained us that you had to bomb with grace and dignity, to just jump into bombing and be OK with it. Scoring and bombing were on equal planes \u2014 you had to respect both.",
      "Cheri Oteri (1995 to 2000)",
      "I would always be in the bathroom. That's how fearful I was. I was always very nervous. It's sheer fear and excitement. But because you only get a chance to do it once, it's more fear for me. But I've always been like that, even when I did theater. I was always in the bathroom until it was like, \"10, 9, 8 ...\"",
      "We have a two-hour draft show at 8 o'clock, then a half hour is cut out of that and you're just ... nothing's ever settled until 11:30 p.m. You're working to get your sketches in during the week and you don't know if they're going to get in. And if they do get in, they could always be cut between dress and air.",
      "Nothing is guaranteed. So that's kind of hard. I always say it's a show that you audition for every week, that you already got.",
      "There was one time I broke and it was doing \"Morning Latte.\" It was with Jerry Seinfeld. In this sketch, Will (Ferrell) goes like this (makes hitting motion) with a book and it hits me in the head. That book hit me so hard in the head \u2014 but it didn't hurt. It just clocked. And because of the book being a hardcover, the sound just reverberated and the audience went, \"Ooohhh.\"",
      "I went back and I saw stars. I started laughing and I couldn't stop. Will had to say my lines. Tears are coming down, I'm laughing so much. I've never not been able to recover from something. But because I saw stars, I couldn't stop laughing.",
      "But it was dress, so on air, I knew it was coming. But that was the one and only time I broke.",
      "Ana Gasteyer (1996 to 2002)",
      "Those last 15 seconds right before you go live, I think it's largely fear. It's not fear, necessarily, about failing or anything like that, but it's all so last-minute that it's just your brain synthesizing what has inevitably changed in your sketch moments before you've started and the breakneck pace of it because it really is live.",
      "What people don't understand \u2014\u00a0it's live, and it's written that week, that minute, that day. We may have written a sketch on Tuesday night, but it got rewritten on Thursday. It got rewritten again on Friday and then rewritten before your dress.",
      "You may have just come off another experience, may have had a failed quick change or stressed moment because commercial breaks are only two minutes. They might feel long when you're at home, but two minutes is really, really, really fast to have to change an entire outfit and wig. So, what's happening in those 15 seconds is kind of rooting yourself in the space of what you're going to do.",
      "You know, when you're coming back from a commercial and you're at home and you're like, \"Gosh, why is this taking so long? Why am I looking at this picture of Ariana Grande for so incredibly long?\"",
      "That's because, wildly, some set has not been assembled. That's what those bumper (photo) cards are for, to buy a little bit of time on the edges of your returns.",
      "There was a sketch we did, a Sally Jessy Raphael with Christina Ricci. She had never done live television before, so she was really spooked and kind of addled, and maybe had a little champagne. There was a bad teen sketch and I was Sally Jessy, there was a fist fight.",
      "It looked bad at dress. Lorne, in the notes, between dress and air, was like, \u201cLet\u2019s work on that punch.\u201d We didn\u2019t have a fight coordinator, it was very unrehearsed and the depth perception was off. We got to air and (Christina) was so focused, and that fist hit my nose in such a dramatic, hilarious, painful ... I mean, in the moment I remember my Sally Jessy red signature frames went flying up off my face and landed in, like, slow motion. It was insane. It was like a full-face TKO. I remember just being like, \u201cI\u2019ve got to maintain the impression,\u201d because I was so nervous about my Sally Jessy impression the whole time.",
      "Rachel Dratch (1999 to 2006)",
      "It's kind of a mix. Definite excitement, nerves ... fear is a factor. Doing theater before \"SNL,\" the fear is kind of what drives you. So, the fear is good actually. But, overall, excitement.",
      "This is kind of common sense, but you don't think of it when you're watching at home: That in between when you're watching a commercial, all the madness is happening because it's live. Someone's changing costume, hair, someone can go from being a baby to an old man in that commercial. There's a team of people working \u2014\u00a0every person has their own hair, makeup and wardrobe person. So, there's this huge transformation taking place or the sets are being moved.",
      "A sketch that went wrong in the best way possible was the \"Debbie Downer at Disney World,\" where we started laughing. That's the one everyone seems to remember so well. People tell me they watch when they're sad to cheer them up and that makes me so happy.",
      "But, yes, of course, we try not to laugh on the show. But that one, knowing the camera was coming in every time after I was saying this total bummer fact, and trying to keep it together, it just shows that this show is live. If there's any doubt, things can go wrong. And sometimes it's very funny when they do.",
      "Amy Poehler (2001 to 2008)",
      "Performing on \"SNL\" feels like working in a comedy emergency room. So you are rushing around sometimes, sometimes things are slow. You are around trained professionals, you have high stakes and it feels often very life or death.",
      "There's so many surprising things about \"SNL\" that people wouldn't realize. It's such a unique unicorn of a show and the way it's put together. I think a lot of people don't realize how tired everyone is all the time, especially during read through, because people have stayed up all night and then go in and have to perform.",
      "I think people also don't realize how most of your time at \"SNL\" is wondering when your food is going to get there. That's about 75% of your brain space, \"When is my food going to come?\" So, I think a lot of people are thinking that when (viewers) are thinking that they're thinking about sketches.",
      "My first year on \"SNL,\" the great John Goodman hosted and was so nice to me, even though I was a lone freshman. I remember I did a sketch with Chris Kattan and I got flipped into a dumpster \u2014 on purpose. I think I kind of passed out for a second and then woke up and I remember thinking, \"I wonder if anyone's ever passed out on 'SNL'?'\" Then I thought, \"How long have I been in this dumpster?\" So, that was fun. That was a good entry into what was a wild ride.",
      "Mikey Day (2013 to Present)",
      "It's so week-to-week. That's how the show works. You could have a week when you're in everything, you could have a week where you have three lines and one thing. It all depends. So, I feel like the emotions vary depending on that week.",
      "However, one constant is that after, \"Live from New York, it's Saturday Night,\" and the band starts playing \u2014 that's when the adrenaline (starts) and I'm always reminded, \"Oh wow, it's 'SNL,'\" and I always get kind of a little high off that.",
      "There's so many heroes on that show. The crew, itself, is, like, Tetris because Studio 8H isn't that big. So, they're constantly moving and all the equipment feels like it's from the '70s. This stuff has that old-school feel in terms of its size and bulk, and moving it to and fro on Saturday is pretty crazy. But they make it work somehow.",
      "Also, the filmed pieces, they build those sets in a day \u2014 a literal day \u2014 and sometimes there's three films being shot in one week, which is wild.",
      "Most recently, it was \"Beavis and Butt-Head\" with Ryan Gosling. It was a lot of fun. Heidi (Gardner) broke, Ryan and I were laughing, giggling like two schoolboys.",
      "But I remember the first time I laughed and it was in an unpredictable sketch called \"Dog Head Man.\" It's like geneticists who have created Dog Head Man. It was so dumb. At dress they were feeding the dog some treat or something and the dog didn't really like it. We're like, \"Can we just give it bread?\" And then it just went to town on this bread and I started laughing because Sam Rockwell and I were talking about such heavy stuff, and you just see the dog is so happy, going to town on human food.",
      "Dog Head Man stands out as one that I remember as the first time I kind of lost it. It wasn't too bad, but when you start to go, you're like, \"Oh no, I haven't done this before, am I going to get in trouble?\"",
      "Heidi Gardner (2017 to present)",
      "It's all of those things, actually. But I always just remind myself to have fun, take a few deep breaths. I'm going to do my job, the words are going to come out. That's always the biggest fear: Am I just going to stop knowing how to read cue cards? But it happens.",
      "I had never seen the show as a fan \u2014 I was a fan, but I had never gone to it. I really didn't understand that it was all in the same studio. I thought \"Weekend Update\" was in a separate room, that you walked down the hall to \"Weekend Update,\" then you walk to a sketch, but it's all in the studio. So, those two-minute commercial breaks really are like just complete chaos. The most organized chaos in the world. And it's really its own art form to watch the crew navigate that.",
      "Well, obviously, \"Beavis and Butt-Head,\" but there was one last season I did with Kristen Wiig, where we were \"Mad Men\" type secretaries, and she was supposed to fall through a desk, like sit on a desk and it breaks away. And I was supposed to fall through a wall and both of us just didn't quite have the strength to break either one.",
      "So, she sat on the desk and it didn't break and then she had to hop down. I went into the wall and it didn't break. So it was very funny to try and navigate that live.",
      "Chloe Fineman (2019 to Present)",
      "Performing on \"SNL\" is truly a fever dream. After so many shows, I'm like, \"Wait, what? I was with who? And I kissed so and so?\" Or, \"I was on stage with Ariana Grande?\" It really runs the gamut. It's very surreal, I'd say.",
      "I think viewers at home would be surprised to learn about the machine that happens during the live show. Anytime I've had friends and family come, it's amazing to watch. The sets are running over here and we're running here and there's heels and this thing's getting taken apart and put together. It happens like clockwork and, really, so much can go wrong. For some reason, it doesn't and it's magic. To me, that's almost as entertaining as the show.",
      "We did a \"Cast Away\" sketch with Jason Momoa, and he was supposed to lift me up and we were supposed to pretend to, like, have our bodies move, but he's so much bigger than me and I'm so short and little, that I really was like, \"Woo!\" He really thrusted me in a way that took my breath away. Honestly, that's a favorite."

    "published": "Sun, 16 Feb 2025 19:55:52 GMT",
    "summary": "Anthony Mackie and Mark Waid, the comic book writer who introduced the idea of the first Black Captain America, discuss the controversy surround the superhero.",
    "story": [
      "Anthony Mackie taking on the role of Captain America, a fictional comic book character initially portrayed as a white man with blond hair and blue eyes, isn\u2019t groundbreaking to comic books fans.",
      "The idea of a Black man as the patriotic superhero was introduced in 1998 by writer Mark Waid in the comic book \u201cCaptain America: Sentinel of Liberty,\u201d where, according to Waid, Sam Wilson first \u201cpicked up the costume and took on the identity of Captain America.\u201d",
      "Over two decades after Sam Wilson became Cap in the comics, a Black Captain America in the movie adaptations has turned into a contentious topic.",
      "The issue of a Black Captain America in the Marvel Cinematic Universe first arose after Chris Evans, who portrayed Cap on-screen for eight years, passed the mantle on to Mackie\u2019s Falcon in 2019\u2019s \u201cAvengers: Endgame.\u201d Fans were upset with Evans\u2019 departure and some felt Mackie wasn\u2019t capable of taking on the superpowered role.",
      "Though some eventually warmed up to the idea after seeing him in the 2021 critically acclaimed Disney+ series, \u201cFalcon and the Winter Soldier,\u201d where Mackie\u2019s Falcon grapples with the complicated notion of what it means for a Black man to be Captain America, the vitriol against actor ramped back up during his press run for \u201cCaptain America: Brave New World.\u201d",
      "During a Q&A in January, fans threatened to boycott the film and Mackie because of his comments on what he thinks Captain America represents that some deemed unpatriotic.",
      "\u201cCaptain America represents a lot of different things, and I don\u2019t think the term \u2018America\u2019 should be one of those representations. It\u2019s about a man who keeps his word and who has honor, dignity, and integrity. Someone who is trustworthy and dependable. This is like an aspect of a dream coming true,\u201d the actor said at the time.",
      "Following the backlash, Mackie has since clarified his comments online and in interviews, saying he\u2019s a \u201cproud American,\u201d and that Captain America is \u201cimportant for kids of all races\u201d so they can have someone to look up to regardless of their race.",
      "Speaking to TODAY.com about some fans\u2019 mixed reaction following the first teaser of him as Cap, Mackie, 46, says he wasn\u2019t \u201caware\u201d that a Black Captain America had become so controversial.",
      "\u201cI think that\u2019s funny, because we all call ourselves comic book fans, right? We all call ourselves comic book nerds, right? So if the comic book says, Sam Wilson becomes Captain America, then Sam Wilson becomes Captain America,\u201d Mackie says pragmatically.",
      "Though Mackie says he \u201cdidn\u2019t have any hesitations\u201d taking on the role in the MCU, Waid \u2014 who introduced the idea of Falcon becoming the first Black Captain America in the comics \u2014 admits there was \u201ca little bit of resistance\u201d from Marvel when he pitched it in the '90s.",
      "\u201cNot because anybody disbelieved the message,\u201d Waid, 62, tells TODAY.com. \u201cNot because anybody at Marvel was on the wrong side of history here, but just because when you\u2019re dealing with a corporate character like that it\u2019s going to go through many creators hands over his 80 years of existence.\u201d",
      "We all call ourselves comic book fans, right? We all call ourselves comic book nerds, right? So if the comic book says, Sam Wilson becomes Captain America, then Sam Wilson becomes Captain America.\u201d",
      "Anthony mackie",
      "Captain America was first created in 1941 during World War II. Since then, an array of people have held the role in the comics, including women and people of color, like Sam Wilson.",
      "Waid explains that Marvel wanted him to be careful and not\u00a0\u201ctoo extreme\u201d since that could potentially \u201calienate\u201d a huge part of their audience. \u201cBecause that\u2019s where the money comes from,\u201d he explains.",
      "But Waid\u2019s goal wasn\u2019t just to make sure the comic\u2019s core readers were satisfied, it was also to authentically portray the Black experience. To do this, the comic book writer says he spoke to his real-life Black friends who made him see a different perspective of America, which included sentiments of \u201cracial hatred\u201d and \u201cbigotry.\u201d",
      "\u201c\u2018There is more of this going on than you realize \u2026 so just be mindful of that as you go into the story,\u2019\u201d he recalls them saying.",
      "Within Marvel, Waid says his story of Falcon taking on the mantle of Captain America \u201cwas very well received.\u201d But externally, he says there was \u201ca little bit of pushback\u201d from fandom and readers, with some saying, \u2018\u2018Well, this is not Captain America. I don\u2019t know what you\u2019re trying to say.\u201d",
      "Looking back, Waid says the pushback by fans wasn\u2019t so severe that he recalls \u201creceiving any hate mail\u201d about it. But he suspects that if he had done this story today, \u201cpeople would be screaming DEI at us at the top of their lungs without knowing what they\u2019re talking about.\u201d",
      "Waid notes that over the last 10 to 15 years, \u201cThere\u2019s been a lot more trolling, a lot more blow back. A lot of organized fandom full of angry white guys who are not happy that they are being quote, unquote, eclipsed by people of color, which is bulls--t.\u201d",
      "If we had done this story today, people would be screaming DEI at us at the top of their lungs without knowing what they\u2019re talking about.\u201d",
      "Mark Waid, writer of \u00a0\u201cCaptain America: Sentinel of Liberty\u201d",
      "The tenured comic book writer says it comes as no surprise that some fans are upset and even threatening to boycott Marvel\u2019s TV shows and the movies, because \u201cthese are the same people who were up in arms about the comics.\u201d",
      "\u201cLuckily, they have been a small enough part of the audience where we didn\u2019t have to take them into account,\u201d he explains. \u201cIt\u2019s not like we lost tons of sales because these trolls were out there being actively, performatively angry about the replacement of Captain America by a Black man in a comic book. They weren\u2019t buying the comics anyway. They were just looking for something to be mad about.\u201d",
      "Waid\u2019s introduction of Sam Wilson (Falcon) as Captain America in the comic \u201cCaptain America: Sentinel of Liberty #9\u201d unfolds in a time of \u201cgreat racial divide\u201d in America.",
      "Steve Rogers (Captain America) is trying to disassociate himself from white supremacists (Sons of Serpents) who are co-opting his name and image because they believe that Cap represents their cause, Waid explains.",
      "\u201c\u2018He\u2019s a blonde white guy with a strong jaw. He\u2019s showing you that this is what America should be,\u2019\u201d he says of their sentiments toward Rogers \u2014 who, during his fight to stop them, appears to get killed. It\u2019s at this juncture that \u201cSam Wilson realizes that someone has to pick up the mantle, someone has to pick up the shield, and someone has to fight to clear the name of Captain America.\u201d",
      "While the film is not exactly like the comics, there are similarities. Directed by Julius Onah, the film follows Falcon\u2019s fight to uncover a villainous plot against President Thaddeus Ross (Harrison Ford) while also helping to exonerate Isaiah Bradley (Carl Lumbly) \u2014 a war vet who is turned into a Super Soldier after undergoing human testings by the government \u2014 who was accused of being involved. Some fans have argued that Bradley is the first Black Captain America since he took the Super Solider serum like Cap. Mackie says Sam's sense of integrity and dedication to justice is what he leans into and tries to embody with his titular role.",
      "\u201cOne thing that I\u2019ve always wanted to portray with Sam, and make the focal point of that conversation, is the fact that he\u2019s the best part of all of us,\u201d Mackie tells TODAY.com. \u201cSam didn\u2019t take the (Super Soldier) serum. Sam isn\u2019t a Super Soldier. He\u2019s just a good human being, and I think that\u2019s why we all kind of are endeared to him and kind of appreciate him, because we can see the best of us in him.\u201d",
      "One thing that I\u2019ve always wanted to portray with Sam, and make the focal point of that conversation, is the fact that he\u2019s the best part of all of us.\"",
      "Anthony Mackie",
      "Since its first publication in March 1941, Waid says Captain America has had a simple, altruistic purpose: he represented the American dream and showed that it was attainable. But he says Cap\u2019s mission has \u201cchanged\u201d over the years.",
      "\u201cAmerica was the land of opportunity,\u201d Waid tells TODAY.com. \u201cAnd clearly it has not always been that way for some people \u2026 And I think that Captain America today stands for equality. He stands for making sure that anyone in this country has an opportunity at bettering themselves and has an opportunity to have the best life possible \u2014 if they\u2019re willing to put the work into it.\u201d",
      "And Anthony Mackie has put that work in with his over two decades in Hollywood and 10 years playing Sam Wilson. Still, even with his tenure, there will still be those who take issue with there being a Black Captain America.",
      "Mackie even gave a nod to the pressure of taking on Cap\u2019s mantle in the film. In an exchange with President Ross following the attack on his life, Mackie\u2019s Sam tells the president that he overwhelmingly understands what he\u2019s going through.",
      "\u201cI know what it\u2019s like to feel you have something to prove,\u201d he says.",
      "Later in the film, Mackie is seen grappling with his past decision to reject the Super Soldier serum and also the pressure that he\u2019s under if he fails his mission.",
      "\u201cIf I\u2019m not on point, I let everyone who wants a seat at that table down,\u201d he says to his First Lieutenant Joaquin Torres (Danny Ramirez), who takes on Sam's former mantle of Falcon. \u201cThat\u2019s pressure. It makes you feel that you\u2019re not enough.\u201d",
      "The \"Captain America\" comic book writer says there\u2019s always been room\u00a0for the character to change, evolve and represent something more inclusive.",
      "\u201cCaptain America can be an Asian man. Captain America can be a woman. Captain America could be anyone who stands for the ideals that Captain America stands for,\u201d Waid explains, noting that he hopes Cap\u2019s fight eventually \u201cgets easier.\u201d",
      "\u201cAs long as they\u2019re an American at heart and fight for the American way \u2026 the way we wish truly was the dream as opposed to what racism and bigotry has sort of poisoned that well.\u201d",
      "Mackie agrees, noting that his Captain America leads with two important things: \u201cCompassion and empathy.\u201d",
      "\u201cI feel like today, we could all use a little compassion and empathy,\u201d he adds.",

      "Season 3 of the Emmy-winning HBO series will look sparkling new in a lot of ways \u2014 from its new set of characters to its Thailand location. But not everyone will be unfamiliar, particularly if you\u2019ve watched Season 1.",
      "One of the first season\u2019s most sympathetic characters, Belinda's storyline wrapped in a bittersweet way. Not only is she returning \u2014 she\u2019s also a guest at the resort, rather than an employee, this season.",
      "Below, we'll go over who Belinda is and what we should know about her before Season 3 premieres.",
      "What happens to Belinda in Season 1 of \u2018The White Lotus\u2019?",
      "Belinda Lindsey manages the resort spa at the White Lotus resort in Maui, Hawaii, and so has a hospitality spirit that keeps her privileged, often spoiled guests from getting upset.",
      "She bonds with guest Tanya McQuoid (Jennifer Coolidge) primarily, revealing that she\u2019s low-key, empathetic and even a bit spiritual.",
      "Afterward, she and Tanya have a few conversations about opening a wellness business together (funded largely by Tanya). Alas, Tanya\u2019s attention soon turns to her new boyfriend, local sport fisherman Greg. She blows off a dinner with Belinda \u2014 and chooses to invest herself, and her money, in his plans.",
      "Shattered when Tanya abandons their shared dream, Belinda is buoyed slightly when the guest hands her an envelope stuffed with cash. It\u2019s not what she hoped for, but it\u2019s still better than nothing.",
      "What\u2019s Belinda\u2019s storyline in Season 3?",
      "To be determined. According to what Rothwell told Entertainment Weekly, Tanya is still an employee of The White Lotus but is \u201cin Thailand doing sort of an exchange program to learn more about the wellness programs that the Thailand White Lotus offers.\u201d",
      "In that capacity, Tanya is both employee and guest, but she\u2019ll get to take classes while she\u2019s there and enjoy the hotel\u2019s amenities.",
      "As a \u201cdownstairs\u201d employee hanging out with the \u201cupstairs\u201d folks, she\u2019ll likely empathize with the hotel workers, while also using her skills and charm to make friends with some of the guests.",
      "Expect class struggle between the haves and have-nots as she wanders the resort alongside a clutch of longtime friends vacationing together, a curious couple and two parents traveling with their three grown kids. It\u2019s a combination that echoes Season 1 of the series.",
      "The trailer does reveal that a robbery takes place and Belinda is shown urging someone to call the police. When someone quips, \u201cGo big or go home\u201d in the trailer, she responds knowingly, \u201c\u2026 in a g\u2014damn body bag.\u201d",
      "But as for her dreams \u2014 we think Belinda still has that wellness center dream. All she really needs from this vacation may be an angel investor!",
      "But we won\u2019t really know where she\u2019s going until after the show premieres.",
      "What has Natasha Rothwell said about returning?",
      "Belinda is still recovering from Tanya\u2019s (well-paid) ghosting, Rothwell told Entertainment Weekly \u201cShe was so devastated by Tanya taking what little hope she had and shattering it,\u201d says Rothwell.",

      "It\u2019s not clear what caused the crash, but at the time wind gusts reached close to 40 mph amid blowing snow and minus 2 degrees wind chill. While lake-effect snow impacted the area earlier in the day, no snow was reported on radars at the time of the accident.",
      "From last Thursday to Sunday, Toronto Pearson saw extreme conditions with two separate snowstorms and saw more than 20 inches of accumulated snow, Deborah Flint, the president and CEO of Toronto Pearson Airport, said Tuesday. She called that amount \"not typical\" and more than received all of last winter.",
      "Flint said teams from Delta and Mitsubishi, the maker of the CRJ-900 aircraft, were on site along with investigators from Canada\u2019s Transportation Safety Board and the U.S. Federal Aviation Administration.",

      "That would be more than the number of Israeli hostages that have been released every Saturday since the ceasefire was agreed on Jan. 19.

      "Israeli forces will remain in five strategic locations in southern Lebanon near the border after Tuesday\u2019s deadline for their full withdrawal, an Israeli official said Monday.",
      "The official spoke on condition of anonymity in line with regulations.",
      "Lebanon\u2019s government has opposed any further delay in the Israeli pullout under the ceasefire agreement that ended fighting with the Hezbollah militant group. There was no immediate comment from Lebanese or Hezbollah officials. Earlier on Monday, an Israeli strike in Lebanon killed a senior Hamas leader.",
      "The news came as Israelis were marking the 500th day since Hamas\u2019 Oct. 7, 2023, attack, which ignited the war in the Gaza Strip and rippled across the region, eventually setting off a full-blown war between Israel and Hezbollah.",
      "The war in Gaza was paused last month\u00a0when a fragile ceasefire took hold. The first phase of the truce is set to end in early March, and it\u2019s unclear whether it will be extended to allow the release of dozens more hostages, or if Israel will renew its military offensive against Hamas with U.S. support.",
      "Separately, an anti-settlement watchdog said Monday that Israel has issued a tender for the construction of nearly 1,000\u00a0additional settler homes\u00a0in the occupied West Bank.",
      "Peace Now says the development of 974 new housing units would allow the population of the Efrat settlement to expand by 40% and further block the development of the nearby Palestinian city of Bethlehem. Hagit Ofran, who leads the group\u2019s settlement monitoring, said construction can begin after the contracting process and issuing of permits, which could take another year at least.",
      "There was no immediate comment from the Israeli government.",
      "Israel captured the West Bank, along with the Gaza Strip and east Jerusalem, in the 1967 Mideast war. The Palestinians want all three territories for their future state and view the settlements as a major obstacle to peace, a position with wide international support.",
      "Settlement expansion",
      "President Donald Trump lent\u00a0unprecedented support to the settlements\u00a0during his previous term. Israel has also steadily expanded settlements during Democratic administrations, which were more critical but rarely took any action to curb them.",
      "Israel has built well over 100 settlements across the West Bank, ranging from hilltop outposts to fully developed suburban communities, with apartment blocks, malls and parks.",
      "Over 500,000 settlers live in the occupied West Bank, which is home to some 3 million Palestinians. The settlers have Israeli citizenship, while Palestinians live under military rule with the Western-backed Palestinian Authority administering population centers.",
      "The Israeli government views the West Bank as the historical and biblical heartland of the Jewish people and is opposed to Palestinian statehood, while human rights groups have accused Israel of\u00a0discrimination against and oppression of\u00a0Palestinians in the West Bank.",
      "Peace Now, which favors a negotiated two-state solution to the conflict, accused Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu\u2019s government of pressing ahead with settlement construction while dozens of hostages captured in Hamas\u2019 Oct. 7, 2023, attack languish in captivity in the Gaza Strip.",

He added that hostages don\u2019t count days while in captivity, they count minutes and seconds.",
      "Hamas is set to continue the gradual release of 33 hostages during the current phase of the truce in exchange for hundreds of Palestinian prisoners. Israeli forces have pulled back from most parts of Gaza and allowed a surge of humanitarian aid.",
      "But the two sides have yet to negotiate the second phase, in which Hamas would release more than 70 remaining hostages \u2014 around half of whom are believed to be dead \u2014 in exchange for more Palestinian prisoners, a full Israeli withdrawal and a lasting ceasefire.",
      "Netanyahu and the Trump administration have given conflicting signals over whether they want to continue the ceasefire or renew the war. Both they say are committed to the eradication of Hamas and the return of all the hostages, but those goals are widely seen as incompatible.",
      "Hamas-led militants killed some 1,200 people, mostly civilians, in the Oct. 7, 2023, attack and abducted around 250. More than half of the hostages have been returned in agreements with Hamas or other deals, while just eight have been rescued in military operations.",
      "The militant group, though weakened,\u00a0remains in full control of the territory. Hamas has said it is willing to relinquish power to other Palestinians but will not accept any occupying force.",
      "Israel\u2019s air and ground war has killed over 48,000 Palestinians, more than half of them women and children, according to Gaza\u2019s Health Ministry, which does not say how many were combatants. The war destroyed vast areas of Gaza and at its height had displaced around 90% of the population of 2.3 million.",
      "Trump has called for Gaza\u2019s population to be permanently relocated to other countries and for the United States to take ownership of the territory and rebuild it for others. Israel has welcomed the plan, while Palestinians and Arab nations\u00a0have universally rejected the idea.",
      "Rights groups and experts say the proposal, if implemented,\u00a0would likely violate international law.",
      "The proposal has meanwhile cast further doubt over the future of the ceasefire. Hamas may be unwilling to release the remaining captives \u2014 its only bargaining chips \u2014 it if believes Israel is going to resume the war with the goal of expelling the Palestinian population.",

      "Branding those reports \"fake news,\" Netanyahu's office said in a statement there had been \"no American pressure to send a delegation to negotiate Phase 2.\"",
      "Still, plans for further negotiations come after Netanyahu said Sunday following a visit from Secretary of State Marco Rubio that Israel and the Trump administration had formed a \"joint strategy\" to ensure that the \"gates of hell will open\" if Hamas does not eventually release all of the hostages who remain held captive in Gaza \u2014 a key requirement of the current ceasefire deal.",
      "He also said Israel was \"committed\" to Trump's widely condemned plan to take over Gaza, where tens of thousands of people have been killed and much of the infrastructure destroyed during Israel's offensive in the enclave.",
      "That campaign began after around 1,200 people were killed in the Hamas-led Oct. 7, 2023, terror attacks, with 251 people taken hostage into Gaza in an assault that marked a major escalation in a decadeslong conflict.",
      "Since then, more than 48,000 people have been killed in Gaza, according to local health officials, though researchers estimate the death toll could be significantly higher. At least 60% of the territory\u2019s infrastructure, including schools and hospitals, has been destroyed, according to estimates from the United Nations.",
      "Hailing Trump's proposal to take over Gaza as a \"revolutionary vision,\" Netanyahu said the U.S. and Israel had also come up with a \"joint strategy\" to see it through and bring about a \"completely different Gaza.\"",
      "In a meeting Sunday with a U.S. Senate delegation led by Sen. Lindsey Graham, R-S.C., Israeli Defense Minister Israel Katz further said he believed Trump's plan for Gaza was \"the only one that can guarantee security for the residents of the south and the state of Israel, in light of the lessons learned from the events of Oct. 7.\"",

      "That came as concerns grew over the expansion of Israeli settlements in the occupied West Bank.",
      "Anti-settlement watchdog group Peace Now said in a news release Sunday that Israel had issued a tender for the construction of nearly 1,000 additional settler housing units that could significantly expand the population of the Efrat settlement in the territory.",
      "The organization warned that such a development would also risk further blocking the development of the nearby Palestinian city of Bethlehem.",
      "Israel has occupied the West Bank since the 1967 Middle East war, building and expanding Jewish settlements there that are widely considered illegal by the international community, a charge Israel rejects.",

      "\u201cWe have been managing an extremely high and complex prison population for more than a year, putting considerable pressure on all those living and working in our establishments,\u201d a Scottish Prison Service spokesperson told NBC News on Tuesday via email, after the first of almost 400 prisoners were released.",
      "Scotland\u2019s prisons housed almost 8,000 prisoners every day in 2024 \u2014 a 6% increase on the previous year, according to its government statistics.",
      "\u201cIn line with trends seen elsewhere in the U.K., Scotland\u2019s prison population has significantly grown in recent years and, consequently, this rise has impacted prisons and the wider justice system,\u201d a Scottish government spokesperson told NBC News on Tuesday.",
      "Scotland is part of the United Kingdom but, like Wales and Northern Ireland, has its own semi-autonomous government with broad powers over areas including health care, education and law, meaning its government can unilaterally decide to free the prisoners without seeking the consent of the British Parliament in London.",

      "In response, the U.K. government last year launched a major review over its sentencing laws and allowed judges to sentence offenders to house arrest. It also freed more than 1,700 prisoners across England and Wales in September.",
      "Under emergency legislation passed last November, Scottish inmates sentenced to less than four years are eligible for early release after serving 40% of their term, unless convicted of domestic abuse or sexual offenses.",

      "\u201cWhile not a complete solution, this Act will bring sustained reduction to prisoner numbers so the prison estate can continue to function effectively,\u201d Scottish Justice Secretary Angela Constance stated in a press release in January.",

      "In response, the Scottish Police Service has urged victims to sign up for a joint scheme with Victim Support Scotland, a charity that provides support to those affected by crime, so that they will be notified if their offender\u2019s release date changes.",
      "The charity told NBC news in a statement Tuesday that there had been \u201cno improvements\u201d to the main mechanism intended to inform victims since the new legislation was passed.",

      "The successful candidates will be required to research tasks related to near-Earth asteroid monitoring and early warning systems, according to the job description for the three positions, among 16 posted last week by the State Administration of Science, Technology and Industry for National Defense (SASTIND), which oversees the country\u2019s space activities.",
      "Applicants must be younger than 35 and \u201cmaintain a firm political stance\u201d in line with the ruling Chinese Communist Party and its leader, Xi Jinping, it said.",
      "They are also required to have a background in astrophysics, Earth and space exploration technology, astronomy, optical engineering, or aerospace science and technology, with a master\u2019s degree or higher.",
      "SASTIND did not immediately respond to a faxed request for comment Tuesday.",

      "Last week, NASA said there was a 2.3% chance that the asteroid would collide with Earth in 2032, up from 1.2% in late January.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s a small chance, but it\u2019s still not insignificant, that it could collide with the Earth, and if it does, then it could create a huge amount of damage,\u201d said Quentin Parker, director of the Laboratory for Space Research at the University of Hong Kong.",
      "But 2032 is far enough away, he said, that the Chinese program and similar ones in the United States and other countries can work together to prevent that from happening.",
      "While the word \u201cforce\u201d can suggest military connotations such as the U.S. Space Force, Parker said what China is establishing is more of a team for detecting planetary threats and doing something about them, \u201cincluding looking at international cooperation, which is something that, in my experience, at least the Chinese really like to try to do.\u201d",
      "The ads have been a major topic of online discussion among young people in China, who are grappling with high unemployment.",
      "\u201cThe asteroid threat has created three new job opportunities,\u201d one commenter joked on the Chinese social media platform Weibo.",
      "Social media users also said the three recruits would be under a lot of pressure, trying to save their world on their own.",
      "But Parker said they might have more company soon.",
      "\u201cThe\u00a0thing about China is that it can devote resources, significant resources, to a thing of this nature,\u201d Parker said. \u201cYou start off with a team of 16, and five years from now it might be a team of 100.\u201d",
      "The planetary defense force is part of a robust Chinese space program that includes a space station, missions to the far side of the moon and a rover on Mars.",
      "China has been a member of the International Asteroid Warning Network, a centralized hub of information coordinated by NASA, since 2018. In 2022, Wu Yanhua, deputy director of the China National Space Administration, said China would begin building a near-Earth asteroid defense system.",
      "\u201cWe aim to detect these asteroids, develop defense strategies and, if necessary, find ways to change their orbits so they no longer pose a threat to humanity or the Earth,\u201d Wu Weiren, the chief designer of China\u2019s lunar exploration program, told Hongxing News in October.",
      "In 2027, China is planning an asteroid-deflection test akin to the double asteroid redirection test successfully carried out by NASA in 2020. The Chinese test will be conducted on an asteroid called 2015 XF261, which is smaller than the 525-foot Dimorphos asteroid whose trajectory NASA disrupted by crashing a spacecraft into it.",

      "\u201cIn the future, we will not only strengthen the equipment configuration and performance, improve the operational models and algorithms,\u201d Li said, \u201cbut also cultivate specialized talent in asteroid defense, contributing China\u2019s wisdom and power to safeguard Earth\u2019s safety.\u201d",

      "Seabed mining, hydrography, disaster relief and cultural ties are areas the pact earmarks for cooperation.",
      "It does not explicitly mention security, but the prospect of greater maritime cooperation could fuel concern over potential military use of information and marine infrastructure.",

But the phrase \u201cwe do not support Taiwan independence\u201d appears to have been removed Thursday in what the State Department says was a routine update.",
      "The change was cheered by Taiwan, while China said it \u201csends a wrong signal to the Taiwan independence forces\u201d and urged the U.S. to \u201cimmediately correct this mistake.\u201d",

      "The State Department said the U.S. position on Taiwan independence had not changed and that the U.S. remained committed to its \u201cOne China\u201d policy.",

      "The State Department website has also been changed to add a reference to Taiwan\u2019s cooperation with a Pentagon technology and semiconductor development project and to say the U.S. will continue to support Taiwan\u2019s participation in international organizations, \u201cincluding membership where applicable.\u201d",
      "China has consistently opposed Taiwan\u2019s membership in international bodies such as the World Health Organization.",
      "The website changes were praised by Taiwan, whose foreign minister, Lin Chia-lung, said in a statement Sunday that his ministry welcomed \u201cthe support and positive stance on U.S.-Taiwan relations\u201d that they demonstrated.",
      "Though President Donald Trump has unnerved Taiwan with recent comments demanding the island pay more for its defense and accusing it of stealing U.S. semiconductor business, his administration has also made strong statements of support for Taipei.",
      "Last week, two U.S. Navy ships sailed through the sensitive Taiwan Strait for the first time since Trump\u2019s inauguration last month. A Canadian warship also sailed through the strait on Sunday, drawing condemnation from Beijing.",

      "Koo Byoung-sam, a spokesperson for South\u00a0Korea\u2019s unification ministry handling inter-Korean affairs, said\u00a0North\u00a0Korea\u00a0appears to be focusing on producing tangible outcomes by mobilizing manpower and material where they can relatively easily make progress, such as housing construction.",
      "During the ceremony, Kim lauded construction workers and officials for achieving nearly 400% progress last year compared with 2020, and pledged another plan to continue expanding the city.",
      "The project would \u201cusher in a new era of prosperity of Pyongyang in which the ideal streets of the people to be proud of in the world are built every year,\u201d KCNA said."

    "summary": "Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy indicated he hadn't been invited and warned that his country \u201cwill never accept deals made behind our backs.\u201d",
    "story": [
      "Secretary of State Marco Rubio, national security adviser Mike Waltz and Middle East special envoy Steve Witkoff plan to head to Saudi Arabia to initiate negotiations toward peace between Russia and Ukraine, two sources familiar with the matter told NBC News.",
      "Witkoff told Fox News' \"Sunday Morning Futures\" that he is traveling to Saudi Arabia with Waltz on Sunday night.",
      "President Donald Trump said he spoke by phone Wednesday with Russian President Vladimir Putin and Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy about the prospect of beginning negotiations to end the war.",
      "\u201cWe agreed to work together, very closely, including visiting each other\u2019s Nations,\u201d Trump wrote Wednesday on Truth Social after the call. \u201cWe have also agreed to have our respective teams start negotiations immediately.\u201d",
      "Senior Trump administration officials, including Vice President JD Vance, Rubio and the U.S. special envoy to Ukraine, Keith Kellogg, have been huddling in Germany this weekend for the Munich Security Conference, a forum for international security policy where the Russia-Ukraine war remains a critical topic of discussion.",
      "Rubio spoke by phone with Russian Foreign Affairs Minister Sergey Lavrov on Saturday. Their discussion included the war in Ukraine and other topics, according to readouts of the call from both countries.",
      "In a speech at the security conference Saturday, Zelenskyy said Ukraine must be involved with any negotiations to end the war.",
      "\"Ukraine will never accept deals made behind our backs,\" he said. \"No decisions about Ukraine without Ukraine, no decisions about Europe without Europe.\"",
      "Rubio said in an interview Sunday on CBS News' \"Face the Nation\" that \"the Europeans will have to be involved\" in negotiations about the end of the war in Ukraine.\"If it\u2019s real negotiations, and we\u2019re not there yet, but if that were to happen, Ukraine will have to be involved because they\u2019re the one that were invaded, and the Europeans will have to be involved because they\u2019re the \u2014 they have sanctions on Putin and Russia as well, and they\u2019ve contributed to this effort,\" Rubio said.",
      "During a panel discussion Saturday on the sidelines of the conference, Kellogg said that \u201cof course\u201d Ukrainians would be at the table in discussions to end the war. However, he said \u201cthe answer is no\u201d when he was asked whether he could assure Europeans that they, too, would have a seat at the table.",
      "\u201cWhen you sit at the table, there\u2019s really, there\u2019s two protagonists when you look at it, and there\u2019s one, hopefully it\u2019ll be an intermediary,\u201d Kellogg added. When the moderator asked for clarification, he indicated that Ukrainians, Russians and Americans would be \u201cat the table talking.\u201d",
      "He later said a group\u2019s not being at the table \u201cdoesn\u2019t mean the interests are not taking a part of, they\u2019re not considered, they\u2019re not used, they\u2019re not developed.\u201d",
      "An aide close to Zelenskyy said that as of Saturday evening, Ukraine has still not been invited to the peace talks between the United States and Russia in Saudi Arabia.",
      "\"It is dangerous to speak with enemies before you speak with allies,\" the aide added. \"Ukraine\u2019s position remains unchanged: We need to have a joint position of Ukraine, the U.S. and Europe before any negotiations with Putin.\u201d",
      "Two U.S. officials confirmed that Ukraine was not invited to the talks in Saudi Arabia but said the intention is for the United States to host a bilaterial meeting with Russia, then a bilateral meeting with Ukraine and then talks together.",
      "\"All to say we are working with both [Russia and Ukraine] with the same weight,\" one of the officials said. \"We want to end the killing and get headed to lasting peace.\u201d",
      "Kellogg on Saturday defended the prospect of engaging with Putin in an effort to achieve peace between Russia and Ukraine, saying in Munich, \u201cWhether you like it or not, you have to talk to adversaries.\u201d",
      "\u201cAs a great secretary of defense, Gen. Mattis, once said: I may not like this son of a b----, but I got to talk to him,\u201d he added.",
      "Kellogg also said Western leaders need to do more to enforce sanctions against Russia, adding that negotiations about ending the war could focus on Russia\u2019s willingness to cede territory and targeting Putin\u2019s oil revenue.",
      "But some members of the administration have seemed reluctant in recent days to specify any particular concessions from Russia ahead of potential negotiations.",
      "Asked Thursday what Russia should give up to reach a deal with Ukraine, Trump declined to name specifics.",
      "\u201cAs far as the negotiation, it\u2019s too early to say what\u2019s going to happen. Maybe Russia will give up a lot, maybe they won\u2019t, and it\u2019s all dependent on what is going to happen,\u201d he said at a news conference alongside Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi.",
      "Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth, who has signaled the United States would be opposed to Ukraine\u2019s joining NATO as part of a negotiated peace, indicated that the United States is likely to support negotiations in which Ukraine cedes territory that\u00a0the Kremlin has already seized.",
      "\u201cWe want, like you, a sovereign and prosperous Ukraine. But we must start by recognizing that returning to Ukraine\u2019s pre-2014 borders is an unrealistic objective,\u201d Hegseth said in a speech during a trip to NATO\u2019s headquarters in Brussels on Wednesday."
