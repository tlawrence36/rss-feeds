      "The organization that bestows the Academy Awards has apologized to \u201cNo Other Land\u201d co-director Hamdan Ballal after mounting criticism following its response to the violent attack on the Oscar winner",
      "NEW YORK -- After mounting criticism following its initial response to the violent attack on Oscar-winning \u201cNo Other Land\u201d co-director Hamdan Ballal, the Academy of Motion Pictures Arts and Sciences apologized Friday for not acknowledging Ballal by name.",
      "In a letter to academy members, academy CEO Bill Kramer and its president, Janet Yang, said they regretted not issuing a direct statement on Ballal. The director on Monday, witnesses said, was beaten by Israeli settlers in the West Bank and then detained by the Israeli military.",
      "The attack, just weeks after Ballal and his fellow directors won best documentary at the Academy Awards, was widely condemned by numerous film organizations, among others. The academy on Wednesday released a statement condemning \u201charming or suppressing artists for their work or their viewpoints.\"",
      "Yuval Abraham, a journalist and co-director of \u201cNo Other Land,\u201d was highly critical of that response, comparing it to \u201csilence on Hamdan's assault.\"",
      "On Friday, more than 600 of the academy's 11,000 members issued an open letter saying the academy's statement \"fell far short of the sentiments this moment calls for.\u201d Among the signatories were Joaquin Phoenix, Olivia Colman, Riz Ahmed, Emma Thompson, Javier Bardem, Pen\u00e9lope Cruz and \u201cThe Zone of Interest\u201d filmmaker Jonathan Glazer.",
      "After a meeting Friday by the academy's board of governors, Kramer and Yang responded with a new statement.",
      "\u201cWe sincerely apologize to Mr. Ballal and all artists who felt unsupported by our previous statement and want to make it clear that the academy condemns violence of this kind anywhere in the world,\u201d they wrote to members. \"We abhor the suppression of free speech under any circumstances.\u201d",
      "After being detained for more than 20 hours, Ballal was released by Israeli soldiers. Ballal and two other Palestinians were accused of throwing stones at a settler, allegations they deny. After being released, Ballal told The Associated Press a settler kicked his head \u201clike a football\u201d during an attack on his village.",
      "\u201cI realized they were attacking me specifically,\u201d Ballal said at a West Bank hospital after his release Tuesday. \u201cWhen they say \u2018Oscar\u2019, you understand. When they say your name, you understand.\u201d",
      "\u201cNo Other Land,\u201d a joint Israeli-Palestinian production, chronicles the situation in Masafer Yatta, which the Israeli military designated as a live-fire training zone in the 1980s and ordered the expulsion of the residents, mostly Arab Bedouin. Around 1,000 residents have largely remained in place, but soldiers regularly come in to demolish homes, tents, water tanks and olive orchards.",
      "After not finding a U.S. distributor despite wide acclaim, \u201cNo Other Land\u201d was self-released in theaters. It still managed to surpass $2 million in North American theaters.",

      "The Sex Pistols will tour North America for the first time since 2003 this fall",
      "NEW YORK -- It wasn't the night punk broke, but it was close. Nearly 50 years ago, the Sex Pistols \u2014 then made up of vocalist Johnny Rotten, guitarist Steve Jones, drummer Paul Cook and bassist Glen Matlock \u2014 performed at the 100 Club Punk Special in London, a 140-capacity club, alongside Subway Sect, Siouxsie and the Banshees and The Clash.",
      "The event marked a shift for the subcultural movement; the bands here would soon bring their underground culture to reach mainstream heights.",
      "Now, the 2025 iteration of the Pistols \u2014 Jones, Cooke and Matlock joined by frontman Frank Carter (of Gallows, Pure Love and Frank Carter and the Rattlesnakes) \u2014 sit in the same venue to discuss their forthcoming North American tour. \u201cThis is where it all kicked off, really, all the punk,\u201d says Cook.",
      "This fall, the legendary punk band will embark on their first tour of North America since 2003, when they were joined by John Lydon (formerly Rotten.) The 2025 run with Carter begins Sept. 16 at the Longhorn Ballroom in Dallas, Texas \u2014 the site of a particularly hostile show for the band when it first toured the U.S. in 1978.",
      "Jones recalls having \u201cpigs' hooves and bottles and what not slung at us by cowboys.\u201d",
      "It is one of a few dates featured in three \u201cLive in the U.S.A.\u201d albums, documenting the band's '78 run: Atlanta, Dallas and San Francisco. The latter will release April 25 and captures the show where the band originally called it quits.",
      "\"We were thinking of breaking up in San Francisco again,\" Jones jokes.",
      "The 2025 tour is currently scheduled to conclude Oct. 16 at the Hollywood Palladium in Los Angeles. The band will hit Washington; Philadelphia; Brooklyn, New York; Montreal; Toronto; Cleveland; Detroit; Minneapolis; Denver; Seattle and San Francisco. Additional tour dates will be announced later.",
      "Pre-sale opens April 2 and 3. Tickets go on sale April 4 at 10 a.m. local time.",
      "They will perform the band's sole album, 1977\u2019s \u201cNever Mind the Bollocks, Here\u2019s the Sex Pistols Album\u201d live in its entirety as well as other material.",
      "So, why tour the U.S. and Canada now?",
      "\u201cWhy not?\u201d says Jones.",
      "\u201cI think everybody needs this band right now. I think the world needs this band right now,\u201d says Carter. \u201cAnd I think definitely America is screaming out for a band like the Sex Pistols.\u201d",
      "\u201cAt the end of the day, we\u2019re living in a really, really difficult time. So not only do people want to come and just be entertained, they want to enjoy themselves,\u201d he continued. \u201cPunk is an energetic music. It\u2019s one where you can go and vent and let your hair down, hopefully in a safe manner. Fingers crossed, no bottles or pigs' hooves.\u201d",
      "Carter fronted the Sex Pistols last year for a few U.K. dates. The band says they did not reach out to Lydon to see if he wanted to participate in this reunion tour.",
      "\u201cThe last thing he wants to do is have anything to do with us right now,\u201d says Jones, referring to a previous lawsuit between the singer and the band over music use in their TV series \u201cPistol.\u201d The judge ruled against Lydon's opposition.",
      "\u201cWe wish him the best,\" Jones said.",
      "\u201cGood luck to him,\u201d adds Matlock. \u201cI wish he thinks, maybe, \u2018good luck\u2019 to us. Probably doesn't. But over the years, John (has had) all our phone numbers, and I can't see many missed calls from him.\u201d",
      "As for the 2025 tour: Fans shouldn't expect the violence of their 1978 run, but they should anticipate a tighter performance.",
      "\u201cWe're a bit older but we play just as well, if not better,\u201d says Matlock. \u201cAnd I think that\u2019s something that\u2019s got a great deal of aplomb that we\u2019re going to bring to the public over there.\u201d",
      "Does this mean there could be new Sex Pistols music in the future? \u201cIt's early days,\u201d says Jones. \u201cLet's see what happens.\u201d",

      "HONG KONG -- At Hong Kong\u2019s Art Basel, painter Chow Chun-fai\u2019s new works transport viewers back to the night in 1997 when the former British colony returned to Chinese rule, displayed in the very exhibition center where one era ended and another began.",
      "That transformation in the city's post-colonial era has taken a drastic turn since 2020, when China imposed a national security law that virtually wiped out dissent. The law drove many middle-class families and young professionals, including artists, to emigrate to democracies like Britain, Canada, Taiwan and the U.S. from what was once a haven for free expression in Asia.",
      "But others, like Chow, chose to stay and continue to document their home city despite unclear red lines. His works at Art Basel, which opens to the public on Friday, revisit Hong Kongers\u2019 collective memories of the late 1990s and early 2000s, a time many were proud of the Chinese financial hub\u2019s vibrancy and openness.",
      "\u201cWhile studying art, we\u2019ve learned many artists faced momentous times. Since we are living through such a momentous time ourselves now, I will continue to learn from it,\" he said in an interview ahead of the exhibition.",
      "Chow is perhaps best known to those outside art circles for his witty recreations of classic movie scenes with bilingual subtitles that lead audiences to reflect on Hong Kong's history and identity. He was also in the news when he ran against pro-establishment candidates in the 2012 legislative election and the 2016 election committee race, though he ultimately lost both contests.",
      "At Art Basel, Chow's paintings revisit significant news events, from the 1997 handover and overseas trips made by former top Chinese leaders to the celebration of China becoming the host of the 2008 Olympic Games.",
      "His works center on some of the biggest news stories covered by Sharon Cheung, a former journalist and now local gallery director.",
      "In 2000, late former Chinese President Jiang Zemin berated Cheung for asking what he called \u201ctoo simple, sometimes naive\u201d questions. She'd asked Jiang if his support for then-Hong Kong leader Tung Chee-hwa gave the impression of an imperial-style appointment. One of Chow\u2019s paintings illustrates that scene.",
      "Another set of Chow's paintings that will be shown, titled \u201cPanda,\u201d captures Jiang\u2019s personality from another side, documenting his light-hearted response to a question about pandas during a 2002 U.S. trip. He replied in English with a laugh: \u201cI\u2019m sorry, I am an electrical power engineer.\" Zhang said he was not a panda expert and quoted a Confucian saying about the virtue of acknowledging what one doesn\u2019t know.",
      "Chow said he included the work in the exhibition because pandas have become a trending topic in Hong Kong, where twins born last year sparked a bear craze. Jiang's response shows the characteristics of Chinese leaders back then, he said.",
      "Some 20 years later, Chinese leaders no longer have such open exchanges with Hong Kong journalists. Last year, China\u2019s government even eliminated an annual news conference by the premier, one of the rare times a top Chinese leader took questions from journalists.",
      "In Hong Kong, Beijing has doubled down on its control following 2019 anti-government protests. Many leading pro-democracy activists were prosecuted and jailed under the security law. Apple Daily and Stand News, news outlets known for their critical reports of the government, were shut down in 2021 after their top editors were arrested.",
      "The cultural sector has felt the chilling effect.",
      "In 2021, the government introduced amendments to its film censorship law on national security grounds. Some filmmakers have stopped screening their work in the city. Cultural works that diverge from government positions have lost funding. Booksellers practice self-censorship at the city's book fair, and local libraries in 2023 pulled titles related to the 1989 Tiananmen Square crackdown in Beijing and some political figures.",
      "Cheung, director of SC Gallery, said people have become more cautious about expressing their thoughts, but that she and Chow will not let fear stop them. Art\u2019s sense of distance allows room for interpretation, Cheung said.",
      "\u201cWe're not trying to tell people something. It's more about what people take away when they look at these images,\u201d she said.",
      "Chow said he never planned to leave Hong Kong despite the city's drastic changes, noting that artists who lived through major changes in the past produced great work.",
      "\u201cToday, finding ourselves in this moment of transformation, how could I, as a creative professional, not be here to witness it personally?\u201d he said.",

      "WASHINGTON -- President Donald Trump on Thursday revealed his intention to force changes at the Smithsonian Institution with an executive order that targets funding for programs that advance \u201cdivisive narratives\u201d and \u201cimproper ideology,\" the latest step in a broadside against culture he deems too liberal.",
      "Trump claimed there has been a \u201cconcerted and widespread\u201d effort over the past decade to rewrite American history by replacing \u201cobjective facts\u201d with a \u201cdistorted narrative driven by ideology rather than truth,\" adding that it casts the \u201cfounding principles\u201d of the United States in a \u201cnegative light.\u201d",
      "The order he signed behind closed doors puts Vice President JD Vance, who serves on the Smithsonian Institution's Board of Regents, in charge of overseeing efforts to \u201cremove improper ideology\u201d from all areas of the institution, including its museums, education and research centers, and the National Zoo.",
      "It marks the Republican president's latest salvo against cultural pillars of society, such as universities and art, that he considers out of step with conservative sensibilities. Trump recently had himself installed as chairman of the John F. Kennedy Center for the Performing Arts with the aim of overhauling programming, including the annual Kennedy Center Honors awards show. The administration also recently forced Columbia University to make a series of policy changes by threatening the Ivy League school with the loss of several hundred million dollars in federal funding.",
      "The executive order also hints at the return of statues and monuments of Confederate figures, many of which were taken down or replaced around the country after the police killing of George Floyd in Minneapolis in 2020 and the rise of the Black Lives Matter movement, which is detested by Trump and other conservatives.",
      "The order also calls for improvements to Independence Hall in Philadelphia by July 4, 2026, in time for the 250th anniversary of the signing of the Declaration of Independence.",
      "Trump singled out the National Museum of African American History and Culture, which opened in 2016 near the White House, the Women's History Museum, which is in development, and the American Art Museum for criticism.",
      "\u201cMuseums in our Nation's capital should be places where individuals go to learn \u2014 not to be subjected to ideological indoctrination or divisive narratives that distort our shared history,\u201d he said.",
      "Linda St. Thomas, the Smithsonian Institution\u2019s chief spokesperson, said in an email late Thursday, \u201cWe have no comment for now.\u201d",
      "Under Trump\u2019s order, Vance will also work with the White House budget office to make sure future funding for the Smithsonian Institution isn\u2019t spent on programs that \u201cdegrade shared American values, divide Americans based on race, or promote programs or ideologies inconsistent with federal law and policy.\u201d Trump also wants to ensure that the women\u2019s history museum celebrates women and not \u201crecognize men as women in any respect.\u201d",
      "It also requires the interior secretary to reinstate monuments, memorials, statues and similar properties that have been removed or changed since Jan. 1, 2020, to \u201cperpetuate a false reconstruction of American history, inappropriately minimize the value of certain historical events or figures, or include any other improper partisan ideology.\u201d",
      "The Smithsonian Institution is the world\u2019s largest museum, education and research complex. It consists of 21 museums and the National Zoo. Eleven museums are located along the National Mall in Washington.",
      "The institution was established by Congress with money from James Smithson, a British scientist who left his estate to the United States to found \u201cat Washington, under the name of the Smithsonian Institution, an establishment for the increase and diffusion of knowledge.\u201d",

      "Sald\u00edvar, who is serving her sentence in a Gatesville prison, will be eligible to be reviewed again for parole in 2030.",
      "Sald\u00edvar founded Selena\u2019s fan club and was the manager of the singer\u2019s clothing boutiques, Selena Etc., until she was fired in early March 1995 after money was discovered missing.",
      "Selena, a Corpus Christi native, was shot in the back with a .38-caliber revolver at a Days Inn motel in Corpus Christi on March 31, 1995. She was able to run to the motel lobby, where she collapsed, and she was pronounced dead at a hospital an hour later.",
      "Motel employees testified that Selena named \u201cYolanda\u201d in \u201croom 158\u201d as her attacker.",
      "\u201cI didn\u2019t mean to do it. I didn\u2019t mean to kill anybody,\u201d a sobbing Sald\u00edvar said during a nine-hour standoff with police. She told officers she had bought the .38-caliber revolver to kill herself.",
      "More than 50,000 people lined up to view Selena\u2019s body the day before she was laid to rest in Seaside Memorial Park on April 3, 1995, just 13 days before her 24th birthday.",
      "Sald\u00edvar\u2019s trial was moved to Houston because of the publicity surrounding the case. Sald\u00edvar testified that she had intended to kill herself during the confrontation with Selena but the gun misfired.",
      "On Oct. 23, 1995, a jury convicted Sald\u00edvar of first-degree murder. She was sentenced to life in prison with the possibility of parole after 30 years.",
      "While in prison, Sald\u00edvar, a former nurse, obtained her paralegal and associate degree in criminal justice. She has filed several civil rights complaints alleging mistreatment by the state\u2019s prison system, according to court records, and she also helped other inmates file petitions.",
      "In court documents from 2016, Sald\u00edvar said she was being held in protective custody \u2014 meaning she was segregated from other inmates \u2014 because prison officials were concerned for her safety due to the \u201chigh profile\u201d nature of her case. She filed several appeals of her conviction, but all were rejected.",
      "Known as \u201cthe Queen of Tejano,\u201d Selena rose to stardom and won a Grammy during a Tejano music boom in the early 1990s. Her hits included \u201cBidi Bidi Bom Bom,\u201d \u201cComo la Flor,\u201d \u201cAmor Prohibido,\u201d \u201cNo Me Queda Mas\u201d and \u201cTu Solo Tu.\u201d",

      "\u201cASCO: Without Permission\u201d is director Travis Guti\u00e9rrez Senger's latest documentary and executive produced by Gael Garcia Bernal and Diego Luna",
      "LOS ANGELES -- When filmmaker Travis Guti\u00e9rrez Senger reflects on ASCO\u2019s legacy, he quickly notes they were more than an art group; they created a movement, one with remarkable influence on Chicano art history.",
      "\u201cThat movement continues today, and it\u2019s very expansive,\u201d he says. \u201cThere\u2019s a lot of books, films and things that will be written about ASCO over a period of time. And this was our contribution in some ways.\u201d",
      "He's referring to \u201cASCO: Without Permission,\u201d a documentary that chronicles the story of the 1970s art group founded by multidisciplinary artist Patssi Valdez, muralist Willie Herr\u00f3n III, painter and performance artist Gronk and writer and photographer Harry Gamboa Jr. They met as teens, formed as young adults, and called their group \u201casco\u201d \u2014 \u201cnausea\u201d or \u201cdisgust\u201d in Spanish \u2014 after one of their early DIY exhibits. Their conceptual work and performance art spoke to the exclusion of Chicanos from the mainstream art world and the systemic police brutality endured by the Mexican American community in East Los Angeles.",
      "All four founding members of ASCO became some of the most notable Chicano artists, later exhibiting works in revered museums around the United States. But in their early days, the group was denied access to the notable galleries and museums. They created their own avenues in the form of public performances, murals and more to exhibit their work, their way.",
      "\u201cTo behave badly is the most ethical thing you can do,\u201d said executive producer Gael Garc\u00eda Bernal at the film\u2019s South by Southwest film festival premiere earlier this month. \u201cYou\u2019re building identity and questioning and unmasking the facade and the farce that exists.\u201d",
      "Bernal and Diego Luna executive produced the film under their production company El Corriente del Golfo. The film has yet to find distribution.",
      "Speaking with The Associated Press, Gamboa and Valdez praised Guti\u00e9rrez Senger\u2019s approach to their history. Both members, who appear in the documentary, saw the film for the first time with a crowd of fans and a group of young Chicano artists whose art was inspired by ASCO\u2019s early rebellion.",
      "\u201cI felt the film really kind of captured the essence of all of us working together,\u201d said Gamboa.",
      "Valdez says it was a special moment for her, as the only woman in the founding group, to be given equal time and understanding.",
      "\u201cFor the first time, I was given an equal voice in the group that hadn\u2019t happened before,\u201d she said, citing how previous stories of the group only highlighted her male collaborators.",
      "ASCO emerged at the height of the Chicano civil rights movement in the 1960s and 1970s. It was a time of heightened political and racial tension amid the East LA walkouts, protesting education inequality, and the Chicano Moratorium, an anti-Vietnam War movement during which many Mexican Americans were victims of police brutality.",
      "Muralists and collectives popped up as Latino artists sought to process the systemic injustice taking place in their communities.",
      "\u201cThe response to such violence was to create art,\u201d said Gamboa Jr. He wanted to alter the mainstream perception of Chicanos and present the possibilities and avenues someone can create despite societal constraints.",
      "For Valdez, being the only woman meant she was no stranger to a double dose of both racism in society and the sexism weaved within conservative Latino households, where young women were expected to keep quiet.",
      "\u201cI couldn\u2019t stand it. So, I was able to act out these forms of censorship through the performance work in ASCO,\u201d said Valdez who once taped herself to a public wall in a piece titled \u201cInstant Mural,\u201d a metaphor on feeling captive.",
      "One of ASCO's most known works is \u201cSpray Paint LACMA.\u201d Gamboa, Gronk and Herr\u00f3n spray painted their names on the side of the Los Angeles County Museum of Art after Gamboa says he was told by a curator, \u201cChicanos are in gangs, they don\u2019t make art.\u201d",
      "\u201cThere was another era when people said, \u2018Latinx art, you know, doesn\u2019t exist. It\u2019s not a thing. It doesn\u2019t belong. It\u2019s not part of American art,\u2019\u201d said Pilar Tompkins-Rivas, the chief curator and deputy director of the Lucas Museum of Narrative Art.",
      "ASCO\u2019s neighborhood performance art would often draw stares, and even crowds. In \u201cStation of the Cross,\u201d the group carried a large cross to the local military recruiting office to protest the Vietnam War.",
      "In 1974, Gamboa took a photo of Gronk posed as the victim of gang violence to bring attention to the media\u2019s sensationalist coverage of crime in East Los Angeles. In the documentary, Gamboa claims that a local news station ran the piece as an actual story.",
      "ASCO\u2019s work as a group remained in obscurity from the mainstream. It was not until 2011 when LACMA mounted \u201cASCO: Elite of the Obscure, A Retrospective, 1972-1887,\u201d the first retrospective to present the group\u2019s performance and conceptual art. On display was an image of Valdez, taken by Gamboa, standing above the graffiti art. Life had presented ASCO with its full-circle moment.",
      "\u201cLatino history has always been erased,\u201d said Guti\u00e9rrez Senger. \u201c\u2018ASCO: Without Permission\u2019 is a story of winning a battle, not a war.\u201d",
      "A 1974 photograph of Valdez shows the artist glammed up in a gold top, holding a golden statue of a cobra. She had won best actress at the Aztlan No Movie Awards \u2014 a fictional award show ASCO created as commentary on the lack of Latino representation in Hollywood.",
      "The group was inspired by Hollywood cinema and popular culture, but knew the likelihood of starring in studio films was limited, unless they wanted to play a maid, cartel leader or gang member.",
      "\u201cHollywood movies, rock \u2019n\u2019 roll. That\u2019s what I was about,\u201d said Valdez. \u201cAnd that\u2019s why I responded in the way I did with my artmaking.\u201d",
      "Gamboa photographed Herr\u00f3n, Gronk and Valdez using cinema stock to capture the essence of their favorite films. The series was called \u201cNo Movies\u201d and later inspired their satirical award show.",
      "Guti\u00e9rrez Senger was drawn to it and pays homage throughout the documentary by featuring a group of young Chicano artists \u2014 including local Los Angeles artists like Fabi Reyna and San Cha \u2014 in short films inspired by ASCO\u2019s signature DIY style.",
      "\u201cI think it\u2019s a necessary obligation as a Latino if you\u2019re making films to fight very, very hard to put brown people on screen and behind the camera and to try to create films about our history,\u201d said Guti\u00e9rrez Senger. \u201cWe have rich stories, and we have a rich history.\u201d",
      "\u201cASCO: Without Permission\u201d includes testimonials from respected Latino artists, including actor Michael Pe\u00f1a and comedian Arturo Castro, who have broken into the mainstream but know the importance of preserving history.",
      "\u201cOur history as Latinos is not in the history books. The movements that we've had are not in the history books,\u201d Pe\u00f1a says in the documentary.",
      "Although it often feels like progression is slow, Valdez says artists need to continue to voice their opinions and \u201cmisbehave and not ask for permission.\u201d",
      "\u201cYou do not need permission to be yourself. You do not need permission to be creative. You do not need permission to be intellectual,\u201d said Gamboa. \u201cAnd the thing is, you cannot allow yourself to be repressed or silenced and or visually curtailed from presenting works.\u201d",

      "Thirty years ago, music legend Selena Quintanilla-P\u00e9rez was killed by her fan club\u2019s president, Yolanda Sald\u00edvar. For the last three decades, Sald\u00edvar has served her life sentence in Texas.",
      "Now 64, Sald\u00edvar has a petition for parole under review, according to Texas Department of Criminal Justice online records. On Sunday, she is up for parole for the very first time.",
      "According to a spokeswoman for the Texas Board of Pardons and Paroles, her case will be voted on or around then, but there's no exact date for the decision to be released.",
      "Here's everything you need to know about Selena, Sald\u00edvar and the parole process in Texas:",
      "Born in 1971, Quintanilla-P\u00e9rez demonstrated an incredible vocal gift in childhood, fronting Selena y Los Dinos with her siblings A.B. and Suzette Quintanilla.",
      "Her superstardom arrived in the early 1990s, with her unique blend of Tejano, pop, cumbia and other musical styles manifesting in huge hits like \u201cBidi Bidi Bom Bom,\u201d \u201cComo la Flor,\u201d \u201cAmor Prohibido,\u201d \u201cNo Me Queda Mas\u201d and \u201cTu Solo Tu.\u201d",
      "Known the world over as The Queen of Tejano, or even more simply just as Selena, she broke barriers for women in Latin music. She opened the floodgates for a new generation of contemporary artists of Latin descent who would go on to enjoy huge popularity with mainstream American audiences. She often sang in Spanish and spoke in English, reflecting a cross-cultural identity that resonated with listeners.",
      "She won her first Grammy in 1994 for best Mexican/Mexican-American album for \u201cLive,\u201d becoming the first female Tejano artist to win the category. She was just 23 when she was killed the following year. But her legacy endures for Mexican Americans, Mexicans, Texans, Latinos and beyond.",
      "Her posthumous English-language crossover album released a few months after her death, \u201cDreaming of You,\u201d topped the Billboard 200, featuring hits like \u201cI Could Fall in Love\u201d and \u201cDreaming of You.\" In 1997, a biographical film about her life, \u201cSelena,\" would quickly become a classic, further launching the career of lead Jennifer Lopez.",
      "In 2017, she received a posthumous star on the Hollywood Walk of Fame. At the time, according to a Hollywood Chamber of Commerce spokesperson, the crowd was the largest-ever for a Walk of Fame ceremony, breaking a 1998 record set by onlookers at the unveiling of the star for Mexican singer Vicente Fern\u00e1ndez.",
      "In 2021, she received a posthumous lifetime achievement award from the Grammys. There was no tribute.",
      "Yolanda Sald\u00edvar, a former nurse, was the founder and president of Selena's fan club. She was also a manager of Selena\u2019s clothing boutiques, Selena Etc., but was fired in early 1995 after money was discovered missing.",
      "On March 31, 1995, Selena went to Sald\u00edvar's room at the Days Inn motel in Corpus Christi, Texas, to pick up business records she needed for a tax filing, according to court testimony. A confrontation followed.",
      "Selena was shot in the back with a .38-caliber revolver in the motel room, ran outside and collapsed in the lobby. She was rushed to a nearby hospital and pronounced dead about an hour later.",
      "Motel employees testified Selena named \u201cYolanda\u201d in \u201croom 158\u201d as her attacker.",
      "\u201cI didn\u2019t mean to do it. I didn\u2019t mean to kill anybody,\u201d a sobbing Sald\u00edvar said during a 9-hour standoff with police, during which she held a gun to her head. She told police she had bought the .38-caliber revolver to kill herself.",
      "The trial was moved to Houston because of heavy publicity.",
      "Prosecutors contended that Sald\u00edvar shot the 23-year-old after the singer\u2019s family suspected her of embezzling $30,000. The defense argued the gun went off accidentally.",
      "On October 23, 1995, the jury convicted Sald\u00edvar of first-degree murder. She was sentenced to life in prison, with the possibility of parole after 30 years \u2014 beginning in 2025.",
      "Sald\u00edvar did not face the death penalty because the crime contained none of the aggravating circumstances required under Texas law, such as a multiple murder or a murder committed during a robbery.",
      "In 1999, the Court of Criminal Appeals in Austin turned down Sald\u00edvar\u2019s first plea for a new trial. In 2000, her lawyer Bill Berchelmann asked the state to revisit the trial. He argued that prosecutors wrongly dismissed potential jurors because of race, did not disclose the criminal record of a witness and made improper comments in court. He said police also violated Sald\u00edvar's rights by interrogating her after she asked for an attorney.",
      "In 2009, Sald\u00edvar lost an appeal because it was filed in the wrong county. She had asked the court to order an appeal filed nine years earlier in Nueces County to move forward, but the state\u2019s highest criminal appeals court said it should have been filed in Harris County, where she was tried and convicted.",
      "She's incarcerated at the Patrick L. O\u2019Daniel prison unit in Gatesville, Texas, about 90 minutes north of Austin.",
      "In Texas, the parole division of the state\u2019s Department of Criminal Justice identifies inmates six months before the date of their initial parole eligibility and pulls their case file for review. Notice of an inmate\u2019s eligibility for parole is sent to officials involved in the trial, any victims and victims' family members.",
      "An institutional parole officer with the Texas Board of Pardons and Paroles interviews an inmate and prepares a summary for the board. The victim or the victim\u2019s family members can provide a written statement and can appear in person before board members.",
      "The inmate\u2019s file is then sent to the parole board and voted on by a three-person panel. The panel will vote on a case just prior to the inmate\u2019s parole eligibility date and a majority of two votes is needed for a final decision.",
      "In Texas, the board does not conduct public parole hearings. Parole release decisions are made independently by each panel member.",
      "Representatives for members of Quintanilla-P\u00e9rez\u2019s family did not immediately respond to The Associated Press' request for comment this week.",
      "A denial by the panel will include the date of the next time an inmate will be eligible for parole.",
      "Sald\u00edvar was convicted of first-degree murder, one of the crimes where state law dictates that the next review after a denial can be done anywhere from one to five years from the date of the denial.",
      "An approval by the panel could include special conditions the inmate will have to follow while on parole. Processing time for a release differs from case to case. Once a release certificate with an approved residence plan is issued, it will be audited by the Texas Department of Criminal Justice\u2019s Classification and Records Department and a release date is calculated. Typically, these processes can take two to six weeks to complete.",

      "A woman accusing French actor G\u00e9rard Depardieu of sexual assault has told a landmark trial in Paris that he groped her buttocks and her breasts several times in three separate incidents on a film set",
      "PARIS -- A woman accusing French actor G\u00e9rard Depardieu of sexual assault told a landmark trial in Paris on Wednesday that he groped her buttocks and her breasts several times in three separate incidents on a film set.",
      "Depardieu, 76, is accused of groping a 54-year-old set dresser and a 34-year-old assistant during filming in 2021 of \u201cLes Volets Verts\u201d (\u201cThe Green Shutters\u201d). He denies any sexual assault.",
      "Day 3 of the Paris trial focused on the testimony of the younger plaintiff, who said Depardieu first groped her bottom when she was alone with him for a brief moment between the backstage area and the film set.",
      "\u201cOut of the blue, he put his hand on my butt,\u201d she said, adding she was \u201cunder shock,\u201d \u201cpetrified,\u201d and said nothing.",
      "In a second incident, she said Depardieu suddenly put both his hands on her breasts: \u201cI said no, I was scared.\"",
      "She also described telling Depardieu \u201cno\u201d during a third similar incident.",
      "The plaintiff said she reported the issue to her direct manager, who then alerted others in charge of the film production, prompting anger from the actor.",
      "Depardieu repeatedly denied the allegations Wednesday in court, saying : \u201cI\u2019m not like that.\u201d",
      "\u201cI think that maybe, I don\u2019t know, she was wary because of my reputation of being vulgar, crude, rude,\" Depardieu said. \"But I\u2019m not only that. I still respect people.\u201d",
      "The actor also told the court that he is almost always accompanied by aides on the film set, including his body guard, and suggested that he would rarely find himself alone with a film worker.",
      "On Tuesday, Depardieu acknowledged that he had used vulgar and sexualized language with the set dresser who accused him of sexual assault. He said he grabbed her hips during an argument, but denied that his behavior was sexual.",
      "The Associated Press doesn\u2019t identify by name people who say they were sexually assaulted unless they consent to. Neither women has done so in this case.",
      "The four-day trial was to continue Thursday, with the verdict expected at a later date.",
      "The actor faces up to five years in prison and a fine of 75,000 euros ($81,000) if convicted.",

      "NASHVILLE, Tenn. -- June Carter, Kenny Chesney and Tony Brown have been invited to join the Country Music Hall of Fame.",
      "The Country Music Association announced the new 2025 inductees on Tuesday in Nashville, Tennessee.",
      "Carter, the Grammy-winning member of one of country music\u2019s pioneering families and the wife of country giant Johnny Cash, joins as this year's veteran era artist. Chesney, who has won the CMA Awards entertainer of the year four times, joins as the modern era artist. And Brown, a Nashville producer who has supervised a wide array of best-selling hits by Vince Gill, Reba McEntire, George Strait and many others, will join the non-performer category.",
      "The three will be formally inducted during a ceremony in the fall.",
      "Tuesday's celebratory ceremony focused on their contributions to country music over the decades, highlighting their influence, even when they were overlooked at times.",
      "\u201cJohnny once said that his wife was one of the most neglected artists in country music,\u201d said country singer Vince Gill, who introduced the inductees. He said Cash worried that his wife's contributions would \u201cunder-recognized simply because she's my wife.\u201d",
      "\u201cThat changes as she takes her rightful place among family, friends and legends in the Country Music Hall of Fame,\u201d Gill said.",
      "Some of Carter's accomplishments include writing more than 100 songs, including co-writing \u201cRing of Fire,\u201d a top hit for Cash. The two married in 1968 and recorded several Grammy-award winning hits like \u201cJackson\u201d and \u201cIf I Were a Carpenter.\u201d",
      "But Carter had been singing since she was 10, long before marrying Cash. Her mother, Maybelle Carter, was in the Carter Family music act with her cousin Sara Carter and Sara\u2019s husband, A.P. Carter. The family act broke up, but mother and daughters June, Helen and Anita continued on as Mother Maybelle & the Carter Sisters, with little June playing autoharp.",
      "The Carters went on to become staples of the Grand Ole Opry country music show in Nashville.",
      "Carlene Carter described her mother as a \u201cforce of nature\u201d who was \u201canchored in love.\u201d",
      "\u201cAnything that\u2019s good about me is because of that mom,\u201d said Carlene Carter, who continued in the family business as a country singer and songwriter.",
      "Chesney, who grew up in eastern Tennessee, told the crowd on Tuesday that if someone had said he would one day be inducted into the same Hall of Fame class as June Carter Cash, he would have called it \u201cunbelievable.\u201d",
      "Chesney's career includes 16 platinum albums and more than 50 Top Ten country hits. After receiving a standing ovation, he said he was just hoping to spread love and positivity through his music.",
      "\u201dI had a really big dream and I\u2019m still pushing that dream as far as I can,\u201d Chesney said. \u201cI just wanted to record and write songs that reflected the lives of a lot of people that came to our shows.\"",
      "For Brown, getting the call about his induction into the Hall of Fame almost knocked him over. He called it one of the biggest accomplishments of his career.",
      "Every year, the Country Music Hall of Fame chooses just three inductees, one of which rotates between songwriters, recording/touring musicians and non-performers.",
      "Brown backed Elvis Presley until his death in 1977, then played with Emmylou Harris & The Hot Band, as well as Rodney Crowell & The Cherry Bombs. But he's being honored more for his production work, as president of MCA Nashville, with RCA Records and eventually as co-founder of Universal South Records.",
      "\u201cYou make records and you make some money, but this is better than money,\u201d Brown said. \u201cThis is about making an impact.\u201d",

      "PARIS -- PARIS (AP) \u2014 G\u00e9rard Depardieu once seemed larger than France itself. With his hulking frame, crooked nose, and volcanic charisma, he reigned over cinema for half a century \u2014 a national icon as familiar as the baguette.",
      "But this week, the actor who starred in more than 230 films \u2014 and who inspired writer John Updike to lament, \u201cI think that I shall never view a French film without Depardieu\u201d \u2014 sat slumped on a special orthopedic stool in a Paris courtroom.",
      "He faces two counts of sexual assault. If convicted, he could face up to five years in prison and a fine of 75,000 euros ($81,000).",
      "But more than Depardieu is on trial.",
      "For many in France, this case marks the country\u2019s ultimate litmus test \u2014 a question not just of guilt or innocence, but of readiness. Can a nation famed for its culture of seduction \u2014 and long criticized for shielding its male artists \u2014 finally hold one of them accountable?",
      "Depardieu, 76, is accused of groping two women \u2014 a set dresser and an assistant \u2014 during the 2021 filming of \u201cLes Volets Verts\u201d (\"The Green Shutters\"). According to complaints and witness statements, he trapped one woman with his legs, grabbed her breasts and waist, and shouted: \u201cI can\u2019t even get it up because of this heat!\u201d before crudely inviting her to touch his \u201cbig parasol.\u201d",
      "He denies all allegations. \u201cNever, but never, have I abused a woman,\u201d he wrote in Le Figaro. \u201cI have only ever been guilty of being too loving, too generous, or having a temperament that is too strong.\u201d",
      "But this is the first time one of the more than 20 accusations against him has reached court.",
      "Once a symbol of France\u2019s creative power, Depardieu\u2019s career now shadows the nation\u2019s delayed reckoning with #MeToo. The courtroom has become the stage for something deeper: a country finally confronting the myths it has long told itself about art, power, and male genius.",
      "Born in 1948 to a working-class family in Ch\u00e2teauroux, Depardieu\u2019s rise was the stuff of legend. A stuttering teen with no formal education, he drifted into acting and exploded onto the French stage with \u201cLes Valseuses\u201d (\"Going Places\"), a 1974 film so provocative it remains banned in some countries.",
      "From there came a blur of hits: \u201cJean de Florette,\u201d \u201cCyrano de Bergerac,\u201d \u201cGreen Card,\u201d \u201cThe Last Metro,\u201d and \u201cDanton.\u201d He won a Golden Globe, an Oscar nomination, and the adoration of millions. He played Columbus, Jean Valjean, and even Ob\u00e9lix in the \u201cAsterix\u201d films. He was prolific, omnipresent \u2014 messy, magnetic, and untouchable.",
      "But the excess was real off-screen too. He crashed his motorcycle while drunk, accepted a Russian passport from Vladimir Putin during a tax dispute, and once urinated in a plane aisle. He boasted of his appetites. France seemed to cheer them on.",
      "That myth \u2014 of the lovable brute \u2014 is now unraveling.",
      "In Hollywood, #MeToo toppled titans. In France, the movement was met with a wary eye. When #BalanceTonPorc (\u201cExpose Your Pig\u201d) emerged in 2017, it rattled the country\u2019s self-image \u2014 particularly in the arts, where seduction and transgression had long been celebrated.",
      "Some warned that #MeToo was killing romance. In 2018, screen legend Catherine Deneuve and 99 other prominent French women published an open letter in Le Monde, scolding the movement for going, in their words, \u201ctoo far.\u201d They championed la libert\u00e9 d\u2019importuner \u2014 \u201cthe freedom to bother\u201d \u2014 as a pillar of French life, defending the right of men to pursue women without fear of consequence. To many, it sounded less like a defense of flirtation than a permission slip for harassment, cloaked in perfume and nostalgia.",
      "Even President Emmanuel Macron echoed the sentiment. In Dec. 2023 \u2014 shortly after a documentary aired footage of Depardieu making sexually suggestive comments about a young girl in North Korea \u2014 Macron defended the actor on national television, condemning the backlash as a \u201cmanhunt.\u201d \u201cG\u00e9rard Depardieu makes France proud,\u201d he said.",
      "The remark sparked national outrage \u2014 not just for its timing, but for what it revealed: the instinct to protect cultural giants, no matter the cost.",
      "France\u2019s reluctance to confront sexual misconduct among its stars has long set it apart.",
      "Roman Polanski, convicted of statutory rape in the U.S. and accused by several other women, continues to work and live freely in France. In 2020, his C\u00e9sar Award win prompted walkouts \u2014 but also a standing ovation. There was little institutional pushback.",
      "In 2022, Johnny Depp was dropped from Disney's \u201cPirates of the Caribbean\u201d franchise after domestic abuse allegations by ex-wife Amber Heard ( he was largely vindicated ).",
      "Yet, in France, he was embraced.",
      "In 2023, he played Louis XV in \u201cJeanne du Barry\u201d, the opening film at the French Cannes Film Festival. French fashion house Dior not only kept him on as the face of its Sauvage fragrance \u2014 it reportedly signed him to a multiyear, seven-figure deal in 2022.",
      "Depardieu\u2019s trial isn\u2019t the only case shaking French cinema. In recent months, a string of high-profile convictions have suggested that the shield of fame may finally be cracking.",
      "In February, director Christophe Ruggia was convicted of sexually abusing actress Adele Haenel when she was a child.",
      "Actor-director Nicolas Bedos was sentenced in 2024 for sexual assault.",
      "The same year, actor-director Judith Godr\u00e8che testified before a parliamentary commission, accusing two renowned directors of exploiting her as a teenager. \u201cThis is not about desire,\u201d she told lawmakers. \u201cIt\u2019s about power. About silence. About a system that protects itself.\u201d",
      "That same commission has since summoned major actors \u2014 including Jean Dujardin of \u201cThe Artist\u201d fame. Some reportedly asked to testify behind closed doors.",
      "Anouk Grinberg, who appeared in \u201cLes Volets Verts,\u201d has publicly supported the two women accusing Depardieu. \u201cWhat I saw on set was not seduction,\u201d she said. \u201cIt was shameful.\u201d",
      "The case has become a national mirror \u2014 reflecting everything France has tolerated, denied, and excused.",
      "On the Parisian sidewalks, opinions still diverge. \u201cWe\u2019re losing our culture of flirtation,\u201d said Alain Morel, 62, sipping an espresso at a caf\u00e9 near the Arc de Triomphe. \u201cFlirting isn\u2019t a crime \u2014 it\u2019s part of who we are.\u201d",
      "But across the street, 28-year-old student Yasmine Bensalem shook her head. \u201cWe called it charm,\u201d she said. \u201cBut it was always about power.\u201d",
      "The trial continues. Depardieu, who has diabetes and heart disease, attends with medical accommodations. His lawyer claims the case is a political vendetta \u2014 a plot to \u201cmake Depardieu fall.\u201d",
      "But whether he is convicted or not, the deeper judgment is already underway.",
      "For decades, France\u2019s artists were seen as untouchable \u2014 their genius a shield. That shield is cracking. The myth is dying. And in its place, a question rises:",
      "Can France finally hold its most powerful men to account?",
      "This is not just the trial of Depardieu. This is the trial of a country \u2014 and whether its unfinished revolution will finish at last.",

      "WASHINGTON -- On a night when half a dozen people made jokes about this being the last-ever Mark Twain Prize, Conan O'Brien made sure the ceremony at the John F. Kennedy Center for the Performing Arts ended on a high note.",
      "O\u2019Brien accepted the award for lifetime achievement in comedy Sunday night while acknowledging the backstage turmoil that hangs over the future of the cultural center in Washington.",
      "O\u2019Brien, 61, was named the 26th recipient of the Mark Twain Prize in mid-January, about three weeks before President Donald Trump upended the Kennedy Center by ousting longtime president Deborah Rutter and board chairman David Rubenstein. Trump dismissed the board of trustees and replaced them with loyalists, who then elected him as chairman.",
      "On Sunday, O'Brien specifically thanked Rubenstein and Rutter \u2014 drawing an extended round of applause \u2014 and also Kennedy Center staffers who, he said, were \u201cworried about what the future might bring.\u201d",
      "He said the example of Mark Twain's own life and career was particularly resonant at this moment in American history.",
      "\u201cTwain hated bullies. ... He punched up, not down, and he deeply empathized with the weak,\u201d O'Brien said. \u201cTwain loved America, but he knew it was deeply flawed.\u201d",
      "A Mark Twain impersonator then emerged from the audience. After a back-and-forth debate with O'Brien, he joined him on stage and the pair slow danced for a while. They were then joined by a dozen more Twain impersonators and previous Twain Prize recipient Adam Sandler for a raucous rendition of Neil Young\u2019s \u201cRockin in the Free World.\u201d",
      "That musical ending capped off a night when the uncertain fate of the Kennedy Center itself was woven through the multiple tributes and testimonials to O\u2019Brien.",
      "\u201cI think it would be insane not to address the elephant in the room,\u201d comic Nikki Glaser said on the red carpet before the ceremony. \u201cIt\u2019s in the air tonight. This night is about Conan, but it can be both.\u201d",
      "Once the festivities began, Stephen Colbert joked that the Kennedy Center had announced two new board members: Bashar Assad, the ousted president of Syria, and Skeletor, a fictional supervillain.",
      "John Mulaney quipped that the entire building would soon be renamed \u201cthe Roy Cohn Pavilion\u201d after one of Trump\u2019s mentors. And Sarah Silverman made multiple Trump jokes that were too vulgar to print.",
      "Trump, in announcing the Kennedy Center changes, posted on social media that those who were dismissed \"do not share our Vision for a Golden Age in Arts and Culture.\u201d",
      "How that vision takes shape remains to be seen, but Trump has spoken about wanting to book more Broadway shows there and floated the idea of granting Kennedy Center Honors status to actor Sylvester Stallone and singer-songwriter Paul Anka.",
      "Into this maelstrom stepped O'Brien, whose comedic persona has never been particularly political. The comic has always tended more toward goofiness and self-deprecation. But he has also leaned into sensitive societal issues at times. In 2011, O'Brien officiated a gay wedding live on his show, overseeing the marriage of his longtime costume designer Scott Cronick and his partner David Gorshein.",
      "O\u2019Brien vaulted into the spotlight from near-total obscurity in 1993 when he was chosen to replace David Letterman as host of \u201cLate Night\u201d despite no significant on-camera experience. The former Harvard Lampoon editor had spent the previous years as a writer for \u201cSaturday Night Live\u201d and \u201cThe Simpsons,\u201d appearing on camera only as an occasional background extra in \u201cSNL\u201d skits.",
      "He went on to host \u201cLate Night\u201d for 16 years, longer than any other host. O'Brien was later tapped to replace Jay Leno as host of \u201cThe Tonight Show,\u201d but that experiment ended in public failure. After seven months of declining ratings, NBC executives brought Leno back for a new show that would bump \u201cThe Tonight Show\u201d back. O\u2019Brien refused to accept the move, leading to a public spat that ended with a multimillion-dollar payout for O\u2019Brien and his staff to exit the network in early 2010.",
      "O'Brien went on to host another talk show on the cable station TBS, while launching successful podcasts and travel shows. He is currently on a late-career elder statesman hot streak. His travel series, \u201cConan O\u2019Brien Must Go,\u201d drew popular and critical acclaim, with a second season coming. His recent gig hosting the Academy Awards was so well received that the producers announced they are bringing him back next year.",
      "In the wake of Trump's takeover of the Kennedy Center, several artists, including the producers of \u201cHamilton\u201d and actress and writer Issa Rae, announced they were canceling appearances at the venue.",
      "Others have chosen to perform while making their sentiments known from the stage. Leftist comic W. Kamau Bell directly addressed the controversy in his performance just days after the shake-up. Earlier this month, cellist Erin Murphy Snedecor ended her set with a performance of the Woody Guthrie protest anthem \u201cAll You Fascists Bound to Lose.\u201d",
      "Other comedians receiving the lifetime achievement award include both Letterman and Leno, along with George Carlin, Whoopi Goldberg, Bob Newhart, Carol Burnett, Bill Murray and Dave Chappelle.",

      "A groundbreaking initiative could soon be bringing surgeons closer to patients in Africa's remote corners where the doctor-to-patients ratio is among the lowest in the world",
      "KOFORIDUA, Ghana -- Charles Owusu Aseku has traveled across Ghana and beyond in search of care for the large growth of tissue called a keloid on his neck since 2002. The 46-year-old was growing increasingly frustrated after two unsuccessful surgeries and a trip to South Africa that ended with just a consultation.",
      "Aseku was preparing for yet another medical trip until late February when he joined others in the first trial of 3D telemedicine technology in Ghana powered through computer screens in the back of a van.",
      "Those behind the initiative, developed by Microsoft\u2019s research team in partnership with local doctors and researchers, say the remote assessment will help provide medical consultations for patients awaiting surgery or after an operation, in a region where the doctor-to-patient ratio is among the lowest in the world.",
      "The project builds on earlier trials in Scotland and now works as a portable system with enhanced lighting and camera upgrades.",
      "Once inside the van, cameras will capture a 3D model of each patient and the image is then projected onto a large computer screen. Multiple doctors can join the consultation session online and manipulate the 3D model to assess the patient.",
      "\u201cThe idea behind the van is to allow it to travel to those remote villages that don\u2019t have specialized care ... to perform a pre or post-surgical consult,\u201d said Spencer Fowers, principal software developer and 3D-telemedicine project lead at Microsoft Research.",
      "The initiative also gives patients the opportunity to have multiple opinions. Aseku\u2019s session had doctors from Rwanda, Scotland and Brazil, an experience that he said gave him hope.",
      "\"I see a lot of doctors here and I am very happy because experience will come from each of them and maybe they will find a solution to my problem,\u201d the 46-year-old said.",
      "Researchers hope the trial at the Koforidua Regional Hospital, in Ghana\u2019s eastern region, is the start of a wider project that could expand the service and explore new use cases.",
      "Recent years have seen growing use of telemedicine, especially since the COVID-19 pandemic. Experts say such digital tools can benefit patients in Africa the most because there are so few specialist doctors for the continent's 1.4 billion people.",
      "George Opoku, 68, was referred to the Korle-Bu Teaching Hospital in the capital Accra \u2014 nearly 100 kilometers away from the Koforidua hospital, which is much closer to his home \u2014 where he had first gone to seek care for sarcoma, a rare form of cancer that develops in the bones and soft tissues.",
      "Upon hearing about the 3D telemedicine trial, his doctor decided to register him for the process, saving him the extra expenses and stress of long-distance travel.",
      "\u201cThis time I had to sit in a van and to introduce myself and condition to not only one doctor but several of them. I was able to answer all their questions and I am hopeful that they will discuss and cure me of my condition,\u201d Opku said. \u201cI feel well already and I am hopeful.\"",
      "A key challenge for the project is the lack of stable internet access, a common problem in remote parts of Africa.",
      "At the Korle-Bu Teaching Hospital, the technology is helping patients in need of plastic surgery. An inadequate number of plastic surgeons means that patients often have to consult with different doctors during each visit.",
      "Dr. Kwame Darko, consultant plastic surgeon at the hospital and one of the principal investigators on the project, said that 3D telemedicine could give patients the chance to be seen by multiple doctors during one session.",
      "The 3D technology could make a difference if replicated in Ghana and elsewhere, according to Dr. Ahensan Dasebre, chief resident doctor at the National Reconstructive Plastic Surgery and Burns Centre at Korle-Bu, who was not part of the project.",
      "\u201cWe are already behind in terms of how many doctors are available to care for a certain number of the population,\u201d he said.",
      "\u201cIf somebody is in a remote part of town where he doesn\u2019t have access to these specialized services, but needs it, the referring doctor could actually use this telemedicine thing to get access to the best of care.\u201d",

      "NEW YORK -- The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention was rocked by five high-level departures on Tuesday in the latest turmoil for the nation's top public health agency.",
      "The departures were announced at a meeting of agency senior leaders. The Atlanta-based CDC has two dozen centers and offices. The heads of five of them are stepping down, and that follows three other departures in recent weeks. This means close to a third of the agency\u2019s top management is leaving or left recently.",
      "The departures \u2014 described as retirements \u2014 were not announced publicly. The Associated Press confirmed the news with two CDC officials who were not authorized to discuss it and spoke on condition of anonymity.",
      "The announcements come a day after the White House announced it is nominating Susan Monarez to be CDC director. But it\u2019s not clear how much, if any, influence that had on the leaders\u2019 decision to leave. The Trump administration earlier this month withdrew its nomination of former Florida congressman Dr. David Weldon just before a Senate hearing.",
      "The latest departures include:",
      "\u2014 Leslie Ann Dauphin, who oversees the Public Health Infrastructure Center and its more than 500 employees. That center coordinates CDC funding, strategy, and technical assistance to state, local and territorial health departments.",
      "\u2014 Dr. Karen Remley, who heads the National Center on Birth Defects and Developmental Disabilities. At the beginning of the year, the center had more than 220 full-time employees.",
      "\u2014 Sam Posner, who heads the Office of Science. More than 100 CDC employees work on research and science policy, and publish the Morbidity and Mortality Weekly Report.",
      "\u2014 Debra Lubar, who runs the 65-person Office of Policy, Performance and Evaluation.",
      "\u2014 Leandris Liburd, head of the Office of Health Equity, with about 40 employees. Liburd took the role in 2020, as part of an effort to address the COVID-19 pandemic\u2019s disproportionate death toll on Black, Hispanic and Native Americans.",
      "Adding to that: Kevin Griffis, head of CDC communications, left last week. Robin Bailey, the agency\u2019s chief operating officer, left late last month. So did Dr. Nirav Shah, a former CDC principal deputy director who last year was the agency\u2019s primary voice about an evolving bird flu epidemic in animals that has also sickened at least 70 people in the U.S.",

But she also proposed an \u201camazing deal\u201d for U.S. President Donald Trump that she said could result in \u201cthe end of AIDS.\u201d",

      "Lenacapavir, sold as Sunlenca, has been shown through twice-yearly injections to completely prevent HIV infection in women and which works nearly as well in men.",

      "\u201cIt could be President Trump, another Republican president, who leads the prevention revolution towards the end of AIDS,\u201d Byanyima said.",
      "She added that the deal would result not only in profits for Gilead and create jobs for Americans, but save millions of lives in poorer countries.",
      "Byanyima said that American money made up about 35% of UNAIDS\u2019 core budget last year but it was unclear whether that might be restored for next year. She said the agency was in talks with the U.S. government but was also preparing for a worst-case scenario, in which there was no funding available from the U.S.",
      "Byanyima said it was unlikely any other donors would be able to fill that vacuum, adding that European donors have told the agency they would be cutting back on their support in order to redirect their funds to defense and other priorities.",
      "Byanyima said that unless support to HIV efforts is restored, there could be more than 6.3 million additional deaths in the next four years and an additional 2,000 people per day becoming infected.",
      "She acknowledged that there has been some valid criticism regarding how HIV aid has been delivered, calling it \u201can opportunity to rethink and develop more efficient ways of delivering life-saving support.\u201d",
      "Byanyima also said African countries were trying to become more self-sufficient and that even some of the poorest nations were now \u201ctrying to stretch very weak, fragile health systems to absorb people living with HIV.\u201d",

      "NUUK, Greenland -- The Danish foreign minister on Saturday scolded the Trump administration for its \u201ctone\u201d in criticizing Denmark and Greenland, saying his country is already investing more into Arctic security and remains open to more cooperation with the U.S.",
      "Foreign Minister Lars L\u00f8kke Rasmussen, make the remarks in a video posted to social media after U.S. Vice President JD Vance\u2019s visit to the strategic island.",
      "\u201cMany accusations and many allegations have been made. And of course we are open to criticism,\u201d Rasmussen said speaking in English. \u201cBut let me be completely honest: we do not appreciate the tone in which it is being delivered. This is not how you speak to your close allies. And I still consider Denmark and the United States to be close allies.\u201d",
      "Vance on Friday said Denmark has \u201cunderinvested\u201d in Greenland\u2019s security and demanded that Denmark change its approach as President Donald Trump pushes to take over the Danish territory.",
      "Vance visited U.S. troops on Pituffik Space Base on mineral-rich Greenland alongside his wife and other senior U.S. officials for a trip that was ultimately scaled back after an uproar among Greenlanders and Danes who were not consulted about the original itinerary.",
      "\u201cOur message to Denmark is very simple: You have not done a good job by the people of Greenland,\u201d Vance said Friday. \u201cYou have underinvested in the people of Greenland, and you have underinvested in the security architecture of this incredible, beautiful landmass filled with incredible people. That has to change.\u201d",
      "Vance said the U.S. has \u201cno option\u201d but to take a significant position to ensure the security of Greenland as he encouraged a push in Greenland for independence from Denmark.",
      "\u201cI think that they ultimately will partner with the United States,\u201d Vance said. \u201cWe could make them much more secure. We could do a lot more protection. And I think they\u2019d fare a lot better economically as well.\u201d",
      "The reaction by members of Greenland\u2019s parliament and residents has rendered that unlikely, with anger erupting over the Trump administration\u2019s attempts to annex the vast Arctic island. Danish Prime Minister Mette Frederiksen pushed back on Vance\u2019s claim that Denmark isn\u2019t doing enough for defense in the Arctic, calling her country \u201ca good and strong ally.\u201d",
      "And Greenlandic lawmakers on Thursday agreed to form a new government, banding together to resist Trump's overtures. Four of the five parties elected to Greenland\u2019s parliament earlier this month have agreed to form a coalition that will have 23 of 31 seats in the legislature.",
      "L\u00f8kke Rasmussen, in his video, reminded viewers of the 1951 defense agreement between Denmark and the United States. Since 1945, the American military presence in Greenland has decreased from thousands of soldiers over 17 bases and installations on the island, he said, to the remote Pituffik Space Base in the northwest with some 200 soldiers today.",
      "The 1951 agreement \"offers ample opportunity for the United States to have a much stronger military presence in Greenland,\u201d the foreign minister said. \u201cIf that is what you wish, then let us discuss it.\u201d",
      "L\u00f8kke Rasmussen added that Denmark has increased its own investment into Arctic defense. In January, Denmark announced 14.6 billion Danish kroner (US$2.1 billion) in financial commitments for Arctic security covering three new naval vessels, long-range drones and satellites.",

      "Suspected U.S. airstrikes have pounded Yemen overnight",
      "DUBAI, United Arab Emirates -- Suspected U.S. airstrikes pounded Yemen overnight into Saturday, reportedly killing at least one person as the American military acknowledged earlier bombing a major military site in the heart of Sanaa controlled by the Houthi rebels.",
      "The full extent of the damage and possible casualties wasn\u2019t immediately clear. The attacks followed a night of airstrikes early Friday that appeared particularly intense compared to other days in the campaign that began March 15.",
      "An Associated Press review has found the new American operation under President Donald Trump appears more extensive than those under former President Joe Biden, as the U.S. moves from solely targeting launch sites to firing at ranking personnel as well as dropping bombs in cities.",
      "Meanwhile, satellite photos analyzed by the AP show a mysterious airstrip just off Yemen in a key maritime chokepoint now appears ready to accept flights and B-2 bombers within striking distance of the country Saturday.",
      "The strikes into Saturday targeted multiple areas in Yemen under the control of the Iranian-backed Houthis, including the capital, Sanaa, and in the governorates of al-Jawf and Saada, rebel-controlled media reported. The strikes in Saada killed one person and wounded four others, the Houthi-run SABA news agency said.",
      "SABA identified the person killed as a civilian. Houthi fighters and their allies often aren\u2019t in uniform. However, analysts believe the rebels may be undercounting the fatalities given the strikes have been targeting military and intelligence sites run by the rebels. Many of the strikes haven't been fully acknowledged by the Houthis \u2014 or the U.S. military \u2014 while the rebels also tightly control access on the ground.",
      "One strike early Friday, however, has been confirmed by the U.S. military's Central Command, which oversees its Mideast operations. It posted a black-and-white video early Saturday showing an airstrike targeting a site in Yemen. While it didn't identify the location, an AP analysis of the footage's details corresponds to a known strike Friday in Sanaa. The footage shows the bomb striking the military's general command headquarters held by the Houthis, something the rebels have not reported.",
      "The Houthi-controlled Telecommunications and Information Technology Ministry in Sanaa separately said U.S. strikes Friday destroyed \u201cbroadcasting stations, communication towers and the messaging network\u201d in Amran and Saada governorates. The strikes in Amran around the Jebel Aswad, or \u201cBlack Mountain,\u201d had appeared particularly intense.",
      "The new campaign of airstrikes, which the Houthis now say have killed at least 58 people, started after the rebels threatened to begin targeting \u201cIsraeli\u201d ships again over Israel blocking aid entering the Gaza Strip. The rebels in the past have had a loose definition of what constitutes an Israeli ship, meaning other vessels could be targeted as well.",
      "The Houthis had targeted over 100 merchant vessels with missiles and drones, sinking two vessels and killing four sailors during their campaign targeting ships from November 2023 until January of this year. They also launched attacks targeting American warships, though none have been hit so far.",
      "The attacks greatly raised the Houthis\u2019 profile as they faced economic problems and launched a crackdown targeting any dissent and aid workers at home amid Yemen\u2019s decadelong stalemated war that has torn apart the Arab world\u2019s poorest nation.",
      "The Houthis have begun threatening both Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates, two American allies in the region, over the U.S. strikes. That's even as the nations, which have sought a separate peace with the Houthis, have stayed out of the new U.S. airstrike campaign.",
      "An AP analysis of satellite photos from Saturday shows the American military has moved at least four long-range stealth B-2 bombers to Diego Garcia in the Indian Ocean \u2014 a base far outside of the range of the rebels that avoids using allies\u2019 Mideast bases. Three had been earlier seen there this week.",
      "That means a fourth of all the nuclear-capable B-2s that America has in its arsenal are now deployed to the base. The Biden administration used the B-2 with conventional bombs against Houthi targets last year.",
      "The aircraft carrier USS Harry S. Truman has launched attacks from the Red Sea and the American military plans to bring the carrier USS Carl Vinson from Asia as well.",
      "Meanwhile, France said its sole aircraft carrier, the Charles de Gaulle, was in Djibouti, an East African nation on the Bab el-Mandeb Strait, which links the Red Sea to the Gulf of Aden. The French have shot down Houthi drones in the past, but they are not part of the American campaign there.",
      "Satellite images Friday from Planet Labs PBC show an airstrip now appears ready on Mayun Island, a volcanic outcropping in the center of the Bab el-Mandeb. The images showed the airstrip had been painted with the designation markings \u201c09\u201d and \u201c27\u201d to the airstrip\u2019s east and west respectively.",
      "A Saudi-led coalition battling the Houthis had acknowledged having \u201cequipment\u201d on Mayun, also known as Perim. However, air and sea traffic to Mayun has linked the construction to the UAE, which backs a secessionist force in Yemen known as the Southern Transitional Council.",
      "World powers have recognized the island\u2019s strategic location for hundreds of years, especially with the opening of the Suez Canal linking the Mediterranean and Red Seas.",
      "The work on Mayun follows the completion of a similar airstrip likely constructed by the UAE on Abd al-Kuri Island, which rises out of the Indian Ocean near the mouth of the Gulf of Aden.",

      "Camara was sentenced in July 2024 after he was found guilty of crimes against humanity in the deaths of at least 157 people at the stadium. Dozens of women were also raped.",
      "Troops opened fire on demonstrators at the stadium who were protesting Camara\u2019s plans to run for president, a year after staging a coup.",
      "The junta at the time said \u201cuncontrolled\u201d elements of the army carried out the rapes and killings. But Camara\u2019s top aides were at the stadium and did nothing to stop the massacre, a Human Rights Watch report said.",
      "Many of the victims were shot, crushed or knifed to death while some of the women were dragged out from hiding and gang-raped by uniformed men over several days, witnesses said.

      "Istanbul Mayor Ekrem Imamoglu, a key rival to Erdogan, was detained on March 19th on corruption and terrorism charges that many saw as politically motivated. The government insists the judiciary is independent and free of political interference.",
      "His detention, and later formal arrest over the corruption charges on March 23rd, sparked nationwide protests despite assembly bans, police crackdowns, and legal prosecution by authorities.",
      "\u201cThey\u2019ve detained hundreds of our children, thousands of our youths... arrested hundreds of them,\u201d CHP leader Ozgur Ozel told protesters. \u201cThey only had one goal in mind: to intimidate them, terrify them, make sure they never go out again.\u201d",

      "As they spend their first Ramadan in their country in years, many Syrians who\u2019ve recently returned from abroad to a homeland they were forced to flee have been celebrating the end of the Assad family\u2019s rule",
      "DARAYA, Syria -- When Mariam Aabour learned of the ouster of Syrian leader Bashar Assad, she shed tears of joy. But as the time came to return to her homeland from Lebanon \u2013 where she fled years earlier \u2013 Aabour felt torn.",
      "She was happy about the homecoming, but sad to leave behind a son and a stepson who remained in Lebanon to work and pay off family debts. Months before her return, Aabour\u2019s father died in Syria without her seeing him. Her Syrian home has been destroyed and there\u2019s no money to rebuild, she said.",
      "Thus it\u2019s been bittersweet experiencing her first Ramadan \u2013 the Muslim holy month \u2013 since her return.",
      "\u201cWe\u2019ve all lost dear ones,\u201d she said. \u201cEven after our return, we still cry over the tragedies that we\u2019ve lived through.\u201d",
      "As they spend their first Ramadan in years in their homeland, many Syrians who\u2019ve recently trickled back in from abroad have been celebrating the end of the Assad family\u2019s rule in December after a fast-paced rebel offensive. They are relishing some new freedoms and savoring some old traces of the lives they once knew.",
      "They enjoy family reunions but many also face challenges as they adjust to a country ravaged by a prolonged civil war and now grappling with a complex transition. As they do, they grieve personal and communal losses: Killed and missing loved ones, their absence amplified during Ramadan. Destroyed or damaged homes. And family gatherings shattered by the exodus of millions.",
      "A time for daily fasting and heightened worship, Ramadan also often sees joyous get-togethers with relatives over food and juices.",
      "Aabour \u2013 one of the more than 370,000 Syrians the United Nations' refugee agency, UNHCR, says have returned to the country since Assad\u2019s ouster \u2013 delights in hearing the call to prayer from mosques signaling the end of the daily fast. In her Lebanon neighborhood, she said, there were no nearby mosques and she relied on phones to know when to break the fast.",
      "The hardest part, she added, is sitting for the fast-breaking meal known as \u201ciftar\u201d without some loved ones, including her father and a son, who she said was killed before the family fled Syria.",
      "She bitterly recalled how her child, who she said was about 10 when killed, liked a rice and peas dish for iftar and would energetically help her, carrying dishes from the kitchen.",
      "\u201cI used to tell him, \u2018You\u2019re too young,\u2019 but he would say, \u2018No, I want to help you,\u2019\u201d she said, sitting on the floor in her in-laws\u2019 house which her family now shares with relatives.",
      "Faraj al-Mashash, her husband, said he\u2019s not currently working, accumulating more debt and caring for an ill father.",
      "The family borrowed money to fix his father\u2019s home in Daraya. It was damaged and looted, but still standing.",
      "Many Daraya homes aren\u2019t.",
      "Part of Rural Damascus and known for its grapes and its furniture workshops, Daraya was one of the centers of the uprising against Assad. The conflict devolved into armed insurgency and civil war after Assad crushed what started as largely peaceful protests; this Ramadan, Syrians marked the 14th anniversary of the civil war\u2019s start.",
      "Daraya suffered killings and saw massive damage during fighting. It endured years of government besiegement and aerial campaigns before a deal was struck between the government and rebels in 2016 that resulted in the evacuation of fighters and civilians and control ceded to the government.",
      "Today, in parts of Daraya, children and others walk past walls with gaping holes in crumbling buildings. In some areas, a clothesline or bright-colored water tank provides glimpses of lives unfolding among ruins or charred walls.",
      "Despite it all, al-Mashash said, it\u2019s home.",
      "\u201cIsn\u2019t Daraya destroyed? But I feel like I am in heaven.\u201d",
      "Still, \u201cthere\u2019s sadness,\u201d he added. \u201cA place is only beautiful with its people in it. Buildings can be rebuilt, but when a person is gone, they don\u2019t come back.\u201d",
      "In Lebanon, al-Mashash struggled financially and was homesick for Daraya, for the familiar faces that used to greet him on its streets. Shortly after Assad\u2019s ouster, he returned.",
      "This Ramadan, he\u2019s re-lived some traditions, inviting people for iftar and getting invited, and praying at a mosque where he has cherished memories.",
      "Some of those who had left Daraya, and now returned to Syria, say their homes have been obliterated or are in no condition for them to stay there. Some of them are living elsewhere in an apartment complex that had previously housed Assad-era military officers and is now sheltering some families, mostly ones who've returned from internal displacement.",
      "The majority of those who've returned to Syria since Assad's removal came from countries in the region, including Lebanon, Jordan and Turkey, said Celine Schmitt, UNHCR\u2019s spokesperson in Syria.",
      "A main security fear for returnees is unexploded mines, Schmitt said, adding UNHCR provides \u201cmine awareness sessions\u201d in its community centers. It also offers legal awareness for those needing IDs, birth certificates or property documents and has provided free transportation for some who came from Jordan and Turkey, she said.",
      "The needs of returnees, so far a fraction of those who\u2019ve left, are varied and big \u2013 from work and basic services to house repairs or construction. Many, Schmitt said, hope for financial help to start a small business or rebuild, adding that more funding is needed.",
      "\u201cWe\u2019re calling on all of our donors,\u201d she said. \u201cThere\u2019s an opportunity now to solve one of the biggest displacement crises in the world, because people want to go back.\u201d",
      "Many of those who haven't returned cite economic challenges and \u201cthe huge challenges they see in Syria\u201d as some of the reasons, she said.",
      "In January, U.N. High Commissioner for Refugees Filippo Grandi said living conditions in the country must improve for the return of Syrians to be sustainable.",
      "Umaya Moussa, also from Daraya, said she fled Syria to Lebanon in 2013, returning recently as a mother of four, two of whom had never seen Syria before.",
      "Moussa, 38, recalls, at one point, fleeing an area while pregnant and terrified, carrying her daughter and clutching her husband\u2019s hand. The horrors have haunted her.",
      "\u201cI\u2019d remember so many events that would leave me unable to sleep,\u201d she said. \u201cWhenever I closed my eyes, I would scream and cry and have nightmares.\u201d",
      "In Lebanon, she lived for a while in a camp, where she shared the kitchen and bathroom with others. \u201cWe were humiliated ..., but it was still better than the fear we\u2019ve lived through.\u201d",
      "She\u2019d yearned for the usual Ramadan family gatherings.",
      "For the first iftar this year, she broke her fast with her family, including brothers who, she said, as fighters against the Assad government, had previously moved to then rebel-controlled Idlib province.",
      "Missing from the Ramadan meal was her father who died while Moussa was away.",
      "Like Moussa, Saeed Kamel is intimately familiar with the pain of a joy incomplete. This Ramadan, he visited the grave of his mother who had died when he was in Lebanon.",
      "\u201cI told her that we\u2019ve returned but we didn\u2019t find her,\u201d he said, wiping away tears.",
      "And it wasn\u2019t just her. Kamel had been hopeful that with Assad gone, they would find a missing brother in his prisons; they didn\u2019t.",
      "Kamel had vowed never to return to a Syria ruled by Assad, saying he felt like a stranger in his country. His home, he said, was damaged and looted.",
      "But despite any difficulties, he held out hope. At least, he said, \u201cthe next generation will live with dignity, God willing.\u201d",
      "Kamel fondly recalled how \u2013 before their worlds changed \u2013 his family would exchange visits with others for most of Ramadan and neighbors would send each other iftar dishes.",
      "\u201cRamadan is not nice without the family gatherings,\u201d he said. \u201cNow, one can barely manage.\u201d",
      "He can\u2019t feel the same Ramadan spirit as before.",
      "\u201cThe good thing,\u201d he said, \u201cis that Ramadan came while we\u2019re liberated.\u201d",

      "ROME -- ROME (AP) \u2014 Pope Francis has shown \u2018\u2019a truly surprising improvement\u2019\u2019 since returning to the Vatican to convalesce after surviving a life-threatening bout with double-pneumonia, the doctor who coordinated the pontiff\u2019s five-week hospitalization said Saturday.",
      "\u201cI find him very lively,\u2019\u2019 Dr. Sergio Alfieri said, after visiting the pope at his apartment in the Santa Marta Domus on Wednesday, three days after his release from Rome\u2019s Gemelli hospital. \u201cI believe that he will return if not to 100%, 90% of where he was before.\u2019\u2019",
      "Francis appeared frail and weak as he greeted a crowd of well-wishers from a hospital balcony on Sunday. His voice was waning as he praised a woman in the crowd for bringing yellow flowers. He was able to only partially lift his arm to bless the people and he gasped for air as he was wheeled back inside.",
      "Alfieri said the pope\u2019s voice was regaining strength, and that his reliance on supplemental oxygen has decreased. The limited mobility of his arm was due to an unspecified trauma he sustained before being hospitalized, and that will take time to heal, Alfieri said.",
      "The 88-year-old pope was hospitalized on Feb. 14 after a long bout with bronchitis that left him breathless at times, and which quickly developed into double pneumonia and revealed a polymicrobial (viral, bacterial and fungal) respiratory infection. Throughout the ordeal, doctors emphasized the complexity of his condition, given his age, lack of mobility requiring a wheelchair, and the removal of part of a lung as a young man.",
      "Alfieri repeated that he didn\u2019t think the pope would make it after a severe respiratory crisis a week after being hospitalized, and he informed the pope that a \u201cdecisive\u201d treatment necessary to save him would put his organs at risk.",
      "\u2019\u2019He gave his consent, and then he looked a Massimiliano Streppetti, whom he named his personal health assistant who assumed the responsibility, to say, \u2018We approve everything,\u2019 also at the price of coming out with damaged kidneys or bone marrow that produces damaging red blood cells,\u2019\u2019 said Alfieri.",
      "Alfieri preferred to describe the treatment as \u201cdecisive,\u2019\u2019 and not aggressive, and emphasized that no extraordinary, life-extending measures were ever taken. The Feb. 22 incident was one of several critical moments when the pope's life hung in the balance, the doctor said.",
      "While Francis beat the double pneumonia in the hospital, Alfieri said he is continuing to treat the fungal infection, which he said will take months to resolve. The pope is also receiving physical, respiratory and speech therapy.",
      "Alfieri continues to consult the pope\u2019s personal medical team daily, and will visit Francis in the Vatican every week.",
      "The pope demonstrated his trademark humor in this week\u2019s visit, responding to a comment by Alfieri that the 88-year-old pontiff had the mentality of a 50- or 60-year-old. \u201cAs I leaned in, he said, \u2018Not 50, 40,'\u2019\u2019 Alfieri recalled. \u201cSo his good sense of humor is back.\u2019\u2019",
      "Doctors have ordered the pope to rest for at least two months and to avoid crowds. But after seeing the pope\u2019s improvements and knowing his work ethic, Alfieri warned that \u201cif he recovers so quickly, they will have to put on the brakes.\u2019\u2019",

      "TIRANA, Albania -- Albania\u2019s Orthodox Church on Saturday held an inauguration ceremony for its new Archbishop Joan, who succeeded Archbishop Anastasios following his death in January.",
      "The ceremony was held at the Cathedral of Resurrection of Christ in downtown Tirana, formally launching Joan\u2019s leadership as the archbishop of Tirana, Durres and all of Albania and also head of the Autocephalous Orthodox Church of Albania.",
      "Earlier this month a seven-member Holy Synod unanimously elected Joan, the metropolitan of Korca, in the post left vacant after Anastasios' death in January.",
      "Albania\u2019s religious leaders, top officials and politicians, Orthodox religious leaders from around the world, and Greek religious and defense ministers were present at the ceremony.",
      "Bishop Nikolla of Apollonia and Fieri, speaking on behalf of the Holy Synod, said that Joan would continue \u201cpreserving religious harmony and co-existence,\u201d like his predecessor Anastasios, who resuscitated the country\u2019s church after the fall of communism.",
      "The Orthodox Church of Albania was declared autocephalous in September in 1922, ending its subordination to the archbishopric of Ohrid and the patriarchate of Constantinople.",
      "Archbishop Joan, 69, born Fatmir Pelushi, grew up in a Muslim family. He was secretly baptized in 1979 by priest Kosmas Kyrios, who later became the bishop of Apollonia.",
      "All forms of religion were banned in Albania for 23 years starting in 1967, when the country was completely isolated from the outside world and the communists seized the property of Islamic, Orthodox, Catholic and other churches.",
      "Joan, whose family was persecuted by the communists, joined a small underground church group. He worked at the Tirana Psychiatric Hospital until 1990, when the communist leadership collapsed. In 1990, he fled to Italy and then to Boston, where he studied at the Holy Cross Greek Orthodox School of Theology.",
      "In 1992, when Albanians fled the poor country en masse, Joan contacted Archbishop Anastasios offering his return to contribute to the church\u2019s reconstruction. He is the sixth head of the Albanian Orthodox Church.",
      "According to the 2023 census, Orthodox believers in Albania make up about 7% of the 2.4 million population, although the church says the actual number is higher. The tiny Western Balkan country is about half Muslim, followed by the Catholics, Orthodox and other religious communities and nonbelievers, who all live in harmony.",

      "The demonstrations began last week following the arrest of Istanbul Mayor Ekrem Imamoglu, a key rival to President Recep Tayyip Erdogan. Imamoglu was jailed pending trial on corruption charges many see as politically motivated and is also accused of supporting terrorism. The government insists the judiciary is independent, but critics say the evidence is based on secret witnesses and lacks credibility.",
      "Early Thursday, student demonstrators tried to march and gathered to read a statement near the gates at Middle East Technical University, pro-opposition broadcaster Halk TV and local media reported. They were met by security forces who deployed pepper spray, water cannon and plastic pellets. A standoff ensued where the students hid behind a barricade of dumpsters until the police charged to detain them.",
      "Melih Meric, a legislator with Imamoglu\u2019s Republican People\u2019s Party or CHP, was seen soaked with water and suffering from pepper spray exposure.",
      "\u201cMy student friends only wanted to make a press statement, but the police strictly did not allow it, this is the result,\u201d Meric said in social media videos.",
      "Interior Minister Ali Yerkikaya said Thursday that nearly 1,900 people have been arrested over eight days of massive protests across the country. He said that 1,879 suspects were detained, including 260 who were jailed pending trial. A further 468 were released under judicial control while their cases continue. Proceedings are ongoing for 662 other people.",
      "The minister said some faced charges for drug offenses and assault, adding that 150 police officers had been injured. He did not specify the nature of other charges but offenses such as resisting police and not complying with a ban on protests and gatherings have been cited previously.",
      "Demonstrations involving hundreds of thousands of largely peaceful protesters have swept across major cities, including opposition-organized rallies outside Istanbul City Hall. Other major protests have been held in Istanbul\u2019s districts of Kadikoy and Sisli districts in recent days.",
      "Some demonstrations have been marred by violence as police used water cannons, tear gas, plastic pellets and pepper spray to breakup protests that have been banned in Istanbul, Ankara and Izmir.",
      "Police continued to carry out house raids targeting protesters Thursday morning. Most of those detained in their homes appear to belong to left-wing parties, trade unions and civil society groups.",
      "Eleven journalists were arrested and sent to jail Wednesday after covering the protests. At least eight were released under judicial control a day later, the Media and Law Studies Association said, but still face charges relating to the protests.",
      "Imamoglu, the Istanbul mayor, was detained in a dawn raid on his home last Wednesday and later remanded to prison. He faces charges stemming from two investigations into the opposition-controlled Istanbul Metropolitan Municipality -- a corruption case and one alleging support for terrorism.",
      "The mayor is the main challenger to Erdogan in an election currently scheduled for 2028 but which is likely to take place earlier.",
      "Justice Minister Yilmaz Tunc said Thursday that 106 people had been arrested in both municipality investigations, with 51 in jail pending trial, including Imamoglu. Those detained include municipal officials and business figures accused of crimes such as bribery, extortion and bid-rigging.",
      "Many see the case against Imamoglu as politically motivated. Protesters often say they have come out against Turkey's democratic backsliding and increasing authoritarianism, as well as the country's bleak economic outlook.",
      "Imamoglu was confirmed as the CHP candidate for presidential elections the same day he was sent to prison He has performed well in recent polls against Erdogan, and his election as mayor of Turkey\u2019s largest city in 2019 was a major blow to the president.",

      "British Steel says it is planning to close its two blast furnaces and steelmaking operations in the north England town of Scunthorpe, after its Chinese owner Jingye failed to agree a rescue package with the U.K. government",
      "LONDON -- British Steel said Thursday that it is planning to close its two blast furnaces and steelmaking operations in the northern England town of Scunthorpe, after its Chinese owner Jingye failed to agree a rescue package with the U.K. government.",
      "Unions called on the government to help secure the future of the company, which Jingye said is suffering daily losses of around 700,000 pounds ($900,000) despite the Chinese firm investing more than 1.2 billion to maintain operations since its takeover of British Steel in 2020.",
      "The company, Britain's second-biggest steelmaker, blamed \u201chighly challenging market conditions, the imposition of tariffs, and higher environmental costs relating to the production of high-carbon steel.\u201d",
      "British Steel said it is consulting with unions over the the decision to close the blast furnaces and steelmaking operations and reduce rolling mill capacity, potentially as early as June. Between 2,000 to 2,700 jobs are potentially at risk.",
      "The company had sought support from the government for a major capital investment in two new electric arc furnaces, which would emit far less carbon into the atmosphere, but no agreement was reached after months of negotiations.",
      "Unions published a report last month setting out how to decarbonize steelmaking at British Steel, which would involve the continued operation of Scunthorpe\u2019s two existing blast furnaces while two new electric ones constructed on site. The plan would require an additional 200 million pounds of government support to mitigate carbon costs in the interim period.",
      "\u201cThis is a dark day for our steel industry and for our country,\" said Roy Rickhuss, the general secretary of the Community union. \u201cThe closures at Scunthorpe would represent a hammer blow to communities which were built on steel, and where the industry still supports thousands of jobs directly and thousands more through extensive supply chains.\"",
      "Rickhuss urged Jingye and the government to get back to the negotiating table and said the Chinese company \u201chave not ruled out\" retaining the blast furnaces during a transition if they can win government backing.",
      "Business and Trade Secretary Jonathan Reynolds said the government will \u201ccontinue working tirelessly\u201d to reach an agreement with Jingye.",
      "\u201cWe\u2019ve been clear there\u2019s a bright future for steelmaking in the U.K,\" he said.",
      "At its height in the postwar period, British steelmaking was a global leader, employing more than 300,000 people, before cheaper offerings from China and other countries hit production. It now employs about 40,000 directly, with the industry accounting for just 0.1% of the British economy.",

      "A remote Australian town that will soon lose its only doctor is offering a salary package of up to $680,000 Australian dollars, plus free rent and a car, to attract a new candidate",
      "WELLINGTON, New Zealand -- A remote Australian town that will soon lose its only doctor is offering a salary of up to 680,000 Australian dollars ($428,000), plus free rent and a car, to attract a new candidate.",
      "The remote Queensland town of Julia Creek, population 500, is offering about double the salary a family physician would earn in the state\u2019s capital, Brisbane. The catch is that Brisbane is a 17-hour drive away. The closest major city, Townsville, is a seven-hour drive.",
      "Prospective applicants must embrace searing heat and tropical insects, too.",
      "But the town's outgoing medic, Dr. Adam Louws, says his replacement will also find a quieter pace of life and the chance to learn skills they\u2019ve never used before.",
      "Louws was recruited from Brisbane in 2022, when Julia Creek drew national headlines for offering a salary of AU$500,000.",
      "\u201cMy mother-in-law sent me a link to this news article saying, \u2018the half a million dollar job that no one wants,\u2019\u201d Louws said. \u201cMy first thought when I saw it and I looked at it was, where\u2019s Julia Creek?\u201d",
      "Julia Creek is a sweeping, romantic slice of the Australian Outback with wide-open spaces and orange sunsets. Kids play sports and ride horses. But it\u2019s remote \u2014 high school means boarding school in the city and the nearest hospital is nearly three hours\u2019 drive away.",
      "Before Louws arrived in 2022, the town hadn't had a permanent doctor for 15 years, with a roster of visiting physicians dropping in for short stays. It\u2019s a problem that has vexed rural towns in Australia and around the world for decades.",
      "Australia has a shortfall of general practitioners of 2,500 doctors across the country, according to a 2024 government report, with the shortage worst in rural areas and expected to grow. Attracting doctors to rural Australia is made harder by the eye-watering distances between the most remote settlements; the vast country is one of the world\u2019s least densely populated.",
      "In neighboring New Zealand \u2014 where 5 million people live in a country the size of the United Kingdom \u2014 distances between far-flung towns have worsened health disparities. In the United States, 65% of rural areas had a shortage of primary care physicians in 2023, official figures showed.",
      "For Janene Fegan, the mayor of McKinlay Shire \u2014 which includes Julia Creek \u2014 that meant the town needed a good sales pitch. Fegan was involved in the local health service\u2019s campaign that recruited Louws and offered to promote the town again when the job was advertised in March.",
      "\u201cWe actually have a very, very good lifestyle and a very safe lifestyle,\u201d she said. \u201cYes, there is distance to travel at times, but how many people do you hear now wanting to escape from that and go off-grid?\u201d",
      "The town was not, she added, literally off the grid: Julia Creek has electricity and broadband internet.",
      "\u201cYou don\u2019t have to stay forever,\u201d Fegan said. \u201cJust give it a shot.\u201d",
      "When the job was advertised in 2022, some health care analysts said the bolstered salary still wasn\u2019t enough to compensate for a solo doctor\u2019s workload.",
      "But Louws, the departing doctor, said working solo prompted him to learn medical skills that he would have sent patients \u201ctwo minutes down the road\u201d for another practitioner to perform when he lived in the city. He also fulfilled a childhood dream of learning to milk dairy cows.",
      "\u201cThe money is plenty. It is,\u201d Louws said. \u201cOne of the things that I think people don\u2019t necessarily consider enough about this job is the other things that this town has to offer.\u201d",
      "Louws applied for the job three days after first hearing about Julia Creek, following study on Wikipedia. Soon, he and his wife and four children were packing to move.",
      "When he\u2019d been in the job six months, Louws said, he knew \u201cnine out of 10\u201d people in the town by name. \u201cIt feels kind of like stepping back in time about 60-odd years,\u201d he said. \u201cEveryone knows everyone.\u201d",
      "At the end of his two year contract in Julia Creek, however, the distance from his extended family had taken a toll and he plans to return to his practice in the city. Louws departs in May; applications for his post close Sunday.",
      "He's sorry to be leaving the \u201cincredible\u201d town.",
      "\u201cIt feels a lot closer,\" the doctor said. \"You get to really make a difference.\u201d",

      "PARIS -- The monthslong trial of former French President Nicolas Sarkozy over the alleged illegal financing of his 2007 presidential campaign is shedding light on France's back-channel talks with the government of then-Libyan leader Moammar Gadhafi.",
      "Family members of terrorist attacks sponsored by Gadhafi's regime have told the court they suspect that Sarkozy was willing to sacrifice the memories of their loved ones in order to normalize ties with Libya almost two decades ago.",
      "French prosecutors on Thursday requested a seven-year prison sentence for the 70-year-old former leader. Sarkozy, who was president from 2007 to 2012, has denied all wrongdoing.",
      "The trial, which started in January, is to continue until April 8, with Sarkozy's lawyers to plead on the last day. The verdict is expected at a later date.",
      "Some key moments in the trial have focused on talks between France and Libya in the 2000s, when Gadhafi was seeking to restore diplomatic ties with the West. Before that, Libya was considered a pariah state for having sponsored attacks.",
      "French families of victims of a 1989 plane bombing told the court about their shock and sense of betrayal as the trial questioned whether promises possibly made to Gadhafi\u2019s government were part of the alleged corruption deal.",
      "In 1988, a bomb planted aboard a Pam Am flight exploded while the plane was over the Scottish town of Lockerbie, killing 270 people from 21 countries, including 190 Americans.",
      "The following year, on Sept. 19, 1989, the bombing of UTA flight 772 over Niger killed 170 people, including 54 French nationals on board, after an in-flight explosion caused by a suitcase bomb.",
      "Both French and U.S. investigations have tied both bombings to Libya, whose government had engaged in long-running hostilities with the U.S. and other Western governments.",
      "Now, families of victims are wondering whether French government officials close to Sarkozy promised to forget about the bombings in exchange for business opportunities with the oil-rich nation and possibly, an alleged corruption deal.",
      "\u201cWhat did they do with our dead?\u201d Nicoletta Diasio, the daughter of a man who died in the bombing, has told the court, saying she wondered if the memories of the victims \u201ccould have been used for bartering\u201d in talks between France and Libya.",
      "During the trial, Sarkozy has said he has \u201cnever ever betrayed\u201d families of victims. \u201cI have never traded their fate for any compromise, nor pact of realpolitik,\u201d he said.",
      "Libya was long a pariah state for its involvement in the 1980s bombings.",
      "In 2003, it took responsibility for both the 1988 and 1989 plane bombings and agreed to pay billions in compensation to the victims\u2019 families.",
      "Gadhafi also announced he was dismantling his nuclear weapons program, which led to the lifting of international sanctions against the country.",
      "Britain, France and other Western countries sought to restore a relationship with Libya for security, diplomatic and business purposes.",
      "In 2007, Sarkozy welcomed Gadhafi to Paris with honors for a five-day official visit, allowing him to set up a bedouin tent near the Elysee presidential palace. Many French people still remember that gesture, feeling Sarkozy went too far to please a dictator.",
      "Sarkozy said during the trial he would have preferred to \u201cdo without\u201d Gadhafi\u2019s visit at the time but it came as a diplomatic gesture after Libya\u2019s release of Bulgarian nurses who were imprisoned and facing death sentences for a crime they said they did not commit.",
      "On July 24, 2007, under an accord partially brokered by first lady Cecilia Sarkozy and EU officials, Libya released the five Bulgarian nurses and a Palestinian doctor.",
      "The medics, who had spent over eight years in prison, faced death sentence on charges they deliberately infected hundreds of children with the AIDS virus in the late 1990s \u2014 an allegation they denied.",
      "The release of the medics removed the last major obstacle to Libya\u2019s rejoining the international community.",
      "Sarkozy travelled to the capital, Tripoli, for talks with Gadhafi the day after the medics were returned to Bulgaria on a French presidential plane.",
      "In court has spoken of his \u201cpride to have saved those six persons.\u201d",
      "\u201cIf you did not discuss with Gadhafi, you\u2019d not get the release of the nurses,\u201d he said.",
      "Accused of masterminding the attack on UTA Flight 772, Gadhafi\u2019s brother-in-law and intelligence chief Abdullah al-Senoussi was convicted in absentia to a life sentence by a Paris court in 1999 for the attack.",
      "An international arrest warrant was issued for him and five other suspects.",
      "Financial prosecutors have accused Sarkozy of having promised to lift the arrest warrant targeting al-Senoussi in exchange for alleged campaign financing.",
      "In 2005, people close to Sarkozy, who was at the time the interior minister, including his chief of staff Claude Gu\u00e9ant and junior minister Brice Hortefeux, travelled to Tripoli, where they met with al-Senoussi.",

      "Al-Senoussi told investigative judges that millions of dollars were provided to support Sarkozy\u2019s campaign. Accused of war crimes, he is now imprisoned in Libya.",
      "Sarkozy has strongly denied that.",
      "Gadhafi's son, Seif al-Islam, told the French news network RFI in January that he was personally involved in giving Sarkozy 5 million dollars in cash.",
      "Seif al-Islam sent RFI radio a two-page statement on his version of events. It was the first time he talked to the media about the case since 2011.",
      "He said Sarkozy initially \u201creceived $2.5 million from Libya to finance his electoral campaign\u201d during the 2007 presidential election, in return for which Sarkozy would \u201cconclude agreements and carry out projects in favour of Libya.\u201d",
      "He said a second payment of $2.5 million in cash was handed over without specifying when it was given.",
      "According to him, Libyan authorities expected that in return, Sarkozy would end a legal case about the 1989 UTA Flight 771 attack \u2014 including removing his name from an international warrant notice.",
      "Sarkozy strongly denied those allegations.",
      "\u201cYou\u2019ll never find one Libyan euro, one Libyan cent in my campaign,\" he said at the opening of the trial in January. \u201cThere\u2019s no corruption money because there was no corruption.\"",
      "The Libyan civil war started in February 2011, with army units and militiamen loyal to Gadhafi opposing rebels.",
      "Sarkozy was the first Western leader to take a public stance to support the rebellion.",
      "On Feb. 25, 2011, he said the violence by pro-Gadhafi forces was unacceptable and should not go unpunished. \u201cGadhafi must go,\u201d he said at the time.",
      "On March 10 that year, France was the first country in the world to recognize the National Transitional Council as the legitimate government of Libya.",

      "More than 4,200 people were killed from July to February, and another 1,356 were injured, the report found. It was issued after William O\u2019Neill, the U.N. human rights commissioner\u2019s expert on Haiti, recently visited the troubled Caribbean country.",
      "While much of the violence has been unleashed by gangs who formed a coalition last year known as \u201c Viv Ansamn,\u201d a growing number of people are being killed by self-defense groups and mobs, including at least 77 suspected gang members slain in November after gunmen tried to attack a community in the Port-au-Prince capital, the report stated.",
      "It also found that the number of people killed and injured by authorities fighting gangs \u201cremained extremely high.\u201d",
      "More than 2,000 people were killed during police operations from July to February, a 60% increase compared with the 1,253 killings reported from February to July of 2024.",
      "Some 73% of victims killed by law enforcement were reportedly gang members, but 27% \u201cwere not associated with gangs and were often struck by stray bullets while in the streets or at home,\u201d the report said. It noted that in some cases, police opened fire from armored vehicles \u201cwhere people were walking or selling goods on the streets.\u201d",
      "It also said police have been reportedly involved in summary executions of suspected gang members, their families, \u201cor individuals who, when intercepted, were unable to provide identification or offer a sufficient explanation for their presence in the area.\u201d",
      "The report stated that nearly 1,000 firearms belonging to Haiti\u2019s National Police have been diverted in the past four years, and that credible sources have said officers are selling some weapons on the black market.",

      "Overall, an estimated 270,000 to 500,000 illegal weapons are circulating across Haiti.",
      "\u201cThe use of these firearms has fueled a destructive cycle of violence in Haiti, leading to severe human rights abuses,\u201d the report stated.",

      "\u201cIt is ... at the lower end of seriousness of crimes amounting to wrongful death,\u201d Harrison said.",
      "A jury convicted White last year, and he was fired from the New South Wales police in December. He had faced a potential maximum sentence of 25 years in prison for manslaughter.",

      "\u201cIt was very disappointing for the family, because \u2014 well, a slap on the wrist for someone that\u2019s killed our mother,\u201d the son said. \u201cIt\u2019s very, very hard to process that.\u201d",

      "\u201dI deeply regret my actions and the severe consequences it has caused to not only Mrs. Nowland but also to your family and the greater community,\u201d White wrote.",
      "\u201cI take full responsibility for my actions. I felt and still feel horrible about what happened,\u201d he added.",
      "White did not speak to the media as he walked from the Sydney court Friday.",

      "Doctors have said he needs to spend at least two months of rest and recovery, avoiding large gatherings, after the respiratory illness that included two serious crises that brought him near death. The doctor who coordinated his hospital treatment, Dr. Sergio Alfieri, said this week that the medical team briefly considered stopping treatment after a Feb. 28 respiratory crisis, before deciding on an aggressive course that eventually beat the double pneumonia.",

      "SEOUL, South Korea -- SEOUL, South Korea (AP) \u2014 Multiple wildfires raging across South Korea\u2019s southern regions for days have killed 26 people and destroyed more than 300 structures, officials said, as thousands of personnel and dozens of helicopters were mobilized again Thursday to battle the the county\u2019s worst-ever blazes.",
      "Korea Forest Service chief Lim Sang-seop said \u201ca small amount\u201d - less than 5 millimeters (0.2 inches) - of rain was expected in the area on Thursday, not enough to play a meaningful role in extinguishing the wildfires.",
      "The fatalities include a pilot whose helicopter crashed during efforts to contain a fire and four firefighters and other workers who died after being trapped by fast-moving flames driven by strong winds.",
      "Authorities haven't disclosed details of the civilian dead, except that they are mostly in their 60s and 70s. They suspect human error caused several of the wildfires that began last Friday, including cases where people started fires while clearing overgrown grass from family tombs or with sparks during welding work.",
      "The wildfires have burned 35,810 hectares (88,488 acres) of land in the southeast, the government\u2019s disaster response center said in a report Thursday. Observers say that's the worst figure of its kind in South Korea. The report said the blazes have also injured nearly 30 people, destroyed about 320 buildings and structures and forced more than 24,200 people to evacuate.",
      "As of Thursday morning, the center said authorities were mobilizing more than 9,000 people and about 120 helicopters to battle the wildfires.",
      "\u201cDamages are snowballing,\u201d acting President Han Duck-soo said in a televised address Wednesday. \u201cThere are concerns that we\u2019ll have wildfire damages that we\u2019ve never experienced, so we have to concentrate all our capabilities on putting out the wildfires this week.\u201d",

Hikers were advised to leave the scenic Jiri Mountain as another fire spread closer.",
      "Officials said earlier this week that firefighters had extinguished most of the flames from the largest wildfires in key areas, but wind and dry conditions allowed them to spread again.",
      "Destroyed in the blazes were houses, factories, vehicles and some historic structures. In Uiseong, about 20 of the 30 structures at the Gounsa temple complex, which was said to be originally built in the 7th century, have been burned. Among them were two state-designated \u201ctreasures\u201d \u2014 a pavilion-shaped building erected overlooking a stream in 1668, and a Joseon dynasty structure built in 1904 to mark the longevity of a king.",

      "South Korea\u2019s military says North Korea sent around 3,000 additional troops to Russia in January and February in continued support for Russian President Vladimir Putin\u2019s war on Ukraine",
      "SEOUL, South Korea -- North Korea sent around 3,000 additional troops to Russia in January and February in continued support for Russian President Vladimir Putin\u2019s war on Ukraine, South Korea\u2019s military said Thursday in its latest assessment.",
      "The South\u2019s Joint Chiefs of Staff said North Korea has also been sending more missiles, artillery equipment and ammunition to help Russia and that North Korea could increase its weapons supplies further depending on the war situation. Russia and Ukraine recently agreed on a limited ceasefire, though both sides have accused each other of violations.",
      "The military equipment North Korea has sent to Russia includes a \u201cconsiderable amount\u201d of short-range ballistic missiles, 170 millimeter self-propelled howitzers and around 220 units of 240 millimeter multiple rocket launchers.",
      "North Korea has sent approximately 11,000 military personnel to fight in the war against Ukraine in its first involvement in a large-scale conflict since the 1950-53 Korean War, and the Joint Chiefs assessed that around 4,000 of them have been killed or wounded.",
      "South Korea\u2019s National Intelligence Service previously attributed the high North Korean casualties to the troops\u2019 likely struggles in adapting to drones and other elements of modern warfare. North Korean troops are further disadvantaged by the crude tactics of their Russian commanders, who have sent them into assault campaigns without providing rear-fire support, the spy agency told lawmakers in January.",
      "Still, Ukrainian military and intelligence officials have assessed that the North Koreans are gaining crucial battlefield experience and have been key to Russia\u2019s strategy of overwhelming Ukraine by throwing large numbers of soldiers into the battle for Kursk.",
      "The South Korean military report came after North Korean leader Kim Jong Un expressed his unwavering support for Russia\u2019s war in Ukraine during a meeting with a top Russian security official, Sergei Shoigu, last week in Pyongyang. State media reports said Kim and Shoigu reaffirmed their commitment to uphold a major mutual defense treaty agreed upon last year. Russian Deputy Foreign Minister Andrei Rudenko told Russian media on Thursday that the governments were discussing a potential visit by Kim to Moscow but did not specify when it might take place.",
      "\u201cWe always talk to everyone about exchanging visits. We are always preparing,\u201d he told RIA Novosti.",
      "Kim\u2019s military support of Russia has raised concerns that he may receive Russian technology transfers in return, further strengthening the threat posed by his nuclear-armed military. Experts say drones are among the potential areas where North Korea might seek to acquire Russian technology and know-how.",
      "North Korean state media said Thursday that Kim observed tests of newly developed reconnaissance and attack drones this week and called for their increased production. Kim in recent months has been emphasizing the development of drones, and the tests were the latest display of his country\u2019s growing military capabilities.",
      "Photos released by North Korea\u2019s official Korean Central News Agency showed Kim observing what appeared to be a large reconnaissance drone roughly resembling Boeing\u2019s E-7 Wedgetail airborne warning and control aircraft. Other images showed exploding drones crashing into military vehicles used as targets.",
      "The agency said the test demonstrated the reconnaissance drone\u2019s ability to track multiple targets and monitor troop movements on land and at sea, potentially enhancing North Korea\u2019s intelligence-gathering operations and ability to neutralize enemy threats. The report said the new exploding drones are designed for various attack missions and feature unspecified artificial intelligence capabilities.",
      "Kim expressed satisfaction with the drones\u2019 performance and approved plans to expand production, emphasizing that drones and AI should be \u201ctop\u201d priorities in efforts to advance his armed forces and adapt them to modern warfare, KCNA said. The agency said the tests took place as Kim visited a drone technology complex and an electronic warfare research group on Tuesday and Wednesday.",
      "Kim previously inspected other demonstrations of drones that explode on impact in November and August last year.",
      "When asked about the new reconnaissance drone, which North Korean state media unveiled for the first time, Lee Sung Joon, spokesperson for South Korea\u2019s Joint Chiefs of Staff, said that the North likely modified an existing aircraft to create an early-warning drone and may have used certain components from Russia. He said North Korea was possibly exaggerating the capabilities of the drone.",
      "\u201cAs you can see, it looks quite cumbersome and we assess that it\u2019s likely vulnerable to interception,\u201d Lee said during a briefing, without elaborating further on the assessment. __ AP writer Dasha Litvinova in Tallinn, Estonia, contributed to this report.",

      "A panel of Brazil Supreme Court justices unanimously ruled that former President Jair Bolsonaro and seven of his associates will stand trial on five counts, including attempting to stage a coup after the far-right leader lost the 2022 election",
      "SAO PAULO -- A panel of Brazil Supreme Court justices unanimously ruled that former President Jair Bolsonaro and seven of his associates will stand trial on five counts, including attempting to stage a coup after the far-right leader lost the 2022 election.",
      "The panel will review existing evidence, potentially gather new evidence and hear testimonies. Legal experts estimate that Bolsonaro could be sentenced to up to 40 years in prison, though his actual jail time \u2014 if convicted \u2014 would be less than that due to procedural considerations.",
      "Here\u2019s what to know about what will happen after Wednesday's ruling:",
      "Bolsonaro will stand trial on the counts of attempting to stage a coup, involvement in an armed criminal organization, attempted violent abolition of the democratic rule of law, damage characterized by violence and a serious threat against the state\u2019s assets, and deterioration of listed heritage.",
      "The five-justices panel of Brazil's Supreme Court ruled based on the indictment by Prosecutor-General, Paulo Gonet. His formal accusation came from a federal police investigation that placed Bolsonaro on the top of a criminal organization that had been active since at least 2021.",
      "Gonet also accused Bolsonaro of supporting a plan that allegedly included poisoning his successor, current President Luiz In\u00e1cio Lula da Silva, and killing Supreme Court Justice Alexandre de Moraes.",
      "While a specific trial date has not been set, the chairman of the Supreme Court panel is expected to outline the procedural framework in the coming days.",
      "Elo\u00edsa Machado, a law professor at the Fundacao Getulio Vargas university in Sao Paulo, explained that the evidentiary phase of the criminal case, which includes defendant interrogations, witness testimony and further procedures such as expert examinations, begins. Many of those procedures will be conducted by auxiliary judges.",
      "\u201cThen, the rapporteur prepares a report and requests a trial date,\" Machado said. \u201cAfter this stage, prosecutors and defense attorneys will present their final arguments before the court rules on whether to acquit or convict.\"",
      "Bolsonaro\u2019s defense team had requested the case to be sent to the full Supreme Court, not just on the 5-justice panel, which could drag a ruling into 2026 as all 11 justices would have their say on the case. The request was denied.",
      "Brazil\u2019s top court is using one of its two permanent 5-justice panels to put Bolsonaro on trial. None of the five was appointed by Bolsonaro.",
      "As rapporteur of the case, justice de Moraes brought the charges to the one he sits on.",
      "The other four justices are C\u00e1rmen L\u00facia, considered one of the harshest on criminal cases; Cristiano Zanin, the chairman of the panel and Lula's attorney between 2013 and 2023; Fl\u00e1vio Dino, appointed by the leftist president in 2023 after serving as his justice minister; and Luiz Fux, the court's chief-justice between 2020 and 2022, considered a moderate.",
      "Brazilian criminal law mandates that arrests occur only after a final, unappealable conviction.",
      "The Supreme Court of Brazil, being the final appeals tribunal for criminal cases involving public authorities, possesses ultimate jurisdiction over Bolsonaro's case.",
      "If the former president takes any action that hampers the court\u2019s ability to deliver its ruling, such as seeking shelter in an embassy, he could be arrested before the trial ends.",
      "Bolsonaro, who has been banned from running for office until 2030 for abuse of power and undermining confidence in the country\u2019s voting system, has denied wrongdoing and claims he is the target of political persecution.",
      "\u201cIf I go to jail, I will give you a lot of work,\u201d Bolsonaro said after Wednesday's Supreme Court's decision.",
      "Lula was convicted of corruption and money laundering by low court judge Sergio Moro in 2017, and had his sentence later upheld by a group of magistrates. He served more than a year and seven months in prison and was released after the Supreme Court changed its jurisprudence to forbid jail time for any Brazilian until all appeals are exhausted.",
      "In 2021, the same court annulled Lula's sentence as it found Moro to be biased. Moro left his position as a federal judge to become Bolsonaro's justice minister.",
      "Michel Temer, who governed between 2016 and 2018 after Dilma Rousseff was impeached, was acquitted by a federal court in 2024 in a corruption and money laundering case. He was briefly arrested in 2019 under the accusation of profiting from fraudulent contracts between state-run Eletronuclear and companies AF Consult Ltd and Engevix during his time as vice president.",
      "Fernando Collor, who governed between 1990 and his impeachment in 1992, was sentenced to eight years and ten months in jail in 2023 for his role in a corruption scheme at then state-run BR Distribuidora. The sentence was upheld by the Supreme Court last year, but Collor is yet to be imprisoned.",
      "The inclusion of high-ranking military officials to stand trial in Brazil's top court is unprecedented, as the country's transition from a military dictatorship to democracy in the 1980s was marked by a sweeping amnesty for military personnel.",
      "Four high-ranking military officials who operated under Bolsonaro will stand trial. These are former Defense Minister Paulo S\u00e9rgio Nogueira; former Navy commander Almir Garnier Santos; retired Gen. Augusto Heleno, who headed the Institutional Security Office; and retired Gen. Walter Braga Netto, who served as Bolsonaro\u2019s chief of staff and defense minister.",

      "JUBA, South Sudan -- South Sudan\u2019s main opposition party said Thursday a peace agreement that ended a five-year civil war has collapsed, following the arrest of its leader Riek Machar a day earlier.",
      "The party's deputy chairperson, Oyet Nathaniel Pierino, said in a statement that the agreement \"has been abrogated\u201d and that Machar's arrest shows a lack of political goodwill to achieve peace and stability.",
      "The U.N. warned on Monday that the country was teetering on the edge of a renewed civil war following fighting in the north between an armed group allied to Machar and government forces.",
      "And U.N. spokesperson St\u00e9phane Dujarric intensified that warning Thursday after Machar's arrest, saying: \u201cWe warn that this action takes the country yet one step closer to the edge of a collapse into civil war and the dismantling of the peace agreement.\u201d",
      "He said \"it is unimaginable that the political leaders would allow their country to go back into a state of bloody civil war and the tragedy that would ensue,\u201d adding that \u201cIt is vital that the leaders of the country put the interest of the people first and foremost.\"",
      "The head of the U.N peacekeeping mission in South Sudan, Nicholas Haysom, said following reports of the detention of Machar all parties should \u201cexercise restraint and uphold the Revitalized Peace Agreement,\u201d which Dujarric said \u201cwould include restoring the freedom of the first vice president.\u201d",
      "South Sudan\u2019s five-year civil war, in which 400,000 people were killed, ended in a 2018 peace agreement that brought President Salva Kiir and Machar together in a unity government. Machar is one of the five vice presidents in the country.",
      "Machar was \u201cin confinement by the government\u201d and his life was \u201cat risk,\u201d opposition spokesperson Pal Mai Deng said in a video address to the media Wednesday night.",
      "Tensions have been increasing between Kiir and Machar\u2019s parties and escalated in March when the White Army, an armed group loyal to Machar, overran an army base in Upper Nile state and attacked a U.N helicopter.",
      "The government responded with airstrikes, warning any civilian in the area where the army group is based to vacate or \u201cface consequences.\u201d",
      "More than a dozen people have died since the airstrikes started in mid-March and the UN warned of a renewed civil war if the leaders do not put the country\u2019s interests first.",
      "\u201cTonight, the country\u2019s leaders stand on the brink of relapsing into widespread conflict or taking the country forward towards peace, recovery and democracy in the spirit of the consensus that was reached in 2018 when they signed and committed to implementing a Revitalized Peace Agreement,\u201d Haysom said in a statement on Wednesday night.",
      "An opposition official described 20 heavily armed vehicles arriving at Machar's home where he was arrested alongside his wife.",
      "\u201cHis bodyguards were disarmed, and an arrest warrant was delivered to him under unclear charges,\u201d said Reath Muoch Tang, an official in the Sudan People\u2019s Liberation Movement/Army - In Opposition.",
      "The African Union Commission's chair, Mahmoud Ali Youssouf, said he would deploy a team to Juba \u201cas part of efforts to de-escalate the situation.\u201d",
      "In a statement on X, the U.S. State Department's bureau of African affairs urged Kiir to reverse the house arrest and \u201cprevent further escalation of the situation.\"",
      "The chairperson of the U.N commission on human rights in South Sudan, Yasmin Sooka, said on Thursday that \"the deliberate targeting of opposition leaders and civilians represents a reckless disregard for international law and the country\u2019s future.\u201d",
      "In early March, several of Machar\u2019s senior allies were arrested by security forces, an action his supporters condemned as a \u201cgrave violation\u201d of the peace deal.",
      "Germany and Norway have temporarily closed their respective embassies in Juba. The U.S Embassy further reduced its minimal staff due to security threats and advised Americans who are in the country to prepare to shelter should the \u201csituation deteriorate further.\u201d The British Embassy also said it had temporarily reduced its staff with consular services \u201cseverely limited.\u201d",

      "Mexico says a government-sponsored junk food ban in schools has taken effect as the country tries to tackle one of the world\u2019s worst obesity and diabetes epidemics",
      "MEXICO CITY -- A government-sponsored junk food ban in schools across Mexico took effect on Saturday, officials said, as the country tries to tackle one of the world\u2019s worst obesity and diabetes epidemics.",
      "The health guidelines, first published last fall, take a direct shot at salty and sweet processed products that have become a staple for generations of Mexican schoolchildren, such as sugary fruit drinks, packaged chips, artificial pork rinds and soy-encased, chili-flavored peanuts.",
      "Announcing the ban had become law, Mexico's Education Ministry posted on X: \u201cFarewell, junk food!\u201d And it encouraged parents to support the government's crusade by cooking healthy meals for their kids.",
      "Mexico's ambitious attempt to remake its food culture and reprogram the next generation of consumers is being watched closely around the world as governments struggle to turn the tide on a global obesity epidemic.",
      "In the United States, for instance, the Trump administration\u2019s health secretary, Robert F. Kennedy Jr., has vowed to upend the nation's food system and \u201c Make America Healthy Again \" by targeting ultra-processed foods to curb surging obesity and disease.",
      "Under Mexico's new order, schools must phase out any food and beverage displaying even one black warning logo marking it as high in salt, sugar, calories and fat. Mexico implemented that compulsory front-of-package labeling system in 2020.",
      "Enforced from Monday morning, the start of the school week, the junk food ban also requires schools to serve more nutritious alternatives to junk food, like bean tacos, and offer plain drinking water.",
      "\u201cIt is much better to eat a bean taco than a bag of potato chips,\u201d said Mexican President Claudia Sheinbaum, who has championed the effort.",
      "Mexico\u2019s children consume more junk food than anywhere else in Latin America, according to UNICEF, which classifies the nation\u2019s childhood obesity epidemic as an emergency. Sugary drinks and highly processed foods account for 40% of the total calories that children consume in a day, the agency reports.",
      "One-third of Mexican children are already considered overweight or obese, according to government statistics.",
      "School administrators found in violation of the order face stiff fines, ranging from $545 to $5,450.",
      "But enforcement poses a challenge in a country where previous junk food bans have struggled to gain traction and monitoring has been lax across Mexico\u2019s 255,000 schools, many of which lack water fountains and even reliable internet and electricity.",
      "It also wasn't immediately clear how the government would forbid the sale of junk food on sidewalks outside school campuses, where street vendors typically hawk candy, chips, nachos and ice cream to kids during recess and after the school day ends.",

      "SAN FRANCISCO -- Crowds protesting billionaire Elon Musk\u2019s purge of the U.S. government under President Donald Trump began amassing outside Tesla dealerships throughout the U.S. Saturday in the latest attempt to dent the fortune of the world\u2019s richest man.",
      "The protesters are trying to escalate a movement targeting Tesla dealerships and vehicles in opposition to Musk\u2019s role as the head of the newly created Department of of Government Efficiency, or DOGE, where he\u2019s gained access to sensitive data and shuttered entire agencies as he attempts to slash government spending. Most of Musk\u2019s estimated $340 billion fortune consists of the stock he holds in the electric vehicle company that he continues to run while also working alongside Trump.",
      "Earlier protests have been somewhat sporadic. Saturday marked the first attempt to surround all 277 of the automaker\u2019s showrooms and service centers in the U.S. in hopes of deepening a recent decline in the company\u2019s sales.",
      "By early afternoon, crowds ranging from a few dozen to hundreds of protesters had flocked to Tesla locations in New Jersey, Massachusetts, Connecticut, New York, Maryland, Minnesota and the automaker's home state of Texas. Pictures posted on social media accounts showed protesters brandishing signs such as \u201cHonk if you hate Elon\u201d and \u201cFight the billionaire broligarchy.\u201d",
      "The Tesla Takedown movement also hoped to rally protestors at more than 230 Tesla locations in other parts of the world. Although the turnouts in Europe weren't as large as the crowds in the U.S., the anti-Musk sentiment was similar.",
      "About two dozen protesters held signs lambasting Musk outside a Tesla dealership in London as passing cars and trucks tooted horns in support.",
      "One of the signs displayed at the London protest showed a photo of Musk next to an image of Adolf Hitler making the Nazi salute \u2014 a gesture that Musk has been accused of reprising shortly after Trump's Jan. 20 inauguration. A person in a tyrannosaurus rex costume held another sign with a picture of Musk's straight-arm gesture that said, \u201cYou thought the Nazis were extinct. Don\u2019t buy a Swasticar.\u201d",
      "\u201cWe just want to get loud, make noise, make people aware of the problems that we\u2019re facing,\u201d said Cam Whitten, an American who showed up at the London protest.",
      "Tesla Takedown was organized by a group of supporters that included disillusioned owners of the automaker\u2019s vehicles, celebrities such as actor John Cusack, and at least one Democratic Party lawmaker, Rep. Jasmine Crockett from Dallas.",
      "\u201cI\u2019m going to keep screaming in the halls of Congress. I just need you all to make sure you all keep screaming in the streets,\u201d Crockett said during a Tesla Takedown organizing call held earlier this month.",
      "Some people opposed to Musk have gone beyond protests and set the automaker\u2019s vehicles on fire and committed other acts of vandalism that U.S. Attorney General Pam Bondi has decried as domestic terrorism. Musk indicated he was dumbfounded by the attacks during a March 20 company meeting and said the vandals should \"stop acting psycho.\u201d",
      "Crockett and other Tesla Takedown supporters have been stressing the importance for Saturday\u2019s protests to remain peaceful.",
      "But police were investigating a fire that destroyed seven Tesla vehicles in northwestern Germany early Saturday morning. It was wasn't immediately clear if the blaze, which was extinguished by firefighters, was related to the Tesla Takedown protests.",
      "A growing number of consumers who bought Tesla vehicles before Musk took over DOGE have been looking to sell or trade in their cars while others have slapped on bumper stickers seeking to distance themselves from the billionaire\u2019s efforts to prune or shut down government agencies.",
      "But Musk didn\u2019t appear concerned about an extended slump in sales of new Tesla cars in his March 20 address to employees. He reassured the workers that the company\u2019s Model Y, which is undergoing a refresh, would remain \u201cthe best-selling car on Earth again this year.\u201d He also predicted Tesla will have sold more than 10 million cars worldwide by next year, up from about 7 million cars now.",
      "\u201cThere are times when there are rocky moments, where there is stormy weather, but what I am here to tell you is that the future is incredibly bright and exciting,\u201d Musk said.",
      "After Trump was elected last November, investors initially saw Musk\u2019s alliance with the president as a positive development for Tesla and its long-running efforts to launch a network of self-driving cars.",
      "That optimism helped lift Tesla\u2019s stock by 70% in the period between Trump\u2019s Nov. 5 election and his Jan. 20 inauguration, creating an additional $560 billion in shareholder wealth. But virtually all those gains have evaporated amid investor worries about the Tesla backlash, lagging sales in the U.S., Europe and China, and Musk spending time overseeing DOGE.",
      "\u201cThis continues to be a moment of truth for Musk to navigate this brand tornado crisis moment and get onto the other side of this dark chapter for Tesla,\u201d Wedbush Securities analyst Dan Ives said in a research note leading up to Saturday\u2019s protests.",

      "U.S. states are positioning themselves to compete for newer, cheaper nuclear reactors being developed as communities and tech giants compete in a race for electricity",
      "HARRISBURG, Pa. -- With the promise of newer, cheaper nuclear power on the horizon, U.S. states are vying to position themselves to build and supply the industry's next generation as policymakers consider expanding subsidies and paving over regulatory obstacles.",
      "Advanced reactor designs from competing firms are filling up the federal government's regulatory pipeline as the industry touts them as a reliable, climate-friendly way to meet electricity demands from tech giants desperate to power their fast-growing artificial intelligence platforms.",
      "The reactors could be operational as early as 2030, giving states a short runway to roll out the red carpet, and they face lingering public skepticism about safety and growing competition from renewables like wind and solar. Still, the reactors have high-level federal support, and utilities across the U.S. are working to incorporate the energy source into their portfolios.",
      "Last year, 25 states passed legislation to support advanced nuclear energy and this year lawmakers have introduced over 200 bills supportive of nuclear energy, said Marc Nichol of the Nuclear Energy Institute, a trade association whose members include power plant owners, universities and labor unions.",
      "\u201cWe\u2019ve seen states taking action at ever-increasing levels for the past few years now,\u201d Nichol said in an interview.",
      "Smaller reactors are, in theory, faster to build and easier to site than conventional reactors. They could be factory-built from standard parts and are touted as flexible enough to plunk down for a single customer, like a data center or an industrial complex.",
      "Advanced reactors, called small modular reactors and microreactors, produce a fraction of the energy produced by the conventional nuclear reactors built around the world for the last 50 years. Where conventional reactors produce 800 to 1,000 megawatts, or enough to power about half a million homes, modular reactors produce 300 megawatts or less and microreactors produce no more than 20 megawatts.",
      "Tech giants Amazon and Google are investing in nuclear reactors to get the power they need, as states compete with Big Tech, and each other, in a race for electricity.",
      "For some state officials, nuclear is a carbon-free source of electricity that helps them meet greenhouse gas-reduction goals. Others see it as an always-on power source to replace an accelerating wave of retiring coal-fired power plants.",
      "Tennessee Gov. Bill Lee last month proposed more than $90 million to help subsidize a Tennessee Valley Authority project to install several small reactors, boost research and attract nuclear tech firms.",
      "Long a proponent of the TVA's nuclear project, Lee also launched Tennessee's Nuclear Energy Fund in 2023, designed to attract a supply chain, including a multibillion-dollar uranium enrichment plant billed as the state's biggest-ever industrial investment.",
      "In Utah, where Gov. Spencer Cox announced \u201cOperation Gigawatt\u201d to double the state's electricity generation in a decade, the Republican wants to spend $20 million to prepare sites for nuclear. State Senate President J. Stuart Adams told colleagues when he opened the chamber's 2025 session that Utah needs to be the \u201cnation\u2019s nuclear hub.\"",
      "Texas Gov. Greg Abbott declared his state is \u201cready to be No. 1 in advanced nuclear power\" as Texas lawmakers consider billions in nuclear power incentives.",
      "Michigan lawmakers are considering millions of dollars in incentives to develop and use the reactors, as well as train a nuclear industry workforce.",
      "One state over, Indiana lawmakers this month passed legislation to let utilities more quickly seek reimbursement for the cost to build a modular reactor, undoing a decades-old prohibition designed to protect ratepayers from bloated, inefficient or, worse, aborted power projects.",
      "In Arizona, lawmakers are considering a utility-backed bill to relax environmental regulations if a utility builds a reactor at the site of a large industrial power user or a retired coal-fired power plant.",
      "Still, the devices face an uncertain future.",
      "No modular reactors are operating in the U.S. and a project to build the first, this one in Idaho, was terminated in 2023, despite getting federal aid.",
      "The U.S. Department of Energy last year, under then-President Joe Biden, estimated the U.S. will need an additional 200 gigawatts of new nuclear capacity to keep pace with future power demands and reach net-zero emissions of planet-warming greenhouse gases by 2050 to avoid the worst effects of climate change.",
      "The U.S. currently has just under 100 gigawatts of nuclear power operating. More than 30 advanced nuclear projects are under consideration or planned to be in operation by the early 2030s, Nichol of the NEI said, but those would supply just a fraction of the 200 gigawatt goal.",
      "Work to produce a modular reactor has drawn billions of dollars in federal subsidies, loan guarantees and more recently tax credits signed into law by Biden.",
      "Those have been critical to the nuclear industry, which expects them to survive under President Donald Trump, whose administration it sees as a supporter.",
      "The U.S. remains without a long-term solution for storing radioactive waste, safety regulators are under pressure from Congress to approve designs and there are serious questions about industry claims that the smaller reactors are efficient, safe and reliable, said Edwin Lyman, director of nuclear power safety at the Union of Concerned Scientists.",
      "Plus, Lyman said, \u201cthe likelihood that those are going to be deployable and instantly 100% reliable right out of the gate is just not consistent with the history of nuclear power development. And so it\u2019s a much riskier bet.\u201d",
      "Nuclear also has competition from renewable energies.",
      "Brendan Kochunas, an assistant professor of nuclear engineering at the University of Michigan, said advanced reactors may have a short window to succeed, given the regulatory scrutiny they undergo and the advances in energy storage technologies to make wind and solar power more reliable.",
      "Those storage technologies could develop faster, bring down renewables' cost and, ultimately, make more economic sense than nuclear, Kochunas said.",
      "The supply chain for building reactors is another question.",
      "The U.S. lacks high-quality concrete- and steel-fabrication design skills necessary to manufacture a nuclear power plant, Kochunas said.",
      "That introduces the prospect of higher costs and longer timelines, he said. While foreign suppliers could help, there also is the fuel to consider.",
      "Kathryn Huff, a former top Energy Department official who is now an associate professor at the University of Illinois Urbana-Champaign, said uranium enrichment capacity in the U.S. and among its allies needs to grow in order to support reactor production.",
      "First-of-their-kind reactors need to get up and running close to their target dates, Huff said, \"in order for anyone to have faith that a second or third or fourth one should be built.\u201d",

      "A federal judge has halted the Trump administration\u2019s efforts to dismantle the Voice of America, the eight-decade-old U.S. government-funded international news service",
      "NEW YORK -- The Voice of America can\u2019t be silenced just yet.",
      "A federal judge on Friday halted the Trump administration\u2019s efforts to dismantle the eight-decade-old U.S. government-funded international news service, calling the move a \u201cclassic case of arbitrary and capricious decision making.\u201d",
      "Judge James Paul Oetken blocked the U.S. Agency for Global Media, which runs Voice of America, from firing more than 1,200 journalists, engineers and other staff that it sidelined two weeks ago in the wake of President Donald Trump ordered its funding slashed.",
      "Oetken issued a temporary restraining order barring the agency from \u201cany further attempt to terminate, reduce-in-force, place on leave, or furlough\u201d employees or contractors, and from closing any offices or requiring overseas employees to return to the U.S.",
      "The order also bars the Agency for Global Media from terminating grant funding for its other broadcast outlets, including Radio Free Europe/Radio Liberty, Radio Free Asia and Radio Free Afghanistan. The agency said Thursday it was restoring Radio Free Europe\u2019s funding after a judge in Washington, D.C. ordered it to do so.",
      "\u201cThis is a decisive victory for press freedom and the First Amendment, and a sharp rebuke\u201d to the Trump administration\u2019s \u201cutter disregard for the principles that define our democracy,\u201d said the plaintiffs\u2019 lawyer Andrew G. Celli Jr.",
      "At a hearing Friday in Manhattan, Oetken faulted the Trump administration for \u201ctaking a sledgehammer to an agency that has been statutorily authorized and funded by Congress.\u201d",
      "The judge criticized the agency\u2019s leadership, including special adviser Kari Lake, for pulling the plug \u201cseemingly overnight\u201d on the U.S. government\u2019s global, soft-power megaphone with \u201cno consideration of the effects.\u201d",
      "Oetken ruled after a coalition of Voice of America journalists, labor unions and the nonprofit journalism advocacy group Reporters Without Borders sued the Trump administration last week to block the cuts. Ultimately, they seek to have VOA return to the air.",
      "The plaintiffs argued the shutdown violated a court\u2019s finding during Trump\u2019s first term that VOA journalists have a free-speech firewall protecting them from White House interference. Their absence from the airwaves has left a vacuum that\u2019s being filled by \u201cpropagandists whose messages will monopolize global airwaves,\u201d the plaintiffs said.",
      "Trump and other Republicans have accused Voice of America of a \u201cleftist bias\u201d and failing to project \u201cpro-American\u201d values to its worldwide audience, even though it is mandated by congress to serve as a non-partisan news organization.",
      "Voice of America went off the air soon after Trump issued an executive order on March 14 that pared funding to the Agency for Global Media and six other unrelated federal entities \u2014 part of his campaign to shrink government and align its with his political agenda.",
      "The White House called the service \u201cThe Voice of Radical America\u201d and said Trump\u2019s order would \u201censure that taxpayers are no longer on the hook for radical propaganda.\u201d It cited coverage it said was \u201ctoo favorable\u201d to former President Joe Biden, as well as stories about white privilege, racial profiling and transgender migrants seeking asylum.",
      "Congress has appropriated nearly $860 million for the Agency for Global Media for the current fiscal year.",
      "Three federal lawsuits in Washington, D.C. are challenging other aspects of the cuts, including one brought by Voice of America\u2019s director and three journalists. Oetken said he\u2019ll rule at a later date on the government\u2019s request to move his case there.",
      "Voice of America has operated since World War II, beaming news into authoritarian countries that don\u2019t have a free press. It began as a counterpoint to Nazi propaganda and played a prominent role in the U.S. government\u2019s Cold War efforts to curb the spread of communism.",
      "According to the lawsuit, Voice of America employees were told to finish their live broadcasts on March 15, then vacate the building. Soon after, the lawsuit said, they lost access to agency computer systems, including email. Voice of America\u2019s news website hasn\u2019t been updated since.",
      "Lake, a former TV news anchor and political candidate, said she has been determining how many people are required to operate some of these outlets at the minimum staffing levels allowed by law.",
      "Some people have been brought back to work and at least one service \u2014 Radio Marti in Cuba \u2014 has returned to the air, Lake told One America News Network in an interview posted Thursday on X.",
      "\u201cWe\u2019re going to get lawsuits,\u201d Lake said. \u201cThis is just par for the course. We\u2019ve been victims \u2014 President Trump has, I myself have \u2014 of \u2018lawfare\u2019. It\u2019s the same cast of characters that is trying to put landmines in the ways of every step President Trump and this administration is trying to do to get this government back in line to where we can actually afford it.\u201d",
      "Lake, echoing the White House\u2019s complaints, said: \u201cWe want to make sure that these agencies are in line with what our American values are. We\u2019re telling America\u2019s story. We\u2019re not telling our adversaries\u2019 stories.\u201d",
      "\u201cBy God,\" she said, \u201cwe\u2019re not going to be putting out anti-American garbage.\u201d",

      "The Metals Company in Vancouver, Canada said late Thursday that it is seeking permission from the U.S. government to start deep-sea mining in international waters, potentially bypassing the International Seabed Authority, which has the power to authorize exploitation permits but has yet to do so.",
      "\u201cIt would be a major breach of international law\u2026if the U.S. were to grant it,\u201d said Duncan Currie, an international and environmental lawyer and legal adviser to the Deep Sea Conservation Coalition, a Netherlands-based alliance of environmental groups.",
      "The Metals Company seeks seafloor minerals like cobalt, copper, nickel and manganese used in electric car batteries and other green technology.",

      "She said one question is whether the company plans to request a permit anyway from the authority even as it continues talks with the U.S. government.",

      "The Metals Company argued that the United States\u2019 seabed mining code would allow it to start operations in international waters since it's not a member of the authority and therefore not bound by its rules.",

Letting deep-sea mining go forward now would be like starting a fire in a library of books nobody\u2019s even read yet,\" said Emily Jeffers, a senior attorney at the Center for Biological Diversity.",

      "The fine, issued on Thursday, is the second-largest handed down by the Nevada Gaming Commission, which has authority over disciplinary action.",

      "While he was perhaps best known for his work on One World Trade Center, considered to be the tallest building in the Western Hemisphere, Childs also was instrumental in other important projects, including a new master plan for the National Mall in Washington, D.C., an expansion of Dulles International Airport in Virginia and the 7 World Trade Center building in Manhattan, according to his firm, Skidmore, Owings & Merrill.",
      "\u201cDavid\u2019s contribution to the firm was extensive and profound, and we will always be grateful to David for his leadership, his impact, and his friendship,\u201d Skidmore, Owings & Merrill said in a statement. \u201cWe will miss him dearly and extend our condolences and deepest sympathies to his family.\u201d",
      "A fond memory that Nicholas Childs has was when his father drew a rendering of what the One World Trade Center property would look like while they were out having lunch in New York, some years after 9/11 but well before the plans were finalized.",
      "\u201cHe picked up a paper napkin, took out a pen, and drew what became the ultimate design of the building on the napkin for me,\u201d Nicholas Childs said in a phone interview Friday, adding that he still has the drawing.",
      "He said his father was a civic-minded architect who would often use a quote by 20th century American-German architect Ludwig Mies van der Rohe \u2014 \u201cGod is in the details.\u201d",
      "\u201cHe cared deeply about those details and making something beautiful,\u201d Nicholas Childs said. \u201cBut he also wanted to make sure, I think as any great architect, that it was a balance of form and function, that it worked for people.\u201d",
      "The 1,776-foot-tall (540-meter-tall) One World Trade Center, once known as the Freedom Tower, is the centerpiece of the redevelopment of ground zero, along with the memorial pools placed where the Twin Towers stood. Opened in 2014, it sports a steel and glass structure that rises into the sky with a tapered, eight-triangle body, topped by a 408-foot-tall (124-meter-tall) needle.",
      "The final design was produced after contentious negotiations between Childs and Daniel Libeskind, who designed the overall plan for the site, and arguments between government officials over what should be built at ground zero and objections by some relatives of 9/11 victims to the design of the Trade Center memorial.",
      "Libeskind had drawn the first plans for building, a twisting glass skyscraper with an off-center spire meant to invoke the Statue of Liberty.",
      "Childs produced a sleeker version of Libeskind\u2019s design, then reworked it after police expressed concerns that the building was not sturdy enough to withstand a truck bomb.",
      "In announcing the new design plans, Childs said the One World Trade Center tower is \u201ciconic, simple and pure in its form, a memorable form that will reclaim the resilience and the spirit of our democracy.\u201d",
      "He also called it \u201cthe safest building in the world,\u201d with features including wider staircases, a separate stairway and elevator for firefighters, \u201cblast-resistant glazing\u201d and more public stairways with direct access to the street.",
      "Childs was born in Princeton, New Jersey, in 1941 and grew up in his early childhood years in Washington, D.C., before moving to Mount Kisco, New York. He attended the private Deerfield Academy in Deerfield, Massachusetts, before going to Yale University in New Haven, Connecticut, where he earned a bachelor's degree and a master's degree in architecture.",
      "He was hired by Skidmore, Owings & Merrill in 1971 for its Washington, D.C., office, where he worked on projects including a new master plan for the National Mall, the Constitution Gardens park along the mall and the Four Seasons Hotel.",
      "He transferred to the firm's New York City office in 1984 and had a hand in significant projects in the city, including 1 Worldwide Plaza in the Hell's Kitchen section of Manhattan and the Deutsche Bank Center, formerly called the Time Warner Center, with its twin skyscraper towers at Columbus Circle.",
      "Childs also worked on the U.S. embassy in Ottawa, Canada, the Canary Wharf development in London and King Abdulaziz International Airport in Jeddah, Saudi Arabia.",
      "In 2004, he was honored with a Rome Prize for architecture, awarded by the American Academy in Rome for innovative work in the arts and humanities.",
      "Childs is survived by his wife, Annie; three children, Nicholas, Joshua and Jocelyn; and several grandchildren.",

      "The company promoted itself as a way for financially needy students to obtain more aid faster, in return for a few hundred dollars in fees. Javice appeared regularly on cable news programs to boost Frank\u2019s profile, once appearing on Forbes\u2019 \u201c30 Under 30\u201d list before JPMorgan bought the startup in 2021.",
      "JPMorgan executives testified that she told them she had over four million clients and would have about 10 million by year\u2019s end, but it turned out there were only about 300,000 customers.",
      "Javice\u2019s lawyer, Jose Baez, told the jury that JPMorgan knew what it was getting in the deal, and made up the fraud allegations due to buyer\u2019s remorse after government regulatory changes made the data it received in the deal useless to its hopes of gaining new young customers.",

      "\u201cThe worst case scenario is that you don\u2019t file and end up being liable for penalties later on,\u201d said Emily DiVito, senior advisor for economic policy at the nonprofit Groundwork Collaborative and former U.S. Treasury advisor. \u201cThat\u2019s not good for anyone. But there are opportunities to ask for extensions and to go on payment plans.\u201d",
      "Here's what to know:",
      "In addition to tacking on interest and penalties, the IRS can eventually garnish your wages, place a lien on your property, or even place a hold on your passport. But if you file for an extension, or if you file your return with your financial information, you can avoid these consequences. Even if you don't have the money to pay what you owe in full by April 15, paying just a small part when you file.",
      "Yes. Volunteer Income Tax Assistance (VITA) sites across the country are staffed with volunteers who will help you file a return or arrange for an extension for free. These volunteers can help you set up an installment payment plan of as many as 72 months to pay off any owed taxes. The IRS Direct File program is also free to use.",
      "\u201cWhile the question mark when you go to click the button to pay can be intimidating, we want to make sure that taxpayers get the money you\u2019re owed, too,\u201d said DiVito. \u201cMost taxpayers \u2014 certainly most working taxpayers \u2014 get money back. But the way that a lot of the tax credits function, you only get that refund if you file your taxes in the first place.\u201d",
      "If you've experienced unusual hardship, and you share that with the IRS, the IRS can sometimes put your account in \u201ccurrently-not-collectible\u201d status. To do that, you share information about your income and living expenses, and the IRS determines if you qualify.",
      "\u201cLet\u2019s say you\u2019ve been ill, and you lost your job from illness, and you have serious medical bills. You\u2019ve had all the bad luck, and things happened outside of your control, and you need some relief,\u201d said O\u2019Saben. \u201cThen the IRS can place you in uncollectable status. But all of this requires conversation and communication. No one wants to admit they\u2019re having economic problems, but the IRS will work with you if you do.\u201d",
      "There are also rare circumstances in which the IRS will settle your tax debt for less than the amount owed, called an \u201coffer in compromise.\u201d VITA tax professionals can also help you see if you're eligible, or you can use a free IRS tool online.",
      "That's OK. Start now.",
      "\u201cI\u2019ve been doing taxes for more than 35 years,\u201d said O'Saben. \u201cThe number one reason people don't file is that they have a feeling they may owe \u2014 which could be wrong \u2014 and they don\u2019t want to face it. But it's not a problem that's going to go away. So tell the IRS the truth of the situation. And they will work with you.\u201d",
      "Miklos Ringbauer, a CPA and tax professional in California, echoed this.",
      "\u201cIt's perfectly okay,\u201d he said. \u201cThe IRS deals with every single taxpayer. They have dealt with this before. There's nothing they haven't seen.\u201d",

      "Chinese President Xi Jinping has urged foreign investors to have faith in China's business prospects in an address to major global business leaders",
      "BEIJING -- In an address to major global business leaders, Chinese President Xi Jinping urged foreign investors to have faith in China\u2019s business prospects, the latest move to revive the world\u2019s second-largest economy that has been dragged down by a property bust and a loss of momentum.",
      "\u201cChina has always been and will certainly be an ideal, safe and promising investment destination for foreign investors,\u201d Xi told executives, including Akio Toyoda, chairman of Toyota, Lee Jae-yong, chairman of Samsung Electronics and Stephen Allen Schwarzman, CEO of investment firm Blackstone.",
      "China remains a major exporter of products to countries around the world and boasts a domestic market of 1.4 billion people. However, massive overbuilding in the property sector has tied up trillions of dollars in capital, sapping business and consumer confidence and depriving the economy of its past vitality, while a tariff war unleashed by the U.S. is compounding those problems.",
      "Private businesses, which provide a large share of growth and jobs in the country\u2019s state-dominated economy, have borne much of the burden after years of regulatory crackdowns have shaken the confidence of entrepreneurs and other investors.",
      "China's unprecedentedly tough response to the COVID-19 outbreak also shut down business for much of three years and some sectors of the economy have yet to recover, particularly where global supply chains are involved.",
      "Yet, Xi, considered something a sceptic when it comes to inviting in overseas businesses, said foreign investors could have confidence that \u201cthe door of opening up will only open wider and wider. The policy of utilizing foreign investment has not changed and will not change,\u201d he said.",
      "\u201cChina contains huge investment and consumption potential,\u201d he added.",
      "China has set an economic growth target of about 5% for this year, the same as last year and a level that analysts said would be difficult to achieve.",
      "The government has said it would attempt to stimulate the roughly $20 trillion economy by borrowing more money for a slew of initiatives, such as giving 300 billion yuan ($41.3 billion) in rebates to consumers who trade in old cars and appliances for new ones. But much of the borrowing will go to supporting the housing market and local governments weighed down by debt.",
      "What is clear is that a trade war with the United States has left the outlook for the coming months uncertain. Trump has raised tariffs on imports from China twice since taking office in January, leaving them at 20% across-the-board. China has shown no sign of backing down, retaliating with tariffs on U.S. goods.",
      "Xi did not mention the tariffs directly, but appeared to be referring to the importance of stable trade terms by saying: \u201cBlowing out other people\u2019s lights will not make your own lights brighter. Blocking other people\u2019s paths will eventually block your own paths.\u201d",
      "For now, however, China is seeking to portray itself as \u201can ideal, safe and promising investment destination for foreign investors,\u201d he said.",
      "\u201cGoing with China is going with opportunities. Believing in China is believing in tomorrow. Investing in China is investing in the future,\u201d the president, who has made himself leader for life and also heads the ruling Communist Party, said.",
      "Others in attendance Friday included Amin H. Nasser, president of Saudi Aramco; Sherard Louis Cowper-Coles, the chair of China-Britain Business Council; Oliver Zipse, BMW CEO and Ray Dalio, chief investment officer of hedge fund Bridgewater Associates.",

Severe electricity shortages continue to plague the war-torn country.",
      "The United Nations estimates that 90% of Syrians live in poverty and the Syrian government has only been able to provide about two hours of electricity every day. Millions of Syrians, like Al-Ahmad and her family, can\u2019t afford to pay hefty fees for private generator services or install solar panels.",

      "Even with a recent gas deal with Qatar and an agreement with Kurdish-led authorities that will give them access to Syria's oil fields, the country spends most of its days with virtually no power. Reports of oil shipments coming from Russia, a key military and political ally of Assad, shows the desperation.",

      "Political economist Karam Shaar said 85% of the country\u2019s oil production is based in those areas, and Syria once exported crude oil in exchange for refined oil to boost local production, though the fields are battered and bruised from years of conflict.",

      "After IS fell, the U.S.-backed Kurdish-led Syrian Democratic Forces took control of key fields, leaving them away from the central government in Damascus. The new authorities hope to resolve this in a landmark deal with the SDF signed earlier this month.",
      "Kamran Omar, who oversees oil production in the Rmeilan oil fields in the northeastern city of Hassakeh, says shortages in equipment and supplies and clashes that persisted with Turkey and Turkish-backed forces have slowed down production, but told the AP that some of that production will eventually go to households and factories in other parts of Syria.",
      "The fields only produce a fraction of what they once did. The Rmeilan field sends just 15,000 of the approximately 100,000 barrels they produce to other parts of Syria to ease some of the burden on the state.",
      "The authorities in Damascus also hope that a recent deal with Qatar that would supply them with gas through Jordan to a major plant south of the capital will be the first of more agreements.",
      "Syria's authorities have not acknowledged reports of Russia sending oil shipments to the country. Moscow once aided Assad in the conflict against armed Islamist group Hayat Tahrir al-Sham that toppled the former president, but this shows that they are willing to stock up on fuel from whoever is offering.",

      "French prosecutors on Thursday requested a seven-year prison sentence for the 70-year-old former leader. Sarkozy, who was president from 2007 to 2012, has denied all wrongdoing.",
      "The trial, which started in January, is to continue until April 8, with Sarkozy's lawyers to plead on the last day. The verdict is expected at a later date.",
      "Some key moments in the trial have focused on talks between France and Libya in the 2000s, when Gadhafi was seeking to restore diplomatic ties with the West. Before that, Libya was considered a pariah state for having sponsored attacks.",
      "French families of victims of a 1989 plane bombing told the court about their shock and sense of betrayal as the trial questioned whether promises possibly made to Gadhafi\u2019s government were part of the alleged corruption deal.",
      "In 1988, a bomb planted aboard a Pam Am flight exploded while the plane was over the Scottish town of Lockerbie, killing 270 people from 21 countries, including 190 Americans.",
      "The following year, on Sept. 19, 1989, the bombing of UTA flight 772 over Niger killed 170 people, including 54 French nationals on board, after an in-flight explosion caused by a suitcase bomb.",
      "Both French and U.S. investigations have tied both bombings to Libya, whose government had engaged in long-running hostilities with the U.S. and other Western governments.",
      "Now, families of victims are wondering whether French government officials close to Sarkozy promised to forget about the bombings in exchange for business opportunities with the oil-rich nation and possibly, an alleged corruption deal.",
      "\u201cWhat did they do with our dead?\u201d Nicoletta Diasio, the daughter of a man who died in the bombing, has told the court, saying she wondered if the memories of the victims \u201ccould have been used for bartering\u201d in talks between France and Libya.",
      "During the trial, Sarkozy has said he has \u201cnever ever betrayed\u201d families of victims. \u201cI have never traded their fate for any compromise, nor pact of realpolitik,\u201d he said.",
      "Libya was long a pariah state for its involvement in the 1980s bombings.",
      "In 2003, it took responsibility for both the 1988 and 1989 plane bombings and agreed to pay billions in compensation to the victims\u2019 families.",
      "Gadhafi also announced he was dismantling his nuclear weapons program, which led to the lifting of international sanctions against the country.",

      "In 2007, Sarkozy welcomed Gadhafi to Paris with honors for a five-day official visit, allowing him to set up a bedouin tent near the Elysee presidential palace. Many French people still remember that gesture, feeling Sarkozy went too far to please a dictator.",
      "Sarkozy said during the trial he would have preferred to \u201cdo without\u201d Gadhafi\u2019s visit at the time but it came as a diplomatic gesture after Libya\u2019s release of Bulgarian nurses who were imprisoned and facing death sentences for a crime they said they did not commit.",
      "On July 24, 2007, under an accord partially brokered by first lady Cecilia Sarkozy and EU officials, Libya released the five Bulgarian nurses and a Palestinian doctor.",
      "The medics, who had spent over eight years in prison, faced death sentence on charges they deliberately infected hundreds of children with the AIDS virus in the late 1990s \u2014 an allegation they denied.",
      "The release of the medics removed the last major obstacle to Libya\u2019s rejoining the international community.",
      "Sarkozy travelled to the capital, Tripoli, for talks with Gadhafi the day after the medics were returned to Bulgaria on a French presidential plane.",
      "In court has spoken of his \u201cpride to have saved those six persons.\u201d",
      "\u201cIf you did not discuss with Gadhafi, you\u2019d not get the release of the nurses,\u201d he said.",

      "An international arrest warrant was issued for him and five other suspects.",
      "Financial prosecutors have accused Sarkozy of having promised to lift the arrest warrant targeting al-Senoussi in exchange for alleged campaign financing.",
      "In 2005, people close to Sarkozy, who was at the time the interior minister, including his chief of staff Claude Gu\u00e9ant and junior minister Brice Hortefeux, travelled to Tripoli, where they met with al-Senoussi.",

      "Al-Senoussi told investigative judges that millions of dollars were provided to support Sarkozy\u2019s campaign. Accused of war crimes, he is now imprisoned in Libya.",

      "Seif al-Islam sent RFI radio a two-page statement on his version of events. It was the first time he talked to the media about the case since 2011.",
      "He said Sarkozy initially \u201creceived $2.5 million from Libya to finance his electoral campaign\u201d during the 2007 presidential election, in return for which Sarkozy would \u201cconclude agreements and carry out projects in favour of Libya.\u201d",
      "He said a second payment of $2.5 million in cash was handed over without specifying when it was given.",

      "BEIRUT -- Lebanon appointed asset manager Karim Souaid to the post of central bank governor Thursday as the government tries to reform the economy after months of war and decades of mismanagement and corruption.",
      "The country's economy has been in crisis for five years and desperately needs reforms to unlock international aid, and on top of that, Israel\u2019s 14-month war with Hezbollah caused what the World Bank estimates was $11 billion in damages and economic losses.",
      "The appointment was announced by Prime Minister Nawaf Salam, the International Court of Justice jurist who was named Lebanon\u2019s premier in January following the election of President Joseph Aoun earlier that month.",
      "Salam said that Souaid was chosen by more than two-thirds of the 24 members of Lebanon's reformist Cabinet, though the prime minister said he himself did not support the decision. \u201cThe Lebanese have asked us for reforms and we insist on reforms,\u201d Salam told reporters after the government meeting.",
      "Souaid, an asset manager who previously was a senior executive at HSBC bank, is seen by critics as being sympathetic to the stance on economic reform taken by the country's banks, and fear he might sell what\u2019s left of Lebanon\u2019s state assets to bail them out.",
      "An unproductive economy and decades of corruption by Lebanon\u2019s political and financial leaders that drained state resources eventually led to a run on the banks in 2019. Covid-19, the massive Beirut Port blast in August 2020 and the monthlong Israel-Hezbollah war furthered compounded the country\u2019s economic woes.",
      "Lebanon has been running on a cash economy, with most of its electricity coming from private suppliers, leading to inflation and pulling almost half the population into poverty, according to the World Bank.",
      "The country has struggled to reach an International Monetary Fund-approved deal to unlock aid to make the economy viable again, with the international financial institution asking Lebanon to end waste, crack down on corruption and financial crimes, and restructure its banking sector.",
      "Lebanon\u2019s commercial banks have been hesitant to implement some of these reforms, as it would burden them with the country\u2019s tens of billions of dollars in economic losses, experts and activists say. The banks believe the state should carry most of that burden, blaming them for defaulting on paying back the state\u2019s massive debt in 2020 and for its wasteful spending.",
      "Souaid had the backing of President Aoun, while Salam and a handful of ministers have remained skeptical of him.",
      "\u201cKarim Souaid was not my candidate and I abstained with some ministers because of my concerns regarding the rights of depositors,\u201d Salam told reporters after the Cabinet meeting, referring to concerns that large amounts of bank deposits might not be given back to depositors. \u201cHe will have to abide by the financial policy of our reformist Cabinet.\u201d",
      "Souaid succeeds Riad Salameh, the embattled former governor of 30 years whose term ended with several international corruption cases lodged against him and for embezzlement and other financial crimes. Salameh was appointed in 1993, when Lebanon was scrambling to bounce back after a 15-year civil war.",
      "Salameh, who is currently in detention, was heralded as a financial genius for preventing hyperinflation and keeping the Lebanese currency stable through years of political tensions and conflict, and then left his post widely perceived as a key architect of the country\u2019s financial downfall.",

      "Major anti-abortion groups are gathering in the nation's capital to begin a lobbying effort with Congress and President Donald Trump\u2019s administration aimed at eliminating funding for Planned Parenthood",
      "WASHINGTON -- Major anti-abortion groups were gathering in the nation's capital on Thursday to begin a lobbying effort with Congress and President Donald Trump's administration aimed at eliminating funding for Planned Parenthood ahead of the Supreme Court hearing a case in April that could strip the organization's funding in South Carolina.",
      "The anti-abortion groups are taking aim at abortion providers under an initiative called Defund Planned Parenthood, which targets federal Medicaid funding for the reproductive health care provider.",
      "\u201cThis event begins an intensive round of outreach to the GOP, calling on them to take advantage of this unique moment to defund the abortion industry,\u201d Students for Life, the national anti-abortion group organizing the event, said in a statement.",
      "The Hyde Amendment already restricts government funding for most abortions, and less than 5% of the services Planned Parenthood provides are abortions, according to the organization\u2019s 2023 report. Planned Parenthood also provides other forms of reproductive health care, including contraception, treatment for sexually transmitted infections and cancer screenings, often for low-income patients.",
      "Vicki Ringer, Planned Parenthood\u2019s South Carolina director of public affairs, said claims that Planned Parenthood uses Medicaid funding for abortion is \u201can attempt to mislead the public\u201d and emphasized Planned Parenthood\u2019s role in providing broader reproductive health care.",
      "\u201cWe should be expanding health care to low-income people rather than trying to kick off these people who rely on us for health care,\u201d Ringer said.",
      "Rachel Rebouche, dean of Temple University's Beasley School of Law in Philadelphia, said the Defund Planned Parenthood movement has been building for 10 years but has gained momentum as the anti-abortion movement has been emboldened by Trump\u2019s presidential victory and by his fellow Republicans winning control of Congress in November.",
      "\u201cWe\u2019re seeing more enthusiasm in states like South Carolina and others to close down Planned Parenthood under the banner of stopping abortions, which their laws already do,\" she said.",
      "The Supreme Court announced it would hear a case involving South Carolina's attempt to strip Medicaid funding for Planned Parenthood. Experts say the lawsuit could prompt similar efforts in conservative states across the country to chip away at the organization's funding.",
      "Almost 100 conservative members of Congress signed an amicus brief urging the Supreme Court to side with South Carolina. The state already bans abortion after six weeks of pregnancy, before many people know they're pregnant.",
      "In February, a panel of judges in the 5th Circuit Court of Appeals reversed a lower court ruling that attempted to force Planned Parenthood to repay millions of dollars of Medicaid funding in Texas and Louisiana.",
      "If the Supreme Court sides with South Carolina, Rebouche said, there may be a wider impact on health care by \"giving states broad power to exclude health care that is unpopular or politically disfavored,\u201d such as contraception. Targeting Planned Parenthood might also have a negative effect on maternal and infant mortality rates and could cost more money in the long run by cutting off low-income patients from vital preventive reproductive health care, she said.",
      "During a 2015 push to strip Planned Parenthood funding, the Congressional Budget Office estimated that doing so would cost the government $130 million over 10 years.",
      "Meanwhile, lawmakers in at least three states \u2014 Missouri, Ohio and South Carolina \u2014 have introduced bills this year aiming to create tax breaks for anti-abortion centers.",
      "The strategies come during a time when abortion rights advocates are warning that Trump and his Cabinet hold significant power to restrict medication abortion access nationwide.",
      "Rather than immediately heeding calls from anti-abortion allies to restrict Medicaid funding for clinics that provide abortions, Trump has made quieter moves after waffling on the issue on the campaign trail.",
      "Trump reinstated a policy that requires foreign nongovernmental agencies to certify that they don\u2019t provide or promote abortion if they receive U.S. aid for family planning assistance.

      "Ukraine\u2019s allies from across Europe have gathered for talks in Paris about how to strengthen Kyiv\u2019s hand and its military as it pushes for a ceasefire with Russia",
      "PARIS -- Ukraine\u2019s allies from across Europe gathered for talks in Paris on Thursday about how to strengthen Kyiv\u2019s hand and its military as it pushes for a ceasefire with Russia, and to consider proposals to deploy European troops in the country in tandem with any peace deal.",
      "French President Emmanuel Macron is hosting the leaders of nearly 30 countries plus NATO and European Union chiefs. The summit comes at a crucial juncture in the more than three-year war, with intensifying diplomatic efforts to broker ceasefires, driven by pressure from U.S. President Donald Trump to end the fighting.",
      "But the conflict is raging on.",
      "Before the leaders met in the luxury of the French presidential palace, Russian drone attacks overnight wounded more than 20 people and heavy shelling Thursday afternoon killed one person and knocked out electricity in parts of Kherson, Ukrainian officials said.",
      "U.S.-brokered agreements this week to safeguard shipping in the Black Sea and last week to halt long-range strikes on energy infrastructure were greeted as a first step toward peace. But Ukraine and Russia have disagreed over the details and accused each other of deal violations, foreshadowing a long and contentious process ahead.",
      "France and the United Kingdom are pushing a separate initiative to build a coalition of nations willing in one way or another to support the deployment of a European armed force in Ukraine, with the aim of securing any peace deal by dissuading Russia from attacking the country again.",
      "Some European countries are more comfortable with a potential deployment than others \u2014 not least because a big unknown is whether Trump would allow American forces and intelligence agencies to back up any European contingent with air and logistical support and other assistance.",
      "Building a force big enough to act as a credible deterrent \u2014 U.K. officials have talked about possibly 10,000 to 30,000 troops \u2014 would also be a considerable effort for nations that shrank their militaries after the Cold War but are now rearming. There would also be questions to resolve about who would command the force and how it might respond to a major violation by Russia of any peace agreement.",
      "The office of U.K. Prime Minister Keir Starmer, who's driving the European initiative together with Macron, said that military planners from Europe and beyond have been drilling down into details of how such a force might be put together, examining \u201cthe full range of European military capabilities including aircraft, tanks, troops, intelligence and logistics.\u201d",
      "In the face of enduring pressure from Trump on European nations to increase military spending and rely less on U.S. forces, dating back to his first presidency, the proposed contingent is also seen as a test of Europe\u2019s ability to defend itself and its interests.",
      "Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy posted an image from inside the summit of him and other leaders standing together with the caption: \u201cEurope knows how to defend itself. We must prove it.\u201d",
      "Macron said Wednesday that the proposed European force could deploy to \u201cimportant towns, strategic bases\u201d in Ukraine and that it could \u201crespond\u201d to a Russian attack if Moscow launched one.",
      "Macron didn\u2019t specify what sort of response he envisaged. But he suggested that a Russian attack might not go unanswered, even though the European troops wouldn't be deployed to the front lines.",
      "\u201cIf there was again a generalized aggression against Ukrainian soil, these armies would, in fact, be under attack and then it\u2019s our usual framework of engagement,\u201d Macron said. \u201cOur soldiers, when they are engaged and deployed, are there to react and respond to the decisions of the commander in chief and, if they are in a conflict situation, to respond to it.",
      "\u201cSo we are not on the front lines, we don\u2019t go to fight, but we are there to guarantee a lasting peace. It\u2019s a pacifist approach,\u201d he said. \u201cThe only ones who would, at that moment, trigger a conflict, a bellicose situation, would be the Russians if they decided again to launch an aggression.\u201d",
      "The meeting in Paris came as Russia has demanded lifting sanctions to meet its terms for the Black Sea ceasefire.",
      "Sanctions imposed by the U.S. and Europe have punished Russia\u2019s economy and limited its access to global markets.",
      "Zelenskyy accused Moscow of attempting to add conditions to what should be an unconditional agreement.",
      "While the White House said that it would help restore Russia\u2019s access to the world market for fertilizer and farm exports, it didn\u2019t validate Moscow\u2019s conditions. U.S. Secretary of State Marco Rubio said that Russia\u2019s demands would be evaluated and presented to Trump.",
      "There has been a growing chorus of opposition in Europe to lifting the sanctions, which remain their main leverage against Moscow.",
      "Ant\u00f3nio Costa, the president of the European Council representing the EU's 27 member states, said that sanctions are crucial to support Ukraine and reach a lasting peace.",
      "\u201cThis means keeping up the pressure on Russia through sanctions,\u201d Costa said Thursday.",
      "As ceasefire efforts gather steam, Ukraine's allies in Europe are working to strengthen Kyiv's hand militarily. Their aim is to enable it to keep fighting until any broad peace takes hold and also to turn the Ukrainian army into the first line of defense against any future Russian aggression.",
      "Macron announced a new package of defense aid for Ukraine that he said was worth 2 billion euros ($2.15 billion) and will include light tanks, air defense and anti-tank missiles and other weaponry and support.",
      "Russian drone attacks overnight wounded at least 18 people in the Kharkiv region and three people in Dnipro, officials said. Shelling in a front-line community in the Zaporizhzhia region knocked out electricity and phone coverage, regional head Ivan Fedorov said on Telegram.",
      "Zelenskyy said that the attacks were further evidence that the U.S. and Europe shouldn't ease sanctions on Moscow.",
      "\u201cRussia is killing every day and prolonging this war,\u201d Zelenskyy said on social media. \u201cThe American proposal for an unconditional ceasefire has been on the table for half a month now.\u201d",
      "Separately, the Ukrainian Army General Staff said that its attack at Engels military airfield in Russia on March 20 had destroyed 96 air-to-air cruise missiles and significant reserves of aviation fuel.",
      "Satellite imagery taken the next day by Maxar Technologies appeared to show damage to ammunition and weapons storage at Engels, the main base for Russia\u2019s nuclear-capable strategic bombers.",

      "TOKYO -- Brazilian President Luiz In\u00e1cio Lula da Silva swiped Thursday at U.S. President Donald Trump's decision to raise U.S. tariffs on a wide range of products, saying Trump should consider the potential harm to the American and global economies.",
      "Lula made the comments while wrapping up a 4-day visit to Japan, where Trump's decision Wednesday to order 25% tariffs on all car imports came as a severe blow given the country's status as a major auto exporter and American ally. The U.S. is the biggest destination for Japanese car exports.",
      "\u201cI am very concerned about the behavior of the American government,\u201d Lula said. \u201cI am concerned because free trade is being harmed and I am concerned because multilateralism is weakened,\u201d Lula said through an interpreter.",
      "Lula said he foresees no positive outcome from Trump's policy of raising tariffs given that they will raise prices for American consumers, adding to inflation and leading to higher interest rates that might stifle economic growth.",
      "He added that Trump is president only of the United States, not the world, and that \u201cthis protectionism does not help any country in the world.\u201d",
      "Japanese Prime Minister Shigeru Ishiba reiterated he wants Japan to be exempt from such tariffs.",
      "\u201cWe must consider appropriate responses, and naturally we will consider all options\u201d including possibly taking countermeasures, Ishiba told a parliamentary session Thursday. \u201cThe bottom line is, we must consider what will best serve Japan's national interest.\u201d",
      "He and Lula on Wednesday agreed to step up partnerships between Japan and Brazil in the areas of the economy, trade and security.",
      "As Trump\u2019s tariff threats have triggered tensions and vows of retaliation from Canada, Mexico, China and Europe, Japan has been working to firm up ties with other countries.",
      "Japan's Chief Cabinet Secretary Yoshimasa Hayashi said Trump's decision on auto tariffs was \u201cextremely regrettable.\u201d Japan strongly has urged it be exempt.",
      "Brazil is the top steel exporter to the United States. Lula said it was considering filing complaints to the World Trade Organization and might impose reciprocal tariffs.",
      "But Brazil is not near the top of Trump's list for trade retaliation since the U.S., its second-largest trading partner, exports more than it imports from there.",
      "The U.S. trade surplus with Brazil was $7.4 billion in 2024, nearly a 32% increase over a year earlier. Brazil's top exports to the U.S. were petroleum and iron and steel. Its biggest imports from the U.S. were crude and refined oil, gas turbines, aircraft, chemical and machinery.",

      "Wood Brothers Racing returned to a spirited welcome this weekend at Martinsville Speedway.",
      "The pedestrian tunnel leading into the infield and garage area was lined with two dozen life-size images saluting the longtime connection between NASCAR\u2019s oldest track and its oldest team.",
      "\"Seeing all the photos in the tunnel walking in here was really cool,\u201d said Josh Berry, who joined the team to drive the No. 21 Ford this season. \u201cObviously, they\u2019re really close by, so it\u2019s a home race. So we\u2019re going to try to do our best to have a good weekend.\u201d",
      "Wood Brothers Racing was founded in Stuart, a mountain town about 30 minutes west of Martinsville Speedway. The 0.526-mile oval is where the team made its NASCAR Cup Series debut May 17, 1953.",
      "And the tunnel tribute is especially fitting this year because Wood Brothers Racing recently earned its 101st career victory while celebrating its 75th anniversary.",
      "Berry\u2019s victory March 16 at Las Vegas Motor Speedway qualified the team for the playoffs months earlier than the team\u2019s three previous appearances in NASCAR\u2019s postseason.",
      "With victories in consecutive Cup seasons for the first time since 1986-87, the Wood Brothers Racing renaissance has been the most popular storyline in NASCAR\u2019s premier series this season.",
      "Berry, a 34-year-old in his second year in the Cup, is the 20th winner for Wood Brothers Racing, whose all-star roster transcends the series by including A.J. Foyt and Dan Gurney alongside NASCAR greats David Pearson, Cale Yarborough and Curtis Turner.",
      "But as NASCAR grew more corporate, the homespun atmosphere remained with the family run team that has been handed down through three generations of leadership. While its racing operations were relocated to the Charlotte area 20 years ago, Wood Brothers Racing still maintains its museum in Stuart, which annually draws thousands of race fans who make pilgrimages to the remote outpost in southwest Virginia.",
      "Ryan Blaney earned his first victory for WBR in 2017 before leaving for Team Penske the next year. The 2023 Cup champion was touched when team CEO Eddie Wood pulled him aside to tell him he always would be part of their family.",

I think that\u2019s why they\u2019ve been around for 75 years is just because they\u2019re great people who have been revolutionary in the sport and also have molded with the times and don\u2019t burn any bridges. Everyone wants to work with those guys.",
      "\u201cI have a lot of fond memories with them. It was pretty neat just to be in their presence and be racing for a team that has meant so much to the sport and the sport so much to their family as well. No one is going to be around for 75 years if they don\u2019t really care about what they do and don\u2019t love it with a passion.\u201d",
      "The last five victories for Wood Brothers Racing also have featured first-time winners: Berry, Harrison Burton (2024), Blaney, Trevor Bayne (2011) and Elliott Sadler (2001).",
      "While it\u2019s been billed as a launching pad to stardom, Wood Brothers Racing would like to establish a reputation as a team that can keep drivers and contend for a championship. The team\u2019s cars largely are prepared by powerhouse Team Penske, which also provides engineering and technical support.",
      "Wood Brothers Racing president Jon Wood gets annoyed having to prove his team has autonomy in determining its success.",
      "\u201cWhen we suck, it\u2019s our fault, but when we do good, we had nothing to do with it,\u201d Wood said after Berry\u2019s Vegas win. \u201cIt\u2019s 100% Penske or something.",
      "\"I think that\u2019s a frustrating part. These are our guys that are doing this. We sat in a room and debated who our next driver would be for 2025. It\u2019s Josh Berry. Those are decisions that we made collectively. It\u2019s our race team and our decision.\u201d",
      "Its resurgence could be validated by Sunday\u2019s 400-lap race at the paper clip-shaped short track. Though Wood Brothers Racing earned its first pole position at Martinsville in October 1958, the team has only two wins there (none since Pearson in April 1973) despite more starts (127) than any other track.",
      "It\u2019s been 24 years since the team\u2019s most recent short-track win, but Berry has won countless stock-car races at similar bullrings around the South \u2014 and Blaney has won the past two fall races at Martinsville.",
      "\u201cObviously, Team Penske cars are always good here,\u201d Berry said. \u201cI love coming here and feel it should be a good opportunity for us.\u201d",
      "Christopher Bell, who leads the Cup Series with three victories in the first six races, earned his first pole in 2025 and the 14th of his career. Chase Elliott will start second, followed by Alex Bowman, Kyle Larson and five-time Martinsville winner Denny Hamlin.",
      "After nearly seven years without an engine failure, the powerplant in Blaney's No. 12 Ford has let go twice in the past three weeks at Phoenix Raceway and Homestead-Miami Speedway.",

      "\u201cI don\u2019t think that style points are something you\u2019re worried about at any point in the tournament,\u201d said Lawson, who is preparing her second-seeded Duke team to face No. 1 seed South Carolina on Sunday in the Elite Eight. It'll be the second time the teams face each other this season. The Gamecocks beat Duke 81-70 at home in December.",
      "\u201cYou have to get a feel for the game,\" Lawson added. \u201cEach game has its own identity, and each game is going to present a problem set for you that you have to try and figure out. Sometimes there\u2019s problem sets you can anticipate. Sometimes you can\u2019t. So it\u2019s really about solving issues in the moment and finding a way to fix them.\"",
      "Friday's problem for the Blue Devils was that they could barely make a basket. Duke shot 31% and missed its first nine baskets. Lawson figured it out by trusting in her team's identity: defense. They held North Carolina to just six points in the fourth.",
      "In Staley's eyes, South Carolina's poor shot selection put it in a hole against Maryland. The Gamecocks did just enough to win, thanks to MiLaysia Fulwiley's 23 points.",
      "It was the second straight game that the defending champion Gamecocks were tested.",
      "Against Indiana in the second round, South Carolina had to overcome a dreadful first-half performance that left it trailing at the break before rallying in the second half.",
      "That they keep finding ways to win shows her Gamecocks are unflappable, Staley said. And a victory is all that matters at this stage.",
      "\"Is it ugly? Yes,\" Staley said. \"Are people going to say this doesn\u2019t look like a national championship team? Well, I mean, we didn\u2019t look like one last year to most in the beginning of the season. We looked like one in \u201922 \u2014 \u201917 we didn\u2019t look like one.",
      "\u201cI think we\u2019re back to where we don\u2019t look like one, and hopefully we can win it and even it out.\u201d",
      "After Maryland played the defending champions close and held them to 38.5% shooting on Friday, coach Brenda Frese said she felt the Terrapins gave other teams \u201ca pretty good blueprint\u201d on how to beat South Carolina.",
      "\u201cThe blueprint?\" Staley said. \u201cPeople played us like that ever since we had Aliyah Boston. It\u2019s nothing new. We lead the country in points in the paint. They did a good job executing their game plan, and we did a poor job at shot selection. So we will be better.\u201d",
      "Senior Bree Hall said the Gamecocks don't expect anyone to take them lightly.",
      "\u201cI've said it all year that the target is very big on our back,\u201d Hall added. \"Every team is going to bring their best game. Especially in moments like this in the tournament, they're going to play as hard as they can, try as hard as they can to make every shot that they throw up.\u201d",
      "Lawson and Staley have crossed paths often in their decorated careers.",
      "Staley was an assistant USA Basketball coach when Lawson played on the Olympic gold medal-winning women's basketball team in 2008. When Lawson coached the USA Basketball 3-on-3 team in 2020, Staley was the 5-on-5 coach. Duke also held some practices in Columbia, South Carolina, in the early days of the COVID-19 pandemic.",
      "\u201cOur relationship is of respect,\u201d Staley said. \"I respect the success that Kara is having at Duke. I respect the fact that she has been in our game for a long time at different stops. ... She is an Olympian, she is an Olympic assistant coach.",
      "\u201cSo for someone that has devoted and served our game as long as she has, you got to tip your hat to her.\u201d",
      "Freshman star Cooper Flagg and the No. 1-seed Blue Devils will play second-seeded Alabama on Saturday for a spot in the men's Final Four. The Duke women's basketball team will be watching.",
      "\u201cWe basically have watch parties,\u201d guard Oluchi Okananwa said. \u201cWe\u2019re so proud of them, and we\u2019re excited for them to be on this big stage with us. It\u2019s super cool to have the Duke men in the same position that we are and cheer them on.\u201d",
      "Lawson has a great relationship with men's coach Jon Scheyer. They often have early morning weight room interactions when their teams go in to lift.",
      "\u201cHe\u2019s been a great supporter of mine, and I try to be a great supporter of his,\u201d Lawson said. \u201cSo we\u2019re texting each other every day, really, through this run, just words of support \u2014 although I haven\u2019t texted him yet today. I don\u2019t think I\u2019m that late because they play tonight. So I will text him.\u201d",

    "story": [
      "The general manager of the Memphis Grizzlies says the decision to fire coach Taylor Jenkins with nine games remaining in the regular season with the franchise firmly in the playoff chase was \"mine and mine only.\"",
      "MEMPHIS, Tenn. -- MEMPHIS, Tenn. (AP) \u2014 Memphis general manager Zach Kleiman said Saturday the decision to fire coach Taylor Jenkins with nine games remaining in the regular season with the franchise firmly in the playoff chase was \u201cmine and mine only\" and in the Grizzlies' best interests.",
      "Kleiman spoke to reporters after the Grizzlies' pregame shootaround for Saturday night's game against the Los Angeles Lakers \u2014 barely 24 hours after Memphis announced firing Jenkins in his sixth season with the Grizzlies. Memphis named Tuomas Iisalo as the interim coach with the Helsinki, Finland, native in his first season coaching in the NBA.",
      "\u201cI came to the conclusion this was in the best interest of the team, and urgency is a core principle of ours so decided to go on with the move,\u201d Kleiman said.",
      "The Memphis GM spoke for less than three minutes, and no Grizzlies spoke after the shootaround. They won't be available until later Saturday at the usual pregame open locker room session when Iisalo speaks to the media for the first time in his new role.",
      "Asked if he hopes making this move now with the Grizzlies currently fifth in the Western Conference starting a stretch with eight of the final nine opponents either playoff clubs or contending for a play-in spot helps Memphis salvage the season, Kleiman said he is focused on how the Grizzlies operate. It's still possible, at least mathematically, that Memphis could get back to No. 2 in the West, and it\u2019s highly unlikely that the Grizzlies will fall into the play-in tournament range.",
      "\u201cI'm responsible for everything,\u201d Kleiman said. \u201cI'm responsible for coaching. I'm responsible for the roster. I'm not trying to absolve myself of anything. I'm excited to see what this team can do the rest of the way, but this was the conclusion that I came to that this was in the best interest of the team and we push forward with this group.\u201d",
      "Kleiman said no players were consulted about the move to fire Jenkins. Kleiman helped hire Jenkins in June 2019 after his own promotion to executive vice president of basketball operations. The GM also did not answer a question about what he wants from Memphis' next coach.",
      "Jenkins had been the fifth longest-tenured coach with his current club in the league, behind only San Antonio\u2019s Gregg Popovich, Miami\u2019s Erik Spoelstra, Golden State\u2019s Steve Kerr and Denver\u2019s Michael Malone \u2014 all of them having won NBA titles. In this season with a maturing roster, the Grizzlies' results against the NBA's best weren't good.",
      "The Grizzlies were 0-4 against Oklahoma City, losing those games by 24, 13, 17 and 21 points. They\u2019re 3-6 so far this season against Houston, Denver and the Lakers, the next three teams ahead of them in the West. All season, the Grizzlies were 33-9 against teams at or below .500 and 11-20 against winning clubs.",
      "Jenkins, with a career record of 250-214, was the winningest coach in franchise history for a team that launched in 1995. He had the longest tenure for a Grizzlies' coach since Lionel Hollins took over in the 2008-09 season before his contract was not renewed after reaching the Western Finals in 2013 with a 56-26 record.",
      "But Jenkins has been criticized for continuing to use too many players at a point in the schedule when the rotation needed to be tightened and questioned for his late-game timeouts and other decisions. Asked about reports of two-time All-Star Ja Morant\u2019s frustration over the Memphis offense, Kleiman repeated this was his decision.",
      "Morant, who has missed the last six games with a left hamstring strain, now is listed as questionable for Saturday night's game with the Lakers.",
      "Now Iisalo takes over after coming to the NBA as a Grizzlies assistant for this season, becoming the first Finnish-born coach in the NBA. Iisalo played and coached in Europe, including in 2024 when he was head coach of Paris Basketball, winning the EuroCup and honors as that league\u2019s coach of the year. He also coached Telekom Baskets Bonn between 2021-23 and Crailshem Merlins between 2016 and 2021.",
      "\u201cLooking forward to seeing what he's able to do with this group,\u201d Kleiman said of Iisalo. \u201cThere's realistic expectations. There's not going to be time to install a bunch of things this time of year. My expectations are clarity of direction and we'll see what we can do, we'll see what we can execute.\u201d",

      "The Dodgers are 4-0 to start the season for the first time since 1981, when they also won the World Series.",
      "Betts went deep to left off Beau Brieske (0-1), scoring pinch-hitter Will Smith and Shohei Ohtani.",

      "Dillon Dingler homered and tripled in the 10th to give Detroit a 5-3 lead in the top of the 10th.",
      "Tied at 3, left fielder Michael Conforto came up short trying to catch the ball hit by Dingler, allowing Riley Greene, who began the inning at second, and Zach McKinstry, who was intentionally walked by Luis Garcia (1-0), to score.",
      "The Dodgers got a run back in the bottom of the 10th to trail 5-4 on Conforto's ground-rule double before Betts' heroics.",

      "INDIANAPOLIS -- Milos Uzan soared for an uncontested layup on a beautifully executed inbound play with 0.9 seconds left, and No. 1 seed Houston survived a late collapse to beat fourth-seeded Purdue 62-60 on Friday night in the Sweet 16 of the NCAA Tournament.",
      "Houston led 56-46 with just under eight minutes remaining but made only one field goal from there until Uzan\u2019s tiebreaking bucket. He inbounded the ball from the baseline to Joseph Tugler, who threw a bounce pass back to Uzan, and the 6-foot-4 junior took it to the rim.",
      "Coach Kelvin Sampson\u2019s Cougars (33-4) advanced to the Elite Eight for the third time in five years after falling in the Sweet 16 as a top seed in the previous two editions of March Madness.

      "Fletcher Loyer scored 16 points, Trey Kaufman-Renn had 14 and Big Ten player of the year Braden Smith added seven points and 15 assists to lead Purdue (24-12). Smith assisted on all 11 second-half baskets for last year\u2019s national runner-up, which played in front of a friendly crowd about an hour\u2019s drive from its campus in West Lafayette.",

      "Sampson called timeout to set up the final play, but Uzan missed a turnaround jumper and Tugler\u2019s tip-in rolled off the rim and out of bounds. The Cougars got one more chance after a replay review confirmed the ball went off of Purdue, and Uzan took over from there.",
      "Smith\u2019s half-court heave was an airball at the buzzer, giving this March Madness a rare dramatic finish in a tough, physical contest with players repeatedly hitting the floor.",
      "Sharpe had a scoring flurry early in the second half to give Houston some separation. His 3-pointer at the 16:14 mark made it 40-32. After Purdue trimmed the deficit to four, Uzan made two 3s to give Houston a 10-point lead.",

      "Marks is credited with coining the name and concept for \u201cOperation Warp Speed,\u201d the effort under President Donald Trump to rapidly manufacture vaccines while they were still being tested for safety and efficacy. The initiative cut years off the normal development process.",
      "Despite the project\u2019s success, Trump repeatedly lashed out at the FDA for not approving the first COVID shots even sooner. Trump told confidants after his 2020 loss that he would have been re-elected if the vaccine had been available before Election Day.",

      "In a post on social media Thursday, Kennedy criticized the department he oversees as an inefficient \u201csprawling bureaucracy.\" He also faulted the department\u2019s 82,000 workers for a decline in Americans\u2019 health.",
      "The resignation is the latest blow to the beleaguered health agency, which has been rocked for weeks by layoffs, retirements and a chaotic return-to-office process that left many staffers without permanent offices, desks or other supplies. Last month, Jim Jones, the FDA\u2019s deputy commissioner for foods, resigned, citing \u201cthe indiscriminate firing\u201d of nearly 90 staffers in his division, according to a copy of his resignation letter obtained by the AP.",

    "story": [
      "A major 7.7 magnitude earthquake that originated near Mandalay, Myanmar shook the Earth as far as Bangkok",
      "Early Friday, a major 7.7 magnitude earthquake that originated near Mandalay, Myanmar, shook the Earth as far as Bangkok, about 800 miles (1,300 kilometers) away.",
      "Two hard-hit cities in Myanmar suffered extensive damage, with images from the capital, Naypyidaw, showing rescue crews pulling victims from the rubble of collapsed buildings. Authorities in Bangkok said deaths had occurred at three construction sites, including a high-rise that collapsed.",
      "Experts say the earthquake, which occurred along the Sagaing Fault, was close to the Earth's surface, generating intense seismic forces. Preliminary estimates by the U.S. Geological Survey show that nearly 800,000 people in Myanmar may have been within the zone of the most violent shaking and that death tolls exceeding 1,000 people, and perhaps much higher, are probable.",
      "The Earth's crust is broken up into several pieces called tectonic plates, which fit together like a jigsaw puzzle.",
      "This formation is \u201cmostly stable, but along the edges they are moving,\u201d Columbia University geophysicist Michael Steckler said.",
      "Pressure builds up when sliding plates get stuck, increasing \u201cvery slowly for decades or for hundreds of years, and then all of a sudden the rock plates will jump,\" triggering shaking that causes an earthquake, Steckler said.",
      "Earthquakes typically occur along edges of tectonic plates. But their impacts may be felt in a broader region.",
      "Earthquakes that occur in the ocean don't always attract attention, but those that occur close to where people live can cause deaths and injuries, most often from collapsed buildings.",
      "Scientists have a good idea of where earthquakes are likely to occur, \"but we can't predict when they'll occur,\u201d USGS seismologist Will Yeck said.",
      "However, after the initial big earthquake, researchers are able to project that other smaller earthquakes nearby, called aftershocks, are likely.",
      "Aftershocks are triggered \u201cbecause of changes to stress in the Earth from the main shock,\u201d Yeck said.",
      "Given the magnitude of the quake in Myanmar, \u201cyou will probably see aftershocks for the next several months,\u201d Steckler said.",
      "In regions of the world with known active fault lines, including California and Japan, building codes are often designed to withstand earthquakes. But that's not true everywhere.",
      "\u201cIf you feel shaking, the guidance depends on where you are in the world,\u201d Yeck said.",
      "In many countries, including the United States, if you're inside when an earthquake occurs, it's advisable to drop to the ground, cover your head \u2014 for example, by crawling under a desk or other sturdy structure \u2014 and hold onto that structure, he said. Try to avoid areas near glass windows and don't use building elevators.",

      "LOS ANGELES -- Fans of Studio Ghibli, the famed Japanese animation studio behind \u201cSpirited Away\u201d and other beloved movies, were delighted this week when a new version of ChatGPT let them transform popular internet memes or personal photos into the distinct style of Ghibli founder Hayao Miyazaki.",
      "But the trend also highlighted ethical concerns about artificial intelligence tools trained on copyrighted creative works and what that means for the future livelihoods of human artists. Miyazaki, 84, known for his hand-drawn approach and whimsical storytelling, has expressed skepticism about AI's role in animation.",
      "Janu Lingeswaran wasn't thinking much about that when he uploaded a photo of his 3-year-old ragdoll cat, Mali, into ChatGPT's new image generator tool on Wednesday. He then asked ChatGPT to convert it to the Ghibli style, instantly making an anime image that looked like Mali but also one of the painstakingly drawn feline characters that populate Miyazaki movies such as \u201cMy Neighbor Totoro\u201d or \u201cKiki's Delivery Service.\u201d",
      "\u201cI really fell in love with the result,\u201d said Lingeswaran, an entrepreneur who lives near Aachen, Germany. \u201cWe're thinking of printing it out and hanging it on the wall.\u201d",
      "Similar results gave the Ghibli style to iconic images, such as the casual look of Turkish pistol shooter Yusuf Dikec in a T-shirt and one hand in his pocket on his way to winning a silver medal at the 2024 Olympics. Or the famed \u201cDisaster Girl\u201d meme of a 4-year-old turning to the camera with a slight smile as a house fire rages in the background.",
      "ChatGPT maker OpenAI, which is fighting copyright lawsuits over its flagship chatbot, has largely encouraged the \u201cGhiblification\u201d experiments and its CEO Sam Altman changed his profile on social media platform X into a Ghibli-style portrait. In a technical paper posted Tuesday, the company had said the new tool would be taking a \u201cconservative approach\u201d in the way it mimics the aesthetics of individual artists.",
      "\u201cWe added a refusal which triggers when a user attempts to generate an image in the style of a living artist,\u201d it said. But the company added in a statement that it \u201cpermits broader studio styles \u2014 which people have used to generate and share some truly delightful and inspired original fan creations.\u201d",
      "Studio Ghibli in Japan declined to comment Friday.",
      "As users posted their Ghibli-style images on social media, Miyazaki\u2019s previous comments on AI animation also began to resurface. When Miyazaki was shown an AI demo in 2016, he said he was \u201cutterly disgusted\u201d by the display, according to documentary footage of the interaction. The person demonstrating the animation, which showed a writhing body dragging itself by its head, explained that AI could \u201cpresent us grotesque movements that we humans can\u2019t imagine.\u201d It could be used for zombie movements, the person said.",
      "That prompted Miyazaki to tell a story.",
      "\u201cEvery morning, not in recent days, I see my friend who has a disability,\u201d Miyazaki said. \u201cIt\u2019s so hard for him just to do a high five; his arm with stiff muscle can\u2019t reach out to my hand. Now, thinking of him, I can\u2019t watch this stuff and find it interesting. Whoever creates this stuff has no idea what pain is.\u201d",
      "He said he would \u201cnever wish to incorporate this technology into my work at all.\u201d",
      "\u201cI strongly feel that this is an insult to life itself,\u201d he added.",
      "Josh Weigensberg, a partner at the law firm Pryor Cashman, said that one question the Ghibli-style AI art raises is whether the AI model was trained on Miyazaki or Studio Ghibli\u2019s work. That in turn \u201craises the question of, \u2018Well, do they have a license or permission to do that training or not?\u2019\u201d he said.",
      "OpenAI didn\u2019t respond to a question Thursday about whether it had a license.",
      "Weigensberg added that if a work was licensed for training, it might make sense for a company to permit this type of use. But if this type of use is happening without consent and compensation, he said, it could be \u201cproblematic.\u201d",
      "Weigensberg said that there is a general principle \u201cat the 30,000-foot view\u201d that \u201cstyle\u201d is not copyrightable. But sometimes, he said, what people are actually thinking of when they say \u201cstyle\u201d could be \"more specific, discernible, discrete elements of a work of art,\u201d he said.",
      "\u201cA \u2018Howl\u2019s Moving Castle' or \u2018Spirited Away,\u2019 you could freeze a frame in any of those films and point to specific things, and then look at the output of generative AI and see identical elements or substantially similar elements in that output,\u201d he said. \u201cJust stopping at, \u2018Oh, well, style isn\u2019t protectable under copyright law.\u2019 That's not necessarily the end of the inquiry.\u201d",
      "Artist Karla Ortiz, who grew up watching Miyazaki\u2019s movies and is suing other AI image generators for copyright infringement in a case that\u2019s still pending, called it \u201canother clear example of how companies like OpenAI just do not care about the work of artists and the livelihoods of artists.\u201d",
      "\u201cThat\u2019s using Ghibli\u2019s branding, their name, their work, their reputation, to promote (OpenAI) products,\u201d Ortiz said. \u201cIt\u2019s an insult. It\u2019s exploitation.\u201d",
      "Ortiz was further enraged when President Donald Trump\u2019s administration jumped into the meme trend Thursday, using the White House\u2019s official X account to post a Ghibli-style image of a weeping woman from the Dominican Republic recently arrested by U.S. immigration agents. The White House and OpenAI didn\u2019t immediately respond to requests for comment on how the image was made.",
      "\u201cTo see something so brilliant, as wonderful as Miyazaki\u2019s work be butchered to generate something so foul,\u201d Ortiz wrote on social media, adding that she hoped Studio Ghibli sues \u201cthe hell out of\u201d OpenAI for this.",

      "The governing body of figure skating has embarked on an ambitious plan called \u201cVision 2030,\u201d and the idea is simple: Make the sport cool again",
      "BOSTON -- Ashley Wagner and Ben Agosto know what it's like to step off the ice at the figure skating world championships and feel as though they've conquered the sport. And what it feels like when the notoriously fickle sport bites back.",
      "So when the International Skating Union put in motion its ambitious \u201cVision 2030\u201d plan, which is designed to grow and expand the sport through improved fan engagement, it made sense that they would call Wagner, a three-time U.S. champion and former world silver medalist, and Agosto, who won an Olympic silver medal with ice dance partner Tanith Belbin.",
      "If anyone was going to interview athletes at this week's world championships at such an emotionally raw moment, the minute after their programs have concluded, it ought to be someone who has been through it themselves.",
      "\u201cI would have loved this when I was an athlete, to have the post-skate interviews right in the kiss-and-cry, when the emotions are so fresh,\u201d Wagner said. \u201cThat's something being brought into this production. We've never seen anything like it.\u201d",
      "Look closely, and you might notice a lot of things never seen before at this week's worlds: cutting-edge LED dasher boards surrounding the rink, grand entrances for the athletes, and more energetic music \u2014 like the rocked-out version of \u201cI'm Shipping Up to Boston\u201d by the Celtic punk band Dropkick Murphys that keeps blaring inside TD Garden.",
      "The idea is simple: The ISU wants to make figure skating feel cool again.",
      "Or at least, cool to more people.",
      "Those who love the intricate, nuanced sport \u2014 the spins and jumps, the brilliant landings and bitter falls \u2014 tend to follow it year-round. But there are just as many fans that tune in once every four years, during the Winter Olympics, when like a shooting star the athletes spring onto the public consciousness and then fizzle as soon as it ends.",
      "\"Skaters are the reason why this sport exits,\" explained ISU president Jae Youl Kim, who granted The Associated Press a behind-the-scenes tour of the world championship setup Thursday, shortly before the start of the men's short program.",
      "\u201cWe are so proud of our athletes and we want to make sure we shine a brighter, stronger spotlight on our skaters.\u201d",
      "That is why those brilliant LED dasher boards are showcasing each athlete's social media tag, and why each is being introduced individually for the first time, something track and field and other Olympic sports have embraced over the years.",
      "The ISU wants to create a spectacle for the 14,000-plus fans in the arena, along with the millions watching around the world.",
      "\u201cThere's much more to come. I mean, we can brainstorm here a lot about potential marketing and sponsorship activations as well,\u201d said Wieland L\u00fcders, who manages the world championships for the ISU. \u201cEach skater has their own partners, potentially, so there are many more thoughts. But for now, we are just at the beginning. This is the basic concept.\u201d",
      "In the future, the Vision 2030 plan hopes to improve the TV presentation, simplify the sport\u2019s complex rules, increase sponsorship and expand revenue streams. It will also promote skating through grassroots initiatives, reimagine the season-long calendar, and explore new technology that could help to usher the sport into the modern era.",
      "The athletes aren't just benefiting from increased exposure, and the potential boon for their pocketbooks, but also from back-of-the-house upgrades that are a part of Vision 2030. In Boston, an expansive lounge is off limits to everyone but competitors, and back at their hotel, there is a calming room complete with a rotating cast of therapy dogs.",
      "Kim visited it this week. Nobody paid any attention to the ISU president because everybody wanted to see Penny, the dog.",
      "If the calming room is meant to destress, the new hot seat in the arena will probably do the exact opposite.",
      "Much like the time trial in Olympic cycling, where the leader sits uncomfortably on a throne until someone else takes the lead, the ISU has created the same thing at the world championships. But rather than some roped-off backstage area, where leaders have waited for decades, the hot seat is right next to the kiss-and-cry area in the heart of the arena.",
      "The athletes who are coming off the ice after their performance can't help but stare down whomever is in the lead.",
      "\u201cWe want the fans to see how that person is reacting when he or she climbs over to take the throne, or how they are reacting when they cannot make it,\u201d L\u00fcders said. \u201cThey could have interactions with each other, some hugging or high-fives, something like this. So we hope we get more engagement between the two skaters.\u201d",
      "Ultimately, more engagement with the fans, too.",

Two initial xenotransplants in the U.S. \u2014 two pig hearts and two pig kidneys \u2013 were short-lived.

His team reported Wednesday in the journal Nature that a pig liver transplanted into a brain-dead person survived for 10 days, with no early signs of rejection. He said the pig liver produced bile and albumin \u2014 important for basic organ function \u2014 although not as much as human livers do.",

    "story": [
      "Businesses and lawmakers are trying to address the U.S. affordable housing crisis by turning to alternative ways to build homes",
      "DENVER -- As Americans struggle under backbreaking rental prices, builders are turning to innovative ways to churn out more housing, from 3D printing to assembling homes in an indoor factory to using hemp \u2014 yes, the marijuana cousin \u2014 to make building blocks for walls.",
      "It's a response to the country's shortfall of millions of homes that has led to skyrocketing prices, plunging millions into poverty.",
      "\"There\u2019s not enough homes to purchase and there\u2019s not enough places to rent. Period,\" said Adrianne Todman, the acting secretary of the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development under former President Joe Biden.",
      "One way to quickly build more is embrace these types of innovations, Todman said. \u201cI can only imagine what our housing situation would be like now if we could have made a decision to be more aggressive in adopting this type of housing.\"",
      "So what are these new ways of building homes? And can they help reduce the cost of new housing, leading to lower rents?",
      "In a cavernous, metal hall, Eric Schaefer stood in front of a long row of modular homes that moved through the plant, similar to a car on an assembly line.",
      "At a series of stations, workers lay flooring, erected framing, added roofs and screwed on drywall. Everything from electrical wiring to plumbing to kitchen countertops were in place before the homes were shrink-wrapped and ready to be shipped.",
      "The business in the Colorado Rocky Mountains, Fading West, has pumped out more than 500 homes in its just over three years of operation, each taking just five to seven days to build, even in the coldest winter months, Schaefer said.",
      "Once assembled in the plant, the narrow townhouse-style homes with white trim, balconies and front porches, are about 90% done. At their final destination they are move-in ready within six weeks, Schaefer said.",
      "The company works with towns, counties and housing nonprofits to help address the shortage of affordable homes, mostly for workers who've been squeezed out by sky-high prices in ritzy mountain towns.",
      "That includes Eagle, Colorado, not far from the Vail ski resort, where Fading West worked with Habitat for Humanity to install modular homes at affordable rents for teachers and other school district employees. The homes tend to be on the smaller side, but can be multifamily or single family.",
      "\u201cYou can build faster. The faster you build \u2014 even at a high quality \u2014 means the lower the price,\u201d Schaefer said. \u201cWe see this as one of the pieces to the puzzle in helping solve the affordable housing crisis.\"",
      "There's a hefty upfront cost to build the factory, and part of the challenge is a lack of state and federal investment, he said. A patchwork of building codes governing how a structure can be built also makes it difficult, requiring changes to the construction depending on the town or county it is being sent to.",
      "Manufactured housing is similar to modular housing, but the units are constructed on a chassis \u2014 like a trailer \u2014 and they aren't subject to the same local building codes. That's part of the reason they are used more broadly across the U.S.",
      "Roughly 100,000 manufactured homes were shipped to states in 2024, up from some 60,000 a decade earlier, according to Census Bureau data. Estimates of modular homes built annually often put them below 20,000.",
      "Yes, there's technology to 3D print homes.",
      "A computer-controlled robotic arm equipped with a hose and nozzle moves back and forth, oozing lines of concrete, one on top of the other, as it builds up the wall of a home. It can go relatively quickly and form curved walls unlike concrete blocks.",
      "Grant Hamel, CEO and co-founder of VeroTouch, stood inside one of the homes his company built, the wall behind him made out of rolling layers of concrete, distinct to a 3D printer. The technology could eventually reduce labor costs and the time it takes to build an abode, but is farther off than manufactured or modular methods from making a dent in the housing crisis.",
      "It's \u201ca long game, to start chipping away at those prices at every step of the construction process,\u201d Hamel said.",
      "The 3D printers are expensive, and so are the engineers and other skilled employees needed to run them, said Ali Memari, director of the Pennsylvania Housing Research Center, whose work has partly focused on 3D printing. It's also not recognized by international building codes, which puts up more red tape.",
      "The technology is also generally restricted to single-story structures, unless traditional building methods are used as well, Memari said",
      "It's \u201ca technology at its beginning, it has room to grow, especially when it is recognized in code,\u201d Memari said. \u201cThe challenges that I mentioned exist, and they have to be addressed by the research community.\u201d",
      "Hemp \u2014 the plant related to marijuana \u2014 is being used more and more in the construction of walls.",
      "The hemp is mixed with other materials, most importantly the mineral lime, forming \"hempcrete,\" a natural insulation that's mold- and fire-resistant and can act as outer wall, insulation and inner wall.",
      "Hempcrete still requires wood studs to frame the walls, but it replaces three wall-building components with just one, said Memari, also a professor at Penn State University's Department of Civil and Environmental Engineering. Memari is now helping oversee research into making hempcrete that doesn't need the wood studs.",
      "As much as a million hemp plants to be used for hempcrete can grow on one acre in a matter of months as opposed to trees, which can take years or decades to grow.",
      "The plant is part of the cannabis family but has far less of the psychoactive component, THC, found in marijuana. In 2018, Congress legalized the production of certain types of hemp. Last year, the International Code Council, which develops international building codes used by all 50 states, adopted hempcrete as an insulation.",
      "Confusion over the legality of growing hemp and the price tag of the machine required to process the plant, called a decorticator, are barriers to hempcrete becoming more widespread in housing construction, Memari said.",
      "Still, he said, \u201chempcrete has a bright future.\"",

      "One firm said Trump's executive order threatens \"the legal system itself.\"",
      "Federal judges in D.C. on Friday partially blocked two executive orders signed by President Donald Trump targeting the Jenner and Block and WilmerHale law firms -- temporarily halting Trump's attempts to punish prominent law firms associated with his political foes.",
      "In a lawsuit brought by Jenner and Block, D.C. District Judge John Bates described Trump's executive order \u2014 which aims to strip the firms' attorneys of any security clearances they may hold and severely restrict any business they may have before the federal government \u2014 as \"troubling\" and \"disturbing.\" He said it targets the firm's and its employees' First Amendment rights and rights to due process.",
      "Bates, an appointee of former President George W. Bush, temporarily enjoined the administration from enforcing aspects of the order that seek to restrict government officials from engaging with officials from Jenner and Block, after he said the government failed to provide any substantive answers as to how employees from the firm threaten national security.",
      "The judge said that attorneys representing Jenner and Block showed that they were likely being targeted on the basis of their protected free speech rights, and that they would suffer irreparable economic harm if it were fully implemented.",
      "Later Friday, Judge Richard Leon also granted a temporary restraining order partially enjoining another executive order signed by Trump targeting the law firm WilmerHale.",
      "Leon, also an appointee of former President George W. Bush, said several parts of Trump's order clearly show \"retaliatory actions based on perceived viewpoint\" of employees of WilmerHale.",
      "\"There is no doubt this retaliatory action chills speech and legal advocacy, or that it qualifies as a constitutional harm,\" Leon said in his written order, following a hearing late Friday.",
      "Leon is now the third federal judge to largely accept arguments from law firms targeted by Trump that his orders are likely unconstitutional \u2014 and that if implemented, Leon said, WilmerHale \"faces crippling losses and its very survival is at stake.\"",
      "Both law firms filed suit in D.C. federal court on Friday to block the executive orders -- the same day another major law firm struck a $100 million deal to preemptively avoid a similar Trump executive order.",
      "The lawsuits accuse Trump of engaging in a sweeping campaign to intimidate major law firms who have represented plaintiffs currently suing the administration, or who have represented or at one point employed those he dislikes.",
      "The Trump executive order threatened their futures as well as \"the legal system itself,\" Jenner and Block said in its lawsuit.",
      "\"These orders send a clear message to the legal profession: Cease certain representations adverse to the government and renounce the Administration's critics -- or suffer the consequences,\" the Jenner and Block suit said. \"The orders also attempt to pressure businesses and individuals to question or even abandon their associations with their chosen counsel, and to chill bringing legal challenges at all.\"",
      "The two firms are the latest firms seeking to counter what has been a rapid onslaught by the White House seeking to target individual firms that have hired or otherwise represented Trump's political enemies.",
      "Meanwhile, Trump said on Friday that the law firm Skadden, Arps, Slate, Meagher & Flom struck a deal to avoid one of his executive orders by providing $100 million in pro bono work during the Trump administration -- among other guarantees.",
      "The move has sent shockwaves through the legal community. The White House is prepared to target more big law firms, sources tell ABC News, and there are ongoing discussions among top advisers on strategy associated with possibly entering into negotiations with more of them.",
      "Legal scholars have said there is little legal precedent for Trump's war on Big Law, which has created a chilling effect across the legal community, and most will certainly have a chilling effect on his opponents who will need legal representation against him.",
      "The firms' legal actions come on the heels of successful effort by the law firm Perkins Coie, which earlier this month secured a court order blocking similar executive action signed by Trump.",

      "Trump has said the CFPB is \"very important to get rid of\" and that the organization was \"set up to destroy some very good people.\"",
      "In her ruling, Judge Jackson said the Trump administration acted in \"complete disregard\" for Congress when it attempted to unilaterally dismantle the agency.",
      "Their efforts to dismantle the organization continued even after Judge Jackson in February ordered the Trump administration to not fire the majority of the agency's employees, she wrote.",
      "\"Absent an injunction freezing the status quo \u2013 preserving the agency's data, its operational capacity, and its workforce \u2013 there is a substantial risk that the defendants will complete the destruction of the agency completely in violation of law well before the Court can rule on the merits, and it will be impossible to rebuild,\" she wrote.",
      "Judge Jackson also criticized the Trump administration for scrambling to change course after she began examining the effort to wind down operations.",
      "According to Jackson, the government's claim that the CFPB was still performing its legally required duties was \"nothing more than window dressing\" to hide what was happening to shutter the organization.",
      "\"The defendants are still engaged in an effort to implement a Presidential plan to shut the agency down entirely and to do it fast,\" Judge Jackson.",
      "In court proceedings, Trump administration officials claimed the stop-work order that sent the vast majority of employees home was a \"common practice at the beginning of a new administration\" and Justice Department lawyers insisted the Trump administration is trying to improve the CFPB, not destroy it.",
      "Judge Jackson specifically called out the irreparable harm done to one of the plaintiffs who brought the lawsuit, Pastor Eva Steege, who sought help from the CFPB to forgive her public service loans before she died. With the Trump administration dismantling the CFPB as she requested help, Steege never got an appointment with the CFPB, according to her lawyers.",
      "\"If I do not receive public service loan forgiveness and the large refund that I am owed before my death, my family could be forced to pursue a death discharge that will not provide them with the refund that they are counting on so that they can use the money for basic needs after I pass,\" Steege said in a sworn declaration.",
      "She died on March 15, and her loans were never discharged.",
      "\"The irreparable harm that has already come to pass for Pastor Eva Steege is enough to grant preliminary relief,\" Judge Jackson wrote.",

      "\"Our nation's students are going to suffer,\" Cottrell said. \"I think of the doctoral students that are, you know, trying to do research on cancer or, you know, learning or whatever it may be, and without the funds to support them, they are going to -- it's going to be hard for them to succeed without those funds, and we're not going to gain that knowledge that we need.\"",
      "The farewell ceremony at the department comes as \"clap-outs\" are set to continue across the country next week at regional offices in places such as Cleveland, Dallas and San Francisco. But these moments hit especially close to home for Richardson, who detailed how she overcame a teenage pregnancy while growing up east of the river in the Southeast quadrant of the city.",
      "She said it's so close yet so \"far away\" from the federal government.",
      "\"I hate that I can't be a voice or inspiration to the young girls growing up in Southeast D.C. that I wanted to inspire,\" Richardson said, adding that she \"wanted to give a chance to, you know, show that there's another way and you can make it forward.\"",
      "\"You can make a big impact and a big difference in the country coming from where we from,\" she said.",

      "Judge Boasberg on Friday extended his restraining order for another two weeks.",
      "U.S. District Judge James Boasberg on Friday extended his temporary restraining order blocking deportations under the Alien Enemies Act for another two weeks.",
      "The order came hours after the Trump administration asked the U.S. Supreme Court to urgently lift Boasberg's block on the use of the AEA to deport alleged Tren de Aragua gang members.",
      "Judge Boasberg's temporary restraining order blocking the deportations -- issued on March 15 -- was set to expire on Saturday, and his new order extends the order until at least April 12. He also set an April 8 hearing to consider a longer-lasting preliminary injunction.",
      "\"As this Court recently explained, Plaintiffs are entitled to a TRO enjoining their removal at least until they have had a chance to challenge that they are covered by the Proclamation,\" Judge Boasberg wrote regarding the temporary restraining order.",
      "In its emergency application to the Supreme Court earlier Friday, Trump administration attorneys wrote that \"Only this Court can stop rule-by-TRO from further upending the separation of powers -- the sooner, the better.\"",
      "\"Here, the district court's orders have rebuffed the President's judgments as to how to protect the Nation against foreign terrorist organizations and risk debilitating effects for delicate foreign negotiations,\" Acting Solicitor General Sarah Harris wrote.",
      "\"More broadly, rule-by-TRO has become so commonplace among district courts that the Executive Branch's basic functions are in peril. In the two months since Inauguration Day, district courts have issued more than 40 injunctions or TROs against the Executive Branch,\" Harris wrote.",
      "The appeal followed Wednesday's 2-1 ruling by the D.C. Circuit Court of Appeals upholding Boasberg's order and defending his jurisdiction in the matter.",
      "The appeals court heard arguments Monday over the Trump administration's use of the Alien Enemies Act earlier this month to deport more than 200 alleged migrant gang members to El Salvador without due process.",
      "Trump invoked the Alien Enemies Act -- a wartime authority used to deport noncitizens with little-to-no due process -- by arguing that the Venezuelan gang Tren de Aragua is a \"hybrid criminal state\" that is invading the United States.",
      "Judge Boasberg temporarily blocked the president's use of the law to deport the alleged gang members, calling the removals \"awfully frightening\" and \"incredibly troublesome,\" and ordered that the government turn around two flights carrying more than 200 alleged Tren de Aragua members to El Salvador. Authorities failed to turn the flights around, saying they were already in international waters.",
      "An official with the U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement subsequently acknowledged in a sworn declaration that \"many\" of the alleged gang members did not have criminal records in the United States -- but said that \"the lack of specific information about each individual actually highlights the risk they pose\" and \"demonstrates that they are terrorists with regard to whom we lack a complete profile.\"",

    "story": [
      "Republicans have expressed concerns about maintaining their U.S. House majority.",
      "In a pair of back-to-back rallies held over the phone on Thursday night, President Donald Trump praised the two Republican candidates in the upcoming special elections for Florida's 6th and 1st Congressional districts, amid recent concerns among Republicans over whether their candidate in the 6th Congressional District, State Sen. Randy Fine, can keep the seat in Republican hands.",
      "Fine has lagged behind his Democratic opponent, Josh Weil, in fundraising, and Republicans have expressed concerns about his campaign, although many still believe he will be able to hold the seat in the ruby-red district.",
      "The special election in Florida's 6th Congressional District, which is on the state's eastern coast and includes the city of Daytona Beach, is being held on Tuesday, April 1, to fill the vacancy created by former Rep. Mike Waltz when he resigned to become Trump's national security adviser.",
      "The tele-rallies also came amid broader concerns among Republicans about maintaining their razor-thin majority in the U.S. House, and on the same day that Trump asked Rep. Elise Stefanik to withdraw her nomination to be United Nations ambassador, citing \"a very tight Majority\" in the U.S. House.",
      "House Republicans currently hold a narrow majority with 218 Republicans to 213 Democrats. Speaker Mike Johnson has a two-vote cushion for his majority.",
      "Fine, at the start of the telephone rally for him, emphatically praised Trump and said he would serve in Congress as one of the president's strongest allies.",
      "\"Mr. President, I'm immensely grateful for your unwavering support, trust and confidence in me. I believe that God saved your life in Butler, Pennsylvania, so that you could save the world,\" Fine said, referencing the July assassination attempt Trump survived. \"And it will be one of the most profound honors of my life to be one of your foot soldiers as you make America great again.\"",
      "Trump praised Fine's early endorsement of him during the 2024 election cycle, adding, \"that's why Randy will always have a very open door to the Oval Office. He will be there whenever I need him, and he wants to be there whenever we need him. He wants to be there for you.\"",
      "\"I've gotten to know him under pressure situations, and he can react well under pressure. So go vote for Randy,\" Trump said later.",
      "Fine reiterated he would work to carry out Trump's agenda in Congress.",
      "\"It's not overstating things to say that your agenda is at stake in this election, and this district can't let you down. Your agenda is on the ballot on April 1,\" he said.",
      "During the earlier telephone rally supporting the Republican candidate in the 1st Congressional District, Florida Chief Financial Officer Jimmy Patronis, Trump praised Patronis' work in Florida and framed the special election as important for his own agenda.",
      "That special election, which will determine who takes the seat vacated by now-former Rep. Matt Gaetz, has gotten less concern from Republicans.",
      "\"The 1st Congressional District is special, and I won it by a lot, and Jimmy is going to win it by a lot. And remember, you're five days away from this all important special election taking place in your district on Tuesday, April 1, so April Fool's Day. So it's going to be the fool for the Democrat candidate, who happens to be terrible,\" Trump said of Patronis' Democratic opponent Gay Valimont, a gun violence prevention activist.",
      "Praising Patronis, Trump said, \"Jimmy's done an outstanding job as the chief financial officer of the state of Florida, helping to guide your state to tremendous economic success. And now he wants to keep on fighting for Florida in Congress.\"",
      "Patronis, speaking after Trump, told listeners, \"Look, if you're not fired up to hearing the president right now, then you need to get your pulse checked with President Trump and the White House. A Republican majority in Congress -- we have a once in a lifetime opportunity to transform this country.\"",

    "story": [
      "Judge Benjamin Settle became the second federal judge to block the policy.",
      "If allowed to go into effect, the Trump administration's new policy on transgender soldiers would be a \"de facto blanket prohibition\" that seeks \"to eradicate transgender service,\" a federal judge wrote Thursday in issuing a preliminary injunction against the policy.",
      "In a 65-page opinion issued late Thursday, U.S. District Judge Benjamin Settle became the second federal judge to block the policy, which he described as discriminatory and disconnected from the goals of \"military readiness, unit cohesion, lethality, or any of the other touchstone phrases long used to exclude various groups from service.\"",
      "The Justice Department filed notice Friday that it would appeal the judge's decision.",
      "While the Trump administration had argued that the judiciary should defer to military leadership, Judge Settle -- who was nominated to the bench by President George W. Bush near the height of the War on Terror -- said he is unable to condone a \"unsupported, dramatic and facially unfair exclusionary policy.\"",
      "\"The government falls well short of its burden to show that banning transgender service is substantially related to achieving unit cohesion, good order, or discipline. Although the Court gives deference to military decision making, it would be an abdication to ignore the government's flat failure to address plaintiffs' uncontroverted evidence that years of open transgender service promoted these objectives,\" he wrote.",
      "The group of seven active-duty service members who brought the lawsuit argued that the policy \"purposefully discriminates\" against soldiers based on their gender identity -- an argument that Justice Department lawyers attempted to rebut by reframing the question as a medical issue, impacting only people who suffer gender dysphoria. Judge Settle was unconvinced, writing that the policy \"uses gender dysphoria as a proxy to ban all transgender service members.\"",
      "\"The government's arguments are not persuasive, and it is not an especially close question on this record,\" he wrote, finding that each of the plaintiffs would be irreparably harmed by the policy, which would curtail their military service.",
      "Judge Settle also called out the Trump administration for seemingly disregarding the service history of the transgender soldiers who brought the case, such as the Commander Emily Shilling, a naval aviator with 19 years of service who flew 60 combat missions before becoming a Navy test pilot.",
      "\"There is no claim and no evidence that she is now, or ever was, a detriment to her unit's cohesion, or to the military's lethality or readiness, or that she is mentally or physically unable to continue her service,\" Settle wrote.",
      "\"There is no claim and no evidence that Shilling herself is dishonest or selfish, or that she lacks humility or integrity. Yet absent an injunction, she will be promptly discharged solely because she is transgender,\" wrote the judge.",

    "summary": "An international relations expert said there are a few ways Trump could acquire Greenland, however, those options would have serious consequences to the world order.",
    "story": [
      "The available options would have serious consequences to the world order.",
      "The Trump administration remains steadfast in acquiring Greenland, despite the island's leaders refusing to give it up as Vice President JD Vance and second lady Usha Vance travel to the country on Friday.",
      "\"We need Greenland for national security and international security. So, we'll, I think, we'll go as far as we have to go,\" President Donald Trump told reporters on Wednesday.",
      "Vance has touted Greenland\u2019s \"incredible natural resources\" in speeches that call for the territory's acquisition for its riches in gold, copper and rare earth materials.",
      "Trump's ambitions aren't far-fetched, according to an international relations expert who told ABC News that there are some avenues in which the U.S. could realistically acquire the autonomous Danish territory.",
      "However, international policy, laws and decades-long economic and political partnerships make Trump's wishes extremely improbable, according to Phillip Lipscy, professor of political science at the University of Toronto.",
      "\"This kind of rhetoric hasn't been part of U.S. foreign policymaking since World War II,\" he told ABC News. \"If the United States moves forward with this, this would be a game changer.\"",
      "Lipscy noted that while acquiring Greenland would bolster the U.S.'s security in the Arctic Circle, such a move is not needed because of NATO nations' strong military and naval presence.",
      "Annexation is not new in U.S. history, going back to the Louisiana Purchase in 1803, when the U.S acquired a major portion of what is now the central part of the country was acquired in a deal with France.",
      "The last time that the U.S. was given land that became territories was when it acquired three Pacific Ocean island groups as part of the post-World War II agreement with the United Nations in 1947 known as the Trust Territory of the Pacific Islands.",
      "That deal took years of negotiating and an agreement from several nations who worked out the geopolitical landscape of post-war Oceania.",
      "Only one of those island groups, the Marianas Islands, remains a U.S. territory.",
      "Lipscy said such deals between sovereign nations have dwindled over the decades in exchange for agreements such as limited military partnerships, trade deals and other treaties, which take far less time and help keep the sovereignty of nations.",
      "Trump and the U.S. would have to negotiate with Denmark's government for a sale or an annexation of Greenland if he were to take over the land without violating international law or using the military to take the country by force.",
      "Greenland's politics are already making any such negotiation difficult, according to Lipscy.",
      "Greenland is a self-sovereign territory of Denmark with its own elected government, with Denmark's parliament handling international matters.",
      "There has been a movement within the island to be independent from Denmark that will be a key factor in any future plans of a U.S. acquisition, according to Lipscy.",
      "\"Certainly, there may be a diplomatic solution that starts with an independent Greenland\u2026but it's difficult to see that situation,\" he said.",
      "In elections earlier this month, pro-independence parties won the most seats in parliament but neither want to be part of the U.S. Greenland is now forming a coalition government in the wake of the election.",
      "Greenland's government and its residents have loudly protested Trump since he began talking about acquiring it in December. He floated the idea earlier in his first term in 2019 but didn't pursue it.",
      "\"Greenland belongs to the Greenlanders. We are not Americans, we are not Danes because we are Greenlanders. This is what the Americans and their leaders need to understand. We cannot be bought and we cannot be ignored,\" Greenland\u2019s Prime Minister Mute Bourup Egede said in a Facebook post earlier this month.",
      "Egede also called Friday's visit by the Vances and other U.S. officials, including national security adviser Mike Waltz and Energy Secretary Chris Wright, part of a \"very aggressive American pressure against the Greenlandic community\" and called for the international community to rebuke it.",
      "The Danish government has also pushed back hard on Trump's calls to acquire Greenland and has encouraged its residents to speak out against it.",
      "\"They know well that Greenland isn't for sale. They know well that Greenland doesn't want to be a part of the United States,\" Danish Prime Mette Frederiksen said in a statement Wednesday.",
      "\"The attention is overwhelming and the pressure is great. But it's in times like these that you show what fabric you're made of. You haven't let yourselves be cowed. You have stood up for who you are - and you have shown what you stand for. It has my deepest respect,\" she added.",
      "Frederiksen said that other European nations are also on Denmark's side in this back-and-forth with Trump, already hampering the ties between the U.S. and its allies since Trump regained office.",
      "Lipscy said that such a purchase would take a long time and would likely stretch long beyond Trump's term, especially if the Greenland and Danish leadership and their people continue to reject Trump's calls.",
      "If Trump continued to ignore the wishes of Greenland and Denmark, it would also strain those relationships and affect economic, national security and political alliances that have been in place since the end of World War II, Lipscy said.",
      "\"It would signal the U.S. can no longer be trusted to be a reliable partner and hold international norms,\" he said. \"No one would want to do any type of deal, partnership or negotiation.\"",
      "Trump has refused to rule out military action to take over Greenland, but Lipscy said that a full-on military acquisition would also not sit well in the domestic and international political field and, most importantly, among the American people.",
      "A poll released by the Wall Street Journal days before Trump returned to the White House found that 68% of Americans opposed the idea.",
      "\"The idea of territorial expansion is coming predominantly from the president himself and there isn't any widespread agreement on acquiring from the public or the Republican Party,\" Lipscy said.",
      "He predicted that while Trump may be \"banging the table\" more to make his goal a reality, it won\u2019t move the needle beyond his base because the general public knows that such a move would be costly and ultimately not help national security.",
      "\"I think even if the ultimate goal of the U.S. government is to secure closer ties with Greenland, the way the administration is going about with its policymaking is deeply counterproductive and unlikely to get the result they are seeking,\" he said.",

    "story": [
      "Andrew Tate is facing a new lawsuit filed by his ex-girlfriend accusing him of sexual assault and battery",
      "Andrew Tate, a hugely successful social media influencer known for expressing misogynistic views online, is facing a new lawsuit filed by his ex-girlfriend accusing him of sexual assault and battery.",
      "It adds to existing legal trouble for Tate, who\u2019s charged with human trafficking and forming a criminal gang to sexually exploit women in Romania. His brother, Tristan Tate, is also accused in that case.",
      "In her complaint, Tate\u2019s ex-girlfriend, Brianna Stern, argues that his abusive treatment of her follows a long pattern of making blatant misogyny part of his brand. She said he initially acted effusively loving and generous to lure her into a relationship that later turned abusive.",
      "The lawsuit, which was filed Thursday in Los Angeles, details an encounter earlier this month at the Beverly Hills Hotel when Tate choked and beat her, according to the complaint. Stern said she was later diagnosed with post-concussion syndrome.",
      "Tate\u2019s attorney, Joseph McBride, said his client denies all allegations of violence. McBride accused Stern and her lawyers of taking advantage of the recent controversy surrounding Tate, hoping it could win them a lucrative payout.",
      "\u201cThis is a money grab,\u201d McBride said in a phone interview Saturday morning. \u201cThis is the weaponization of the court system against an innocent man.\u201d",
      "The Tate brothers, who are dual U.S. and British citizens, were arrested in Romania in late 2022 and formally indicted last year. Andrew Tate was also charged with rape. They deny all the allegations against them.",
      "Stern met Tate in July 2024 after the brothers invited her to Romania because they were looking for models to help promote their cryptocurrency meme coin, according to her lawsuit. She said he convinced her the media portrayals of him were untrue, that he was actually a supporter of women. It seemed like \u201ca dream come true,\u201d she said in the complaint.",
      "After she returned to the U.S., Tate\u2019s communications became threatening and manipulative, including calling her his \u201cproperty,\u201d Stern alleges. He sent messages saying he wanted to beat and impregnate her: \u201cYou have an attitude because you\u2019re not hit enough,\u201d he once wrote, according to the complaint.",
      "Tate\u2019s attorney, however, called the messages \u201cdoctored, edited and falsified,\u201d saying he doesn\u2019t believe they\u2019ll be admissible in court.",
      "\u201cNone of it is true,\u201d McBride said. \u201cAll of it is a lie.\u201d",
      "During their last encounter at the hotel, Stern alleges, Tate beat and choked her during sex.",
      "\u201cWhile doing so, Tate told her repeatedly that if she ever crossed him, he was going to kill her,\u201d the lawsuit says.",
      "Tate, 38, is a former professional kickboxer and self-described misogynist who has amassed millions of followers online, many of them young men and boys drawn in by the luxurious lifestyle he projects. He previously was banned from TikTok, YouTube and Facebook for hate speech, including that women should bear responsibility for getting raped. He and his brother are vocal supporters of President Donald Trump.",
      "The Tate brothers checked in at a police station near Romania\u2019s capital last Monday, complying with judicial control requirements in the human trafficking case that ordered them to return after weeks in the U.S. The American trip was possible because a travel ban against them was lifted last month after a Romanian court found multiple legal and procedural irregularities \u2014 a significant blow to the prosecution and a win for the Tates.",
      "Tate has repeatedly claimed that prosecutors in Romania have no evidence against him and claimed there\u2019s a political conspiracy to silence him.",
      "Days after they arrived in Florida, the state\u2019s attorney general opened a criminal investigation into the brothers.",
      "Four British women are suing Tate in the U.K. after the Crown Prosecution Service decided not to prosecute him on sexual violence and other abuse charges. Last March, the brothers appeared at the Bucharest Court of Appeal in a separate case after U.K. authorities issued arrest warrants over allegations of sexual aggression dating back several years. The appeals court granted the U.K. request to extradite them, but only after legal proceedings in Romania have concluded.",
      "Stern said in a statement posted to social media that she\u2019s terrified of how Tate will respond to her public accusations.",
      "\u201cI considered many times just silently leaving Andrew and saying nothing, doing nothing, because I was scared and because it was honestly hard for me to accept that I was being abused,\u201d she wrote. \u201cBut I can now see that doing so would be the cowardly approach.\u201d",
      "Her attorney, Tony Buzbee, praised her \u201cincredible courage to come forward and make her voice heard.\u201d",

      "President Donald Trump has spent nearly every weekend in Florida since starting his second term",
      "WEST PALM BEACH, Fla. -- The sun was shining outside President Donald Trump's West Palm Beach golf course on Saturday morning when Alan Mentser got a call letting him know that police were shutting down a road nearby. It was almost time to \u201cshow the boss a little love.\u201d",
      "Mentser, 65, and a group of hard-core supporters have spent years gathering at the same spot to welcome Trump when he comes to play golf, and they have the routine down. They monitor flight trackers to know when Air Force One arrives and traffic cameras to see if the presidential motorcade is on the move.",
      "It\u2019s an intense commitment of time and resources for a brief glimpse of their political hero. Mentser pointed to a gigantic banner showing Trump giving a thumbs up against an American flag backdrop. He said each one costs $300, and he has about eight of them.",
      "But Mentser said it's worth it at a time when supporters view Trump as a man under siege from his enemies and fabricated controversies.",
      "\"It might give him 30 seconds of seeing, \u2018there\u2019s my people,\u2019\" he said. \u201cBut that 30 seconds matter.\u201d",
      "Now it was time to do it again. The cue was a siren as a police vehicle blocked the road in front of the golf club.",
      "\u201cHere we go!\u201d Mentser said. When he glimpsed the motorcade in the distance, he announced, \u201cattention on deck.\u201d",
      "A member of the group switched the soundtrack on a portable speaker from country music to \u201cYMCA,\u201d the Trump campaign anthem.",
      "The convoy of black cars rolled down the street and turned into the golf club. Trump was wearing his typical red \u201cMake America Great Again\u201d hat and white polo shit, and he reached across his chest to wave to the crowd with his left hand.",
      "\u201cPresident Trump! We love you!\u201d shouted Brady Collier, 31, who wore the same hat as the president.",
      "It was over in less than 30 seconds.",
      "A woman with white hair pulled up shortly afterward with her windows down and a dog in the passenger seat. She waved one middle finger at the golf club and another at Trump\u2019s supporters. Someone called her a \u201cbaby killer\u201d before she drove off.",
      "The moment didn\u2019t dampen Collier\u2019s enthusiasm. Despite all the times that he's witnessed Trump's motorcade, he said \u201ctoday was special.\u201d This time, the limo seemed to roll slower and closer to the sidewalk, giving Collier a better glimpse of the president.",
      "\u201cThere\u2019s nothing cooler than that,\u201d he said. \u201cOther than Jesus Christ.\u201d",
      "Collier, 31, is from Indiana but spent the winter in Florida, where he\u2019s doing landscaping and food deliveries. It\u2019s also an opportunity to show his support for Trump as often as possible.",
      "Jared Petry, 24, has been doing the same thing. He\u2019s from Ohio and is one of the \u201cFront Row Joes,\u201d a group of superfans that traveled the country supporting Trump at campaign rallies. Petry was in Butler, Pennsylvania, last summer when the president was fired upon in an assassination attempt.",
      "\u201cI heard popping. I didn\u2019t know what was going on,\u201d he said.",
      "Petry was near the front of the audience, and he captured video of Trump, surrounded by Secret Service agents, lurching to his feet and pumping his fist in the air.",
      "\u201cI knew he was OK,\u201d he said.",
      "Now, Petry is outside the golf course every weekend.",
      "\u201cHe never forgets his supporters,\" he said. \u201cHe waves at us.\u201d",
      "The group chatted about going to a nearby restaurant where Fox News host Sean Hannity is sometimes spotted, but something different happened this time. A group of staff members from the golf club came over to invite them in for a meal.",
      "Mentser said that had never happened before. They ate freshly made omelets and blueberry muffins and walked out to the veranda, where they could see Trump playing one of the holes on his golf course.",
      "The group refrained from trying to get Trump's attention, Mentser said.",
      "\u201cYou don\u2019t want to have the president post on Truth Social that \u2018I was lining up my putt and my supporters threw off my game,'\u201d he joked.",
      "The whole experience, Mentser said, was \u201ctremendous.\u201d",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s a small way for him to say thank you, I see you,\" he said.",

      "TOKYO -- U.S. Secretary of Defense Pete Hegseth praised Saturday the friendship and trust that his country and Japan have developed while attending a memorial service on Iwo Jima to honor those who died in battle during World War II.",
      "Japan is Hegseth's second stop after the Philippines on his first Asia trip. His visit comes as Beijing has been showing increasingly assertive actions in the disputed South China Sea and following threats by President Donald Trump to impose trade tariffs on the East Asian country, a key U.S. ally.",
      "Hegseth landed on the Japanese island of Iwo Jima, now known as Iwoto, where Japanese and American soldiers faced off in one of the war's fiercest battles. He joined several American veterans who survived the battle and Japanese bereaved families, as well as his Japanese counterpart, Gen Nakatani, Prime Minister Shigeru Ishiba and other officials at Saturdsay's Reunion of Honor event.",
      "\u201cIwo Jima embodies our shared warrior ethos, our shared devotion to the nation, and to duty and our shared reverence for the men of valor who preceded us,\u201d Hegseth said in front of the cenotaph built in 1985 marking their first joint memorial.",
      "\u201cThe U.S.-Japan alliance shows ... how yesterday\u2019s enemy has become today\u2019s friends,\u201d Hegseth said. \u201cOur alliance has been and remains the cornerstone of freedom, prosperity, security and peace in the Indo-Pacific.\u201d",
      "Recent polls show the Japanese feel more affinity toward the U.S. than any other country. Most Americans and Japanese alive today were born after Japan surrendered in August 1945.",
      "Japan, which faces growing threats from China, North Korea and Russia, has been accelerating its military buildup and increasingly working closely with the U.S. military.",
      "On Sunday, Hegseth will hold talks with Nakatani in Tokyo to discuss further strengthening the alliance.",

      "Ishiba renewed his determination to peace and to further elevate the Japan-U.S. alliance.",
      "\u201cAnd we must continue to endeavor to humbly face the history and keep telling the harrowing experience of the war to the world so that we never repeat the tragedy of war,\" Ishiba said.",
      "The 1945 Battle of Iwo Jima is best known for the photo by The Associated Press\u2019 Joe Rosenthal showing six Marines raising the U.S. flag over Mount Suribachi.",
      "About 70,000 American troops fought at Iwo Jima from Feb. 19 to March 26, 1945, as the U.S. tried to take control of a key strategic point to advance to mainland Japan. Nearly 7,000 Marines and about 20,000 Japanese were killed. More than half of the remains of the Japanese are still unaccounted for.",

But DHS declined to answer specific questions from The Associated Press about how it was treating reports from outside groups or the usage of facial recognition.",
      "Betar spokesman Daniel Levy said that some people on its list were identified using the facial-recognition tool called NesherAI created by Hawila's company, Stellar Technologies, which was launched from his Brooklyn apartment. The software takes its name from the Hebrew word for \u201ceagle.\u201d",
      "Demonstrating the software for a reporter recently, Hawila paused repeatedly to tweak computer code to account for what he said was the just-completed ingestion of thousands of additional photos scraped from social media accounts.",
      "After some delay, the software matched a screenshot of a fully masked protester \u2014 seen on video confronting Hawila at a recent march \u2014 with publicity photos of a woman who described herself online as a New York artist. He said he would report her to the police for assault.",
      "Hawila, a native of Lebanon, is no stranger to controversy. He was the subject of news stories in 2021 when, after marrying an ultra-orthodox woman in New York, he was confronted with accusations that he lied about being Jewish. Religious authorities have since confirmed that his mother was Jewish and certified his faith, he said.",
      "Hawila said he no longer works directly with Betar but continues to share protesters\u2019 names with it and other pro-Israel groups and said he has discussed licensing his software to some of them. He showed an email exchange with one group that appeared to confirm such contact.",
      "\u201cTechnology, when used in good ways, makes the world a better place,\u201d he said.",
      "As a candidate, Trump campaigned on a promise to crack down on campus antisemitism and threatened to deport activists with student visas that he called violent radicals.",
      "Soon after the election, Betar claimed on social media that it was working to identify and report international student protesters to the incoming administration.",
      "\u201cEntire university departments have been corrupted by jihadis,\u201d Levy said in a recent e-mail exchange with the AP.",
      "Days before his arrest, Khalil said in an interview that he was aware of Betar\u2019s call for his deportation and that it and other groups were trying to use him as a \u201cscapegoat.\u201d",
      "Students protesting Israel's conduct in Gaza have been unsure what to make of Betar, which the Anti-Defamation League recently added to its list of extremist groups. The ADL has also voiced support for revoking the visas of foreign student activists.",
      "At the University of Pittsburgh, leaders of Students for Justice in Palestine said they spoke with police in November after an online message from Betar that said it would be visiting the school to \u201cgive you beepers\u201d \u2014 an apparent reference to Israel\u2019s detonation of thousands of electronic pagers last fall to kill and wound members of Lebanon\u2019s Hezbollah militia.",
      "Ross Glick, who was Betar's executive director at the time, said that the message was \u201ca tongue-in-cheek dark joke,\u201d not a threat.",

      "Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth\u2019s decision to review military standards on combat and physical fitness and appearance opens a Pandora\u2019s box of the widely different rules among the services",
      "WASHINGTON -- The defense secretary's decision to review military standards on combat and physical fitness and appearance opens a Pandora\u2019s box of widely differing rules among the services. And it will raise a crucial question: Should there be a cookie-cutter approach, or should service differences, evolving social norms and recruiting realities play a role in policy decisions?",
      "Pete Hegseth has been very public about his opposition to women in combat jobs and his belief that standards were lowered to accommodate women, and he warned there would be reviews to address the issues. He is a staunch proponent of making all standards the same, regardless of gender, and military officials are braced for changes as reviews continue.",
      "In a memo March 12, Hegseth said the undersecretary for personnel must gather information on military standards \u201cpertaining to physical fitness, body composition, and grooming, which includes but is not limited to beards.\u201d",
      "\u201cWe must remain vigilant in maintaining the standards that enable the men and women of our military to protect the American people and our homeland as the world\u2019s most lethal and effective fighting force,\u201d he wrote.",
      "The effort is seen as a broadside against women serving on the frontlines \u2014 which they have been doing successfully for years. Hegseth's memo calls for a review of how standards have changed and the impact of those shifts since Jan. 1, 2015 \u2014 the year the Defense Department opened all combat jobs to women.",
      "And it raises questions about whether he wants to make all fitness tests the same for the services and make them all gender- and age-neutral or whether he will set minimum standards and allow the services to require more stringent requirements as desired.",
      "Eliminating the current policy of scoring annual fitness tests based on age and gender could hurt retention and recruitment if troops are suddenly told to meet a new, dramatically harder requirement. Such changes are generally phased in over time.",
      "Here's a look at the current standards.",
      "The military has long had what is largely a two-part system for physical fitness standards:",
      "\u2014 Routine annual fitness tests with different requirements based on gender and age.",
      "\u2014 More grueling standards for specific combat, special operations, infantry, armor, parajumpers and other jobs that are the same for everyone in that occupation, and are not adjusted for age or gender.",
      "Right now, the fitness tests are a hodgepodge.",
      "Each service has basic tests that all service members must pass once or twice a year. For every service, the tests vary. Scoring is adjusted for gender and age. For example: A 20-year-old man must complete a run in a faster time than a woman or a 30-year-old man in order to receive the maximum score.",
      "Fitness tests used to be simpler: a run, push-ups and sit-ups. They evolved over time and now can include options. For example, Air Force service members can do either a 1 1/2-mile run or a sprint. Other services will at times allow biking or rowing as a cardio substitute for the run; planks are now more widely used than sit-ups.",
      "The Army and Marines have more extensive fitness tests..",
      "The Army, in a major overhaul several years ago, expanded its fitness test to six events, including a dead lift, run, planks, push-ups, standing power throw and a combination sprint/drag/carry. The events were meant to mimic real-world military circumstances. An early plan to make that test gender and age neutral was scrapped after studies showed problems.",
      "The Marine Corps has two tests a year. In the first half, Marines take a physical fitness test that includes a three-mile run, pull-ups and planks. In the second half of the year, they take a combat fitness test that includes an 880-meter run in combat boots, an ammo-can lift and an exercise that mimics troops\u2019 maneuver under fire.",
      "The maneuver portion includes an obstacle course with a low crawl, high crawl and sprint, as well as dragging a person and using the fireman\u2019s carry.",
      "Specific military jobs like special operations, infantry, armor and parajumping require different, higher-level physical \u2014 and often mental and psychological \u2014 tests, requirements and qualification courses.",
      "Those standards require everyone to meet the same gender- and age-neutral requirements. For example, an Army soldier who wants to be a Green Beret or a sailor who wants to be a SEAL must pass those grueling months-long qualification courses.",
      "Also, after the Pentagon allowed women to be in all combat jobs, the Army set specific fitness standards for each military occupation that are the same regardless of sex or age. Recruits who want to serve in an infantry or armor job must pass a specific physical assessment that has higher, more significant demands, in order to sign a contract for that specialty.",
      "Over the years, a wide array of standards and requirements have been adjusted for reasons ranging from religious tolerance to recruiting and evolving societal trends.",
      "In large part, they are driven by recruiting struggles and the need to woo those from a changing universe of American young people, including those with less academic schooling or people from states where marijuana is legal.",
      "The Navy, for example, began in 2022 to enlist more recruits who score very low on the Armed Services Qualification Test. That was to help meet recruiting goals. A year later it began to bring in people who didn\u2019t graduate from high school or get a GED. Both were shifts that the other services have largely avoided. The Navy argued that it needed those lower-scoring recruits to fill jobs that involve intense manual labor.",
      "Hegseth has said little about that type of standard and has focused on physical rather than mental fitness.",
      "In addition, several services have changed policies on hair and beards. They now allow different buns and ponytails for women, and beards in certain circumstances for either medical or religious reasons. And most of the services have relaxed policies on marijuana in recent years.",
      "Similarly, they have all loosened restrictions on the size and placement of tattoos, opening the door to full-sleeve tattoos. Most now allow small ones on the neck or finger.",

      "Civil rights advocates, historians and Black political leaders are sharply rebuking President Donald Trump for his order targeting the Smithsonian Institution",
      "ATLANTA -- President Donald Trump's order accusing the Smithsonian Institution of not reflecting American history notes correctly that the country's Founding Fathers declared that \u201call men are created equal.\u201d",
      "But it doesn't mention that the founders enshrined slavery into the U.S. Constitution and declared enslaved persons as three-fifths of a person for the purpose of the Census.",
      "Civil rights advocates, historians and Black political leaders sharply rebuked Trump on Friday for his order, entitled \u201cRestoring Truth and Sanity to American History.\u201d They argued that his executive order targeting the Smithsonian Institution is his administration\u2019s latest move to downplay how race, racism and Black Americans themselves have shaped the nation\u2019s story.",
      "\u201cIt seems like we\u2019re headed in the direction where there\u2019s even an attempt to deny that the institution of slavery even existed, or that Jim Crow laws and segregation and racial violence against Black communities, Black families, Black individuals even occurred,\u201d said historian Clarissa Myrick-Harris, a professor at Morehouse College, the historically Black campus in Atlanta.",
      "The Thursday executive order cites the National Museum of African American History and Culture by name and argues that the Smithsonian as a whole is engaging in a \u201cconcerted and widespread effort to rewrite our Nation\u2019s history.\u201d",
      "Instead of celebrating an \u201cunparalleled legacy of advancing liberty, individual rights, and human happiness,\u201d the order argues that a \u201ccorrosive \u2026 divisive, race-centered ideology\u201d has \u201creconstructed\u201d the nation \u201cas inherently racist, sexist, oppressive, or otherwise irredeemably flawed.\u201d",
      "It empowers Vice President JD Vance to review all properties, programs and presentations to prohibit programs that \u201cdegrade shared American values\u201d or \u201cdivide Americans based on race.\u201d",
      "Trump also ordered Interior Secretary Doug Burgum to determine if any monuments since January 2020 \u201chave been removed or changed to perpetuate a false reconstruction of American history\u201d or \u201cinappropriately minimize the value of certain historical events or figures.\u201d Trump has long criticized the removal of Confederate monuments, a movement that gained steam after the May 2020 murder of George Floyd.",
      "Critics argued the order is the latest move by the Trump administration to quash recognition of Black Americans\u2019 contributions to the nation and to gloss over the legal, political, social and economic obstacles they have faced.",
      "Trump\u2019s approach is \u201ca literal attack on Black America itself,\u201d Ibram X. Kendi, the race historian and bestselling author, said. \u201cThe Black Smithsonian, as it is affectionately called, is indeed one of the heartbeats of Black America,\u201d Kendi argued, and \u201calso one of the heartbeats\u201d of the nation at large.",
      "Congressional Black Caucus Chair Yvette Clarke, D-N.Y., suggested that Trump wants to distort the national narrative to racist ends.",
      "\u201cWe do not run from or erase our history simply because we don\u2019t like it,\u201d she said in a statement. \u201cWe embrace the history of our country \u2013 the good, the bad, and the ugly.\u201d",
      "The African American museum, one of 21 distinct Smithsonian entities, opened along the National Mall in 2016, the last year that President Barack Obama held office as the nation\u2019s first Black chief executive. The museum chronicles chattel slavery, Jim Crow segregation and its lingering effects, but also highlights the determination, successes and contributions of individual Black Americans and Black institutions throughout U.S. history.",
      "Former NAACP President Ben Jealous, who now leads the Sierra Club, said museums that focus on specific minority or marginalized groups \u2014 enslaved persons and their descendants, women, Native Americans \u2014 are necessary because historical narratives from previous generations misrepresented those individuals or overlooked them altogether.",
      "\u201cAttempts to tell the general history of the country always omit too much ... and the place that we\u2019ve come to by having these museums is so we can, in total, do a better job of telling the complete story of this country,\u201d he said.",
      "And, indeed, Trump sounded more like Jealous when he visited the African American museum in 2017, at the outset of his first term, and declared it a national gem.",
      "\u201cI\u2019m deeply proud that we now have a museum that honors the millions of African American men and women who built our national heritage, especially when it comes to faith, culture and the unbreakable American spirit,\u201d Trump said following a tour that included Sen. Tim Scott of South Carolina and then-Housing and Urban Development Secretary Ben Carson, both of whom are Black.",
      "\u201cI know President Obama was here for the museum\u2019s opening last fall,\u201d Trump continued. \u201cI\u2019m honored to be the second sitting president to visit this great museum.\u201d",
      "Trump won his comeback White House bid with a notable uptick in support from non-white voters, especially among younger Black and Hispanic men.",
      "He ratcheted up attacks during his campaign on what he labeled \u201cwoke\u201d culture and diversity, equity and inclusion initiatives, not just in government but the private sector. He also used racist and sexist tropes to attack Democratic nominee and Vice President Kamala Harris, the first Black woman and person of South Asian descent to hold national office, and regularly accused her and other liberals of \u201chating our country.\u201d",
      "Since his Jan. 20 inauguration, Trump has banned diversity initiatives across the federal government. The administration has launched investigations of colleges \u2014 public and private \u2014 that it accuses of discriminating against white and Asian students with race-conscious admissions programs intended to address historic inequities in access for Black students.",
      "The Defense Department, at one point, temporarily removed training videos recognizing the Tuskegee Airmen and an online biography of Jackie Robinson. Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth fired Joint Chiefs Gen. C.Q. Brown, a champion of racial diversity in the military who spoke about his experiences as a Black man after the murder of George Floyd.",
      "The administration has fired diversity officers across government, curtailed some agencies' celebrations of Black History Month, and terminated grants and contracts for projects ranging from planting trees in disadvantaged communities to studying achievement gaps in American schools.",
      "Civil rights advocates and historians expressed concern about a chilling effect across other institutions that study Black history.",
      "Kendi noted that many museums and educational centers across the country \u2014 such as San Francisco\u2019s Museum of the African Diaspora, The Legacy Museum: From Enslavement to Mass Incarceration in Montgomery, Alabama, and the International African American Museum in Charleston, South Carolina \u2014 exist with little to no federal or other governmental funding sources. Some already are struggling to keep their doors open.",
      "\u201cTo me, that\u2019s part of the plan, to starve these institutions that are already starving of resources so that the only institutions that are telling America\u2019s history are actually only telling political propaganda,\u201d Kendi said.",

      "An Associated Press analysis has found that South Dakota taxpayers subsidized Gov. Kristi Noem\u2019s cross-country campaigning to the tune of hundreds of thousands of dollars",
      "SIOUX FALLS, S.D. -- As then-Gov. Kristi Noem crisscrossed the country \u2014 stumping for President Donald Trump and boosting her political profile beyond her home state \u2014 she refused to reveal what her extensive travel was costing taxpayers.",
      "In the weeks since Noem became Trump\u2019s Homeland Security secretary, that mystery has been solved: South Dakota repeatedly picked up the tab for expenses related to her jet-setting campaigning.",
      "An Associated Press analysis of recently released travel records found more than $150,000 in expenses tied to Noem\u2019s political and personal activity and not South Dakota business. That included numerous trips to Palm Beach, Florida, where Trump resided before retaking office.",
      "Most of those costs covered the state-provided security that accompanied Noem, irrespective of the reason for her travel. Over her six years as governor, AP\u2019s analysis shows, South Dakota covered more than $640,000 in travel-related costs incurred by the governor\u2019s office.",
      "The expenditures include $7,555 in airfare for a six-day trip to Paris, where she gave a speech at a right-wing gathering, costs associated with a bear hunt in Canada with her niece and a book tour that included a stop in New York. An additional $2,200 stemmed from a controversial trip last year to Houston for dental work she showcased on Instagram.",
      "The expenses, released last month following a lawsuit by The Dakota Scout, have incensed Republicans in the deep-red state, with several GOP lawmakers accusing Noem of tapping state funds to fuel her own political ascendancy.",
      "The uproar comes as the Trump administration seeks to eliminate waste, fraud and abuse in government and as Noem has taken over DHS, the third-largest federal agency, with a budget and workforce many times the size of South Dakota's.",
      "The spending \u201coffends a lot of people,\u201d said Dennis Daugaard, a former Republican South Dakota governor, who added that costs generated by Noem\u2019s ambition for higher office could\u2019ve been paid with campaign funds.",
      "Taffy Howard, a GOP state senator who clashed with Noem over her refusal to disclose her travel expenses, expressed shock at the price tag. \u201cIt seems like an incredible amount of money,\u201d Howard told AP.",
      "A spokesman for Noem, Tim Murtaugh, declined to answer detailed questions about the expenses but did not dispute that some of the travel lacked an apparent connection to state business. There\u2019s no indication the former governor broke any laws having the state foot the bill for security expenses \u2014 even on trips that critics said benefited her more than South Dakota taxpayers.",
      "\u201cUnfortunately, bad guys tend to make threats against high-profile public officials,\" Murtaugh said. \u201cWhen it was a political or personal trip, she paid for her own travel out of her political or personal funds.\u201d",
      "Josie Harms, a spokesperson for Noem\u2019s gubernatorial successor, said security requirements were \u201ca matter of state business no matter where the governor may be.\"",
      "\u201cThe scope of that security is not up to the governor,\u201d Harms added.",
      "During her years in office, Noem frequently said that releasing the travel expenses would jeopardize her safety.",
      "South Dakota has relatively lax disclosure requirements for such travel expenses. Governors from both parties have used state funds to finance the travel expenses of their security details and staffers.",
      "Critics called on Washington\u2019s Jay Inslee, a Democrat, to reimburse the state for similar costs resulting from his unsuccessful 2019 presidential run. And Ron DeSantis, Florida's GOP governor, also came under fire for racking up hefty travel tabs for his security detail during his bid for higher office.",
      "Murtaugh, a spokesman for Noem in her personal capacity, questioned why Democratic governors were not being scrutinized for their travel on behalf of former Vice President Kamala Harris, their party's 2024 presidential nominee.",
      "\u201cThey maintained aggressive political schedules on behalf of Kamala Harris but somehow escape media attention for costs associated with that, while Kristi Noem is being held to a different standard?\u201d Murtaugh wrote in an email.",
      "The more than 3,000 pages of records released to the Scout by Noem's successor included hotel receipts, restaurant bills and credit card statements.",
      "The AP obtained the same records, as well as dozens of additional documents that show state officials acknowledged that \u201ccampaigning for Trump is not an official duty\u201d of the governor in denying one of several requests to release her travel expenses.",
      "The receipts are heavily redacted, so it\u2019s not always clear who incurred the expense. Only 30 items totaling $2,056.72 were charged on the governor\u2019s state-issued Mastercard, according to her attorney.",
      "Some expenses seemingly had no link to state business, such as $21 hotel-room movie purchases. It\u2019s also unclear who attended meals that included unnamed \u201cfederal officials.\u201d",
      "The state auditor questioned some of the charges, including the governor\u2019s office\u2019s use of a luxury airline travel agency for a flight to Paris and a $2,000 change fee.",
      "The state also ran up more than $3,300 in late fees and interest. The record doesn\u2019t indicate how much was paid in overtime for staff and security accompanying Noem on her political excursions.",
      "\u201cSpending for security detail, as well as where and when they are deemed necessary, falls under the discretion of the governor,\u201d Jenna Latham, a supervisor in the state auditor's office, wrote to AP in an email.",
      "Most of the expenses were incurred as Noem became a rising star in Trump\u2019s \u201cMake America Great Again\u201d universe and a contender to be his 2024 running mate. Her fortunes appeared to have suffered a blow after she revealed in a memoir that she shot and killed her farm dog, Cricket, after it scared away some game during a pheasant hunt.",
      "This is not the first time Noem\u2019s travel has come under the microscope. A state government accountability board in 2022 had requested an investigation into her use of the state plane to attend political events, but a prosecutor found no grounds for charges.",
      "The records raise questions about the necessity of the travel and the secrecy surrounding the expenses.",
      "Noem\u2019s office refused to release records related to a 2020 speaking engagement at AmpFest, a gathering of Trump supporters near Miami, telling a public-records requester the trip was \u201cnot for the purpose of the governor\u2019s official duties\u201d and no receipts existed.",
      "But the newly released records include several transactions in South Florida on those days, including a rental car and a stay at the posh Trump National Doral Miami. Days later, South Dakota picked up the tab for gasoline and hotel rooms for Noem's security so she could speak at a Republican fundraiser in New Hampshire.",
      "\u201cNoem\u2019s travel doesn\u2019t pass the smell test,\u201d said Viki Harrison, program director for Common Cause, a nonpartisan group that seeks to limit big money in politics. \u201cThere should be a huge firewall between campaigning and official business.\u201d",
      "Noem\u2019s predecessors traveled less frequently in a low-tax state that values frugality, both on the farm and from elected officials. Daugaard, whose official statue features him pinching a penny, said he reimbursed staff for purchases like ice cream.",
      "Former Gov. Mike Rounds, now South Dakota\u2019s junior U.S. senator, said he tried to keep partisan activity at \u201carm\u2019s length\u201d from state resources and was careful about what he put on the government\u2019s dime.",
      "Such thriftiness was required, he said, because his state is \u201cso tight on everything to begin with, just in terms of having enough money to pay the bills.\u201d",

      "PORTLAND, Ore. -- An Oregon judge issued a preliminary injunction Friday blocking the city at the heart of a U.S. Supreme Court ruling on homeless encampments from enforcing its camping rules unless it meets certain conditions, as part of a lawsuit filed by advocates.",
      "Under the decision by Josephine County Circuit Court Judge Sarah McGlaughlin, Grants Pass must increase capacity at city-approved sites for camping and ensure they are physically accessible to people with disabilities.",
      "Unless those conditions are met, the order bars the city from citing, arresting or fining people for camping on public property; from forcing people to leave campsites; from removing campsites that are not clearly abandoned; or from prohibiting camping in most city parks.",
      "The order still lets the city enforce rules banning sleeping on sidewalks and streets or in alleys and doorways.",
      "Mayor Clint Scherf told The Associated Press he was \u201cdisheartened\u201d by the decision, and Grants Pass information coordinator Mike Zacchino said via email that the city was \u201creviewing all aspects to ensure we make the best decision for our community.\u201d",
      "The lawsuit was filed by Disability Rights Oregon, which accused the city of discriminating against people with disabilities and violating a state law requiring cities' camping regulations to be \u201cobjectively reasonable.\u201d Plaintiffs also included five homeless people in Grants Pass.",
      "Grants Pass, a small city of about 40,000 along the Rogue River in the mountains of southern Oregon, has struggled for years to address the homelessness crisis and become emblematic of the national debate over how to deal with it.",
      "Its parks in particular became a flashpoint, with many of them becoming the site of encampments blighted by drug use and litter.",
      "Last June, in a case brought by the city, the U.S. Supreme Court ruled that communities can ban sleeping outside and fine people for doing so, even when there are not enough shelter beds.",
      "That overturned a California-based appeals court decision that held that camping bans when shelter space is lacking amounted to cruel and unusual punishment under the U.S. Constitution\u2019s Eighth Amendment.",
      "Officials from across the political spectrum filed briefs in that case saying they were hamstrung in their ability to deal with encampments.",
      "After the high court ruling, Grants Pass banned camping on all city property except locations designated by the City Council, which established two sites for the town\u2019s hundreds of homeless people in a bid to move them from the parks.",
      "Upon taking office in January, the new mayor and new council members moved to close the larger of the two sites, which housed roughly 120 tents, according to the complaint. Meanwhile the smaller one saw its hours of operation reduced to between 5 p.m. and 7 a.m., meaning people had to pack up their belongings every morning.",
      "The two sites were frequently crowded, with poor conditions and inaccessible to people with disabilities due to loose gravel, according to the complaint.",
      "\u201cIt is unconscionable to me to allow people to live there like that,\u201d City Council member Indra Nicholas said before the vote to close the larger site.",
      "After the lawsuit was filed, the city reopened a second, smaller site and extended the time people could stay to four days.",
      "McGlaughin's order says the city must increase capacity to what it was previously before the larger site was closed.",
      "Tom Stenson, deputy legal director for Disability Rights Oregon, called the ruling a victory.",
      "\u201cThis is not a radical solution. The court is basically saying, \u2018Go back to the amount of space and places for people who are homeless that you had just three months ago,\u2019\u201d he told AP.",
      "Homelessness increased 18% last year nationwide, driven mostly by a lack of affordable housing as well as devastating natural disasters and an increase in migrants in some parts.",

      "The university\u2019s trustees appointed the co-chair of their board, Claire Shipman, as acting president while the search for a permanent replacement continues.",
      "Armstrong led the university through some of the most fraught months in its long history.",
      "The move by President Donald Trump's administration to strip the university and its hospital of research funding, on the grounds that it hadn't done enough to combat antisemitism or punish students who participated in pro-Palestinian demonstrations last year, created what many considered an existential crisis.",
      "The university quickly capitulated, agreeing to a list of administration demands.",
      "Among the new changes, Columbia agreed to review its admissions policies, ban protesters from wearing masks, bar demonstrations from academic buildings and to put its Middle East studies department under the supervision of a new senior provost with a mandate to review its leadership and curriculum.",
      "The school\u2019s acquiescence was condemned by some faculty members and free speech advocates, with Donna Lieberman, the executive director of the New York Civil Liberties Union, saying it \u201cendangers academic freedom and campus expression nationwide.\u201d",
      "U.S. Education Secretary Linda McMahon said the university was \u201con the right track\u201d but has not yet indicated whether funding might be restored, leaving researchers at the school \u2014 many from the medical center \u2014 in a state of limbo.",
      "In recent weeks, the Trump administration has moved to deport several Columbia students who participated in demonstrations as it cracks down on noncitizens involved in pro-Palestinian activism on campuses.",
      "Two of those students, Mahmoud Khalil and Yunseo Chung, are lawful U.S. residents who were involved in demonstrations at the campus and are now fighting in court to stay in the country.",
      "Immigration agents arrested Khalil at his university-owned apartment, and have searched other residences on the school's campus.",
      "The new acting president, Shipman, was a correspondent for ABC News, NBC News and CNN over a long career in journalism, covering the White House and Russia, among other beats. She has written several books on women\u2019s leadership.",
      "Shipman said in a statement she is assuming the role \u201cwith a clear understanding of the serious challenges before us and a steadfast commitment to act with urgency, integrity, and work with our faculty to advance our mission, implement needed reforms, protect our students, and uphold academic freedom and open inquiry.\u201d",
      "She added that when a permanent president is chosen, that person will \u201cconduct an appropriate review of the University\u2019s leadership team and structure to ensure we are best positioned for the future.\"",
      "Whoever accepts the role permanently will have to navigate between the demands of the Trump administration and ongoing protests from students upset about the war in Gaza and emerging restrictions on free speech.",

      "The leader of a small group of self-described satanists and three other people have been arrested following a scuffle inside the Kansas Statehouse",
      "TOPEKA, Kan. -- The leader of a small group of self-described satanists and three other people were arrested Friday following a scuffle inside the Kansas Statehouse arising from an effort by the group's leader to start a Black Mass in the rotunda.",
      "About 30 members of the Kansas City-area Satanic Grotto, led by its president, Michael Stewart, rallied outside the Statehouse for the separation of church and state. The group also protested what members called the state's favoritism toward Christians in allowing events inside. Gov. Laura Kelly temporarily banned protests inside, just for Friday, weeks after Stewart's group scheduled its indoor ceremony.",
      "The Satanic Grotto's rally outside drew hundreds of Christian counterprotesters because of the Grotto's satanic imagery, and its indoor ceremony included denouncing Jesus Christ, who Christians believe is the Son of God. About 100 Christians stood against yellow police tape marking the Satanic Grotto's area. The two groups yelled at each other while the Christians also sang and called on Grotto members to accept Jesus. Several hundred more Christians rallied on the other side of the Grotto's area, but further away.",
      "Kelly issued her order earlier this month after Roman Catholic groups pushed her to ban any Satanic Grotto event. The state\u2019s Catholic Bishops called what the group planned \u201ca despicable act of anti-Catholic bigotry\u201d mocking the Catholic Mass. Both chambers of the Legislature also approved resolutions condemning it.",
      "\u201cThe Bible says Satan comes to steal, kill and destroy, so when we dedicate a state to Satan, we\u2019re dedicating it to death,\" said Jeremiah Hicks, a pastor at the Cure Church in Kansas City, Kansas.",
      "Satanic Grotto members, who number several dozen, said they hold a variety of beliefs. Some are atheists, some use the group to protest harm they suffered as church members, and others see Satan as a symbol of independence.",
      "Amy Dorsey, a friend of Stewart's, said she rallied with the Satanic Grotto to support free speech rights and religious freedoms guaranteed by the U.S. Constitution\u2019s First Amendment, in part because Christian groups are allowed to meet regularly inside the Statehouse for prayer or worship meetings.",
      "Before his arrest, Stewart said his group scheduled its Black Mass for Friday because it thought the Kansas Legislature would be in session, though lawmakers adjourned late Thursday night for their annual spring break. Stewart said the group might come back next year.",
      "\u201cMaybe un-baptisms, right here in the Capitol,\u201d he said.",
      "Video shot by KSNT-TV showed that when Stewart tried to conduct his group's ceremony in the first-floor rotunda, a young man tried to snatch Stewart's script from his hands, and Stewart punched him. Several Kansas Highway Patrol troopers wrestled Stewart to the ground and handcuffed him. They led him through hallways on the ground floor below and into a room as he yelled, \u201cHail, Satan!\u201d",
      "Stewart\u2019s wife, Maenad Bee, told reporters, \u201cHe\u2019s only exercising his First Amendment rights.\u201d",
      "Online records showed that Stewart, 42, was jailed briefly Friday afternoon on suspicion of disorderly conduct and having an unlawful assembly, then released on $1,000 bond.",
      "The Kansas Highway Patrol, which provides security at the Statehouse, said two others who entered the building with Stewart also were arrested for unlawful assembly, Jocelyn Frazee, 32, and Sean Anderson, 50. Frazee had no bond set; information for Anderson was not available online.",
      "Witnesses and friends identified the young man trying to snatch away the Black Mass script as Marcus Schroeder, who came to counterprotest with fellow members of a Kansas City-area church. Online records show Schroeder, 21, was arrested on suspicion of disorderly conduct, with his bond also set at $1,000.",
      "A friend of Schroeder's, Jonathan Storms, said he was trying to help a woman who also sought to snatch away Stewart's script and \u201cdidn't throw any punches.\u201d",
      "The woman, Karla Delgado, said she came to the Statehouse with her three youngest children to deliver a petition protesting the Black Mass to Kelly's office. Delgado said she approached Stewart because he was violating the governor's order and Highway Patrol troopers weren't immediately arresting him. She said in the ensuing confusion, her 4-year-old daughter was knocked to the ground.",
      "\u201cWhen we saw that nobody was doing anything \u2014 I guess just in the moment of it \u2014 it was like, \u2018He\u2019s not supposed to be allowed to do this,\u2019 so we tried to stop him,\" she said.",

      "MADISON, Wis. -- Billionaire Elon Musk's unprecedented efforts to bolster the conservative candidate in next week's hotly contested Wisconsin Supreme Court race ran into legal hot water Friday amid accusations that he had broken state election law.",
      "Musk announced late Thursday that he planned to hold a Sunday rally in Wisconsin, where he said he would \u201cpersonally hand over\u201d $1 million checks to two voters who had already cast their ballots \u201cin appreciation for you taking the time to vote.\u201d",
      "Wisconsin state law expressly prohibits giving anything of value in exchange for voting \u2014 drawing a slew of complaints, including from Wisconsin\u2019s Democratic attorney, who sued Friday afternoon to block Musk from handing out the checks.",
      "Amid the backlash, Musk deleted the post and later posted a revised offer.",
      "\u201cTo clarify a previous post, entrance is limited to those who have signed the petition in opposition to activist judges. I will also hand over checks for a million dollars to 2 people to be spokesmen for the petition,\u201d he wrote.",
      "Andrew Romeo, a spokesperson for Musk\u2019s political action committee, declined to comment on what had prompted the change.",
      "Musk's initial post drew a flurry of accusations just days before Tuesday's election, which will determine the ideological makeup of the highest court in the perennial presidential battleground.",
      "Attorney General Josh Kaul on Friday asked the circuit court to issue an emergency injunction to stop Musk from making the payments, calling them a \u201cblatant attempt to violate\u201d Wisconsin's anti-bribery statute.",
      "They also took issue with Musk\u2019s political action committee, America First, offering to pay $100 to any registered Wisconsin voter who signed a petition voicing opposition to \u201cactivist judges\u201d \u2014 or forwarded it to someone who did. Earlier this week, the group announced that it had awarded $1 million to a Green Bay man to serve as a \u201cspokesperson for signing our Petition In Opposition To Activist Judges.\u201d",
      "The recipient, Scott Ainsworth, has donated to Republicans and made social media posts supporting President Donald Trump and his agenda.",
      "A bipartisan coalition of government watchdog groups and former officeholders, along with a liberal Madison law firm, asked the Wisconsin attorney general and the Milwaukee County district attorney to investigate the $1 million payment and $100 signing payments.",
      "Wisconsin law makes it a felony to offer, give, lend or promise to lend or give anything of value to induce a voter to cast a ballot or not vote.",
      "Numerous legal experts argued Friday that Musk's first post promising payments to voters for voting appeared to be in clear violation of the bribery statute.",
      "\u201cYou cannot pay people to vote or not to vote,\u201d said Richard Painter, a law professor at the University of Minnesota and former White House ethics chief in the Bush administration. \u201cHis running these lotteries based on whether people vote or not, it\u2019s illegal. And he\u2019s got to cut that out.\u201d",
      "Musk\u2019s revised X post, Painter said, \u201cat least purports to comply with Wisconsin law.\u201d",
      "\u201cI guess that technically complies,\u201d he said.",
      "Others weren't so sure.",
      "Bryna Godar, staff attorney with the State Democracy Research Initiative at the University of Wisconsin Law School, said Musk changing the terms of his offer \u201cputs the payments and attendance at the rally back into a gray area under Wisconsin law.\u201d",
      "\"The question is whether the offers are 'in order to induce' people to vote or go to the polls, and there can be arguments made on either side of that question,\u201d she said in an email.",
      "She also said it is possible that Musk violated the election bribery law simply by offering the payments, even if no money is ever paid.",
      "\"Given that he already made the offer and that it was up while early voting was actively underway, there is a question of whether the initial post already violated state law, even though he has later walked it back,\" she wrote. \u201cDeleting his post and changing the terms might mitigate the circumstances, but it does not necessarily resolve the legal issue.\u201d",
      "Democratic Party of Wisconsin Chair Ben Wikler was more blunt.",
      "\u201cLet\u2019s be very clear: Elon Musk committed a crime the moment he offered million-dollar checks 'in appreciation for\u2019 voting, and deleting evidence of that crime changes nothing,\" he said in a statement. \u201cUnder Wisconsin law, merely the offer of something of value \u2014 in this case, the chance to receive one million dollars \u2014 is plainly illegal.\u201d",
      "A challenge to Musk\u2019s payments could end up before the Wisconsin Supreme Court.",
      "Musk\u2019s political action committee used nearly identical tactics to the ones he is using in Wisconsin ahead of the presidential election last year, when he spent hundreds of millions of dollars helping President Donald Trump win a second term.",
      "That included offering to pay $1 million a day to voters in Wisconsin and six other battleground states who signed a petition supporting the First and Second Amendments.",
      "Philadelphia\u2019s district attorney sued in an attempt to stop the payments under Pennsylvania law. But a judge said prosecutors failed to show the effort was an illegal lottery and allowed it to continue through Election Day.",
      "Rick Hasen, a prominent election law expert at the UCLA School of Law, noted that the legal issues raised this week echoed concerns about Musk\u2019s tactics ahead of last year\u2019s presidential election.",
      "\u201cDuring the 2024 elections, there was a question whether Elon Musk was breaking federal law in offering various incentives only to registered voters, including what was essentially a lottery open only to registered voters,\u201d he wrote. \u201cHe\u2019s up to similar gimmicks in the upcoming, very expensive Wisconsin Supreme Court race.\u201d",
      "According to a tally by the Brennan Center for Justice, America PAC and Building for America\u2019s Future, two groups that Musk funds, have spent more than $20 million trying to help elect conservative Waukesha County Judge Brad Schimel, whom Trump endorsed last week.",
      "Schimel is facing Democratic-backed Dane County Circuit Judge Susan Crawford in the race that will determine the ideological makeup of the state\u2019s highest court. Liberals currently have a 4-3 majority.",
      "Musk also has given the Wisconsin Republican Party $3 million, which can be passed along to Schimel's campaign.",
      "That outside cash has made the race the most expensive judicial election in U.S. history, by far. More than $81 million has been spent to date, obliterating the $51 million record set just two years ago, when another seat on the same court was up for grabs.",
      "The election will determine control of the court, but has also become a referendum on Trump\u2019s first weeks in office \u2014 as well as one on Musk himself.",
      "During a telephone town hall for Schimel Thursday night, Trump implored his voters to turn out in the off-year election.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s a very important race,\u201d he said. \u201cI know you feel it\u2019s local, but it\u2019s not. It\u2019s really much more than local. The whole country is watching.\u201d",
      "Musk got involved in the race just days after his electric car company, Tesla, filed a lawsuit against Wisconsin in an effort to open dealerships in the state, which could eventually end up before the justices.",
      "The Wisconsin Supreme Court is also expected to soon rule on a number of prominent national issues, including abortion rights, congressional redistricting and voting rules, which could affect the 2026 midterms and the 2028 presidential election.",
      "Jay Heck, the executive director of Common Cause Wisconsin, a good government group, said that regardless of the outcome, Musk's efforts were \u201cunprecedented\u201d in the state.",
      "\u201cIt's obscene and unprecedented. He's already put in close to $20 million,\" he said. \u201cThis election for a Supreme Court open seat in Wisconsin is going to cost, when it's all said and done, somewhere between $80 and $100 million dollars. And this is to influence less than four million eligible voters, of which only 25-30% will turn out because this is a spring, low-turnout election.\"",

    "story": [
      "A federal judge has ruled that more than 109,000 square miles of Gulf Coast federal were unlawfully opened up for offshore drilling leases",
      "NEW ORLEANS -- An expanse of Gulf Coast federal waters larger than the state of Colorado was unlawfully opened up for offshore drilling leases, according to a ruling by a federal judge, who said the Department of Interior did not adequately account for the offshore drilling leases' impacts on planet-warming greenhouse gas emissions and an endangered whale species.",
      "The future of one of the most recent offshore drilling lease sales authorized under the Biden administration is in jeopardy after District Court for the District of Columbia Judge Amit Mehta\u2019s finding on Thursday that the federal agency violated bedrock environmental regulations when it allowed bidding on 109,375 square miles (283,280 square kilometers) of Gulf Coast waters.",
      "Environmental groups, the federal government and the oil and gas industry are now discussing remedies. Earth Justice Attorney George Torgun, representing the plaintiffs, said one outcome on the table is invalidating the sale of leases worth $250 million across 2,500 square miles (6,475 square kilometers) of Gulf federal waters successfully bid on by companies.",
      "The leases in the Gulf Coast were expected to produce up to 1.1 billion barrels of oil and more than 4 trillion cubic feet (113 billion cubic meters) of natural gas over 50 years, according to a government analysis. Burning that oil would increase carbon dioxide emissions by tens of millions of tons, the analysis found.",
      "The agency \u201cfailed to take a \u2018hard look\u2019\u201d at the full extent of the carbon footprint of expanding drilling in the Gulf Coast, the judge wrote.",
      "The auction was one of three offshore oil and gas lease sales mandated as part of a 2022 climate bill compromise designed to ensure support from now-retired Sen. Joe Manchin, a leading recipient of oil and gas industry donations. Another of the mandated oil and gas lease sales, in Alaska\u2019s Cook Inlet, was overturned by a federal judge last July on similar grounds.",
      "\u201cIf federal officials are going to continue greenlighting offshore drilling, the least they can do is fully analyze its harms,\u201d said Hallie Templeton, legal director at Friends of the Earth, a nonprofit that is of the plaintiffs in the lawsuit. \u201cWe will keep fighting to put a full stop to this destructive industry, and in the meantime, we will keep a close watch on the government to ensure compliance with all applicable laws and mandates.\u201d",
      "The drilling would also threaten the Rice\u2019s whale, a species with less than 100 individuals estimated to remain and which lives exclusively in the Gulf Coast, according to court records filed by environmental advocacy groups.",
      "A Department of the Interior spokesperson said the agency could not comment on pending litigation.",
      "The process did not meet the standards of the National Environmental Policy Act, or NEPA, which requires federal agencies analyzes the environmental impacts of their actions prior to decision-making around federal lands.",
      "While Joe Biden later sought to ban offshore drilling in his last days in office, President Donald Trump's administration has pushed a \u201cdrill, baby, drill\u201d agenda expanding the fossil fuel industry, withdrawing the U.S. from the Paris climate agreement and rolling back environmental regulations \u2014 including for NEPA.",
      "The American Petroleum Institute, or API, an oil and gas trade association representing more than 600 firms and a party to the Gulf Coast case, said it is evaluating its options after this week's ruling.",
      "API spokesperson Scott Lauermann said the case is an example of activists \u201cweaponizing\u201d a permitting process, \u201cunderscoring how permitting reform is essential to ensuring access to affordable, reliable energy.\u201d",

      "WATERBURY, Conn. -- A Connecticut man who told authorities was held captive in his own home for two decades since he was still a boy has asked why his stepmother is not behind bars after being charged with cruelty to persons and other crimes, a state prosecutor said Friday.",
      "Don Therkildsen Jr., a supervisory assistant state's attorney, made the remark during a court hearing in Waterbury for Kimberly Sullivan, who pleaded not guilty Friday to charges that also included kidnapping and felony assault. Sullivan was ordered to be placed on electronic monitoring, and Therkildsen also asked for house arrest over concerns she could flee.",
      "\u201cThis victim is afraid. This victim lives in fear,\u201d Therkildsen said in court. \u201cI introduced myself to the victim, explained who I was. His first question in this fear is, \u2018Why is she out walking around when I was locked up in a room for 20 years?\u2019\u201d",
      "Sullivan, 57, posted $300,000 bail after she was arrested March 12. She has denied allegations that she kept her stepson locked in a small room in their Waterbury home and limited his food and liquids so much that he weighed only 69 pounds (31 kilograms) when he was rescued. He is 5-feet-9-inches tall (1.75 meters tall).",
      "Sullivan's lawyer, Ioannis Kaloidis, objected to the house arrest request and said Sullivan has complied with all conditions since she posted bail. He also said threats have been made against Sullivan and confining her to house arrest at one location would put her in danger.",
      "The 32-year-old man set a fire in the house on Feb. 17 in an effort to be free, police said. He was rescued by firefighters and taken to a hospital, where staff said he was emaciated from malnutrition.",
      "He told police that he was locked in the small room with no heat or air conditioning for most of every day since he was about 11 years old, allowed out only briefly to do chores. His father, Kregg Sullivan, let him out of the room for longer periods, but he died last year, police said.",
      "He said he was hungry all the time. He was unenrolled from Waterbury\u2019s public school system in 2004 after educators contacted state child welfare officials with concerns about his well-being, police said. He apparently was going to be home-schooled.",
      "State and local authorities have been looking into how this could have happened, and some are calling for stricter oversight of home-schooling.",
      "Waterbury police have said they visited Sullivan's home twice in 2005 and there were nothing to warrant concern.",
      "A former principal at the elementary school the man attended as a child, Tom Pannone, told WVIT-TV that school officials repeatedly called Sullivan and the state Department of Children and Families, or DCF, over concerns that he was too thin and was stealing food and eating things out of the garbage.",
      "Police said DCF workers visited the home, but it's not clear what the agency did. The man told police that Sullivan made him tell authorities everything was OK under the threat of his food being reduced.",
      "DCF previously said it could not immediately find any records involving the family. On Friday the agency announced that it found some records in its archives and was reviewing them.",
      "Officials did not immediately share details of the records and said they would be providing them to police and state investigators after completing a search and review.",

      "A judge challenging the outcome of his North Carolina Supreme Court race was photographed wearing Confederate military garb and posing before a Confederate battle flag when he was a member of a college fraternity that glorified the pre-Civil War South",
      "WASHINGTON -- A judge challenging the outcome of his North Carolina Supreme Court race was photographed wearing Confederate military garb and posing before a Confederate battle flag when he was a member of a college fraternity that glorified the pre-Civil War South.",
      "The emergence of the photographs comes at a delicate time for Jefferson Griffin, a Republican appellate judge who is seeking a spot on North Carolina's highest court. Griffin, 44, is facing mounting criticism \u2013 including from some Republicans \u2013 as he seeks to invalidate over 60,000 votes cast in last November\u2019s election, a still undecided contest in which he is trailing the Democratic incumbent by over 700 votes.",
      "The photographs, which were obtained by The Associated Press, are from when Griffin was a student at the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill from 1999-2003 and a member of the Kappa Alpha Order, one of the oldest and largest fraternities in the U.S., with tens of thousands of alumni.",
      "Griffin said he regretted donning the Confederate uniform, which was customary during the fraternity's annual \u201cOld South\u201d ball.",
      "\u201cI attended a college fraternity event that, in hindsight, was inappropriate and does not reflect the person I am today,\u201d Griffin said in a statement. \u201cAt that time, like many college students, I did not fully grasp such participation\u2019s broader historical and social implications. Since then, I have grown, learned, and dedicated myself to values that promote unity, inclusivity, and respect for all people.\u201d",
      "One of the pictures, taken during the 2001 ball, shows Griffin and roughly two-dozen other fraternity members clad in Confederate uniforms. Another photograph from the spring of 2000 shows Griffin and other Kappa Alpha brothers in front of a large Confederate flag. He served in 2002 as his chapter\u2019s president.",
      "Kappa Alpha has proven to be a lightning rod for controversy over the decades, often due to the racist or insensitive actions of some of its members. A number of politicians have been forced to apologize for having worn Confederate costumes at the fraternity's functions or for being photographed in front of a Confederate flag.",
      "Jesse Lyons, a spokesman for the fraternity's national office in Lexington, Virginia, said use of the rebel battle flag was prohibited in 2001 and displaying other Confederate symbols had been discouraged years before. The fraternity banned the wearing of the Confederate uniforms in 2010. It's unclear if the chapter at UNC banned the uniforms before the national organization did.",
      "\u201cWe believe in cultural humility, we respect the best parts of our organization\u2019s history, and through education we challenge our members to work for a better future. These things are not mutually exclusive,\u201d Lyons said.",
      "The fraternity claims Robert E. Lee as its \u201cspiritual founder\u201d and long championed the Southern \u201cLost Cause,\" a revisionist view of history that romanticizes the Confederacy and portrays the Civil War as a valiant struggle for \u201cstates\u2019 rights\u201d unrelated to the enslavement of Black people. In decades past, some Kappa Alpha chapters referred to themselves as a \u201cklan,\u201d a term that many viewed as an unsubtle wink to the Ku Klux Klan.",
      "The photographs featuring Griffin were taken at a time when many other Kappa Alpha chapters were reevaluating their celebration of the Confederacy.",
      "During Griffin\u2019s time in the fraternity, some in his chapter questioned the appropriateness of dressing up in Confederate uniforms for the ball. Griffin opposed abandoning the tradition, according to a person familiar with the situation, who spoke on the condition of anonymity out of fear of reprisal. The uniforms stayed.",
      "Griffin said he would \u201cnot respond to unsubstantiated comments based on memories of 20-plus years past.\u201d",
      "In high school Griffin also expressed an affinity for Robert E. Lee, the Confederate general who led southern forces during the Civil War. In a 1998 feature on high school \u201cscholars of the week\u201d in the Raleigh News & Observer newspaper, Griffin said Lee was his No. 1 choice to include on an \u201cideal guest list\u201d for a party.",
      "The Kappa Alpha Order was founded in 1865, not long after Lee surrendered to the Union Army, at a Virginia college where Lee served as president. At least one of the first members was a former rebel soldier who had served under Lee, who is revered by the fraternity as the ideal of gentlemanly Southern chivalry.",
      "For more than a century, Kappa Alpha threw \u201cOld South\u201d parties. They were formal affairs where the Confederate battle flag was flown and fraternity brothers dressed in replica Confederate gray uniforms and their dates wore antebellum-style hoop skirts. Sometimes they would ride through campus on horseback.",
      "Some Kappa Alpha chapters, particularly in the South, clung to their traditions, including the wearing of blackface, even as they drew protests and public sentiment shifted.",

      "A case to determine whether millions of motorists are in line for compensation will be heard by the UK's most senior judges this week.",
      "A Court of Appeal judgement last year sent shockwaves through the car finance sector, when it ruled that hidden commission payments to dealers were unlawful.",
      "Companies claim they did nothing wrong, and said they await much-needed clarity from the Supreme Court judges.",
      "Lenders, including major banks, have set aside huge sums of money as millions of people who bought new and used cars on finance could potentially make a claim for hundreds of pounds.",
      "When Marcus Johnson bought a car, a dealer received \u00a31,650 - a quarter of the amount the 34-year-old, from Cwmbran, Torfaen borrowed in total.",
      "Mr Johnson said that when he bought a blue Suzuki Swift in 2017 he simply didn't know that the commission was paid, although the lender said he signed a document.",
      "\"I bought it as a little run-around, to get back and forth from work and to take my family out at the weekends,\" he said.",
      "\"I had no idea that commission even existed as part of the industry.\"",
      "His, along with two others, were test cases that led to a ruling at the Court of Appeal in which three judges unanimously agreed that it would be illegal for the lender to pay any commission to the dealer without the informed consent of the buyer.",
      "In other words, customers should be told clearly how much commission would be paid - and agree to it - without those details being buried in the terms and conditions of the loan.",
      "'One unholy mess'",
      "The car finance sector is the second biggest lender to consumers in the UK, with people only borrowing more in mortgages.",

      "Car loan scandal payout fears as row drags on",
      "Those payments were central to the Court of Appeal ruling. The Financial Conduct Authority (FCA), the City regulator, said dealers and motor finance providers have been receiving a deluge of complaints.",
      "It is urging people to make a claim, if they feel they were the victims of mis-selling.",
      "Under the FCA's plans, providers will have until December to consider and respond to complaints - but those cases will be hugely dependant on the judgement of the Supreme Court judges.",
      "The final ruling, following three days of evidence from Tuesday, is expected during the summer.",
      "In February, the Supreme Court rejected an unusual intervention from the government, which was worried huge amounts of redress payments could upset the car market and make it less competitive, as well as making the UK less attractive to investors.",
      "The car finance sector insists it complied with the law as it was understood, and as regulation required.",
      "Adrian Dally, from the Finance and Leasing Association, the trade body for the sector, said: \"We hope that the Supreme Court settles the issue once and for all, confirms that the industry did nothing wrong historically, and clarifies what the rules are permanently for the future.\"",
      "Dame Meg Hillier, who chairs the influential Treasury Committee of MPs, described the situation as \"one unholy mess\" because dealers and lenders may not have been transparent to their customers.",
      "Compensation",
      "Even if the judges agree with the appeal from car finance providers, lenders are still facing a hefty compensation bill.",
      "That is because the FCA has already banned discretionary commission arrangements (DCAs), when the higher the interest rate on the loan, the higher the commission that was paid to dealers.",
      "It said this provided an incentive for a buyer to be charged a rate that was higher than necessary.",
      "It is considering setting up a compensation scheme for drivers who had these deals before the ban in 2021, although some drivers are going through the courts for redress.",
      "Alex Neill, co-founder of Consumer Voice, which advises people on compensation, said the Supreme Court could agree with the Court of Appeal in saying all \"secret\" commission payments were unlawful.",
      "\"That would be huge and would be on the scale of PPI, with compensation payments running into the tens of billions of pounds,\" she said.",
      "If not, then it still meant there could be compensation for 40% of car loan agreements with discretionary agreements.",
      "\"That is still going to be worth billions of pounds in compensation and over \u00a31,000 per individual,\" she said."

      "Ferrari, which ships its cars from Italy, immediately announced a 10% price hike, to help cover the new cost of the duty.",
      "As companies are forced to respond to the 25% tariffs, by raising prices or accepting lower profits, some may decide to pull some models out of the US entirely, leading to fewer choices for American consumers, warned Patrick Anderson, chief executive of the Anderson Economic Group.",
      "This could also lead to carmakers without a current large manufacturing presence in the US, such as Jaguar Land Rover or Porsche, reducing production in their home countries, potentially affecting jobs.",
      "All Mitsubishi cars sold in the US are imported, while Hyundai, which announced plans for a plant in the US earlier this week, ships most of its cars from South Korea.",

      "Unlike centralized systems, where social media companies have complete control over content and identities, Bluesky users can choose how their feeds are moderated, and what kind of posts the algorithm recommends to them, thanks to the hundreds of options offered by both Bluesky and the community.",

      "The law states that the value of a network goes up with the square of the number of users. That means that bigger social networks have way more resources than smaller ones. They can use those resources to get bigger and bigger and crowd out smaller social media services.",
      "Non-profits like Free Our Feeds and the Social Web Foundation, which Mr Prodromou heads, have a strategy that they hope will help them overcome that Metcalfe's Law.",
      "They hope to replace the current situation, where users of social media hop between their favourite services.",

      "Using this kind of interoperability, Mr Prodromou hopes that services like Social Web Foundation will provide the same value as giant, monolithic platforms.",
      "It's not straightforward, as not all social media firms support the same protocol, for example, BlueSky uses the AT Protocol.",

      "Instead it informs you when you're going to be in the same place (city or event) as someone you know and encourages you to connect with people more often in person.",
      "\"Until Mozi, no combination of apps could tell me what city my friends are in at any given time, or even what my friends locally are up to,\" says Mozi co-founder, Molly DeWolf Swenson.",

      "On the face of it, that sounds like a good thing. So why are people saying that she may struggle to meet them and the only way she may do so is by raising taxes?",
      "It's a complicated picture, but there are essentially five steps to get from where we are now to tax rises.",
      "Not much spare money",
      "Ahead of the Spring Statement, the chancellor had been under pressure, with speculation over how she would be able to meet her self-imposed financial rules, one of which is to not borrow to fund day-to-day spending.",
      "In October, the government's official economic forecaster, the Office for Budget Responsibility (OBR), said that Reeves would be able to meet that rule with \u00a39.9bn to spare.",
      "An increase in government borrowing costs since then meant that that room to spare had disappeared. Now big welfare cuts and spending reductions in the Spring Statement have restored it.",

      "\"It is a tiny fraction of the risks to the outlook,\" Richard Hughes from the OBR told the BBC.",

      "Predicting the future is difficult",
      "Which brings us on to the precarious nature of making economic forecasts.",
      "\"All forecasts turn out to be wrong. Weather forecasts also turn out to be wrong,\" says Mr Hughes.",
      "Predicting what will happen in the future, especially in five years' time is hard, and is subject to revisions. You could be forgiven for not predicting a war or a pandemic, for instance.",
      "The respected think tank, the Institute for Fiscal Studies (IFS), has already said there is \"a good chance that economic and fiscal forecasts will deteriorate significantly between now and an Autumn Budget\".",

      "Car tariffs a sign worse could come",
      "Reeves admitted the car tariffs would be \"bad for the UK\" but insisted the government was in \"extensive\" talks to avoid them being imposed here.",
      "According to the OBR, these import taxes would have a direct impact on goods totalling around 0.2% of GDP.",
      "Before Trump's announcement, the OBR had warned of the risk of an escalating trade war, and while the proposals do not exactly match the watchdog's worst-case scenario, which would see the UK retaliate, Hughes said it had elements of it.",

      "The war in Ukraine continues, despite Trump's pledge to end it.",
      "The UK, along with Germany, has said it will increase defence spending. Trump has long called for European members of Nato to spend more on defence, and there are also fears that if the US does make a deal with Russia to end the war, that could leave Europe vulnerable.",
      "Domestically, businesses are also facing a worrying time as they brace for a rise in costs in April as employers' National Insurance contributions, the National Living wage and business rates are all set to go up.",

      "Break the rules or raise taxes",

      "Reeves has staked her reputation on meeting her fiscal rules, pledging to bring \"iron discipline\" and provide stability and reassurance to financial markets, in contrast to former Prime Minister Liz Truss, whose unfunded tax cuts spooked the markets and raised interest rates.",
      "So if she is still to meet her rules and not borrow to fund day-to-day spending, that would mean either more spending cuts or tax rises.",

      "But as Paul Dale, chief UK economist at Capital Economics, puts it: \"Non-defence spending can only be cut so far.\"",

      "Almost half the population, 32.4 million people, has now signed up to apps like Spotify and Apple Music, according to music industry analysts MIDiA Research.",
      "That's vastly more than the 20 million who pay for video streaming, but the number of new subscribers is tailing off. About 1.25 million new customers took out a plan last year, said MIDiA, representing growth of 4%. In 2020, that figure was 9%.",
      "MIDiA says the slowdown will lead to higher prices. \"If you're not growing users, what do you do? You get them to pay more,\" said the company's managing director, Mark Mulligan.",
      "Spotify has already bumped up the price of its premium plan in the UK. After years of being held at \u00a39.99, it increased to \u00a310.99 in summer 2024, and \u00a311.99 last May.",

      "\"We've really tried with mid-price tiers and, frankly, struggled to get them to work,\" he said.",

      "\"Finding something in the middle that you can actually explain to consumers and that is different than what's already on offer has been really, really challenging,\" he explained.",
      "Outside of the UK,  MIDiA's latest report showed that the number of people subscribing to music streaming services grew by 11.6% year-on-year.",
      "Most of the growth came from emerging markets in Africa and India. China also extended its lead as the world's biggest streaming market, with 190 million subscribers.",
      "Mulligan predicted that the growth of streaming services outside Europe and America could change the way we listen to music.",
      "\"We'll see a cultural shift where these massive installed bases of streaming users in the global south will shape listening habits in the west.",
      "\"As they become bigger markets, more people [in those countries] will want to become artists, and more people will want to set up record labels.",
      "\"So more music will be made, more music will be exported, and there'll be a sort of cultural rebalancing.\"",

      "Genres like Afrobeats and Amapiano are already hugely popular and, last year, Nigerian star Burna Boy became the first African artist to headline a stadium show in the UK.",
      "South Korea is also a powerhouse - accounting for 45% of all physical albums sold in the last year - while Latin America boasts some of the world's biggest recording artists, including Bad Bunny, Karol G and Peso Pluma.",
      "As a result, the UK's historic musical dominance is waning.",
      "Last year, British musicians failed to appear in the Top 10 of the world's bestselling singles or albums, for the first time in two decades.",
      "\"In basic terms, the democratisation of music that we've seen, thanks to streaming, is wonderful - but it's a very crowded space,\" Victoria Oakley, head of the IFPI, told BBC News.",

      "The story of this Spring Statement is that welfare has been cut back to make up for a notable rise in the cost of servicing the national debt. There is also a trim to the money being given to government departments.",
      "There is relatively little else actually happening in policy terms. There were no tax rises, no changes to Chancellor Rachel Reeves' borrowing rules and as expected, this was definitely not a Budget.",
      "The real question now is whether the chancellor can escape from a never-ending cycle of microhaggling with the government's independent forecaster the Office for Budget Responsibility (OBR) in this way, twice a year for the rest of the Parliament.",
      "When asked about whether new tax rises could now come in the Autumn like last year, she said emphatically: \"We'll never have to do a Budget like that again.\"",

      "Other uncertainties include higher interest rates and lower UK productivity, he said, adding that \"the risks are very elevated\".",
      "That is why growth, confidence, and comprehensive economic strategy is so important.",
      "By June there should be new plans for trade, industry and infrastructure. In the next few weeks, there could be an economic deal with the US, and the start of a Brexit reset with the EU.",

      "It's a policy that doesn't involve taxes or spending yet is expected to provide a huge boost to growth.",
      "At this stage this is not about an extra brick being laid or even planning approval, but it is a \"spreadsheet win\" that eased the chancellor's fiscal pain.",
      "This comes as a result of local authority housing targets and council land being freed up.",

      "But the test is obviously actual spades and diggers in the ground and architects' plans being approved. This government is now all-in on Bob the Builder.",
      "There was some accountancy-driven cunning. Lists of public defence-related spending up and down the UK came from the unconstrained capital budget for buildings, which is basically exempt from the chancellor's non-negotiable financial rule to only borrow to fund day to day spending.",
      "But the cuts to welfare are very real. The 250,000 increase in people in poverty due to the cuts to health-related benefits does not include the impact of recipients getting new jobs.",
      "The Impact Assessment seems to confirm that the aim of the policy is more about saving cash than fundamental reform.",
      "In this and in other areas questions arise about whether the \"OBR tail wags the policy dog\" - i.e. is this really the way long-term policy should be formed?",
      "The big picture is that all of this becomes a lot easier if growth returns and interest costs calm.",
      "In the dreams of Number 11, while we assume the debate in autumn will be about what further tax rises are required, it is possible that by the time of October's Budget, they may not be needed."

      "Remember, these are only forecasts. They may be wrong and are subject to change.",
      "There's likely to be more speculation about the future of tax-free allowances in Individual Savings Accounts (Isas). The government says it is \"looking at options for reforms\" to encourage investing money.",

    "story": [
      "Housebuilding is forecast to hit a 40-year high, with reforms to the planning system expected to boost the economy by \u00a36.8bn, according to the independent spending watchdog.",
      "The Office for Budget Responsibility (OBR) said changes including mandatory housing targets for councils and making it easier to build on green belt land could result in 1.3 million new homes across the UK by the end of the decade.",
      "The government said further planned reforms and investment in affordable housing would help to meet its target of 1.5 million new homes in England over the next five years.",
      "But the OBR warned its estimates were uncertain as factors such as the number of construction workers could hinder progress.",
      "Industry leaders have said tens of thousands of new recruits will be needed to deliver the government's target, with the sector facing a skills shortage and ageing workforce.",
      "Earlier this week, the government announced \u00a3600m of funding to train up to 60,000 more skilled construction workers.",
      "The OBR said local opposition could also delay or prevent new homes.",
      "Critics have argued the reforms could disregard local concerns, while some councils have warned higher housing targets will be almost impossible to achieve, pointing to strains on local infrastructure and land shortages.",
      "The Home Builders Federation said planning changes were \"a very positive step\" but the OBR figures showed further \"urgent\" measures to help homebuyers were needed to meet the government's target.",
      "Chief executive Neil Jefferson said the cost of building new homes had also \"rocketed\" in recent years, with new taxes and regulatory fees further supressing investment.",
      "The government has made boosting the number of new homes a key priority, promising to back the \"builders not blockers\".",

      "Everything you need to know about the Spring Statement",
      "Three ways the changes could affect you and your money",
      "There had been a question mark over whether the OBR would factor the government's planning reforms into its forecasts for economic growth.",
      "However, in her Spring Statement, Chancellor Rachel Reeves confirmed the watchdog had considered and scored changes to the National Planning Policy Framework published in December.",
      "The OBR said the reforms could boost housebuilding by 170,000 over the next five years, resulting in 1.3 million new homes across the UK by 2029/30, a 16% increase.",
      "It added that the number of new homes annually was projected to reach a 40-year high of 305,000.",
      "The watchdog estimated the boost to housebuilding as a result of the reforms would increase the size of the UK economy by 0.2% by 2029/30, worth around \u00a36.8bn in today's prices.",
      "The government said this was the biggest positive effect on growth from a  \"zero-cost policy\" the OBR had ever forecast.",
      "The boost to economic growth is driven by factors including higher productivity in the construction sector, more people paying rent and making it easier for people to move for work.",
      "The OBR said the increase in supply would lead to a small reduction in average house prices of around 0.9% by 2029/30.",
      "Experts said while the boost from planning reforms was welcome there needed to be more focus on first-time buyers who are struggling to get on the housing ladder.",
      "Felicity Barnett, from the Mortgage Advice Bureau, said many prospective homeowners were \"trapped by strict affordability criteria\" and needed more accessible options.",
      "Aynsley Lammin, an analyst at Investec, said a good economic backdrop, favourable interest rates and policies to help first-time buyers were needed to boost demand.",
      "He added that the government would also need to invest in affordable homes.",
      "Under the government's new planning framework previously developed land - known as \"brownfield\" sites - will be prioritised for new homes.",
      "But ministers have acknowledged this will not be enough to meet the government's target.",
      "Councils will also be ordered to review green belt boundaries - which were created to prevent urban sprawl - by identifying lower-quality \"grey belt\" land that can be built on.",
      "Building will be allowed on higher quality green belt land if developers provide the necessary infrastructure and guarantee affordable housing, as well as access to green spaces.",

    "story": [
      "UK inflation fell by more than expected in February, driven by a drop in clothing and shoe prices due to an unusually high number of sales.",
      "Inflation decreased to 2.8%, down from a rate of 3% in January, according to the Office for National Statistics (ONS).",
      "The latest figures come ahead of Chancellor Rachel Reeves' Spring Statement, where she will set out her economic plans.",
      "Grant Fitzner, chief economist at the ONS, said women's clothing \"was the biggest driver for this month's fall\".",
      "\"This was only partially offset by small increases, for example, from alcoholic drinks\", he added.",
      "Overall prices for clothing and footwear fell in the year to February for the first time since 2021, with children's clothing and accessories such as hats and scarves also having an impact.",
      "The ONS said another factor was an unseasonably high number of clothing sales. Discounting usually drops off in February as January sales end and spring ranges enter the shops, but that did not happen this year.",
      "Economists polled by Reuters had expected that inflation - which measures the rate at which prices rise  - would dip to 2.9% in February. However, despite the bigger than expected fall, the figure is still above the Bank of England's target of 2%.",
      "The rate of price rises is also expected to increase in the months ahead, with council tax and energy and water bills all set to rise in April.",
      "In addition, a recent survey from the ONS found that almost a half of businesses are considering price rises as they brace for next month's tax rises and increase in the National Living Wage.",
      "Susannah Streeter, head of money and markets at Hargreaves Lansdown, said the Bank of England was unlikely to cut rates at its next meeting because February's fall was \"not an enormous change\" and inflation \"is still significantly above target\",",
      "\"Although policymakers won't want to keep rates too high for too long given the stagnation in the economy, they are set to stay cautious with a rate cut looking more likely to come in June and another later in the year\", she said.",
      "'Stagflation' fears",
      "Reeves will address Parliament with her Spring Statement in Parliament on Wednesday afternoon, with further cuts to welfare spending expected.",
      "She is also expected to confirm a downgrade to official economic growth predictions.",
      "Some economists have raised concerns about the possibility of 'stagflation', where prices rise faster than the central bank's target but the economy fails to grow.",
      "\"Economic growth is miniscule and risks going backwards, but should inflation continue to refuse to get back near the 2% target, it is difficult to see what the Bank of England can do with interest rates,\" said Lindsay James from wealth manager Quilter.",
      "Chief Secretary to the Treasury Darren Jones said the government's \"number one mission is kickstarting growth\" and pledged to go \"further and faster on growth through our plan for change\".",
      "Shadow chancellor Mel Stride said the Conservatives left government in July \"with inflation bang on target\" and urged Reeves take \"urgent action\" in her Spring Statement or \"working families will continue to pay the price\".",
      "The Liberal Democrats said the inflation figure \"will be of no comfort to the millions of families across the country who are struggling\"."

      "The Lower Thames Crossing will become the largest road tunnel in the UK and is described by National Highways as \"the most significant road project in a generation\". But what about the people whose lives it will disrupt?",
      "Surrounded by rolling fields and a close-knit network of neighbours, Jackie Thacker's home in Orsett, Essex, provided the serene location she dreamt of enjoying retirement in.",
      "Yet one by one, those neighbours have packed their bags and left, never to return to the homes they once loved.",
      "The 75-year-old now faces a stark choice: sell up or live next to a major road.",
      "The government is pressing ahead with plans for the Lower Thames Crossing, a 14.5-mile (23km) road linking Essex and Kent via two tunnels underneath the river.",
      "It is due to be built by 2032 at a cost of up to \u00a310bn.",
      "But for those living on the route, confirmed by the government on Tuesday, that ambition holds less attraction.",
      "\"It's been like a noose around our neck, ever since the route was chosen,\" says Ms Thacker, who has lived in her house for 38 years.",
      "Ms Thacker, a grandmother, has spent most of the past four decades enjoying village life: walking to the pub, playing petanque and visiting the local cricket club.",
      "She becomes tearful while explaining how everything she loves about her life could soon be flattened, sold off or turned into a building site.",
      "\"Ever since we've been here, we've had wonderful neighbours,\" Ms Thacker says.",
      "\"But now the ones we've known for a long time have had to move out due to the pressures brought on by knowing the road was going through.",
      "\"It scared the life out of them, so they've moved on now.\"",
      "It is not the happy end she envisaged for her twilight years.",
      "\"It's breaking my heart,\" she admits. \"I'm stressed beyond belief.",
      "\"I could see myself being here until life's end and having a peaceful life's end, but it's not going to be peaceful anymore.\"",
      "For more than 60 years, the Dartford Crossing has been the only Thames road crossing east of London.",
      "Yet it is now used by more traffic than it was ever designed for, instead creating a bottleneck that frequently blocks up the M25.",
      "By providing an alternative route, linking the A2 and M2 in Kent with the A13 and M25 in Thurrock, it is hoped the Lower Thames Crossing will cut traffic there by 20%.",
      "About 2.6 miles (4.2km) of the route will be underground, with northbound and southbound tunnels running next to each other beneath the Thames.",
      "They are expected to be dug east of Gravesend in Kent and to the west of East Tilbury in Essex.",
      "But National Highways has been accused of hoovering up everything in its wake to clear the path for the new road.",
      "So far, it has spent more than \u00a31.2bn in planning and land costs.",
      "The authority says 76 residential properties are on land it needs for the route, 58 of which have already been purchased through a voluntary scheme.",
      "A total of 35 will be demolished, with the rest affected by construction. It insists each purchase has been \"robustly scrutinised\".",

      "\"The whole thing is a complete mess from start to finish,\" he sighs.",
      "The 76-year-old was in the middle of building a property for his son in the garden when he got a knock on the door.",
      "\"They said 'Don't carry on building it - we're going to knock your house down,'\" he explains.",
      "What is the Lower Thames Crossing project?",
      "That was in 2018. Five years later, Mr Rouse took another call.",
      "He was told his house was no longer needed.",
      "But Mr Rouse had already accepted a \u00a31.2m deal from National Highways, of which \u00a31m has landed in his bank account.",
      "He has now been given an ultimatum: keep the money and leave his home by November, or buy the property back from National Highways and stay.",
      "\"They should've thought of this. They've jumped in too early and bought properties they don't need,\" Mr Rouse says.",
      "\"But if this new road is going to go across the top of my house, we don't want to be here. It's upsetting for the whole family.",
      "\"I've sat in this mess for seven years now. Who makes that seven years up?\"",
      "Concerns have also been raised by campaigners, who fear ancient woodland will be destroyed when works begin in 2026.",
      "For Tony and Leigh Hughes, who have lived in South Ockendon for 34 years, the potential damage to wildlife has only worsened their grief.",
      "National Highways has promised that 80% of the crossing will run through either a tunnel, cutting or embankment to blend it into the landscape.",
      "It also wants to make seven \"green bridges\" to provide safer crossing points for people and wildlife.",
      "One of those bridges falls 75m (250ft) from Mr and Mrs Hughes's home.",
      "Mrs Hughes fears both residents and wildlife will be disrupted while it is constructed.",
      "\"There will be times where the traffic is 24/7. We will not be able to get to our property and the road will be closed at weekends,\" she says.",
      "\"It's very, very sketchy on what our life is going to be like.",
      "\"It will affect people coming to our house. Who would want to visit us? It's a horrible, daunting thought that I could go out shopping and not be able to get home.\"",
      "The couple have been offered a deal for their house, but they believe it is 20% under its market value.",
      "They says they feel trapped as their property is no longer an attractive proposition for any buyer.",
      "Mrs Hughes continues: \"It is a very inhumane situation to be in as we can't sell, other than to National Highways at a knocked-down price.\"",
      "Her husband, 56, adds: \"It's beautiful here and we never intended on leaving.",
      "\"Even though we own our property, we have no control over the situation at all.",
      "\"We have to find a cash buyer that's willing to buy a lovely cottage next to a motorway and I'm sorry, but those buyers are very, very few and far between.\"",
      "In a statement to the BBC, National Highways insists its landmark project will \"improve journeys and bring significant benefits\" to the region.",
      "However, a spokesman admits there will be an impact on properties along the route.",
      "\"Through a comprehensive programme of consultation we have been able to significantly reduce the number affected by almost 70%, and reached voluntary agreements with many,\" he says.",
      "\"Following confirmation of our planning consent this week we will be speaking again to impacted property owners about next steps.\"",
      "But what is next for those set to have their lives uprooted?",
      "\"We don't know where we'll be in five years,\" says Mr Hughes. \"I do know this area won't be as beautiful as it is now.\"",
      "A tearful Ms Thacker adds: \"I just can't visualise moving. I love the place so much and I think moving would be too stressful.\"",

    "summary": "Shares in technology firms have both fallen and risen sharply over the past year.",
    "story": [
      "We have all heard of carmaker Ford, but what about its one-time rivals Abbot-Detroit, Acme, Adams and Aerocar?",
      "No? Well that is hardly surprising because unlike Ford they all went bust very early on. And they are just some of the failed car companies starting with the letter \"A\".",
      "We only remember the winners who went on to dominate the world's motor industry, and the current high-tech sector is much the same.",
      "A great many investors backed the wrong horseless carriages around a century ago and lost their money. Only a few picked Ford or Chrysler, which is almost exactly what is happening now, only to the tech sector.",
      "Tech shares have been hugely volatile over the past year, as has been widely reported, with share price graphs often looking like rollercoaster rides, even before President Trump's tariffs have caused wider stocks falls.",
      "Nvidia shares sink as Chinese AI app spooks markets",
      "Tesla's challenges run deeper than 'toxic' controversy around Elon Musk",
      "US tech firms feel pinch from China tariffs",
      "A principle reason for this tech sector volatility, according to Elroy Dimson, professor of finance at the University of Cambridge, is that like the once nascent car industry we don't know which tech firms will win in the long run.",
      "\"If you go back to the beginning of the last century there were an awful lot of motor companies, and it was clear that automobiles were going to make a huge difference,\" says Prof Dimson. \"But almost every company went bankrupt, you didn't know which company you should be buying.\"",
      "Then, of course, not all high-tech businesses are making money. The measure of the return on an investment in shares uses two factors, the growth in profits or dividends, and the growth in the value of the shares.",
      "Boring companies might pay reliable dividends and see their shares gradually increase in value. But many high-tech companies are not paying out much if anything in dividends. Instead, they are investing in future growth, and so their share prices fluctuate based on hopes of future profits.",
      "As Susannah Streeter, head of money and markets at UK financial services firm Hargreaves Lansdown, puts it: \"Tech shares are more volatile, they have high valuations and their price-earnings ratios are very high, and growth stocks are more sensitive to interest rate movements.\"",
      "But also, investors in such shares are, as Ms Streeter puts it, gambling on \"not jam today but jam tomorrow\". They are all trying to pick the next future big winner, not the one paying out profits now, but the one that will eventually pay huge dividends sometime in the future.",
      "So, any news or even suggestion that future growth is not going to be as good as previously expected means share values can collapse.",
      "On the other hand, any good news boosts share prices even if current profits, or even losses, don't change at all, as investors pile into what they think is the future winner. The shares are more volatile because they are not underwritten by current profits or dividends.",
      "That means as Prof Dimson puts it, \"that small changes in growth expectation can lead to large changes in share value\", which can effect a large number of companies at the same time.",
      "\"You have companies that are reasonably similar, so when growth rates change it is effecting quite a few companies in a similar way,\" he says.",
      "\"This is not different from the dotcom boom at the beginning of the 2000s. There were companies with huge growth prospects. And when the growth prospects disappeared, these were the companies that disappeared.\"",
      "Also, even today there are not that many really large high-tech companies. In America they are colloquially known as the \"magnificent seven\" - Nvidia, a chipmaker, Alphabet, which owns Google, Amazon, Apple, Microsoft, Meta, the parent of Facebook, and Tesla.",
      "So, it does not take much to spook the market, especially since several of these firms are really quite young, and are dominant in sectors where previous leaders have crashed and burned. Anyone remember Ericsson, Boo or Compaq?",
      "Technology, unlike say steel production or food manufacturing, is changing at a very rapid rate, and there is obviously the chance that a new high-tech company will come along and destroy the business model of its most established rivals.",
      "There is simply no guarantee that today's \"magnificent seven\" will remain magnificent or even stay as the same seven firms.",
      "Take Tesla for example, its sales have recently fallen in response to two widely-reported factors. Firstly, some potential customers are opposed to Tesla owner Elon Musk's involvement in President Trump's government. And secondly, Chinese electric car firms such as BYD are increasingly strong competitors.",
      "Meanwhile, Nvidia saw its share price drop sharply at the start of this year following the release of Chinese artificial intelligence chatbot DeepSeek.  This app was reportedly created at a fraction of the cost of its rivals.",
      "The instant popularity of DeepSeek has raised questions about the future of America's AI dominance and the scale of investments US firms are planning. This concerns Nvidia because it is at the forefront of making microchips for AI processing.",
      "AI is now the biggest tech game in town, and it seems that absolutely everyone is claiming that AI is transforming their industry, their products and their profits. They can't all be right.",
      "Or as Prof Dimon puts it: \"At least in 1910 you knew what automobiles did, but today with AI companies you have to rely on the wisdom of the crowd, and for AI companies that isn't good enough.\"",
      "And not all AI firms can win, adds Robert Whaley, professor of finance at Vanderbilt University in Tennessee. \"AI is certainly contributing to tech volatility. The race is on.\"",
      "That means that AI shares are sensitive to predictions. And any sign that a particular firm is lagging in the AI race may mean that lots of investors, most of whom don't understand the subject, abandon it for another that seems to be further ahead.",
      "Then there are investors who seemingly don't seem to care which companies' shares they buy, so long as they are in the \"booming\" high-tech sector, as they are speculating and spreading their risks.",
      "In short, share prices are not always a rational measure of a firm's value, especially in the high-tech sector, or even of its prospects. Instead, they can represent the optimism of investors. And optimism does not always last.",
      "It is often short-lived, passing, and faddish. And sometimes optimism comes face to face with reality or just plain fades away. It is, in short, volatile.",

      "\"It's the sound of money!\" says a smiling Philip Walton as he surveys the shipping container with 120 computers busily crunching through complex calculations that verify bitcoin transactions.",
      "In exchange they are automatically rewarded bitcoin by the network.",
      "We're in the far north-western tip of Zambia near the border with the DRC, and of all the bitcoin mines I've visited - this one is the strangest.",
      "Water and electronic equipment don't usually mix well but it's precisely the proximity to the river that's drawn bitcoiners here.",
      "Philip's mine is plugged directly into a hydro-electric power plant that channels some of the Zambezi's torrent through enormous turbines to generate continuous, clean electricity.",
      "More importantly for bitcoin mining - it's cheap.",
      "So cheap it made business sense for Philip's Kenya-based company Gridless to drag its shipping container full of delicate bitcoin mining computers across bumpy narrow roads 14 hours from the nearest major city to set up here.",
      "Each machine makes about $5 (\u00a33.90) a day. More if the price of coins is high, less if it drops.",
      "Occasionally Philip glances down at his smart watch - the home screen showing the ever-changing squiggly line of bitcoin's dollar value.",
      "At the moment it's around $80,000 a coin, but Philip says they can make a profit even when the value of the bitcoin goes low thanks to the cheap electricity on the site and the partnership they have with the energy company.",
      "\"We recognised that in order to get better mining economics we needed to partner with the power company here and give them a revenue share. And so the reason we're willing to come out here somewhere so remote is it allows us to effectively get cheaper power,\" he says.",
      "Zengamina hydro-power plant is huge but technically it's a mini grid - a standalone island of power for the local community.",
      "It was built in the early 2000s thanks to $3m raised from charity donations.",
      "British-Zambian Daniel Rea runs the site after his missionary family led the building project, primarily to power the local hospital.",
      "Now it provides power for around 15,000 people in the local area but the project hasn't been able to make ends meet because of slow take-up from the community.",
      "Allowing the bitcoiners to set up shop here has been transformational to the business.",
      "\"Every day we were wasting over half of the energy we could generate which also meant we're not earning from that to meet our operating expenses. We needed a major user of power in the area and that's where the game-changing partnership with Gridless came in,\" Daniel says.",
      "The bitcoin mine now accounts for around 30% of the plant's revenue allowing them to keep the prices down for the local town.",
      "Bitcoin and its economics are of course far from the minds of the people in Zengamina.",
      "The town itself is a few miles from the plant and comprises not much more than a few dozen shed-like buildings peppering a cross roads.",
      "Only one shop has a fridge and a dozen kids crowd around a communal computer taking turns to choose a song to blare out, causing adults to wince as they go about their day.",
      "Although the hydro-electric plant came online in 2007, it took a few more years to connect it to the local town, and then more time to connect individual homes and businesses.",
      "So, some people like barber Damian are still enjoying the novelty of getting wired up only a year and a half ago.",
      "\"Until I got power I had nothing and couldn't do anything.  When I got power I bought everything at the same time.\"",
      "He's not joking. At night his tiny barber shop is a beacon of power with a TV playing music videos, strings of Christmas lights and the buzz of his hair clipper. Like moths, young people hang out in his barber shop like a youth hostel.",
      "\"Getting power has changed my life,\" he smiles. \"The money I'm earning now from the barbershop is helping me pay for school fees again.\"",
      "Embracing electricity is very much a business decision for Damian. At home he shares one light bulb between the two rooms that make up the small house.",
      "Elsewhere in the town sisters Tumba and Lucy Machayi sit on the crossroads watching the world go by.",
      "Like many young people, they're glued to their phones.",
      "\"Before the town got power, it was basically just the bush,\" says Lucy.",
      "The little electricity they had used to come from small solar panels, they say.",
      "\"No fridge, no TV, no mobile phone network,\" says Tumba.",
      "\"Electricity completely changed the lives of people here,\" Lucy adds.",
      "\"We can charge our phones, we have network. We can communicate with each other.\"",
      "Not many people here know or care about the bitcoin mine that's played a part in helping the hydro-plant keep things going.",
      "But soon they'll watch as that container once again rattles its way through the town on its way to another location.",
      "Zengamina Hydro has secured a large investment to help them expand to more villages and join up to the national grid.",
      "Soon the excess energy the mine was harvesting will be sold back to the national grid and mining bitcoin will no longer be profitable at Zengamina.",
      "Phillip and team are sanguine about this and insist this is good news. They will have had a successful few years here and ultimately they are happy to have helped Zengamina. And made a tidy profit in bitcoin of course.",
      "The company says there are plenty of places with so-called stranded energy that they can plonk their bitcoin mine next to.",
      "Gridless already has six sites like this in three different African countries.",
      "North of Zengamina another bitcoin mine slurps up excess energy from a hydro-electric plant run by Virunga National Park in the Congo. It's helping to fund conservation projects, the park says.",
      "But Gridless now plans an ambitious next move - to build their own hydro-plants from scratch to mine for bitcoin and bring electricity to rural areas.",
      "The company's co-founder Janet Maingi says the company is busy raising tens of millions of dollars for the project.",
      "They're focusing on so-called run-of-river hydroelectric models like at Zengamina and the continent has an abundance of \"untapped hydro potential\" she says.",
      "\"A consumer-driven, adaptive energy model is essential for scalable, affordable, and sustainable energy access that meets the needs of African communities,\" she explains.",
      "The company is not a charity and believes that ensuring long-term economic viability for developers and investors can only be done through bitcoin.",
      "Finding locations for a new plant or to tap into existing ones is the easy part though.",
      "The company still faces resistance from some authorities and companies which see bitcoin as an energy-greedy and selfish use of electricity that might otherwise be used by rural people.",
      "But the company insists that the incentive is always to sell to the highest buyer and that will always, they say, be the local community.",
      "History tells us that without incentives or rules in place, bitcoin mining at scale can put strain on public energy grids. In Kazakhstan in 2020-2021 a mining boom increased energy usage in the country by 7% before the government clamped down and clipped the wings of the burgeoning industry.",
      "In the US - bitcoin mining's new mecca - conflicts between miners, locals and residents have been common when electricity is in high demand.",
      "Authorities have created agreements with some mining giants to ensure that they power down their warehouses chock full of computers at times when the grid needs balancing.",
      "For example, Greenidge gas power plant in New York which was renovated to mine bitcoin was mandated to power down mining in January to supply electricity to the grid during a cold snap.",
      "Agreements like these will need to be widespread if President Donald Trump's ambition for bitcoin to be \"mined, minted and made in the USA\" is to be achieved.",
      "The environmental impact of the industry is also a major concern. It's estimated that bitcoin mining uses as much energy as a small country like Poland.",
      "But according to researchers at Cambridge University which does annual estimates on bitcoin's energy usage, there is a shift taking place to a more sustainable energy mix.",
      "Set ups like this Zengamina are a tiny part of the overall mining picture.",

    "published": "Mon, 24 Mar 2025 00:05:50 GMT",
    "summary": "The dispute centres on whether it is acceptable to age and bottle the spirit overseas.",
    "story": [
      "Rum is a key part of Jamaica's cultural identity, but what exactly makes a rum Jamaican?",
      "That question is at the centre of a dispute that is continuing to rumble on the Caribbean island, as some producers wish to strengthen rules on what can, and cannot, be called \"Jamaica rum\".",
      "In October of last year, Jamaica's Intellectual Property Office (JIPO) approved amendments to the geographical indication (GI) designation for Jamaica Rum that was originally set up in 2016. The biggest change is that ageing the rum overseas is now prohibited.",
      "The amendment was called for by the Spirits Pool Association (SPA), the trade organisation that seeks to speak as a single voice for Jamaica's six rum distilleries - Appleton (which is owned by J Wray and Nephew), Clarendon, Hampden Estate, Long Pond, New Yarmouth and Worthy Park Estate.",
      "The SPO's argument is that a stronger GI is needed for the appellation to be officially recognised in its two key export markets \u2013 the EU and the US.",
      "It says this would give Jamaican rum better protection against competitors, and lead to more drinkers recognising it as a premium product made to high specifications in a certain geographic location.",
      "But the amendment has caused quite a stir in Jamaica, because one of the biggest producers claims it would put it out of business.",
      "This company, National Rums of Jamaica (NRJ), owns Long Pond and 73% of Clarendon. NRJ is comprised of three shareholders \u2013 the government of Jamaica, Demerara Distillers of Guyana and the Barbados-based West Indies Rum Distillery (Wird).",
      "The key factor is that Wird has since 2017 been owned by French spirits firm Maison Ferrand. Its business model relies heavily on exporting rum in bulk and ageing overseas - something not allowed under Jamaica's new GI.",
      "It argues that rum aged outside of Jamaica is still Jamaican rum, and that the island has exported and aged rum abroad for centuries.",
      "And so, the NRJ is appealing the ruling of JIPO, with a hearing scheduled for 28 April.",
      "The Spirits Pool Association says that Wird only started to have issues with the geographical indication after its takeover by Maison Ferrard.",
      "\"What we're saying is, if you truly believe in Jamaica rum, age it in Jamaica,\" says Christopher Gentles, general manager of the SPA.",
      "Rum is typically made by fermenting and then distilling sugarcane molasses, the thick treacle-like substance leftover after refined sugar has been produced from the harvested plants.",
      "Mr Gentles says that ageing the rum before it is sold is of paramount importance, and that doing so outside of Jamaica invalidates the products authenticity and uniqueness. And so, he adds that \"we were a little bit puzzled\" by the NRJ's objection.",
      "The SPA also points out that exporting and ageing spirits overseas means Jamaica misses out on the value-added processes like refining, bottling, labelling and distributing as well as other secondary benefits to the local economy like rum tourism.",
      "Both the NRJ and Maison Ferrard declined to comment.",
      "India's spirited rum revolution",
      "From 'hellish liquor' to premium product",
      "Is rum about to become the new gin?",
      "The use of GIs makes a product distinctive, and opens up three potential sources of value, according to Dev Gangjee, professor of intellectual property law at the University of Oxford.",
      "\"The first is simply a price premium. Research shows products can charge a price that is 1.5 to 2.7 times more than standard.\"",
      "This isn't always reflected in profit as GI products are often more expensive to make, he adds.",
      "The second reason is \"they anchor production in that region\". This stops a product from becoming generic and losing its value - like cheddar cheese, which was originally from a specific part of the UK but is now a by-word for a generalised type of cheese.",
      "Lastly, Prof Gangjee says GIs help to advertise the region and \"opens up other aspects of history and geography\", citing France's successful wine tourism industry.",
      "Examples of successful and longstanding GIs are Scotch whisky, champagne, and Parma ham.",
      "Another Caribbean country similarly embroiled in a dispute over GI and rum is Barbados. Currently the island doesn't have a scheme.",
      "Barbados has five distilleries and four agreed on the wording of a proposed Barbados rum GI. The sole objector was Wird, which owns brands such as Cockspur.",
      "Similarly to the situation in Jamaica, it objects to the proposed rules against ageing overseas.",
      "The failure by Barbados to obtain a GI has frustrated the other producers, including Richard Seale, owner of the island's Foursquare distillery. \"We need to have intrinsic industries that are rooted here, tied here, that cannot be separated from here,\" he says.",
      "Back in Jamaica, the SPA wants the country's rum to apply for the EU's Protected Geographical Indication classification, but this cannot happen until the proceedings at the JIPO have concluded.",
      "Mr Gentles hopes that a compromise can be reached, even if it means that both sides are not totally happy. \"It is my firm believe that one day we will put this behind us,\" he says.",
      "And while the SPA hopes that a stronger GI will boost acclaim and business, it is also about pride in a product intimately linked to Jamaica's history.",
      "In the days following the October ruling Jamaican newspaper, The Gleaner, endorsed the JIPO decision, saying there were many examples of firms \"with no association to Jamaica attempting to appropriate the mystique of the island's brand\".",
      "It concluded: \"When foreign entities become owners of uniquely Jamaican products, there should be a commitment to robustly maintain the integrity of the brand.\"",

      "Regulator Ofgem increased the energy price cap because of higher wholesale costs and inflation.",

      "A Court of Appeal judgement last year sent shockwaves through the car finance sector, when it ruled that hidden commission payments to dealers were unlawful.",
      "Companies claim they did nothing wrong, and said they await much-needed clarity from the Supreme Court judges.",
      "Lenders, including major banks, have set aside huge sums of money as millions of people who bought new and used cars on finance could potentially make a claim for hundreds of pounds.",
      "When Marcus Johnson bought a car, a dealer received \u00a31,650 - a quarter of the amount the 34-year-old, from Cwmbran, Torfaen borrowed in total.",
      "Mr Johnson said that when he bought a blue Suzuki Swift in 2017 he simply didn't know that the commission was paid, although the lender said he signed a document.",
      "\"I bought it as a little run-around, to get back and forth from work and to take my family out at the weekends,\" he said.",
      "\"I had no idea that commission even existed as part of the industry.\"",
      "His, along with two others, were test cases that led to a ruling at the Court of Appeal in which three judges unanimously agreed that it would be illegal for the lender to pay any commission to the dealer without the informed consent of the buyer.",

      "Under the FCA's plans, providers will have until December to consider and respond to complaints - but those cases will be hugely dependant on the judgement of the Supreme Court judges.",
      "The final ruling, following three days of evidence from Tuesday, is expected during the summer.",
      "In February, the Supreme Court rejected an unusual intervention from the government, which was worried huge amounts of redress payments could upset the car market and make it less competitive, as well as making the UK less attractive to investors.",
      "The car finance sector insists it complied with the law as it was understood, and as regulation required.",
      "Adrian Dally, from the Finance and Leasing Association, the trade body for the sector, said: \"We hope that the Supreme Court settles the issue once and for all, confirms that the industry did nothing wrong historically, and clarifies what the rules are permanently for the future.\"",

      "Compensation",
      "Even if the judges agree with the appeal from car finance providers, lenders are still facing a hefty compensation bill.",
      "That is because the FCA has already banned discretionary commission arrangements (DCAs), when the higher the interest rate on the loan, the higher the commission that was paid to dealers.",
      "It said this provided an incentive for a buyer to be charged a rate that was higher than necessary.",
      "It is considering setting up a compensation scheme for drivers who had these deals before the ban in 2021, although some drivers are going through the courts for redress.",
      "Alex Neill, co-founder of Consumer Voice, which advises people on compensation, said the Supreme Court could agree with the Court of Appeal in saying all \"secret\" commission payments were unlawful.",
      "\"That would be huge and would be on the scale of PPI, with compensation payments running into the tens of billions of pounds,\" she said.",
      "If not, then it still meant there could be compensation for 40% of car loan agreements with discretionary agreements.",

    "summary": "Why the reign of the free market is facing its biggest ever challenge",
    "story": [
      "I remember 1974 well. With inflation on the rise, the government had been locked in battle with trade unions over worker pay. The government appeared paralysed: stand up to the miners and strikes could shut down the power system, but give in and pay them more money and inflation would rocket.",
      "And then the global oil crisis came out of nowhere. It threw economies, including Britain's, into chaos. The government introduced a three-day week. Power cuts were common - we would be plunged into darkness without warning. And seemingly, the government just expected us to deal with it.",
      "This was also the year I began presenting the BBC's current affairs programme Panorama. We spent a lot of time debating these issues. People came on with all kinds of different ideas of what to do.",
      "There were even suggestions that what the country really needed to take back control from the unions was a military takeover - a coup.",
      "There was another idea out there too. It was proposed by the Conservative politician Keith Joseph and was entirely radical - so removed from the mainstream, in fact, that during filming of Panorama, Joseph turned to the production team and asked exasperatedly if they understood what he meant.",
      "That idea was the free market.",
      "This meant Britain departing from the post World War Two consensus that government should control the economy and that instead if you left the markets alone, they would deliver the country greater prosperity and security.",
      "If, in 2025, the idea sounds anything but radical, that's exactly the point.",
      "What we saw in the UK in the 1980s under Margaret Thatcher's government was just how quickly the free market transitioned from a radical idea into the new reality. Then before long it became what many assumed was the system that would last forever.",
      "US President Donald Trump is a billionaire businessman who has clearly done well financially out of capitalism. But suddenly, thanks in part to him, the free market system finds itself under assault like never before.",
      "It might yet weather the storm. However others are asking, is the free market system fatally flawed and doomed to failure?",
      "The fantasy world of Thatcher's Britain",
      "So much of what Thatcher did in the wake of her 1983 general election victory seems so obvious now. We take it for granted that private companies play a pivotal role in providing our water, electricity, gas, railways, ports and freight.",
      "But at the time few believed it possible to do what she had done - it seemed like a fantasy world, completely detached from how things had been done post war.",
      "I was six when the war ended. There was rationing \u2013 coupons that allowed you to buy meat or clothes, or of course, sweets. But out of these hard times and on the heels of victory, a new vision of society was emerging in Britain.",
      "With Clement Attlee's landslide election victory in July 1945, for the first time in Britain's political history a majority cast their votes for a party ostensibly dedicated to socialism.",
      "But more than that, a new consensus on how the country should run emerged, with those leading the Labour and Conservative parties singing from a broadly similar sheet.",
      "\"We have built our defences against want and sickness, and we're proud of it,\" was uttered not by a Labour prime minister but by Harold Macmillan, Conservative prime minister from 1957 to 1963. This had been how things were done.",
      "However not everyone bought into the consensus. Antony Fisher, who was a chicken farmer, was exasperated by what he saw as the meddling of the Egg Marketing Board. He set up the Institute of Economic Affairs think tank, inspired Keith Joseph and he in turn got Thatcher's ear.",
      "Trump's admiration of Thatcher",
      "That the current assault on the free market is coming, in part, from a Republican US president seems all the more ironic given how popular Thatcher's reforms were with the American right.",
      "Thatcher and President Ronald Reagan shared a similar world view, and Trump has spoken of his admiration for the two, albeit with the caveat that he didn't agree with some of Reagan's trade policies.",
      "Thatcher was convinced that the country would be much better off if gas and water and electricity were taken out of the hands of the state. And sold on the open market. The free market. Just like buying a loaf of bread.",
      "The Thatcher government's big idea was that they weren't just going to sell the shares in state-owned utilities to big businesses or investors. They were going to offer them to the British people.",
      "In December 1984 shares in British Telecom (BT) went on sale. The next morning, the numbers were staggering: more than two million Britons were now BT shareholders.",
      "And Thatcher began to realise that selling off these companies wasn't just about breaking the shackles of government control. It could be something bigger - turning every person in Britain into a capitalist and in doing so making capitalism popular.",
      "In Britain, by the end of the 1980s, the scale of transformation was staggering. The sum of \u00a360bn was raised by selling off state run companies. Up to 15 million Britons were now shareholders.",
      "Britain was embracing the free market. This wasn't just an economic shift. It was a cultural revolution. A redefinition of Britain's relationship with money, with government, and with itself.",
      "And if Thatcher's privatisation had given ordinary people the chance to buy shares, her reforms to Britain's financial services sector in 1986, known as the Big Bang, gave ordinary people the chance to sell them too, to get a job in the previously closed world of the City.",
      "There were many on the left for whom the principle alone of these reforms was something to object to. The assault on the free market from some on the right is not about the principles of the reforms, but the consequences.",
      "Offshore business and collapsing communities",
      "At the core of Thatcher's thinking was a belief that free market capitalism could work only if many people had a direct stake in it. And with share ownership of previously state run utilities, many people did. But before long, alarm bells were starting to be rung. And their chime has only gotten louder.",
      "James Goldsmith was a businessman who had made a fortune by buying struggling companies cheaply, reshaping them to maximise efficiency and then selling them at a profit. The 1980s reforms were like manna from heaven for him.",
      "But then he seemed to change his mind about things. In 1994 he told a committee of US senators that its premise contained a fatal flaw - that the system demanded maximum profit but to achieve maximum profit that meant severing the umbilical link with many of your own electorate.",
      "\"You get to a system whereby, to get the best corporate profits, you have to leave your own country. You have to say to your own sales force 'Goodbye, we can't use you anymore - you're too expensive'.",
      "\"You've got unions. You want holidays. You want protection. So we're going offshore.\"",
      "Goldsmith was predicting that companies would take their business wherever they would make the most money. If you are a CEO answerable to shareholders that's literally your job description. And the result, he said, would be job losses in the West, with communities collapsing.",
      "And to make things worse, he argued that Britain had ceded sovereignty to the likes of the European Union and the World Trade Organization, with Britain binding itself to an economic system run by unelected bureaucrats in Brussels, only adding to the sense of alienation felt in collapsing communities. And with global markets dictating policy. If an industry wasn't profitable, it was left to die.",
      "Today, the UK may be a global leader in science and financial services but is that of much consolation to communities where we once made things that are now made offshore?",
      "Based on what I often heard in my many years touring the country presenting Question Time, I'm not sure it is.",
      "Goldsmith would end up trying to go into politics. His Referendum Party was trounced in the 1997 general election but he had planted a seed. He had argued that the global free market path that Britain and the rest of the world was going down was dangerous. That it would spread division around the world.",
      "Fast-forward nearly 20 years to 2016 and his warning came to pass. Britain voted to leave the European Union and the verdict could not be clearer: the Leave vote was highest in those left-behind communities, seemingly fuelled by those who felt globalisation was not working for them.",
      "The dream of a nation of shareholders has soured too.",
      "In 1989 Thames Water was privatised. We were promised lower bills, better infrastructure, less red tape and investment in a system fraying at the edges. It was investment that the global capitalist system was supposedly best placed to provide.",
      "What followed was something else entirely. Debt ballooned and dividends flowed to shareholders. The company extracted profit while pipes leaked and sewage poured into rivers. And our bills now pay for interest on that debt - it feels like we've come a long way from Thatcher's nation of shareholders.",
      "Trump's tariffs 'defy easy explanation'",
      "Back in 1994, James Goldsmith had posited that the problem with the free market dream was that it didn't protect the home base.",
      "Now, there is someone else much more powerful who takes that view.",
      "President Trump's methods are so erratic that with him it's hard to tell what is going on. His readiness to slap hugely consequential tariffs on countries that are both traditional foes and supposed friends at times defies easy explanation.",
      "But what we can say is that he is trying to return to ideas that preceded the free market. He is trying to make America strong through protectionism, making it harder for anyone to simply sell anywhere.",
      "There is an argument that if you take the long view then perhaps the free market period is the outlier. Britain itself had a long, long period of protectionism before it embraced free trade.",
      "Tariffs are nothing new in world economic history and in a sense Trump is just trying to return the US to how things were, albeit in quite a chaotic way.",
      "The reign of the free market is facing its biggest ever challenge. But that challenge is coming not from supporters of socialism who ideologically back a big role for the state. Instead, the challenge is coming from Trump, a man who is broadly speaking of the right and has no qualms with capitalism allowing people to become very rich.",

      "A series of essential bills are rising at the start of what some commentators have described as \"awful April\".",
      "The exact amount you pay will depend on your individual circumstances, and where you live.",
      "Although minimum wages are also increasing, and wages on average have been outpacing inflation, household finances could still come under extra pressure.",
      "Here are seven ways in which you could be affected from 1 April.",
      "1. Water bills",
      "Water bills for households are going up in England and Wales by \u00a310 more per month on average, but there's a lot of variation depending on the company.",
      "For example, the annual Southern Water bill will jump 47% to \u00a3703, while Anglian Water customers will pay 19% more, or \u00a3626.",
      "Factors including whether households have a meter and how much water used will also impact bills, which are being front-loaded for the next five years, meaning the big increase is coming this year.",
      "Water companies in England and Wales have said the increases are needed to invest in creaking infrastructure, including sewage, and to build more reservoirs.",
      "In Scotland, water bills are rising by almost 10%. Scottish Water, which is a public body, said spending was needed to cope with periods of \"drought and intense rainfall\" brought on by climate change.",
      "Domestic customers in Northern Ireland are not billed for water, with the system funded by the devolved government.",
      "How much will I have to pay for my water?",
      "How much will I have to pay for my water?",
      "2. Energy bills",
      "The annual energy bill for a household using a typical amount of gas and electricity is going up by \u00a3111 a year to \u00a31,849 from April.",
      "Regulator Ofgem increased the energy price cap because of higher wholesale costs and inflation.",
      "The cap is set every three months and limits the amount suppliers can charge for each unit of gas and electricity, but not the total bill, so if you use more, you will pay more.",
      "It affects 22 million homes in England, Wales and Scotland.",
      "Standing charges - fixed fees to connect to a gas and electricity supply and vary by region - are rising again for gas but dropping for electricity, but it depends on where you live.",

      "Energy price cap: Why are gas and electricity bills going up and can I fix?",
      "3. Council tax",
      "It is likely the tax you pay to your local authority is going up.",
      "In England, local authorities with responsibility for delivering social care can increase council tax every year by up to 4.99% without triggering a referendum or local vote.",
      "Smaller councils without social care duties can increase bills by up to 2.99%.",
      "For 2025-26, the government is allowing Bradford, Newham, Birmingham, Somerset, and Windsor and Maidenhead to bypass the 4.99% cap, meaning they could raise council tax by more.",
      "Council tax rates in Scotland have been frozen or had limited increases since 2007, but they are are going up, in some cases by as much as 10%.",
      "The Scottish government says it is offering local authorities an extra \u00a31bn in 2025-26 to help reduce the scale of any rise.",
      "In Wales, council tax rates could jump by as much 15% in some areas. Local authorities were given \u00a3253m by the Welsh government in its draft budget, but council leaders say more money needed.",

      "4. Car tax",
      "The standard rate of tax for cars registered after April 2017 is rising \u00a35 to \u00a3195 a year. According to the RAC, you may pay less or more if your car was first used before 2017.",
      "The exact amount for your road tax will depend on the year your car was registered and the type of fuel it uses.",
      "One big change is that electric vehicles (EVs) will no longer be tax exempt. EVs registered from April 2025 will pay the lowest rate of \u00a310 in the first year, then move to the standard rate. The standard rate will also apply to EVs first registered after April 2017.",
      "5. Broadband, phone and TV licence",
      "Rule changes introduced by the telecoms regulator this year mean that mobile and broadband providers must now tell customers \"in pounds and pence\" about any price rises, as well as when they occur.",
      "The new rules typically only apply to new customers, so any price rise will depend on when you took your contract out, but prices ususally increase around now.",
      "For instance, under the new rules, someone with a mobile Sim only contract with EE will see their bill go up by \u00a31.50 a month, or \u00a318 a year.",
      "But for the majority of EE customers who took their contract out before 10 April 2024, they will face an increase of 6.4%, which is based on the inflation rate last December together with an additional charge.",
      "Similarly, most Virgin Media broadband customers will face a 7.5% rise in bills, but for anyone who took out a contract after 9 January this year, their monthly bill will go up by \u00a33.50.",
      "The cost of a TV licence is also going up by \u00a35 to \u00a3174.50, and for a black and white TV is going up by \u00a31.50 to \u00a358.50.",
      "6. Stamp duty",
      "House buyers in England and Northern Ireland will start paying stamp duty on properties over \u00a3125,000, instead of over \u00a3250,000.",
      "First-time buyers currently had paid no stamp duty on homes up to \u00a3425,000, but this is dropping to \u00a3300,000.",

      "7. Hidden tax rises",
      "The government has kept in place the freeze on tax thresholds on income tax and National Insurance until 2028, a policy brought in by the previous government.",
      "This is often dubbed a stealth tax - as governments don't explicitly label it as a tax.",
      "But the policy amounts to a tax rise because of a process called \"fiscal drag\", which sees more people \"dragged\" into paying higher rates of tax as wages rises.",
      "The new tax year begins on 6 April.",
      "According to figures from the government's financial watchdog by 2028-29, nearly four million additional people will be expected to pay income tax - and three million more will have moved to the higher rate - due to the threshold being frozen.",

      "David remembers the moment he found his elderly stepfather, John, unkempt and suffering from dementia, living alone in an unclean hotel room.",
      "\"I didn't think you'd leave an animal in the state that room was in,\" he says. \" There was no care at all. You would not leave a vulnerable old man like that.\"",
      "Months earlier, John had vanished. His eldest granddaughter, Amy, had taken control of his welfare and his finances, and stopped any contact between John and the rest of his family, including Barbara, his wife of many years.",
      "With Amy's help, John had changed his will, making her the sole beneficiary, and had then been left to live by himself in a single room, confused and isolated.",
      "John's family was one of hundreds who contacted the BBC after hearing The Willpower Detectives last year.",
      "The series revealed how a partner at an Essex-based law firm was using what's known as Lasting Power of Attorney (LPA) to take over the finances of vulnerable clients.",
      "In June, Parliament will debate a private member's bill to provide extra safeguards to LPA. The bill - introduced by the MP Fabian Hamilton - has cross-party support, and is shaped in part by the BBC's investigations and the huge public response to the cases raised.",
      "The story of John Wilcox demonstrates how, in handing over responsibility for their financial assets, vulnerable people can sometimes be put at risk by members of their own family.",
      "After many years of running a successful office-furnishing business in Leeds, John and Barbara Wilcox had retired and were living comfortably in mid-Wales.",
      "Both had been married before. John had no children of his own, but he loved Barbara's son and daughter as his own, as well as her three grandchildren. To each of these, he had given enough money to buy their first homes.",
      "However, everything changed in 2020 when John was diagnosed with dementia.",
      "The condition caused a personality change, and John became delusional and paranoid. He started to accuse Barbara and his own brother Desmond of plotting against him.",
      "Following a collapse at home John was taken to hospital, where - because of Covid restrictions - nobody was allowed to visit.",
      "This isolation fed John's feelings of paranoia, and the suspicion that he had been abandoned by his family.",
      "It was during this time that John's eldest granddaughter, Amy - the one person he still seemed to trust - began to take charge of his life.",
      "At first, no-one in the family was suspicious. John had always been close to Amy.",
      "Unknown to them, John had requested and signed a form banning contact between anyone involved in his care and anyone in his family, apart from Amy.",
      "Even though his medical notes describe him as paranoid and delusional, John was declared as having \"mental capacity\" - this was significant because it meant he could legally grant someone lasting power of attorney over his finances.",
      "Barbara says her efforts to raise concerns with social services were blanked: \"They just didn't want to know. They weren't interested in the letters that we wrote.\"",
      "After three months in hospital, John was discharged into Amy's care. She suggested he could recuperate at a care home at Paignton in Devon, near where she lived, while she readied her house for him to stay there.",
      "At this stage, the other family members thought this was just a temporary arrangement in everyone's best interests. Amy said that it was what John wanted, and it would be a respite for Barbara.",
      "However, Barbara recalls: \"As soon as she got him down there, the vitriol started.\" Amy told the rest of the family they no longer had any say about John's welfare, and they were not to try to contact him.",
      "In response to their pleas, it was agreed that a niece of John's would call him once a week to check that he was alright.",
      "But six weeks after he was admitted to the care home, the niece made her regular call, only to be told that John had left.",
      "The family was devastated - John had disappeared.",
      "They went to the police but were told he had signed a form in hospital instructing that no information should be shared with them. They were only told that John was not living with Amy.",
      "The family discovered that John had signed an LPA document giving Amy power of attorney over all his property and finances.",
      "Meanwhile, a solicitor in Devon contacted Barbara asking about their home and joint assets. Barbara later found out about John's new will, which named Amy as the sole beneficiary.",
      "This development had immediate and stressful consequences. The solicitor asked Barbara to begin the process of selling the home she had shared with John, in order to release his share of their assets.",
      "John's brother, Desmond, took the lead in trying to find out where John now was. It took him several weeks.",
      "He says he rang 50 care homes, trying to track John down. He and Barbara also wrote to Amy asking her to at least tell them how her grandfather was, but they say they never received a reply.",
      "Eventually, Amy's aunt confronted her in person, and found out that John was in a hotel in Torquay.",
      "Desmond knew that in the past, John had lent \u00a3100,000 to a friend who owned several hotels in south-west England.",
      "It appeared that John had been put up at one of these hotels. The owner had made a deal to offset John's bill (a nightly rate of \u00a3265) against his outstanding debt.",
      "Amy's father, David, drove to the hotel. He was horrified by what he found: \"The conditions he was living in were appalling. I was absolutely astounded.\"",
      "John was renting the room only - with no cleaning services or food. There was a fridge and a microwave oven - in which he would heat ready meals supplied by Amy.",
      "For David, it was the ultimate betrayal of a vulnerable man. He says that John was dishevelled and confused: \"He was just abandoned. He hardly went out of that room and it was in a terrible state.\"",
      "Having found John, his family decided they needed to tread carefully. They say they wanted him to understand the truth about what had been done to him, and they were also worried that Amy might try to move him again.",
      "At first, John refused to see Barbara, claiming she had tried to kill him, and that she had never come to see him in hospital.",
      "And then one day, Barbara drove to John's hotel with her son David and his partner Julie. She stayed outside in the car but gave David a tin of flapjacks to take to John in his room.",
      "The touch and smell of a faded everyday item - an old cake tin with some homemade flapjacks inside - seemed to have an effect on him.",
      "\"I know what's in there,\" he said to his stepson.",
      "\"Do you know who made them?\" David remembers asking John.",
      "John replied: \"Yes I do.\"",
      "David then offered to bring Barbara into the hotel room and John agreed.",
      "Barbara says she was heartbroken by her husband's physical and mental deterioration. He weighed only seven-and-a-half stone, and he was so weak that she thinks he would have died if he had been left much longer.",
      "It was a \"very, very emotional\" reunion, she remembers. Before long, they were holding hands and John had agreed to come home with her.",
      "The next day, Barbara and her brother Mike came back to the hotel to pick John up. Mike says it felt like they were \"planning a heist\". He recalls that \"as we drove away and started to get out of Torquay, I said: 'Oh gosh, we got away with that.'\"",
      "Back in Wales, Barbara was able to see John's bank accounts, and discovered that Amy had taken more than \u00a35,000 - there was just 16p left in his account.",
      "But John's story had a happy ending of sorts. He managed to get the power of attorney and the new will cast aside, and lived for nine months with Barbara in Wales, before dying peacefully at home.",
      "His tale highlights the difficulties involved when it comes to deciding who has control of what's often seen as \"family money\", and who will inherit it.",
      "Issues of mental capacity have to be considered in situations like these, according to James Warner, a consultant in old-age psychiatry.",
      "\"Dementia makes people susceptible to manipulation and those involved with overseeing important changes need to be extra-vigilant,\" he says.",
      "The elderly and vulnerable can quickly find themselves in situations where they are extremely vulnerable, he says, and more needs to be done to protect them.",
      "The Office of the Public Guardian (OPG) holds power of attorney records for more than eight million people in England and Wales, but last year it investigated less than 1% of the cases brought to its attention.",
      "Labour MP Fabian Hamilton says the OPG can be \"toothless\" for vulnerable elderly people and their families.",
      "Mr Hamilton says changes are needed to provide greater safeguards, and his private member's bill on attorney powers is due for its second reading in June.",
      "The bill - which has cross-party support - would compel banks and regulators to check for issues such as cognitive decline, and greater scrutiny over whether an attorney is abusing their LPA powers.",
      "Barbara thinks that the proposed legislation could have helped in her situation.",
      "\"In cases like John's, where you have this kind of paranoia, solicitors involved with a power of attorney should be making enquiries of the family and verifying,\" she says.",
      "Meanwhile, John's family have had no contact with Amy, unable to forgive the hurt she caused them and what she put her grandfather through.",
      "They say they still do not understand why Amy acted in the way she did. She (along with John's other grandchildren) had already been given money enough to buy a house each, and she stood to inherit more eventually.",
      "In May 2024, Amy accepted a police caution for fraud - which in law is an admission of guilt - specifically because she had taken money from John's account after he had returned to Wales, and was no longer in her care.",
      "When I wrote to Amy about this, she replied that she had only accepted the caution to lift the stress from herself and her family, and didn't regard it as just.",
      "She told me that there were two sides to every story and that all of John's decisions were made by him in the company of his solicitor. She added that the decision not to tell John's family anything was at his request."

    "story": [
      "Clearer advice is needed on how to make campuses inclusive without falling foul of free speech regulations, the National Union of Students (NUS) has said.",
      "The body representing university students has expressed concern after the University of Sussex was fined \u00a3585,000 by the Office for Students (OfS) this week for failing to uphold free speech - the first case of its kind.",
      "The higher education regulator launched an investigation back in 2021 when Professor Kathleen Stock left the university. She had faced protests after saying that biological sex was more important than gender identity.",
      "According to the OfS, the university's policy statement on trans and non-binary equality, including a requirement to \"positively represent trans people\", might have led to staff and students preventing themselves from voicing opposing views.",
      "That has triggered not only the threat of a court showdown, after the university vowed to challenge the OfS's findings, but also put universities across the UK on alert over further free speech-related fines - and leaving some fearing a catch-22 situation.",
      "Universities in England are asking for clarity behind the scenes on how to protect their students from abuse and harassment because the regulator hasn't spelt out what is acceptable.",
      "The regulator told the BBC it would be writing to a handful of institutions to remind them of their duty to protect free speech. Arif Ahmed, from the OfS, warned the University of Sussex fine could have been as high as \u00a33.7m and there was \"potential for higher fines in the future\".",
      "Finding the balance",
      "Commenting for the first time since the fine was issued to Sussex, the NUS said it was concerned about the size of the fine at a time when university finances are under pressure.",
      "Its vice president for liberation and equality Saranya Thambirajah said it was important universities were welcoming places for all marginalised groups of students - and suggested the money could have gone towards improving student welfare instead.",
      "She told the BBC it's \"really unclear\" where the OfS is drawing the line on what is or isn't acceptable.",
      "\"We would say at the NUS, that the line between freedom of harm and freedom of speech right now is not falling in the right place, or at the very least, there is very little clarity from the regulator as to where that line should be falling,\" she said.",
      "The OfS has said it should be possible to express any lawful view on campus - but the trans and non-binary equality policy at the heart of the Sussex row, which was in place until last year, illustrates the potential challenges ahead.",
      "One of the concerns raised by the regulator was a section in the policy which said that harassment or bullying including intrusive behaviour, name calling or derogatory jokes were serious disciplinary offences.",
      "Now, the university has replaced it with a new trans and non-binary policy - but the regulator hasn't told bosses yet whether or not that passes the free-speech test.",
      "Next free speech fine may cost millions, unis told",
      "Government to implement university free speech law",
      "And in another potential point of tension, from 1 August a new regulation comes into force requiring universities in England to go further in showing how they will promote and uphold free speech on campus.",
      "The OfS says this shouldn't include the content of courses or discussions in the lecture hall. All higher education institutions have to meet conditions to register with the OfS in order to charge tuition fees.",
      "But they will also have to show how they are acting to prevent the harassment of students - and universities are required to try to increase applications from underrepresented groups, through initiatives to make them feel more included.",
      "Lawyer Smita Jamdar, who advises universities in England on how to comply with regulations, says that to reduce harassment, universities need to be \"really clear about the behaviour you will and will not tolerate\" and that action will be taken when students \"transgress those boundaries\".",
      "While that has to be balanced against freedom of speech, Ms Jamdar said most people would expect \"the line to be drawn somewhere other than name calling and derogatory jokes\".",
      "When the BBC looked at similar trans equality policies at a number of universities it wasn't entirely clear whether they would be considered a challenge to free speech.",
      "Of course, the implications of the Sussex fine for universities across the country straddle many other free speech debates and groups of students, including all the potential flashpoints of race, religion, ethnicity and conflict which sometimes play out on university campuses.",
      "The impacts of the Sussex fine are unlikely to go away any time soon, with vice-chancellors and students alike calling for more clarity.",
      "One of those major tests would be if University of Sussex's vice-chancellor, Prof Sasha Roseneil, gets her day in court. The university has confirmed it will seek a review by a senior judge of the inquiry.",
      "If the Sussex case gets debated in court, plenty of people on other campuses would be listening closely."

      "On Thursday, the government said the \u00a3740m of funding investment it announced in December will create 10,000 new school places for pupils with special educational needs and disabilities (Send) within mainstream schools.",
      "Education Secretary Bridget Phillipson said it will help plug \"the significant gaps in provision\".",
      "An estimated 1.7 million school-aged children have special educational needs and disabilities in England.",
      "Those with further needs can receive legal entitlement to more specific support, often in a specialist school, via an education, health and care plan (EHCP).",
      "The number of pupils with an EHCP, who need a place in specialist provision, is forecast by local authorities to rise by 44,000 in the next three years - from 229,000 in 2024-25 to 273,000 in 2028-29.",
      "This is the second year figures on special school capacity have been collected by the Dfe.",
      "It says the reason for the gap in provision is because of the number of schools at or over capacity. However, the figures may not reflect the current pupils attending special schools because of the different and changing needs for which schools cater.",
      "It found there were 92,000 secondary places across special state schools in England, but about 100,000 secondary pupils on the roll in May 2024.",
      "In a highly critical report earlier this year, the Public Accounts Committee (PAC) found a Send system \"in disarray\", \"mired in red tape, lacking funding, and failing to produce value for money\".",
      "It warned 40% of councils would be \"staring down bankruptcy\" next year, when a scheme allowing local authorities to keep those deficits off their financial books expires.",
      "The government is encouraging local authorities to help mainstream schools to set up more provision for children with Send within their own schools.",
      "Fewer than one in 10 mainstream schools have SEN units or resourced provision which provide more intensive support for pupils, according to the Dfe.",
      "It hopes to reform the system to be more inclusive so children's need can be identified and met at an earlier point in mainstream schools, and special schools can cater to those with the most complex needs.",
      "Releasing more details on the plans, Phillipson said: \"This investment is a big step towards delivering not only enough school places, but the right school places, supporting all children and particularly those with Send, and plugging the significant gaps in provision we inherited\".",
      "Elsewhere, the figures on school capacity show 16% of primary schools are over capacity, down 1% on last year, and 24% of secondary schools, up 1% on last year.",
      "There has been an increase in 24,000 school places overall, but this is falling because of the reduction in pupil numbers since 2018-19.",
      "It has been predicted the number of children in state nurseries and primary schools would fall by 4.5% over the next four years, but it varies across England.",
      "Pupil numbers in London have been in decline for a number of years and are projected to fall further because of a drop in the birth rate.",

      "He added: \"I think universities should be looking at their policies and thinking carefully about what they need to do to comply with the law and to comply with regulatory requirements.\"",
      "The report said maximum penalties for universities would be capped at whichever is higher: 2% of a university's annual \"qualifying income\" - the amount they receive from tuition fees and OfS grants - or \u00a3500,000.",
      "Many universities post incomes in the hundreds of millions every year, meaning maximum fines could comfortably reach seven figures.",
      "The University of Sussex fine was capped at \u00a34.6m, the OfS said, adding that an \"appropriate deterrent\" against future breaches could be achieved with the lower fine.",

      "She later apologised for what she had said.",
      "Some commend her for speaking her mind. Ehenulo says that she is \"not the first and certainly not the last actor to be speaking about politics\".",
      "And Luxford told me she was \"hard-pressed\" to imagine the film's core audience, children under 10, being swayed by her politics.",

      "\"Ultimately, [Zegler] became a lightning rod for controversy, not just due to her own actions, but because Snow White landed at the intersection of Hollywood's creative stagnation, racial politics, international conflict, and America's deep ideological divide,\" he said.",

      "Some, like Luxford, argue that some of the pile-on comes from \"a place of prejudice\".",

    "summary": "A 15-year-old teenager discusses Andrew Tate and girl-boy friendships with his parents after watching the Netflix drama.",
    "story": [
      "\"It's just weird to talk about your sexual feelings to your parents,\" says 15-year-old Ben*.",
      "His parents, Sophie and Martin, two professionals in their 40s, nod understandingly. They are discussing the kinds of \"big issues\" Ben's social media usage throws up, and for Ben their conversations about sex and pornography are \"the worst\".",
      "The family \u2013 minus Ben's little sister, who is too young to join the discussion \u2013 are gathered in their living room to dissect the smash-hit Netflix drama Adolescence, which they watched the previous evening.",
      "The series follows the story of 13-year-old protagonist Jamie, who is accused of murdering a female peer after being exposed to misogynistic online material and subjected to cyberbullying.",
      "Both of Ben's parents are concerned their own son's behaviour is being impacted by the material he is exposed to, and Ben, who is worried himself, is trying to set limits on his own phone use.",
      "Given their concerns, and how they overlap with the themes of Adolescence, the family agreed to watch the programme together and allowed BBC News to sit in on their discussion, which ranged from the relevance of Andrew Tate to whether boys and girls can be friends.",
      "'People just call each other virgins'",
      "Ben is sitting on the sofa in the living room scrolling on his phone before the conversation begins.",
      "The parents take their seats looking relaxed despite the difficult subjects they are about to discuss. Photos of loved ones line the bookshelves in the family's living room, and a piano stands against the wall.",
      "Sophie and Martin have worked hard to create a \"very open\" household, Sophie says, where \"all topics are on the table\". While watching the programme, Sophie made a list of things to talk about with Ben.",
      "A confident and outspoken teenage boy, Ben is well-liked by fellow pupils at his single-sex state secondary school. But the qualities that make him popular with his peers often land him in trouble with his teachers, who give him detentions or send him to isolation for making what his mother describes as \"inappropriate comments\".",
      "In the show, Jamie and his peers use language associated with the \"manosphere\" \u2013 websites and online forums promoting misogyny and opposition to feminism \u2013 and incel culture. Incels, short for involuntary celibate, are men who blame women because they are unable to find a sexual partner. It is an ideology that has been linked to terror attacks and killings in recent years.",
      "Perhaps surprisingly, \"incel\" wasn't a familiar term to Ben, and his dad Martin had to explain it as they watched the programme.",
      "\"People just call each other 'virgins'. I've not heard 'incel' before,\" Ben tells his parents. He suggests the term might have \"dropped off\" social media for young people in recent years, reflecting the pace at which the conversation moves online.",
      "Ben tells his parents there are elements of the show he recognises, including its depiction of the fights and cyberbullying at school. But he thinks it is only a \"rough picture\" of what it's like to be a teenager today, and that it was principally made for \"an adult who isn't online\".",
      "For example, it neglects to show the good side of social media alongside its dangers, he says, and some details \u2013 including the secret emoji codes one character claims children use \u2013 ring false.",
      "It is for this reason that Martin, who says he enjoyed the tense drama, also feels the show is playing on every parent's \"worst nightmare\" about their child's phone use, meaning it sometimes favours theatrics over realism in an attempt to \"shock\" adults into action.",
      "Andrew Tate, an influencer and central figure of the shadowy online world of the manosphere, is mentioned by name in the drama and has been the cause of much concern among parents and teachers. But Ben says that while Andrew Tate was \"popular\" at his school about two years ago, he is now \"old news\".",
      "Ben has noticed the way Tate combines health and wellbeing with politics. \"Some of his things, like 'exercise for an hour a day' \u2013 fair enough, that's correct. But then he combines it with far-right ideas, like 'the man should go out and work and the wife should stay at home',\" Ben says.",
      "Both parents agree that Tate is not to blame for misogyny. As far as they're concerned, he is symptomatic of \"a bigger social problem\".",
      "Can boys and girls be friends?",
      "This problem is represented starkly in the bleak picture Adolescence paints of male-female friendships in the social media age. Protagonist Jamie doesn't have any female friends, and appears to view relations with the opposite sex through a lens of dominance and manipulation.",
      "Sophie is concerned that interactions between boys and girls are distant and impersonal in Ben's peer group. She says Ben doesn't have many opportunities to mix with girls his age.",
      "And she worries her son is getting most of his information about how to interact with girls from social media. \"It's really twisted,\" she says. \"They don't know how to behave around each other.\"",
      "She asks her son a question: \"If you don't know how to talk to girls when you're feeling awkward, if you're like, 'Eurgh, I don't know how to dress', where do you go for help?\"",
      "\"Online,\" Ben says.",
      "\"So it goes full circle,\" says his mum. \"That's where they get information.\"",
      "Ben isn't embarrassed that he's \"used ChatGPT for like two years\" to get this sort of advice. \"Or TikTok,\" he adds.",
      "Drama shines light on 'growing problem' - PM",
      "Netflix drama Adolescence hailed as 'flawless' TV",
      "Netflix's Adolescence makes UK TV ratings history",
      "Sophie says Ben learned most about friendship with the opposite sex during a visit to a cousin's house, who attends a mixed school and has female friends.",
      "She recalls Ben's cousin reprimanding him after Ben asked whether the cousin was attracted to a female friend.",
      "\"I don't remember him getting annoyed with me like that, but okay,\" Ben says.",
      "They debate their varying recollections of events until they land on a version on which they can agree: \"His cousin was like, 'No, that's my friend. I don't think of them in that way,'\" Sophie says.",
      "\"That was really eye-opening for him,\" she says. Turning to Ben, she recalls: \"You came back from it, and you were like, 'It's much better [at my cousin's], girls and boys are friends.'\"",
      "Sharing intimate images",
      "In the Netflix drama, it is revealed that Jamie's victim Katie had been subjected to misogynistic bullying after a male classmate shared intimate images of her without her consent.",
      "Jamie's discussion of this incident with a child psychologist, played by Erin Doherty, is pivotal to the programme's acclaimed third episode.",
      "Ben has seen this kind of abuse of trust among his peers too. \"There's a guy near here, and [a picture of] his genitals got leaked on a massive group chat with loads of people,\" he says. \"That was a big thing on TikTok.\"",
      "The series kicks off with an episode in which police question Jamie about the sexualised images of adult women he has shared on his Instagram page, hinting at the ease with which young teenagers can access pornography.",
      "This feels familiar to Ben, who thinks porn is the \"biggest issue\" among his peer group. He knows boys who are \"addicted\" to it: \"They rely on it. There are people in my year who'll have such a bad day unless they watch it.\"",
      "Ben squirms a little while talking about pornography, staring at the wall or fiddling with his phone.",
      "He seems more comfortable talking about the other forms of concerning content young people come across online.",
      "He estimates that \"one in 10\" videos he watches on his phone contain distressing material, including scenes of extreme violence. And Ben's parents are under no illusions that their son is \"safe\" just because he is upstairs on his computer - unlike Jamie's parents in the show.",
      "What can be done?",
      "For Martin and Sophie, the solution lies in giving children better opportunities to \"participate\" in society and build their self-esteem.",
      "They say they are also keen for their son to have \"wide range\" of male role models to learn from. Ben, who has paused to check his phone several times in the course of their discussion, re-engages with the conversation.",
      "He is animated in his praise for his sports coaches, whose \"really strong morals\" he admires.",
      "The parents nod, evidently pleased by his enthusiasm. They say they pack their son's life with activities in an attempt to get him off his phone. But this is expensive, they say, and puts poorer students at a disadvantage.",
      "Sophie says of the show's main character, Jamie: \"He doesn't have sport. He doesn't feel good about himself. His dad looks away when he fails\".",
      "Adolescence shows that children with limited opportunities to build their self-esteem are more \"vulnerable\" to the predatory messages of misogynistic influencers, Sophie says.",
      "Both parents agree tech companies, the government, schools and families all have a responsibility to offer young people a convincing alternative to the siren call of the manosphere.",
      "They insist parents can't do it alone. As Sophie says: \"It's a tsunami and someone's given me an umbrella.\"",
      "Ben thinks what happens online is too often dismissed by adults as being irrelevant to the real world. He thinks this is a mistake: social media should be treated \"like real life \u2013 because it is real life\", he says.",

      "\"But I wanted to write about real things. No one else can sing my songs. I don't take other people's demos. This is all mine.\"",
      "Even a passing glance at his discography proves him right.",
      "Warren's arena pop anthems are searingly honest, almost to a fault, drawing on his challenging childhood, and fairytale romance with Kouvr.",
      "His father died when he was nine years old, after a long struggle with kidney cancer. The loss sent his mother spiralling into alcoholism, something Warren only realised when he tried to clear up one of her coffee mugs.",
      "\"It turned out to be alcohol,\" he says. \"And the next day it was alcohol, and the next day it was alcohol, and at 4am it was alcohol, and when we were driving, it was alcohol.\"",
      "When he called her out on it, the addiction turned to abuse.",
      "\"Every person struggling with addiction needs someone to blame it on, besides themselves, and I became that person,\" he says.",
      "When he was 18, she kicked him out. He was broke and homeless. Friends let him sleep in their cars \u2013 never their houses, because his mum had convinced their parents he was a trouble-maker.",
      "Around the same time, he was introduced to Instagram model Kouvr Annon by a friend on Snapchat.",
      "\"We just clicked right away,\" he says. \"I felt I could tell her everything, just after our first conversation.\"",
      "Within four months, Kouvr left her family in Hawaii, flew out to California and started living with Warren in a car.",
      "Then, as now, they're an exceptionally cute couple \u2013 tender and funny and clearly besotted with one another. When they started posting videos of their romance online, people wanted to see more. In a span of six months, Warren gained more than a million followers on YouTube.",
      "Combined with the prank videos he'd filmed with his friends, he built a big enough audience to start earning money.",
      "\"When I got my first cheque for $2,000 in a month, I was like, 'Holy cow, this is gonna change my life',\" he recalls.",
      "Some of that money went into the creation of the Hype House in 2019. Warren came up with the name, and moved into the property with Annon and a bunch of young internet stars like Addison Rae, Charlie D'Amelio, Chase Hudson and Thomas Petrou.",
      "The collective introduced themselves in December 2019 with a photoshoot that mimicked Backstreet Boys video for I Want It That Way.",
      "By the end of the day, the hashtag #hypehouse was trending, and the mansion quickly became an incubator for viral videos.",
      "The enterprise thrived during lockdown but, as individual members signed TV deals, or grew tired of the escalating demands for content, it started to fall apart. Warren and Annon left in 2022, citing a desire to \"move on to the next chapter in their lives\".",
      "Since then, rumours have swirled about behind-the-scenes drama at the house, with some members hinting at exploitation and mistreatment.",
      "\"There was falling out,\" Warren told the Zach Sang show in 2023. \"But a lot of us signed NDAs, so no-one's going to talk about it.\"",
      "He did, however, pour his frustrations into music.",

      "\"It scars forever when someone you called your friend / Shows you the truth can be so cold.\"",
      "Warren says he never made money from the Hype House. What it did give him, however, was a built-in audience for his music.",
      "\"I think that's really rare,\" he says. \"Usually, when someone goes from social media to music, they lose that fan base.",
      "\"But I think a lot of people watched my YouTube videos because they were having a rough life and needed an escape. So when I started making music about my rough life, I think they identified with it even more.\"",

      "\"The other day, a woman wanted me to sign a Heinz Beans t-shirt,\" he says. \"I giggled because I thought that was funny, then she turned it over, and it was the same t-shirt her son wore right before he died from cancer.",

      "Dua Lipa has won the dismissal of a lawsuit that accused her of copying her hit single Levitating from two other songs.",
      "The star was sued in 2022 by songwriters L Russell Brown and Sandy Linzer, who accused her of plagiarising their 1979 disco track Wiggle and Giggle All Night and 1980's Don Diablo.",
      "On Thursday, US Judge Katherine Polk Failla ruled that the songs only had generic similarities, including non-copyrightable musical elements that had also previously been used by Mozart, Gilbert and Sullivan, and the Bee Gees in their song Stayin' Alive.",
      "It is the second time that Lipa has won a plagiarism case over Levitating, which was a global hit in 2020.",
      "She was previously sued by Florida reggae band Artikal Sound System, who claimed Lipa ripped off the chorus for her song from their 2015 track Live Your Life.",
      "Their case was dropped in 2023 after a judge ruled there was no evidence that Lipa and her co-writers had \"access\" to the earlier song - a key requirement in any copyright lawsuit.",
      "However, she is still facing a third legal challenge over the song, from musician Bosko Kante - a featured artist on Levitating, who sang vocals through a talk box.",
      "He sued in 2023, saying his contribution had been used on remixes of the song without permission.",
      "Kante is seeking damages of at least $2m (\u00a31.5m) plus interest, as well as profits from the remixes, which he estimated as being at least $20m (\u00a315m).",
      "Brown and Linzer's case alleged that Lipa stole the opening melody of Levitating, where she sings: \"If you wanna run away with me, I know a galaxy and I can take you for a ride.\"",
      "They called the melody and phrasing a \"duplicate\" of their own songs.",

    "story": [
      "A forgotten oil-on-canvas masterpiece by Indian painter MF Husain, rediscovered decades later, has rewritten the record books for Indian art.",
      "Husain's Untitled (Gram Yatra), a sprawling 14-foot-wide mural, sold for an unprecedented $13.8m (\u00a310.6m) at a Christie's auction in New York last week. It shattered the previous high for Indian art of $7.4m (\u00a35.7m), fetched by Amrita Sher-Gil's The Story Teller in 2023.",
      "Husain, who died in 2011, aged 95, was a pioneer of Indian modernism and remains a lasting inspiration for Indian artists. In 2006, he left India after death threats from Hindu hardline groups over his depictions of deities.",
      "For nearly five decades, the record-breaking painting unassumingly adorned the walls of a Norwegian hospital, overlooked and undervalued. Now, it stands as a defining work of modern South Asian art.",
      "Husain painted Gram Yatra - meaning \"village journey\", a name it was given later on - in 1954, long before he became an icon.",
      "Its 13 vignettes - vivid snapshots of Indian village life - reflect his distinctive blend of Indian folk traditions and modernist influences. They are reminiscent of narrative paintings in India's miniature tradition, in which small pictures weave a story.",
      "In Gram Yatra, Husain used vibrant, earthy tones to bring the frames to life, depicting women in everyday scenes, such as cooking, caring for children and riding a cart.",
      "In one of the frames, a farmer extends his arm, as if holding the land in the adjoining frame - a nod to the farming roots of Indian society.",
      "\"If you're looking for a single artwork that defines modern South Asian art, this is it,\" said Nishad Avari, head of South Asian Modern and Contemporary Art at Christie's.",
      "The painting, he added, also showed how Husain was influenced by his foreign travels, notably his 1952 trip to China, which introduced him to the calligraphic brushwork of artists like Xu Beihong - traces of which can be seen in the painting's expressive strokes.",
      "In the years following India's independence, he sought inspiration not in Paris or New York, but in India's villages, mirroring Mahatma Gandhi's belief that the heart of the nation lay in its rural roots.",
      "According to Husain's biographer Akhilesh (who uses only one name), the painter's deep engagement with India's cultural fabric helped shape how the country saw itself - \"how people live, what they like and what they think\".",
      "The painting also shows the early signs of Husain's modified cubist style - where geometric shapes and bold lines stood out in his works.",
      "The painting's journey from Delhi to Oslo adds to its mystique.",
      "It was purchased in 1954 for just $295 by Ukrainian doctor Leon Elias Volodarsky, who was in India on a World Health Organization (WHO) mission.",
      "After he took it to Norway, the piece adorned the walls of Oslo University Hospital for nearly half a century, largely unnoticed by the art world.",
      "It stayed that way for several decades until auction house Christie's was alerted to it in 2013 - two years after Husain's death - leading to its global exhibitions before this record-smashing sale.",
      "Ashish Anand, CEO of DAG (formerly the Delhi Art Gallery), believes this will elevate the value of Husain's entire body of work and \"lead to Indian art being viewed beyond just its aesthetic value to a tangible and serious financial asset\".",

      "It pointed to a \"concerning trend\" that between 1994 and 2024, artists have begun to tour in fewer locations in the UK and have focused increasingly on a small group of cities.",
      "Mark Davyd, CEO of Music Venue Trust, said: \"It's vitally important to get more artists out to more great venues in under-serviced towns and cities.",

      "\"It's very exciting to see AJ Tracey come to town as part of this tour, and I have massive respect for him, going out and playing so many grassroots spaces as opposed to the usual cities and venues,\" he said.",
      "\"Hopefully, this helps pave the way for other artists to be more adventurous when planning shows and widening both their own and the venues' audiences.",

    "story": [
      "Acclaimed author Sir Salman Rushdie is set to release his first work of fiction in nearly three years, following a stabbing that left him blind in one eye in 2022.",
      "The Eleventh Hour will consist of a collection of stories from around the world, set across India, England and the US.",
      "The work will be published by Vintage, part of Penguin Random House, on 4 November - more than three years after he was stabbed while on stage by an assailant who was convicted last month of attempted murder and assault.",
      "\"Salman Rushdie's new fiction moves between the places he has grown up in, inhabited, explored, and left,\" the publisher said.",
      "According to Penguin Random House, the book depicts the story of \"two quarrelsome old men in Chennai, India, who experience private tragedy against the backdrop of national calamity\".",
      "For readers familiar with Sir Salman's Midnight's Children, for which he won the Booker Prize, this upcoming work revisits the Bombay neighbourhood of that book, where \"a magical musician is unhappily married to a multibillionaire\".",
      "Sir Salman said the book is made up of three novellas - short stories - all of which were written in the last 12 months.",
      "The stories explore themes and places present in his mind, the author added, highlighting \"mortality, Bombay, farewells, England (especially Cambridge), anger, peace, America, and Goya and Kafka and Bosch\".",
      "News of his latest work comes a year after Sir Salman released an autobiographical account of what happened when he was stabbed on stage during an event at the Chautauqua Institution.",
      "Knife: Meditations After An Attempted Murder explored Sir Salman's account of the attack, when he was stabbed more than a dozen times by Hadi Matar, 27.",
      "As well as vision loss in one eye, the attack in August 2022 left Sir Salman with other severe injuries, including damage to his liver and a paralysed hand caused by nerve damage to his arm.",
      "In February, Matar was found guilty of his attempted murder and assault and now faces a sentence of more than 30 years in prison.",
      "Sir Salman testified during the trial. Recalling the incident, he said he was struck by the assailant's eyes, \"which were dark and seemed very ferocious\".",
      "He initially thought he had been punched, before realising he had been stabbed.",
      "The 77-year-old previously spent several years in hiding after the 1988 publication of The Satanic Verses - a fictional story inspired by the life of the Muslim Prophet Muhammad - triggered threats against his life.",
      "The surrealist, post-modern novel sparked outrage among some Muslims, who considered its content to be blasphemous - insulting to a religion or god - and was banned in some countries.",
      "A year after the book's release, Iran's Supreme Leader Ayatollah Khomeini called for Sir Salman's execution. He offered a $3m (\u00a32.5m) reward in a fatwa - a legal decree issued by an Islamic religious leader.",

    "published": "Fri, 28 Mar 2025 17:04:53 GMT",
    "summary": "The BBC correspondent was deported from Turkey this week after covering ongoing mass protests in the country.",
    "story": [
      "I had just sent my family a message saying how happy I was to be back in Turkey, where I used to live, and how it felt like coming home. Then, the phone in my hotel room rang.",
      "\"We have an urgent matter to discuss in person,\" the receptionist said. \"Could you come down?\"",
      "I arrived to find three plain-clothes policemen waiting for me. They asked me for my passport and led me away, trying to prevent my colleagues from filming.",
      "I had been in Istanbul for three days by then, covering the anti-government protests sparked by the arrest of the city's mayor, Ekrem Imamoglu.",
      "I was taken first to the police headquarters and held for seven hours. Two colleagues were allowed to be present and lawyers could come in to talk. The atmosphere was generally cordial. Some of the police officers told me they didn't agree with what they said was a state decision. One hugged me and said he hoped for my freedom.",
      "At 9.30pm, I was moved to the foreigners' custody unit of the Istanbul police. There, the atmosphere hardened from a succession of chain-smoking officers, with whom I had to negotiate in my broken Turkish. I was fingerprinted and denied access to lawyers or any contact with the outside world.",
      "In the early hours of Thursday, I was presented with papers to say I was being deported for being \"a threat to public order\". When I asked for an explanation, they said it was a government decision.",
      "One police officer suggested he film me saying that I was leaving Turkey of my own accord, which could help me to return in the future and which he could show his bosses. I politely refused, suspecting it would be given to the government-controlled media to push their version of events.",
      "By 2.30am, I was being moved to a final location \u2013 the foreigners' custody department at the airport. I was put in a room with a few rows of hard chairs and told I could sleep there. Between police officers entering to brush their teeth, planes taking off and the morning call to prayer, no sleep came.",
      "Seventeen hours after my initial detention, I was driven to a waiting plane to board a one-way flight to London. That night, after the case was made public, sparking significant media coverage around the world, the Turkish government press office released a statement saying I had lacked the correct accreditation. At no point had they mentioned this during my detention and it seemed clear that it was an afterthought on their part to attempt to justify my case.",
      "I was never mistreated at any point during the ordeal. And I knew throughout that BBC management and the British Consulate in Istanbul were working hard to secure my release.",
      "So many others who have fallen foul of the Turkish authorities do not have such a safety net. When I lived there as the BBC Istanbul correspondent between 2014 and 2019, Turkey was the world's biggest jailer of journalists. The watchdog Reporters Without Borders ranks Turkey 158th of 180 countries in the Press Freedom Index. Since these latest protests began, eleven journalists are among the two thousand or so people who have been detained.",
      "The latest unrest was sparked by the arrest of Ekrem Imamoglu, Recep Tayyip Erdogan's main political rival, whom opinion polls suggest could unseat the President in an election.",
      "But they have grown into something much wider: a clamour for democracy in a country sliding further into authoritarianism. The clampdown on the media is central to that trajectory, as the government has progressively crushed criticism or debate. I caught a glimpse of that first hand. It ended for me with sadness and sleeplessness. For others, it's been so much worse.",
      "Meanwhile, President Erdogan is digging in, dismissing the protests as \"street terrorism\". He's emboldened by the current international climate of having an ally in the White House and of Turkey's importance to everything from Ukraine to Syria.",
      "The question now is whether the country's biggest demonstrations in over a decade can sustain momentum or whether Turkey's long-time leader can simply brush this off. Those out on the street may be chanting \"enough\" \u2013 but they also know never to write off Recep Tayyip Erdogan.",

    "published": "Wed, 26 Mar 2025 00:11:26 GMT",
    "summary": "The TV couple are opening up their home and their lives in a new reality series for BBC One.",
    "story": [
      "We might feel like we know Stacey Solomon and Joe Swash already. We have seen them live off rice and beans in the Australian rainforest in I'm a Celebrity\u2026 Get Me Out of Here! We have watched Joe learn to ice skate in Dancing on Ice and Stacey declutter homes in Sort Your Life Out.",
      "But now the couple are going one step further and allowing viewers inside Pickle Cottage, their family home in Essex, in a new reality series for BBC One.",
      "It is a fly-on-the-wall series - and Stacey says she only realised in the thick of the filming that viewers can see everything, \"and then you panic a bit\", she tells the BBC.",
      "But ultimately, they are just a normal family \"doing our best in every aspect of our lives\", she says.",
      "\"So in the end, you sort of relax with that, and you think, 'Oh well, so they saw us get the hump with each other, or they saw us do something wrong'.",
      "\"That is probably the best thing we could show the world, because everything isn't perfect.\"",
      "There was no point in doing a reality show, says Joe, if they were not going to be honest.",
      "\"We don't want to glamourise anything,\" says Joe. \"Our biggest discussions at the beginning of this were, 'how much are people going to want to watch us take the kids to school and change nappies?' Our lives are not that exciting.\"",
      "Joe, 43, a former EastEnders actor, and Stacey, 35, a former X Factor contestant, met on the set of I'm a Celebrity in 2010 and have been in a relationship since 2016.",
      "They married in 2022 and are raising five children - Zach, Leighton, Rex, Rose and Belle - aged between 17 and two, alongside two dogs and four ducks.",
      "\"When I met Joe, my older children [Zach and Leighton] were four and seven,\" says Stacey, \"so they were little.\"",
      "When people say it is nice to see a blended family, she says she forgets that is what they are. \"To be honest, we're just a family.\"",
      "Joe says he struggles sometimes with the words - blended family, stepdad and stepsons.",
      "\"I love [Zach and Leighton] as much as I love all my other kids,\" he says. \"There's no distinction.\"",
      "When it comes to childcare, the couple do not have a nanny or au pair, but they do have a very supportive family.",
      "\"We've got Dave - my dad - and my sister,\" says Stacey. \"And I always say this, we live like a Kibbutz. We basically all chip in with each other.\"",
      "As well as juggling family and work, viewers will get to see all aspects of Stacey and Joe's lives, which, like any relationship, can include the odd disagreement.",
      "\"We want to show that we love each other, but sometimes we kill each other,\" says Joe. \"It's all part of it, and other couples do the same, so they'll relate to that.\"",
      "Stacey says she found being able to watch back and reflect on a situation quite helpful as she could see it from an outsider's point of view, which she believes is healthy for a relationship.",
      "Viewers will also get to see the love and support Stacey and Joe give each other. Joe describes Stacey as extremely loyal, like a \"mother lion\".",
      "\"Don't go near her cubs, she'll have you,\" he says.",
      "\"She's just the most wonderful person,\" he says. \"She's kind, she's loving. I mean there's nothing about Stacey I would change. People love her in the streets and, imagine me, I'm so lucky, I get to spend the rest of my life with her.\"",
      "Joe has the ability to give everyone a bit of himself, says Stacey, which is \"so magic\" and he has the most incredible amount of empathy, she says.",
      "Their parenting styles, on the other hand, are \"polar opposite\" she says.",
      "\"I'm aware that Stacey takes a lot of the brunt because I let [the children] do something and she's the one that has to say, 'No, you can't do that',\" says Joe. \"So she has to play bad cop quite a lot of the time, which I am aware of, but I just don't know any other way.\"",
      "Stacey believes this stems from the fact that Joe lost his father when he was very young.",
      "\"I think that when that happens to you in your life, obviously you just want to be\u2026 fun, happy. You don't want to create any negative memories,\" she says.",
      "For their family, having young children and teenagers growing up together has created something really magical.",
      "Stacey says the teenage boys can revert to being younger again which is important because they grow up so quickly in the modern world. They have the chance to still play, with the excuse being \"oh, I'm only doing it because it's with my little brother or little sister\", she says.",
      "It also gives the older boys a massive sense of responsibility, she adds.",
      "Raising five children requires military-style organisation, says Stacey, something she learnt after having her first son at the age of 17.",
      "\"I, quite frankly, was probably the most scatty teenager you've ever known,\" says Stacey. \"When I had Zachary, I had this one whole life that I was responsible for, and so many things that I had to do that I'd never had to consider.\"",
      "She says she would get a giro - a welfare cheque - to cash in at a certain time on a Thursday at the Post Office, and she realised she could not be late as she needed the money for groceries.",
      "Stacey relied on Zach and \"asked a lot of him\", she says, needing him to help her.",
      "\"I haven't done that with the younger ones, because I've had Joe,\" she says, \"and that's just the reality of my situation. It's been different through the years.\"",
      "But Zach, now 17 himself, is \"probably one of the most empathetic, caring, emotionally intelligent young teenagers that I know,\" says Stacey.",
      "\"I feel like that has a lot to do with how we grew up together, and how life was for us in the beginning.\"",
      "Having more children is not currently on Stacey's radar, she says, as her body is still recovering from having three children in five years.",
      "\"My pelvic floor is dying,\" she laughs. Although Joe would love to have more.",
      "Stacey still has plans to increase their brood - but this time it is their animals.",
      "\"I literally walked into a conversation the other day and I heard 'cow',\" says Joe, \"and I was like, 'No way, we can't have a cow'.\"",
      "\"We were just throwing a few ideas around,\" says Stacey. \"I would love to have animals and make our own milk and collect our own eggs and grow our own vegetables.",
      "\"That's a dream of mine - but in the future. At the moment, we're still rearing children.\"",
      "Stacey & Joe starts on Tuesday 1 April at 20:00 BST on BBC One and BBC iPlayer."

    "link": "https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cdxq309kexeo",
    "published": "Wed, 26 Mar 2025 12:33:21 GMT",
    "summary": "NewJeans talk to the BBC in their first interview since a court blocked their attempt to leave their record label.",
    "story": [
      "\"It took a huge amount of courage to speak out,\" NewJeans have told the BBC in their first interview since a court blocked their attempt to leave their record label, in a case that has rocked the K-pop industry.",
      "\"This fight is necessary. Although it will be extremely difficult and arduous, we will keep doing what we have done so far and speak up,\" said Haerin, one of the members of the five-piece.",
      "\"We thought it was important to tell the world about what we've been through. All the choices we've made so far have been the best choices we could have made.\"",
      "NewJeans looked invincible in the charts when they launched what was an unusual rebellion in the high-pressure, tightly-controlled world of K-pop. Hanni, Hyein, Haerin, Danielle and Minji stunned South Korea and fans everywhere with their decision in November to split from Ador, the label that launched them.",
      "They alleged mistreatment, workplace harassment and an attempt to \"undermine their careers\", which Ador denies. It sued to enforce their seven-year contract, which is set to expire in 2029, and sought an injunction against any commercial activities by the group.",
      "On Friday, a South Korean court granted it, ordering NewJeans to stop all \"independent\" activities, including song releases and advertising deals, while the case was still under way. NewJeans has since challenged the injunction in court.",
      "Friday's ruling was a \"shock\", the group told the BBC.",
      "\"Some people think that we're famous enough to do whatever we want and say whatever we please. But the truth is, it's not like that at all,\" Hyein said. \"We held it in for a long time, and only now have we finally spoken up about what we think, what we feel and the unfairness we've experienced.\"",
      "The K-pop industry has repeatedly come under fire for the pressure it puts on its stars not only to perform and succeed, but to appear perfect. But rarely do conflicts spill into the public, exposing stars' grievances and rifts with their labels.",
      "NewJeans' dramatic announcement last year followed a long and public spat with Ador and its parent company, Hybe - South Korea's biggest music label, whose client list includes K-pop royalty such as BTS and Seventeen.",
      "Ador told the BBC in a statement that the contract with NewJeans still stands, adding that \"most of their claims have risen from misunderstandings\". The court said that NewJeans did not \"sufficiently prove\" that Ador had violated the contract, adding that the label had upheld \"most of its duties, including payment\".",
      "The girls were rehearsing for a performance in Hong Kong, when news of the ruling dropped. They found out when Minji got a worried message from her mother: \"She asked me, 'are you okay?' And I was like 'what happened?'\"",
      "\"I was stunned,\" Minji says. So were the others when she told them. \"At first I thought I didn't hear her properly,\" Danielle says. \"We were all kind of in shock.\"",
      "This was their second of two interviews with the BBC in as many weeks. In the first interview, which happened before the ruling, the group had been excited to release their new single, Pit Stop - their first since they announced their break from Ador and renamed themselves NJZ.",
      "They spoke about how they coped with a difficult period, including finding comfort in cooking. \"I'm not really good at it but it's kind of healing,\" Minji had said, before promising to cook an \"amazing dinner\" for the group.",
      "In the second interview, which was 24 hours after the ruling, they seemed disheartened and unsettled, less sure of what was to come. \"If we knew we were gonna go through this, maybe we would have chosen\u2026\" Hanni trailed off as she teared up.",
      "Seconds later, she continued: \"Even if we do everything we can and it doesn't work out the way we hope it does, then we'll just have to leave it to time. I'm sure time would figure it out for us.\"",
      "The following night, they took to the stage in Hong Kong and, despite the court order, performed Pit Stop under their new name. But the evening, which they had pitched to fans as a fresh start, ended in tears as they told the crowd they were going on a hiatus.",
      "\"It wasn't any easy decision to make,\" Hyein said on stage, as each of them took turns to address their fans. \"But at the moment for us, it's about protecting ourselves, so that we can come back stronger.\"",
      "Just three years into their debut, the future of the young stars - they are aged between 16 and 20 - is now in question.",
      "But they tell the BBC that this is not the end of the road for them as they \"find more ways\" forward. With the legal battle expected to last for months, if not years, Minji says that gives them time to plan what they want to do next.",
      "Ever since they debuted in July 2022, NewJeans have delivered remarkable success with each new release - OMG, Ditto, Super Shy, Attention. A year on, they were the eighth biggest-selling act in the world.",
      "Critics called them a \"game-changer\" as their uniquely playful blend of 1990s R&B and sugar-coated pop melodies broke through a K-pop market dominated by electronic beats. And their breezy dance moves stood out among super-synchronised videos.",
      "They were still on the rise when Min Hee-jin - Ador's former boss and their long-time mentor, who launched them - began trading accusations publicly with Hybe. The music label had created Ador, granting Min a minority shareholding and further stock options, before she was removed from her role last August.",
      "Hybe was now accusing her of plotting Ador's takeover and Min, in an emotional press conference, accused them of undermining NewJeans by launching another girl group with a similar style. The fight got uglier and Min left the company, alleging she was forced out.",
      "That's when NewJeans broke their silence - they demanded Min's return in two weeks in a livestream.",
      "They were not able to contact her for a while, Danielle told the BBC in the first interview: \"We didn't know what was happening and we didn't have a way to support her. That itself was a hard thing because she was always there for us and\u2026 in a way a person to look up to.\"",
      "Ador had said Min could not return as CEO, but could continue as an internal director and NewJeans' producer. When Min didn't return, NewJeans announced that they were leaving Ador and accused the label of not meeting other demands: an apology for alleged bullying and actions against what they claimed were controversial internal reports.",
      "Ador, which denies all these allegations, appears to blame Min for their dispute with NewJeans. \"The core of this issue lies in the label's ex-management providing distorted explanations to their artists, leading to misunderstandings. They can be fully addressed and resolved upon the members' return to the label,\" Ador told the BBC in a statement.",
      "In the months since, Hanni, a Vietnamese-Australian, testified in tears to South Korean lawmakers in an inquiry into workplace harassment. \"I came to the realisation that this wasn't just a feeling. I was honestly convinced that the company hated us,\" she told them, after describing several incidents where she said the group felt undermined and bullied.",
      "NewJeans' case was dismissed because the labour ministry said K-pop stars did not qualify as workers and were not entitled to the same rights.",
      "Then in December, NewJeans took another rare step by supporting fans who were calling for the impeachment of South Korea's disgraced president, Yoon Suk Yeol who had briefly imposed martial law - the group provided free food and drinks to fans who showed up at the huge protest rallies.",
      "With each round of publicity, there was also criticism, much of it involving their age. Some said they had \"crossed the line\", while others called them \"stupid and reckless,\" and even \"ungrateful\" for picking a fight with Ador. Others questioned if they were making their own decisions.",
      "Being young doesn't mean they should be taken less seriously, the group says. \"That's an easy way to devalue the fact that we are actually trying to do something,\" Hanni says. \"The decisions we've made in the past year have been decided through a very, very large amount of discussion between us.\"",
      "As the dispute has dragged on, the critics have got louder, dubbing the girls as troublemakers rather than game-changers. Following the ruling, which their critics welcomed, NewJeans say they have been \"very aware of the intense scrutiny and judgment\" ever since they held that press conference last year.",
      "\"There hasn't been a single moment when we've expressed our opinions without worry or tension,\"  Minji says. \"We've thought more than anyone else about how much responsibility each of our actions carries, and we're currently bearing that responsibility ourselves.\"",
      "It's not clear how long their hiatus will last. Ador says it hopes to meet the group soon to discuss the future, but NewJeans insist they don't feel protected enough to go back.",
      "Their lawsuit with Ador will return to the headlines next week when the hearings begin - and so will all five of them.",
      "The one thing that seems constant is their determination to get through this together.",
      "Two weeks ago, Hanni had said: \"We've always said to each other, if one person doesn't want to do it, then we're not going to do it. It has to be all all five of us that agrees to do it. That's how we've gotten here and that's how we are going to get to the end.\"",

    "summary": "The gang, managed from Thailand, produced 11 million pills in the West Midlands to be sold online.",
    "story": [
      "A gang leader who co-ordinated a \u00a34m fake Xanax drug-making operation in sheds and garages across the West Midlands has been jailed for eight years.",
      "Up to 11 million tablets were made in various locations in Tipton, Wednesbury and Wolverhampton and then sold on the dark web via cryptocurrency payments.",
      "The criminal enterprise, between 2018 and 2019, was run from a luxury villa in Thailand by Brian Pitts, 30, who is one of 10 being sentenced for their part in the operation.",
      "The fake tablets were shipped across the UK and to the USA, Wolverhampton Crown Court heard.",
      "Tests revealed the amount of the active ingredient Alprazalam in the fake tablets varied from none at all to twice the proper amount.",
      "Pitts, who had earlier pleaded guilty to six charges, including conspiracy to supply Class C drugs, was described by Judge John Butterfield as \"the beating heart of this enterprise\".",
      "He said the ringleader controlled every part of the drugs operation and was constantly involved in it.",
      "Pitts, of Beebee Road in Wednesbury, was arrested by police when he returned to the UK with his then-partner Katie Harlow, who was also part of the Thai end of the criminal operation, and Lee Lloyd.",
      "The Crown Prosecution Service (CPS) said they were all found with \"designer clothes and Rolex watches in their luggage\".",
      "The officers were able to seize Pitts' mobile phone, which prosecutors described as a \"goldmine of information\", showing his involvement at all levels of the operation.",
      "Four other members of the gang were jailed on Thursday, with five more due to be sentenced in the coming days.",
      "Harlow, 27, of Lane Street, Bilston, was sentenced to two years and one month, after she earlier admitted a charge of converting and transferring criminal property.",
      "Judge Butterfield said that while it appeared Pitts had taken some actions in her name, none of them were without her knowledge.",
      "Lee Lloyd, 48, of Shakespeare Road, Tipton, was sentenced to seven years and two months, after earlier admitting six charges, including conspiracy to supply Class C drugs.",
      "Judge Butterfield said he was \"plainly a trusted right hand man to Brian Pitts\" and took regular calls from him.",
      "Kyle Smith, 26, of Arundel Road, Willenhall, was jailed for four years. He had previously pleaded guilty to five charges, including conspiracy to supply Class C drugs.",
      "The court heard he had been involved in packaging, posting and record-keeping and had been \"in the middle of packaging pills\" when police visited him.",
      "Mark Bayley, 63, of Jeremy Road, Wolverhampton, was sentenced to six years and five months. He also previously pleaded guilty to five charges, including conspiracy to supply Class C drugs and possession with intent to supply Class B drugs.",
      "Police found a pill-making machine in operation at his address and he was described as having \"pre-existing expertise\".",
      "Judge Butterfield said it would be wrong to dismiss the enterprise as \"a minor cottage industry\" and that it was instead \"large scale, organised and determined\".",
      "The gang had initially come to light after an investigation was launched by Pfizer, the manufacturer of the genuine Xanax tablets, which are used to treat anxiety.",
      "'Could have fetched \u00a311m'",
      "The inquiry was then picked up by the Regional Organised Crime Unit, which discovered the gang had purchased legally four pill-making machines, enabling them to press more than 16,000 tablets an hour.",
      "While the gang made \u00a34m, the number of tablets they made could have fetched them more than \u00a311m, the court heard.",
      "The gang also purchased the powders needed to make the tablets from China and bought fake Xanax stamps.",
      "Illicit Alprazolam can contain other unknown and potentially harmful sedative drugs, and has been linked with a number of deaths in both the UK and US when mixed with other potent drugs.",
      "The UK Health Security Agency said there was evidence use was \"a growing problem, particularly among young people and young adults\".",
      "Cranstoun, a harm reduction charity in the Black Country, said counterfeit drugs were often \"much more potent and stronger than the drugs they are masquerading as\".",

      "\"We dedicated time, resource and expertise to ensure these illicit counterfeit activities were prevented in order to protect public health.\"",

    "story": [
      "An NHS trust criticised over the avoidable death of a newborn baby was paid \u00a32m for providing good maternity care, the BBC can reveal.",
      "A senior coroner ruled on Friday that University Hospitals of Morecambe Bay (UHMB) NHS trust contributed to Ida Lock's death and had failed to learn lessons from previous maternity failures.",
      "Despite this, the trust claimed it had met all 10 standards under an NHS scheme aimed at promoting safe treatment.",
      "Ida's mother Sarah Robinson said it was \"another kick in the teeth\" while her father Ryan Lock labelled it \"disgusting\". The trust, which has previously apologised for its failings in Ida's care, declined to comment about the NHS payment scheme.",
      "Senior coroner for Lancashire James Adeley concluded that Ida had died due to the gross failure of three midwives to provide basic medical care.",
      "Ida, who was born at the Royal Lancaster Infirmary (RLI) on 9 November 2019, died a week later after suffering a serious brain injury due to a lack of oxygen.",
      "Dr Adeley ruled her death had been caused by the midwives' failure to deliver the infant \"urgently when it was apparent she was in distress\" and contributed to by the lead midwife's \"wholly incompetent failure to provide basic neonatal resuscitation\".",
      "He said eight opportunities had been missed \"to alter Ida's clinical course\".",
      "Her five-week inquest at Preston County Hall heard that many of the issues identified in a 2015 independent review of UHMB's maternity services were still evident in November 2019.",
      "The RLI is run by the UHMB trust.",
      "'Critical inspection'",
      "Under the Maternity Incentive Scheme run by NHS Resolution, the health service's insurance arm, maternity departments in England are encouraged to provide good care by meeting 10 safety standards, including properly investigating deaths and listening to parents' concerns.",
      "Trusts which certify they have met these standards receive a rebate on their insurance premiums, in addition to a share of money paid by NHS trusts which do not.",
      "In the five years that the scheme has been running, UHMB said it had met the 10 standards four times.",
      "In 2018, the first year of the programme, the trust's self-certification led to it being paid \u00a31,288,241.",
      "In 2019, the year of Ida's death, it received \u00a3734,112 after again claiming to have hit all of the criteria.",
      "The UHMB trust also claimed a perfect 10-out-of-10 record in 2020 but their submission was reviewed by NHS Resolution following a critical inspection of maternity services by the Care Quality Commission.",
      "The regulator's report rated maternity services as \"inadequate\", with UHMB's score downgraded to three out of 10.",
      "Consequently, UHMB was not given any money that year by NHS Resolution, and the trust was made to repay most of the amount it had received in 2019.",
      "'Painting a false picture'",
      "When told about the payments scheme and how the trust had benefitted from it, Mr Lock said it was \"disgusting\".",
      "He said: \"It's painting a false picture so they can receive money.\"",
      "A former maternity risk manager at the trust, Rox-Anne Hetherington, said Morecambe Bay's actions were in keeping with her experience.",
      "\"I can, hand-on-heart, say that it wasn't a case of 'What have we done to [make things better]?'",
      "\"It was a case of 'What are we going to say we've done?'\"",
      "Dr Bill Kirkup, whose 2015 inquiry exposed widespread failings in maternity care, including the preventable deaths of 11 babies and a mother at the trust's Furness General Hospital in Cumbria, also said he wasn't surprised.",
      "\"Some trusts put a lot of effort into how they can present the best picture of themselves, and much less effort into whether they're actually making improvements underneath,\" he said.",
      "'Not fully compliant'",
      "UHMB's claims are in line with other struggling trusts which have also made similar erroneous submissions under the Maternity Incentive Scheme.",
      "The Shrewsbury and Telford NHS trust was forced to repay almost \u00a31m after it similarly claimed to have met all of the safety standards.",
      "A review of its maternity care, published in 2022, found more than 200 babies and mothers could have survived with proper care.",
      "The East Kent University Hospitals trust, where an inquiry found at least 45 babies could have survived, was also forced to repay \u00a32m after falsely claiming it had met the safety criteria.",
      "In a statement, NHS Resolution said \"University Hospitals of Morecambe Bay NHS trust initially self-reported full compliance with the Maternity Incentive Scheme in years 1, 2, 3 and 5.",
      "\"However subsequent NHS Resolution reviews of the Trust's evidence for years 2 and 3 following the publication of their CQC report demonstrated that they were not fully compliant for those years.",
      "\"The Trust was required to repay any funds for those years. The previously granted rebate was returned to NHS Resolution and was redistributed to all compliant Trusts.\"",

      "New claimants will also see this top-up fall from \u00a397 extra per week in 2025-26 to \u00a350 a week by 2026-27, before being frozen until the end of 2029-30.",

      "The work capability assessment, which checks eligibility for the health related top-up to universal credit, will be scrapped by 2028.",
      "Instead, claimants will have to go through the Pip system to claim for a health benefit. The government says they will be assessed on how their disability affects their daily life, rather than on their capacity to work.",
      "While you can receive universal credit or Pip while in employment, universal credit is means-tested and tapers off as earnings increase, while Pip is not affected by how much someone works or their level of savings.",
      "A new \"right to try\" system will mean people will not be financially penalised if they take a job which doesn't work out.",
      "The government will also consult on merging employment and support allowance and jobseeker's allowance into a single time-limited benefit that is not means-tested. This would be more generous but available for a shorter period.",

      "Why does the government want to cut welfare spending?",
      "Overall, the government currently spends \u00a365bn a year on health and disability-related benefits. Before the government announced the Pip and UC changes, this was projected to increase to \u00a3100bn by 2029.",
      "Pip is the second-largest element of the working-age welfare bill, with spending due to almost double to \u00a334bn by 2029-30.",
      "When Pip was introduced in 2013, the aim was to save \u00a31.4bn a year by reducing the number of people eligible for payments. However, initial savings were modest and the number of claimants has risen.",
      "About 1.3m people now claim disability benefits primarily for mental health or behavioural conditions.",
      "That is 44% of all working age claimants, according to the independent economic think-tank, the Institute for Fiscal Studies (IFS).",
      "The OBR now predicts welfare spending on working-age adults will be \u00a372.3bn by 2029-2030. Spending on pensioners and children is expected to be \u00a325.4bn.",
      "How big is the welfare budget and where might cuts fall?",

      "How many people are unemployed?",
      "According to the latest figures from the Office for National Statistics (ONS), 4.4% of people were unemployed in the period between October and December 2024, external, which is about 1.6 million people.",
      "While this figure has risen over the past two years, unemployment remains relatively low by historical standards.",
      "However, unemployed people represent only a small part of the nearly 11 million working-age people who don't have a paid job.",
      "About 9.4 million of them are not called \"unemployed\". That is because they are not actively looking for work, or available to start a job.",
      "Instead people in this group are called \"economically inactive\", external.",
      "But 1.6 million of that group - in addition to the unemployed - do say they want a job.",

      "It varies according to age.",

      "Before Covid, the UK's \"inactivity rate\" was the second lowest in the G7 club of leading economies, behind Japan.",

      "He has just had an ultrasound scan at an NHS centre which sits between familiar High Street names. It is easy-to-reach healthcare - as convenient as popping out to the shops.",
      "This is part of the government's vision for the future of the NHS, soon to be set out in a 10-year plan. In England, ministers have already promised three big changes: shifting more services from hospitals into the community, focusing on preventing ill-health and making more use of new technology.",
      "BBC Panorama spent months in South Yorkshire meeting people already changing how they work, to see what it will take to fix a health service which is buckling under increasing demand.",
      "The NHS also has to cut waiting times, money is tight and the organisation which currently runs it, NHS England, is being scrapped to reduce bureaucracy.",
      "There is another deep-rooted problem - a care system, supporting older and disabled people in the community, that is understaffed, underfunded and in crisis.",
      "Government critics say you cannot reform the NHS unless you reform social care, because it helps get people out of hospital more quickly and prevents some being admitted in the first place.",
      "An independent commission will begin looking at social care reform next month. There will be an interim report, but the final report is not due until 2028.",
      "Challenged on whether you can reform the NHS without changing social care, Health and Social Care Secretary, Wes Streeting tells Panorama that he doesn't need to wait for a review and plans to divert more NHS money into social care.",
      "\"I want to spend more of our resources through social care, because it delivers better outcomes for patients and better value for taxpayers,\" he says.",
      "Streeting would not be drawn on how much money would be involved, but said details about spending on social care would be in the 10-year NHS plan.",
      "Most care is paid for by councils, or by the people who need it. It can end up costing some families tens of thousands of pounds. Only those with the very highest needs get help from the NHS.",
      "Future of the NHS",
      "At Barnsley Hospital it used to take about six weeks to get a non-urgent scan, but at the town's NHS centre next to the shops most people are seen in two weeks.",
      "The centre's new scanners and X-ray machines have increased the number of patients staff can see and freed up the hospital so it can concentrate on emergencies and inpatients.",
      "Phil had skin cancer removed four weeks ago from his chin and the consultant wanted to check a couple of pea-sized lumps in his stomach. The scan results will be sent to his GP.",
      "\"It's about peace of mind. You're not waiting for appointments,\" he says.",
      "Liz Elfleet, medical imaging manager at Barnsley Hospital NHS Foundation Trust who helped set up the unit, describes this as the future of the NHS.",
      "\"We've seen around a 50% reduction in patients not attending for appointments,\" and the number of women accepting an invitation to have a routine breast screening appointment has risen \"from 43% to just under 80% over the three years,\" she says.",
      "The centre, which offers a range of health checks and scans, was opened in 2022 under the last Conservative government. The current Labour government says many more services will now move out of hospital into the community.",
      "In Barnsley, that is already happening. Part of another shopping centre is being converted into a second, large health hub. The project will be funded by the local council, regional mayor and a government grant.",
      "The leader of Labour-run Barnsley Council, Sir Steve Houghton, says the scanning centre has shown NHS facilities can boost town centres, and they estimate people spend about \u00a317 on average in local businesses when they visit.",
      "Preventing ill-health",
      "The second big shift the NHS is being asked to make is to focus more on preventing ill-health. In Sheffield, a GP practice has already begun to do this, to help them manage a workload which they say had become overwhelming.",
      "Five years ago, Steel City General Practice analysed the data for 10,000 of their patients who needed the most help. \"So we then said, let's actually proactively bring them in. They haven't contacted us - we've contacted them,\" says Dr Krishna Kasaraneni.",
      "GP appointments usually take about 10 minutes, but the Steel City practice gave these patients longer appointments to try to pick up problems earlier. They also took a risk and didn't chase a national target to see all patients within two weeks.",
      "Dr Kasaraneni says it has paid off. \"The numbers of strokes have dropped over that five-year period. Coronary heart disease numbers have dropped,\" he says. It has helped the doctors manage their workload better.",
      "The improved health of the patients has freed up some appointments, and on average people don't wait longer to see someone, but the growing older population means they are still very busy.",
      "While GPs will be crucial to the government's 10-year plan, there are not enough of them. Taking into account those working part-time, the equivalent number of fully qualified, full-time GPs is lower now than it was a decade ago - despite a rising population.",
      "Better use of technology",
      "The third of the big NHS changes is better use of new technology. At Sheffield's Royal Hallamshire Hospital, they are using AI to speed up the comparison of heart scans.",
      "Before, a radiographer would take about half an hour to manually plot different points around a 3D image of the heart and identify any changes from a scan carried out six months earlier. Now AI tackles it in just a couple of minutes.",
      "Prof Andy Swift, who developed the AI tool with colleagues from the hospital and Sheffield University, says it has been used on 10,000 cases in the past few years. He says it is saving about 30 minutes each time.",
      "\"In the time that we've saved, we've managed to scan more patients and also do more reports for patients,\" he says.",
      "Despite these innovations, change on the scale the government promises is difficult in an NHS struggling to cope with growing demand.",
      "Solving the problems of the NHS also requires tackling the difficulties of social care, which supports around a million older and disabled people in the community.",
      "In February, NHS England figures showed around 14,000 people could not leave hospital, partly because of a lack of home and residential care. More social care can also reduce falls and illnesses.",
      "'We keep pressure off NHS'",
      "The family of Martin - who is 41 and is autistic, with cerebral palsy and epilepsy - say Sheffield care worker Darren Leigh has become like a brother to him over 20 years. Darren knows when Martin is unwell and can quickly get the right help.",
      "\"We keep pressure off the NHS a lot of the time,\" he says. \"There are [also] people in hospital that need to come out but can't because they can't get the care they need.\"",
      "The care system has struggled with underfunding, staff shortages and increasing demand for years. Like many care firms, the not-for-profit company Darren works for says it is \"on a bit of a knife-edge\" as the government is also increasing the costs of employing people. Employer's National Insurance and the National Minimum Wage will go up in April.",
      "The government says it will give councils in England nearly \u00a3900m more for adult and children's social care over the next year. Across the UK, there will be increased support for family carers and a fair pay agreement for staff is being introduced.",
      "Speaking to Panorama, Streeting says social care has a \"big part to play in terms of shifting care out of hospital into the community\". He adds: \"I'm convinced that we can spend NHS resources more effectively through social care.\"",
      "The main opposition parties in England agree social care needs to be reformed.",
      "But the Conservatives say the government has no real plan.",
      "The Liberal Democrats say the NHS cannot be fixed without fixing social care. Reform UK wants to simplify social care through a single funding stream.",
      "And the Green Party is calling for free social care.",
      "There are also questions over whether the NHS has the money to make all the changes the government is promising.",
      "It had a budget of \u00a3171bn in the financial year 2023-2024. It was also given an additional \u00a321bn over two years. NHS Providers, representing trusts across England, says most of that money has been eaten up by everyday pressures including wage rises, inflation and drug price increases.",
      "It warns these competing pressures make the change needed more difficult.",
      "The health and social care secretary agrees that it will not be easy, but says he cannot \"keep on pouring ever-increasing amounts of taxpayers' money into a system that is not set up to deliver best use of that money and best care for patients\"."

    "summary": "An inquest into the death of Ida Lock has shone light on repeat mistakes - and wider failures in certain hospitals across England",
    "story": [
      "Listen to Michael read this article",
      "By the entrance to Furness General Hospital in Barrow-in-Furness sits a sculpture of a moon with 11 stars. It is a memorial to the mother and babies who died unnecessarily due to poor care at the hospital between 2004 and 2013.",
      "Inscribed underneath is a short verse: \"Forever in our hearts; Forever held in the love that brought you here; Our star in the night sky, spring blossom, summer rose, falling leaf, winter frost; Forever in our hearts.\"",
      "When the memorial was unveiled in 2019, Aaron Cummins who is chief executive at University Hospitals of Morecambe Bay NHS Trust, which runs the hospital, said: \"We will never forget what happened.  We owe it to those who died to continually improve in everything that we do.\"",
      "Barely a month later, Sarah Robinson stepped into a birthing pool at the Royal Lancaster Infirmary, a hospital run by the same NHS trust. She was about to give birth to her second child.",
      "Within an hour, Ida Lock was born; within a week, she was dead.",
      "What her parents were put through on that day \u2013 and in the years since \u2013 goes a long way to explaining why maternity services in England have failed so many families.",
      "The inquest into Ida Lock's death, which concluded last week, exposed over five weeks why maternity services across England have long struggled to improve - and this one case holds a mirror to issues that appear to be prevalent across a number of trusts.",
      "'I thought I'd done something wrong'",
      "The memorial the trust erected at Furness General Hospital followed a damning inquiry into the trust's maternity services.",
      "That investigation, carried out by Dr Bill Kirkup and published in March 2015, found there had been a dysfunctional culture at Furness General, substandard clinical skills, poor risk assessments and a grossly deficient response to adverse incidents with a repeated failure to properly investigate cases and learn lessons.",
      "Morecambe Bay became a byword for poor maternity care and the trust promised to enact all 18 recommendations from the Kirkup review. And yet that never happened.",
      "\"We wouldn't be in this situation now if they'd followed those recommendations,\" says Ms Robinson.",
      "Ida Lock's inquest began last month, more than five years after she died - the delay was down to several reasons, including its particular complexity.",
      "What emerged was just how profoundly many of those lessons had not been learned. Particularly egregious, says Ms Robinson, was a suggestion from a midwife \u2013 shortly after the birth - that Ida's poor condition was linked to her smoking, something Sarah had never done in her life.",
      "\"The amount of days I cried because I thought I'd done something wrong... every Christmas, every holiday, you always have this heavy weight that you shouldn't be having fun. And all along, some people knew.\"",
      "Meanwhile, the staff who had delivered Ida were told in an email that \"they had demonstrated excellent teamwork, and had all worked in the best interests of mum and baby\".",
      "As the coroner found on Friday, Ida's death was wholly avoidable, caused by a failure to recognise that she was in distress prior to her birth, and then a botched resuscitation attempt after she was born.",
      "By the time she was transferred to a higher dependency unit, at the Royal Preston hospital, she had suffered a brain injury from which she could not recover.",
      "Having failed to deliver their daughter safely, Ida's parents would have expected that the trust would properly and openly investigate her death. Instead, they pursued an investigation that Carey Galbraith, the midwife who completed it, would later describe as \"not worth the paper it was written on\".",
      "They didn't take responsibility for their failings despite having an independent report from the Healthcare Safety Investigation Branch (HSIB) \u2013 a body that examined questionable maternity care \u2013 clearly stating their shortcomings.",
      "\"Our efforts to get any answers have been met with a complete block,\" said Ida's father, Ryan Lock. \"Particular people have told us to our face something that wasn't the case, that Ida was poorly before she was born, and that's the reason why that this happened.\"",
      "Clearly, the Morecambe Bay report was not, as was hoped, a line in the sand for maternity services across England, or a rallying cry for widespread improvements. As the inquest has shown, it did not even lead to sustained improvement at Morecambe Bay.",
      "Tabetha Darmon, chief nursing officer at the trust, said in a statement last week that it has made improvements since.",
      "\"We take the conclusions from the coroner very seriously and have made a number of the improvements identified during the inquest. We are carefully reviewing the learning identified to ensure that we do everything we can to prevent this from happening to another family.\"",
      "'A woeful picture' nationwide",
      "Elsewhere around the country, other trusts have also been forced to face their failures, often by grieving families.",
      "In March 2022, an investigation into services at the Shrewsbury and Telford NHS trust found that more than 200 mothers and babies could have survived with better care. Then, in October that year, a review into maternity services at East Kent Hospitals University NHS trust found that at least 45 babies might have survived if they had been given proper treatment.",
      "And an ongoing review into the maternity care provided by Nottingham University Hospitals NHS trust, due to be completed next year, is set to be the biggest yet, with around 2,500 cases being examined.",
      "Even that does not tell the full story. Families in several areas, including Sussex, Leeds and Oxford, want local investigations into their maternity services. And an annual review of units by inspectors the Care Quality Commission (CQC) paints a woeful picture.",
      "In the commission's latest report, published in September, not a single one of the 131 units inspected received the top rating, Outstanding, for providing safe care.",
      "About a third (35%) were rated as Good for safety, around half (47%) were rated as Requires Improvement while almost a fifth (18%) were deemed Inadequate, the lowest grading.",
      "\"While we identified pockets of excellent practice,\" wrote the CQC, \"we are concerned that too many women and babies are not receiving the high-quality maternity care they deserve.\"",
      "Professor James Walker, who used to be the clinical director for HSIB, said that from his visits around England, the problem was that maternity units \"didn't have the skills, the finances, or the drive to actually make the changes that are required.\"",
      "Ida Lock's inquest was a case in point. What emerged over the inquiry was that the midwife delivering Ida was not compliant with crucial training in heart-rate monitoring, that staff did not know how to investigate incidents or realise they should inform external regulators of an unexpected death.",
      "\"It's deeply distressing,\" says Dr Kirkup. \"It's bad enough that other trusts didn't listen, but for it to happen again in this same trust is unforgivable.\"",
      "From poor culture to lack of teamwork",
      "Listening to his exasperation brought me back to the autumn of 2022. On that bright morning, Dr Kirkup was speaking at the publication of his inquiry into maternity care in East Kent.",
      "Many of the failures he'd found there \u2013 poor culture, lack of teamworking, not listening to families, a failure to investigate incidents or learn from them \u2013 were a repetition of what he'd uncovered at Morecambe Bay seven years earlier.",
      "He struggled to hide his frustration that here he was again, forced once more to explain to families why they had been failed by a trust that did not know how to do the right thing.",
      "Like Morecambe Bay, East Kent deteriorated even after his 2022 inquiry. Within months of the publication, inspectors became so concerned about its services that they considered closing maternity care at one of its hospitals, the William Harvey in Ashford.",
      "The CQC found that staff were not carrying out basic tasks such as washing their hands in between patients, or wearing gloves and aprons when delivering care, and that they were leaving urine and bloodstains in toilets.",
      "The inspection highlighted how little the East Kent review had changed things where it mattered, front-line in the wards.",
      "As the report had said, \"there are deep-seated and longstanding problems of organisational culture\" in the trust's maternity units, including \"disgraceful behaviour and flawed teamworking that were previously left to fester\".",
      "In October 2024, the board of East Kent Hospitals Trust said that it apologised unreservedly for the pain and loss, and for the failures of the board.",
      "It said: \"We are on a journey to fundamentally transform the way we work. Changing the culture of a large and complex organisation takes time and there is much work still to do, but we are determined to succeed so that we are providing the right standard of care and compassion.\"",
      "Derek Richford, whose grandson Harry had died in avoidable circumstances in 2017 at East Kent, is now working with the trust to improve maternity care and argues that it is an uphill struggle. \"It's been a devil of a job,\" he claims, \"to get people in the trust to simply read the report, even the summary.\"",
      "Should medics be punished?",
      "The question asked by some families is why heads haven't rolled. There is a widespread recognition in healthcare that punishing medics for individual clinical errors does not necessarily lead to safer outcomes.",
      "It can in some cases promote a defensive culture, where people do not own up to their mistakes and lead to individuals being blamed rather than supported to improve.",
      "The day after the Shrewsbury maternity report was published, the then-Health Secretary Sajid Javid said his department would \"go after the people responsible.",
      "\"I want to make sure that we leave no stone unturned in finding the people that were responsible for this and making sure that they are held to account,\" he added.",
      "Three years later, there is no evidence of anybody being held to account.",
      "The Department of Health says it is \"unable to comment on individual staffing responsibility while an active police investigation is taking place\".",
      "\u00a31.15bn of maternity-related payouts",
      "Even when major reviews into maternity care have led to families getting individual feedback and told they had been failed, any subsequent legal action leads to NHS Resolution, the health service's insurance arm, requiring that the case is examined afresh. This can add further delays and costs to the process.",
      "NHS Resolution said that inquiries \"do not look at cases from a legal liability perspective. Failings by a clinician might amount to errors of judgement, but that is not necessarily sufficient to constitute negligence under the law\".",
      "Rise of vaccine distrust - why more of us are questioning jabs",
      "The NHS is spending a fortune giving people a death they don't want",
      "Labour's plan for benefits throws up a bigger dilemma",
      "In 2023-24, NHS Resolution paid out \u00a31.15bn for maternity-related deaths and injuries, 41% of its total payments, despite maternity care forming a much smaller proportion of a trust's daily activities.",
      "\"NHS resolution is this anonymous body,\" says Derek Richford, \"that you can't get a name of the person you want to speak to. You can't get any accountability. And those people are the puppeteers for the people below who have to run around doing their will. It's wrong.\"",
      "'The time for inquiries is over'",
      "There are now calls for the government to establish a national maternity inquiry, rather than relying on individual ones at different hospitals and trusts. More than 36,000 people have signed up to one such petition, led by two sets of bereaved parents; while campaign group Maternity Safety Alliance is making a similar call. So far, the Department of Health hasn't committed to a national inquiry.",
      "Both Dr Kirkup and Prof Walker argue that the time for inquiries is over.",
      "\"Another inquiry will find exactly the same things that we find at the moment,\" said Prof Walker, \"we know what the problems are.\"",
      "What is needed is a national plan to improve maternity care, argues Dr Kirkup. He says he has been working with the Department of Health on drawing up plans to improve teamworking and providing compassionate care.",
      "Streeting has said he will \"fix our maternity services\", including supporting trusts to make rapid improvements and training more midwives, but has not detailed how he intends to go about this. \"I just wish that the Secretary of State would announce his intentions,\" says Dr Kirkup.",
      "Prof Walker also believes that a national programme of improvement and oversight should be launched, taking the learning from individual investigations and ensuring it is embedded across the system. For it to be truly effective, he argues, it will require a specific type of leadership.",
      "\"The NHS traditionally doesn't appoint leaders,\" he says, \"it appoints managers, people who come in and take the status quo that's there, and just make sure that it gets more efficient. That doesn't make it better, or innovate or improve.",
      "\"One of my frustrations over the years, working in various places, is I kept being told 'we don't do that'. And I kept on saying, 'why don't we do that?' The simple questions are always the best ones, because they challenge the status quo.\"",
      "Prof Walker highlights that there has been some progress in recent years, however. The latest figures on Maternity and Newborn Safety Investigations (the successor body to HSIB) show that the number of incidents of both potential and severe brain injuries have decreased.",
      "Back in East Kent, Mr Richford has observed some changes too. \"We have a new board of directors that appear to be doing the right thing \u2013 they're certainly saying the right thing,\" he says.",
      "\"[But] even now, seven years on [from Harry's death], it's still not as it should be. We are still trying to make sure that the trust is being as transparent as they say they are.\"",
      "As for Ida Lock's parents, the road on which their daughter would have grown up leads directly to Morecambe Bay, and a small patch of sand. This is where they scattered some of her ashes. Now they refer to it as Ida's beach. When they pass by, with their two other children, they regularly blow her a kiss across the sand.",
      "Their fervent hope is that other couples do not experience a similar fate. But they know that long before them, other families also suffered - and they aren't confident that more won't in the future.",
      "\"Those families went through what we're going through now,\" says Sarah. \"But nothing came of it. You can't trust that [improvements] are ever going to happen.",
      "\"I hope something does change.\"",

      "The government has threatened to override the body advising judges in England and Wales in a row over how ethnic minority offenders should be sentenced, days before new rules are set to take effect.",
      "It comes after the Sentencing Council refused a request from Justice Secretary Shabana Mahmood for it to rethink new instructions for judges due to begin on Tuesday.",
      "Mahmood said the guidelines would lead to \"differential treatment\" of offenders by courts.",
      "Under the rules, which have prompted a \"two-tier\" justice row, judges will be expected to consider the lives of offenders from ethnic minority and other backgrounds before deciding on punishment.",
      "Downing Street said Sir Keir Starmer was \"disappointed\" the council had refused to change the guidance and \"all options\" were being considered in response, including passing legislation to block the changes.",
      "But shadow justice secretary Robert Jenrick, a vocal opponent of the new guidance, said the threat to legislate was \"too little too late\".",
      "\"From Tuesday, [Mahmood] will preside over a sentencing system she conceded is two-tier,\" he added.",
      "The row began earlier this month when the council, which advises judges and magistrates on prison terms and community punishments, issued new guidance on when a court should order a pre-sentence report into an offender's life.",
      "These reports contain information about an offender's background and are intended to help judges decide what sort of punishment is appropriate.",
      "The updated guidance says judges should normally request a pre-sentence report on offenders from an ethnic, cultural or faith minority, and other groups such as young adults under 25, women and pregnant women.",
      "The council argues its new guidance is intended to remedy a \"disparity in sentence outcomes\" between white and non-white offenders.",
      "But after the Conservatives argued it would lead to a \"two-tier\" approach to sentencing, Mahmood said she would ask for it to be changed.",
      "She also echoed that \"there will never be a two-tier sentencing approach under my watch\".",
      "Sentencing body defends changes after 'two-tier' row",
      "More funding for judges to tackle record court delays",
      "In correspondence published on Friday, council chair Lord Justice Davis said the council has decided the guidelines \"did not require revision\".",
      "He added the guidelines had been subject to a four-month consultation under the previous Conservative government and the \"overall response to the consultation was positive\".",
      "He said the council saw no reason to re-run the consultation, although it would now include \"clarification\" on the language in the guidelines to \"correct the widespread misunderstanding which has emerged in the last few weeks\".",
      "An \"explanatory statement\" would also be added to the council's website, he added.",
      "He added that although it was not for judges to introduce \"overarching policies to redress the imbalance\" in sentences, they must \"do all that they can to avoid a difference in outcome based on ethnicity\".",
      "\"The judge will be better equipped to do that if they have as much information as possible about the offender.",
      "\"The cohort of ethnic, cultural and faith minority groups may be a cohort about which judges and magistrates are less well informed.\""

      "Sir Keir Starmer's communications chief has resigned after nine months in Downing Street.",
      "Labour veteran Matthew Doyle, who worked for Tony Blair, was brought in as Sir Keir's communications director four years ago, when the party was in opposition.",
      "He is the second senior member of Sir Keir's team to leave less than a year after the general election, following Sue Gray walking out of the door as his chief of staff in the autumn.",
      "Mr Doyle's departure is expected to lead to the promotions of James Lyons to director of communications (strategy) and Steph Driver to director of communications (delivery).",
      "Sue Gray quits as Sir Keir Starmer's chief of staff",
      "Dodds exit shows unease over Starmer's tough decisions",
      "Mr Doyle's decision to quit and leave immediately has caused some surprise, but one special adviser said he \"had been increasingly detached for some time. It was clear that Lyons was actually in charge - and doing an excellent job to be fair\".",
      "The veteran spin doctor has more than a quarter of a century of experience with Labour, beginning as the head of press for the party in 1998, before a brief stint as an adviser to David Blunkett, then the work and pensions secretary.",
      "Moving into Blair's No 10 in 2005, Mr Doyle rose to become deputy head of communications, and carried on working for Blair after he left office for another five years.",
      "He spent a period working at the charity International Rescue with David Miliband, the former Blair-era foreign secretary, and set up his own consultancy.",
      "Mr Doyle joined Sir Keir Starmer's team in the summer of 2021, arguably the lowest point of his leadership, shortly after a humiliating defeat for Labour in a by-election in Hartlepool.",
      "An email from Mr Doyle to colleagues this morning, seen by the BBC, said \"it's time to pass the baton on\".",
      "He added: \"I wanted to let you know that I have informed the prime minister I am standing down as director of communications.",
      "\"When I started working for Keir four years ago, not many people thought we could win a general election and certainly not in the emphatic way we did.",
      "\"That was down to the hard work and determination of so many people and of course Keir's leadership.",
      "\"I am incredibly proud of the part I have played in returning our party to government and the change we are already bringing to the country. Now it's time to pass the baton on.\"",
      "'Away day'",
      "In a statement, Sir Keir said: \"Matthew brought his considerable experience to my team in summer 2021 and has worked tirelessly by my side every day since playing a leading role in Labour's historic election win.",
      "\"On a personal level it has been a real privilege to work with him and on behalf of the entire team I wish him all the very best for his next role.\"",
      "Special advisers from across government are gathering for an away day today, at which new arrangements for Labour's communications team will be discussed.",
      "Mr Doyle's role is expected to be split between Ms Driver, who is Downing Street's current deputy communications director, and Mr Lyons, a former political journalist and TikTok spinner who joined Number 10 last year.",
      "Ms Driver will focus on day-to-day interactions with journalists, with Mr Lyons' attention on managing the grid of forthcoming government announcements.",

    "summary": "The chancellor is on track to meet her own fiscal rules, so why is there talk of tax rises in the autumn?",
    "story": [
      "Chancellor Rachel Reeves has set out her plans for the UK economy in her Spring Statement and is on track to meet her self-imposed rules on the public finances, which she has said are \"non-negotiable\".",
      "On the face of it, that sounds like a good thing. So why are people saying that she may struggle to meet them and the only way she may do so is by raising taxes?",
      "It's a complicated picture, but there are essentially five steps to get from where we are now to tax rises.",
      "Not much spare money",
      "Ahead of the Spring Statement, the chancellor had been under pressure, with speculation over how she would be able to meet her self-imposed financial rules, one of which is to not borrow to fund day-to-day spending.",
      "In October, the government's official economic forecaster, the Office for Budget Responsibility (OBR), said that Reeves would be able to meet that rule with \u00a39.9bn to spare.",
      "An increase in government borrowing costs since then meant that that room to spare had disappeared. Now big welfare cuts and spending reductions in the Spring Statement have restored it.",
      "Almost \u00a310bn may sound like a lot, but it's a relatively small amount in an economy that spends \u00a31 trillion a year, and raises around the same in tax.",
      "In fact it is the third lowest margin a chancellor has left themselves since 2010. The average headroom over that time is three times bigger at \u00a330bn.",
      "Warning taxes could still rise despite welfare cuts",
      "Warning taxes could still rise despite welfare cuts",
      "\"It is a tiny fraction of the risks to the outlook,\" Richard Hughes from the OBR told the BBC.",
      "He said there were many factors that could \"wipe out\" the chancellor's headroom, including an escalating trade war, any small downgrade to growth forecasts or a rise in interest rates.",
      "Predicting the future is difficult",
      "Which brings us on to the precarious nature of making economic forecasts.",
      "\"All forecasts turn out to be wrong. Weather forecasts also turn out to be wrong,\" says Mr Hughes.",
      "Predicting what will happen in the future, especially in five years' time is hard, and is subject to revisions. You could be forgiven for not predicting a war or a pandemic, for instance.",
      "The respected think tank, the Institute for Fiscal Studies (IFS), has already said there is \"a good chance that economic and fiscal forecasts will deteriorate significantly between now and an Autumn Budget\".",
      "A case in point, only hours after Reeves delivered her statement in parliament, US President Donald Trump announced new 25% tariffs on cars and car parts coming into the US.",
      "Car tariffs a sign worse could come",
      "Reeves admitted the car tariffs would be \"bad for the UK\" but insisted the government was in \"extensive\" talks to avoid them being imposed here.",
      "According to the OBR, these import taxes would have a direct impact on goods totalling around 0.2% of GDP.",
      "Before Trump's announcement, the OBR had warned of the risk of an escalating trade war, and while the proposals do not exactly match the watchdog's worst-case scenario, which would see the UK retaliate, Hughes said it had elements of it.",
      "Although 0.2% is a tiny amount, nevertheless it will affect the economy.",
      "And in the OBR's worst-case scenario, 1% would be knocked off economic growth.",

      "Uncertainty can stop firms and people spending",
      "Trump's trade policies and the fact that nobody seems to know whether he will follow through with his threats, U-turn on them, or how he will react to others is just one way his presidency is making the world so uncertain at the moment.",
      "The war in Ukraine continues, despite Trump's pledge to end it.",
      "The UK, along with Germany, has said it will increase defence spending. Trump has long called for European members of Nato to spend more on defence, and there are also fears that if the US does make a deal with Russia to end the war, that could leave Europe vulnerable.",
      "Domestically, businesses are also facing a worrying time as they brace for a rise in costs in April as employers' National Insurance contributions, the National Living wage and business rates are all set to go up.",
      "Some firms have said they have put off investment decisions as a result, and many have warned of price rises or job cuts. If these materialise, then that will knock growth.",
      "Break the rules or raise taxes",
      "Given all of the above, if the chancellor's headroom were to disappear, why would that matter?",
      "Reeves has staked her reputation on meeting her fiscal rules, pledging to bring \"iron discipline\" and provide stability and reassurance to financial markets, in contrast to former Prime Minister Liz Truss, whose unfunded tax cuts spooked the markets and raised interest rates.",
      "So if she is still to meet her rules and not borrow to fund day-to-day spending, that would mean either more spending cuts or tax rises.",
      "The government has already announced big cuts to the welfare bill as well as plans to cut the civil service and abolish several quangos including NHS England.",
      "But as Paul Dale, chief UK economist at Capital Economics, puts it: \"Non-defence spending can only be cut so far.\"",
      "By leaving herself so little wiggle room and with such a precarious economic outlook, \"we can surely now expect six or seven months of speculation about what taxes might or might not be increased in the autumn,\" says Paul Johnson from the IFS.",
      "That speculation itself can cause economic harm, he says.",
      "Reeves has not ruled out tax rises but told the BBC there were \"opportunities\" as well as \"risks\" for the UK economy."

      "Real household disposable income per person is expected to grow by an average of around 0.5% a year, the OBR said.",

      "Economist Paul Johnson, director of the Institute for Fiscal Studies, told BBC Breakfast this was \"actually a pretty feeble rate of growth\".",

      "\"I won't shy away from the challenges we face, and change won't happen overnight,\" Reeves added. \"But the prize on offer to us is immense.\"",

      "This is hotly disputed by the government who insist they are sticking to rigid \"fiscal rules\" aimed at keeping a lid on borrowing - to prevent a repeat of the economic meltdown seen after Conservative PM Liz Truss's \"mini budget\".",
      "But the OBR - which was set up in 2010 to evaluate the government's figures - said Reeves will only manage to avoid breaking her fiscal rules through billions in public spending cuts.",

      "But Reeves insisted at a news conference that she was determined to keep a grip on the public finances.",

      "This marks the end for some and the gloom that can be caused by GMT, and the start of British Summer Time (BST) and lighter evenings.",
      "However, the Labour MP for Dunstable and Leighton Buzzard, Alex Mayer, has called for a \"major overhaul of time\" and a conversation about \"how best to use our nation's daylight hours\" in a parliamentary debate.",
      "But why do the clocks go back and forward in the UK each year?",
      "The process of moving the clocks forward by one hour in the summer was started during World War One in Germany in 1916, as a way to save energy resources during lighter evenings.",
      "Weeks later other countries followed suit, including the UK, where it was named British Summer Time. During World War Two in 1941, the then-prime minister Sir Winston Churchill introduced a system where clocks were advanced by two hours.",
      "This meant that during winter, while clocks went back an hour they were still one hour ahead of GMT to increase productivity during daylight.",
      "This ended in 1945, but briefly returned two years later due to severe fuel shortages that summer.",
      "What did the debate involve?",
      "Mayer wants a return to how things were in World War Two and hosted an adjournment debate in Parliament on the subject.",
      "She argued that a return to what is known as \"Churchill Time\" could help save a combined \u00a3485m in yearly electricity bills - and reduce carbon emissions by more than 400,000 tonnes.",
      "She called this \"a low-cost, high-impact proposal\" to \"help meet climate goals, reduce energy bills, and boost our High Streets by making better use of the daylight hours we already have\".",
      "Responding for the government, Business Minister Justin Madders said despite public debate about changing the clocks, the government was not going to introduce double summer time.",
      "Mayer is not the first MP to bring this discussion to Westminster.",
      "In 2012, a bid by Conservative MP Rebecca Harris to move UK clocks forward by an hour for a three-year trial period failed after the legislation ran out of time in the House of Commons.",
      "In 1968, there was a three-year experiment to keep BST in place throughout the year. On average, there was a huge reduction in road casualties, but this has since been attributed to new drink-driving legislation in 1967.",
      "What are the arguments against the change?",
      "During that experiment in northern Scotland, there was a net increase in the number of people killed or seriously injured on the roads, because during the darkest days of December sunrise would not take place until 10:00.",
      "In 2012, when MPs voted against it, many objections focused on the impact of a change on road accidents.",
      "Critics argued it would make the lives of outdoor workers harder and increase road accidents due to the darker mornings - although those in favour of a change argue it would reduce evening accidents.",
      "Other sources have expressed concerns about the negative impact of extended daylight evenings to health and sleep patterns.",
      "Recent studies suggested modern power consumption habits mean energy savings made by reducing evening lighting were now offset by increased energy consumption, in the warmer lighter evenings.",

    "published": "Fri, 28 Mar 2025 00:00:13 GMT",
    "summary": "Why the reign of the free market is facing its biggest ever challenge",
    "story": [
      "I remember 1974 well. With inflation on the rise, the government had been locked in battle with trade unions over worker pay. The government appeared paralysed: stand up to the miners and strikes could shut down the power system, but give in and pay them more money and inflation would rocket.",
      "And then the global oil crisis came out of nowhere. It threw economies, including Britain's, into chaos. The government introduced a three-day week. Power cuts were common - we would be plunged into darkness without warning. And seemingly, the government just expected us to deal with it.",
      "This was also the year I began presenting the BBC's current affairs programme Panorama. We spent a lot of time debating these issues. People came on with all kinds of different ideas of what to do.",
      "There were even suggestions that what the country really needed to take back control from the unions was a military takeover - a coup.",
      "There was another idea out there too. It was proposed by the Conservative politician Keith Joseph and was entirely radical - so removed from the mainstream, in fact, that during filming of Panorama, Joseph turned to the production team and asked exasperatedly if they understood what he meant.",
      "That idea was the free market.",
      "This meant Britain departing from the post World War Two consensus that government should control the economy and that instead if you left the markets alone, they would deliver the country greater prosperity and security.",
      "If, in 2025, the idea sounds anything but radical, that's exactly the point.",
      "What we saw in the UK in the 1980s under Margaret Thatcher's government was just how quickly the free market transitioned from a radical idea into the new reality. Then before long it became what many assumed was the system that would last forever.",
      "US President Donald Trump is a billionaire businessman who has clearly done well financially out of capitalism. But suddenly, thanks in part to him, the free market system finds itself under assault like never before.",
      "It might yet weather the storm. However others are asking, is the free market system fatally flawed and doomed to failure?",
      "The fantasy world of Thatcher's Britain",
      "So much of what Thatcher did in the wake of her 1983 general election victory seems so obvious now. We take it for granted that private companies play a pivotal role in providing our water, electricity, gas, railways, ports and freight.",
      "But at the time few believed it possible to do what she had done - it seemed like a fantasy world, completely detached from how things had been done post war.",
      "I was six when the war ended. There was rationing \u2013 coupons that allowed you to buy meat or clothes, or of course, sweets. But out of these hard times and on the heels of victory, a new vision of society was emerging in Britain.",
      "With Clement Attlee's landslide election victory in July 1945, for the first time in Britain's political history a majority cast their votes for a party ostensibly dedicated to socialism.",
      "But more than that, a new consensus on how the country should run emerged, with those leading the Labour and Conservative parties singing from a broadly similar sheet.",
      "\"We have built our defences against want and sickness, and we're proud of it,\" was uttered not by a Labour prime minister but by Harold Macmillan, Conservative prime minister from 1957 to 1963. This had been how things were done.",
      "However not everyone bought into the consensus. Antony Fisher, who was a chicken farmer, was exasperated by what he saw as the meddling of the Egg Marketing Board. He set up the Institute of Economic Affairs think tank, inspired Keith Joseph and he in turn got Thatcher's ear.",
      "Trump's admiration of Thatcher",
      "That the current assault on the free market is coming, in part, from a Republican US president seems all the more ironic given how popular Thatcher's reforms were with the American right.",
      "Thatcher and President Ronald Reagan shared a similar world view, and Trump has spoken of his admiration for the two, albeit with the caveat that he didn't agree with some of Reagan's trade policies.",
      "Thatcher was convinced that the country would be much better off if gas and water and electricity were taken out of the hands of the state. And sold on the open market. The free market. Just like buying a loaf of bread.",
      "The Thatcher government's big idea was that they weren't just going to sell the shares in state-owned utilities to big businesses or investors. They were going to offer them to the British people.",
      "In December 1984 shares in British Telecom (BT) went on sale. The next morning, the numbers were staggering: more than two million Britons were now BT shareholders.",
      "And Thatcher began to realise that selling off these companies wasn't just about breaking the shackles of government control. It could be something bigger - turning every person in Britain into a capitalist and in doing so making capitalism popular.",
      "In Britain, by the end of the 1980s, the scale of transformation was staggering. The sum of \u00a360bn was raised by selling off state run companies. Up to 15 million Britons were now shareholders.",
      "Britain was embracing the free market. This wasn't just an economic shift. It was a cultural revolution. A redefinition of Britain's relationship with money, with government, and with itself.",
      "And if Thatcher's privatisation had given ordinary people the chance to buy shares, her reforms to Britain's financial services sector in 1986, known as the Big Bang, gave ordinary people the chance to sell them too, to get a job in the previously closed world of the City.",
      "There were many on the left for whom the principle alone of these reforms was something to object to. The assault on the free market from some on the right is not about the principles of the reforms, but the consequences.",
      "Offshore business and collapsing communities",
      "At the core of Thatcher's thinking was a belief that free market capitalism could work only if many people had a direct stake in it. And with share ownership of previously state run utilities, many people did. But before long, alarm bells were starting to be rung. And their chime has only gotten louder.",
      "James Goldsmith was a businessman who had made a fortune by buying struggling companies cheaply, reshaping them to maximise efficiency and then selling them at a profit. The 1980s reforms were like manna from heaven for him.",
      "But then he seemed to change his mind about things. In 1994 he told a committee of US senators that its premise contained a fatal flaw - that the system demanded maximum profit but to achieve maximum profit that meant severing the umbilical link with many of your own electorate.",
      "\"You get to a system whereby, to get the best corporate profits, you have to leave your own country. You have to say to your own sales force 'Goodbye, we can't use you anymore - you're too expensive'.",
      "\"You've got unions. You want holidays. You want protection. So we're going offshore.\"",
      "Goldsmith was predicting that companies would take their business wherever they would make the most money. If you are a CEO answerable to shareholders that's literally your job description. And the result, he said, would be job losses in the West, with communities collapsing.",
      "And to make things worse, he argued that Britain had ceded sovereignty to the likes of the European Union and the World Trade Organization, with Britain binding itself to an economic system run by unelected bureaucrats in Brussels, only adding to the sense of alienation felt in collapsing communities. And with global markets dictating policy. If an industry wasn't profitable, it was left to die.",
      "Today, the UK may be a global leader in science and financial services but is that of much consolation to communities where we once made things that are now made offshore?",
      "Based on what I often heard in my many years touring the country presenting Question Time, I'm not sure it is.",
      "Goldsmith would end up trying to go into politics. His Referendum Party was trounced in the 1997 general election but he had planted a seed. He had argued that the global free market path that Britain and the rest of the world was going down was dangerous. That it would spread division around the world.",
      "Fast-forward nearly 20 years to 2016 and his warning came to pass. Britain voted to leave the European Union and the verdict could not be clearer: the Leave vote was highest in those left-behind communities, seemingly fuelled by those who felt globalisation was not working for them.",
      "The dream of a nation of shareholders has soured too.",
      "In 1989 Thames Water was privatised. We were promised lower bills, better infrastructure, less red tape and investment in a system fraying at the edges. It was investment that the global capitalist system was supposedly best placed to provide.",
      "What followed was something else entirely. Debt ballooned and dividends flowed to shareholders. The company extracted profit while pipes leaked and sewage poured into rivers. And our bills now pay for interest on that debt - it feels like we've come a long way from Thatcher's nation of shareholders.",
      "Trump's tariffs 'defy easy explanation'",
      "Back in 1994, James Goldsmith had posited that the problem with the free market dream was that it didn't protect the home base.",
      "Now, there is someone else much more powerful who takes that view.",
      "President Trump's methods are so erratic that with him it's hard to tell what is going on. His readiness to slap hugely consequential tariffs on countries that are both traditional foes and supposed friends at times defies easy explanation.",
      "But what we can say is that he is trying to return to ideas that preceded the free market. He is trying to make America strong through protectionism, making it harder for anyone to simply sell anywhere.",
      "There is an argument that if you take the long view then perhaps the free market period is the outlier. Britain itself had a long, long period of protectionism before it embraced free trade.",
      "Tariffs are nothing new in world economic history and in a sense Trump is just trying to return the US to how things were, albeit in quite a chaotic way.",
      "The reign of the free market is facing its biggest ever challenge. But that challenge is coming not from supporters of socialism who ideologically back a big role for the state. Instead, the challenge is coming from Trump, a man who is broadly speaking of the right and has no qualms with capitalism allowing people to become very rich.",
      "That the challenge is coming from within is what makes it so potent.",

      "When folk in government say the world has changed what they mean, at least in part, is Donald Trump is back in the White House and they can't be remotely certain what is going to happen next.",

      "Two and a bit months in to Trump's second term, the strategy from the government in the UK has been to wrangle in private and say as little as possible in public.",
      "\"If in doubt, say nowt\" is how you might colloquially describe the approach, resisting the temptation to be drawn into commentary about the president's actions for fear of provoking a blast of his ire.",
      "And alongside this, work has been under way to agree a US-UK trade deal, which may provide some insulation from the whims and broadsides of Trump.",
      "But all this underlines that uncertainty is the new certainty and considerable bandwidth is absorbed within government anticipating what might be around the corner and then seeking to negotiate about and/or mitigate the consequences of whatever is expected to change.",

      "With more than a splash of understatement, the OBR writes in its latest economic and fiscal outlook - which accompanied the chancellor's Spring Statement - that \"following the election of a new US administration in November, US trade policies and those of its major trading partners remain in flux\".",
      "You can say that again.",
      "Across five pages, the OBR works through various scenarios following a hike in tariffs of 20 percentage points by the US.",
      "Firstly on countries other than the UK, then on all countries including the UK and finally again on all countries including the UK but where those countries reciprocate with equivalent tariffs on US goods.",
      "Flick to page 40 here to have a read for yourself.",

      "The story of this Spring Statement is that welfare has been cut back to make up for a notable rise in the cost of servicing the national debt. There is also a trim to the money being given to government departments.",
      "There is relatively little else actually happening in policy terms. There were no tax rises, no changes to Chancellor Rachel Reeves' borrowing rules and as expected, this was definitely not a Budget.",
      "The real question now is whether the chancellor can escape from a never-ending cycle of microhaggling with the government's independent forecaster the Office for Budget Responsibility (OBR) in this way, twice a year for the rest of the Parliament.",
      "When asked about whether new tax rises could now come in the Autumn like last year, she said emphatically: \"We'll never have to do a Budget like that again.\"",

      "The Department for Work and Pensions (DWP) says that it expects 3.2 million families \u2013 a mixture of current and future recipients - to lose out financially as a result of the total package of measures, with an average loss of \u00a31,720 per year.",
      "This includes:",
      "370,000 current Pip recipients who will no longer qualify and 430,000 future Pip recipients who will get less than they would previously have been entitled to, with an average loss of \u00a34,500 per year2.25 million current UC recipients who will be affected by freezing the incapacity top up with an average loss of \u00a3500, although this will be partially offset by the increase in the standard allowance of UC 730,000 future UC recipients who will lose an average of \u00a33,000 per year.",
      "370,000 current Pip recipients who will no longer qualify and 430,000 future Pip recipients who will get less than they would previously have been entitled to, with an average loss of \u00a34,500 per year",
      "2.25 million current UC recipients who will be affected by freezing the incapacity top up with an average loss of \u00a3500, although this will be partially offset by the increase in the standard allowance of UC",
      "730,000 future UC recipients who will lose an average of \u00a33,000 per year.",
      "However, these calculations don't take into account the effects of the extra \u00a31bn the government it says it will spend to help those with disabilities and long-term health conditions find work.",
      "It expects this support will mitigate some of the predicted financial losses.",
      "In addition, the DWP says 3.8 million families will gain an average of \u00a3420 a year as a result of the increase in the standard UC allowance and changes to the assessment process.",
      "What is being done to get more people into work?",
      "The government says it wants to help those who can work back into employment, while doing more to protect those with severe conditions who are unable to do so.",
      "As part of this it will invest \u00a31bn in what it calls \"high-quality, tailored and personalised support\" to help people find jobs.",
      "A number of changes have been announced which the government hopes will break the link between trying to get into work and losing benefits.",
      "The work capability assessment, which checks eligibility for the health related top-up to universal credit, will be scrapped by 2028.",
      "Instead, claimants will have to go through the Pip system to claim for a health benefit. The government says they will be assessed on how their disability affects their daily life, rather than on their capacity to work.",
      "While you can receive universal credit or Pip while in employment, universal credit is means-tested and tapers off as earnings increase, while Pip is not affected by how much someone works or their level of savings.",
      "A new \"right to try\" system will mean people will not be financially penalised if they take a job which doesn't work out.",
      "The government will also consult on merging employment and support allowance and jobseeker's allowance into a single time-limited benefit that is not means-tested. This would be more generous but available for a shorter period.",
      "\"If you have paid into the system, you'll get stronger income protection while we help you get back on track,\" Work and Pensions Secretary Liz Kendall said.",
      "Why does the government want to cut welfare spending?",
      "Overall, the government currently spends \u00a365bn a year on health and disability-related benefits. Before the government announced the Pip and UC changes, this was projected to increase to \u00a3100bn by 2029.",
      "Pip is the second-largest element of the working-age welfare bill, with spending due to almost double to \u00a334bn by 2029-30.",
      "When Pip was introduced in 2013, the aim was to save \u00a31.4bn a year by reducing the number of people eligible for payments. However, initial savings were modest and the number of claimants has risen.",
      "About 1.3m people now claim disability benefits primarily for mental health or behavioural conditions.",
      "That is 44% of all working age claimants, according to the independent economic think-tank, the Institute for Fiscal Studies (IFS).",
      "The OBR now predicts welfare spending on working-age adults will be \u00a372.3bn by 2029-2030. Spending on pensioners and children is expected to be \u00a325.4bn.",
      "How big is the welfare budget and where might cuts fall?",

      "Here's what it could mean for you.",
      "1. Benefit changes",
      "If you are on benefits, you could be directly affected.",
      "The changes to the benefits system, announced last week, will see some people lose support from next year, although universal credit payments are set to rise from next April.",
      "This means:",
      "If you claim Personal Independence Payments and do not qualify when the criteria are tightened, then you are likely to be hardest hit. Some 370,000 people are expected to lose their entitlement altogether, and others will receive less than they expected. The average loss is \u00a34,500 a yearEven if you are not affected by the Pip changes, you may still lose out.

      "Other changes to the welfare reforms also mean less money than you may have expected.",
      "For example, the government had said there would be a rise in the standard allowance for universal credit for 6.5 million people.",
      "It will now rise to \u00a3106 a week, for a single claimant aged over 25 in 2029-30, rather than the \u00a3107 previously billed.",
      "The health element of universal credit, which is paid if your ability to work is limited,  was set be halved for new claimants to \u00a350 a week in 2026-27, and will now be frozen thereafter.",
      "Ministers have said that existing claimants will be affected too with their entitlement frozen at \u00a397 a week until 2029-30.",
      "2. Living standards and household bills",
      "The Spring Statement doesn't come in isolation. Next week, a series of household bills will rise.",
      "From 1 April, you will pay more for water, energy and your council tax.",
      "However, if you're over 21 and on the minimum wage then your hourly rate will go up to \u00a312.21 an hour, from the current \u00a311.44.",
      "Nonetheless, the rising cost of living has pushed many of you to your financial limit.",
      "And now the prices you pay are expected to rise at a faster pace this year than previously thought.",
      "Inflation - is expected to average 3.2% this year, according to the government's official forecaster, the Office for Budget Responsibility, before falling to 2.1% in 2026 and then 2% from 2027. The government's target is 2%.",
      "As a result,  interest rates, which are used to try and control the rate of rising prices, are expected to remain higher than previously thought.",
      "Overall, however, living standards are expected to improve.",
      "This is measured by real household disposable income which is expected to rise by just over 2% between now and 2030. That means on average you are expected to be \u00a3500 a year better off by 2030. However, this is relatively small by historical standards.",
      "Remember, these are only forecasts. They may be wrong and are subject to change.",
      "There's likely to be more speculation about the future of tax-free allowances in Individual Savings Accounts (Isas). The government says it is \"looking at options for reforms\" to encourage investing money.",
      "3. Jobs and services cut or created",
      "Forecasts about the general state of the economy will also influence the decisions the chancellor chooses to make and this could directly affect you.",
      "For example, official forecasts about economic growth this year have been halved from 2% to 1%, but are higher in subsequent years owing, in part, to the government's housebuilding programme.",

    "story": [
      "\"The world has changed\" is the mantra we are hearing from the government.",
      "It is a phrase designed to explain and justify the chancellor's argument on Wednesday in what is known as her Spring Statement.",
      "The Conservatives are branding it an \"emergency Budget\", which ministers insist is nonsense, but it is certainly true it is a bigger event than it was expected to be just a few months ago.",
      "We won't see Rachel Reeves standing on the steps of 11 Downing Street waving a red box around and it will be shadow chancellor Mel Stride responding to her in the House of Commons, rather than the leader of the opposition as happens on Budget Day.",
      "But other elements of the day will have a Budget day feel, not least in the overall vibe of whether Parliament and the country feel confidence in the government's economic prospectus.",
      "The backdrop is pretty bleak.",
      "When Labour won last year's general election, they said the first of their \"missions\" was to \"kickstart economic growth\".",
      "The thing is, there isn't any - the economy is flatlining.",
      "Plus, inflation is up and government borrowing costs are up.",
      "Then there are the big-picture challenges: the UK has an ageing population, the benefits bill is going skywards, the dangerous international picture is demanding more money for defence and the country is saddled with huge debt, which attracts huge debt interest payments.",
      "Add to that the wild unpredictability of US President Donald Trump, the looming prospect of tariffs and the vast uncertainty over Ukraine's future and European security.",
      "Follow Spring Statement 2025 live",
      "Follow Spring Statement 2025 live",
      "All of which prompts the question: if the world really has changed, how much appetite now or in the future might Labour have for a really far-reaching re-examination of how it approaches government?",
      "With big and potentially unpalatable trade-offs looming, what alternatives could there be?",
      "There are loads of ideas it could explore, from the left, the right and everywhere in between. But let's take a look at a few, all floated publicly by some on their own side.",
      "What is the chancellor's Spring Statement and what will be in it?",
      "Loosen the fiscal rules?",
      "At the heart of the political conversation this week are the government's self- imposed \"fiscal rules\".",
      "The government has chosen them in the hope they illustrate financial responsibility,  a trustworthiness on the international stage that the UK can pay its way and service its debts.",
      "The two rules are that day-to-day costs are met by tax revenues and that debt is falling as a share of the economy five years ahead.",
      "They are, ultimately, arbitrary: managing the national finances is complex and multilayered and while governments will often impose limits on themselves in the hope of portraying credibility, precisely what they are can vary significantly.",
      "Former Labour cabinet minister Lord David Blunkett told the BBC at the weekend he \"would like the Chancellor to loosen a little the self-imposed fiscal rules\", adding that they amounted to \"Treasury orthodoxy\u2026at its worst\".",
      "\"I would lift them marginally. I would raise the self-imposed rule by at least \u00a310-15 billion and I would spend a great chunk of it on what we did back in '97 with the new deal for the unemployed,\" the former work and pensions secretary told BBC Radio 4.",
      "Lord Blunkett isn't the only one \u2013 Jagjit Chadha, Professor of Economics at Cambridge University, has written in The Guardian this week of his scepticism about the value of the fiscal rules.",
      "There is another parallel that could be drawn too.",
      "Last week the German parliament voted to allow a massive increase in defence spending.",
      "The new law will exempt spending on defence and security from Germany's strict debt rules.",
      "Could, should, the UK do the same?",
      "Both the German parallel and Lord Blunkett's suggestion get short shrift from senior government figures.",
      "\"When people say change the fiscal rules, that means borrowing more money,\" is how one source put it to me.",
      "\"We have got to be honest about the implications of higher borrowing. If we did what Germany is doing, it could add \u00a34bn to borrowing costs, not far off the prisons budget,\" they added.",
      "It is also pointed out that Germany's national debt is vastly smaller than the UK's as a share of national income.",
      "And there is no appetite to do anything that might provoke the international markets to go wobbly about the UK again, as happened when Liz Truss was prime minister.",
      "What about a wealth tax?",
      "Some on the left of the Labour Party have been calling for this, as have the Green Party and others.",
      "The idea would attempt to do what it said on the tin, but observers such as Paul Johnson of the Institute for Fiscal Studies are cautious about its likely effectiveness as a revenue raiser.",
      "Before the last Budget in the autumn a cross-party group of MPs suggested it, while Labour MP Richard Burgon raised it as an idea at Prime Minister's Questions earlier this month.",
      "Reeves has long distanced herself from the idea, arguing in 2023: \"I don't see the way to prosperity as being through taxation.\"",
      "Reeves and Prime Minister Sir Keir Starmer are fearful of being portrayed as high taxers and high spenders, an image plenty within Labour think has previously cost them dearly at elections.",
      "But could a one-off such tax ever be tempting as ministers confront awkward spending squeezes in places and that ever growing demand for defence spending?",
      "Other taxes rises in spotlight",
      "What about cranking up income tax, national insurance or VAT?",
      "After all, these are the big levers of revenue raising for any chancellor.",
      "But there is a catch: Labour promised not to in its election manifesto.",
      "They did, nonetheless, put up national insurance, albeit on employers not employees \u2013 a rise that is due to kick in next month and is causing considerable anxiety for many businesses.",
      "So why not ratchet up one of the others?",
      "Some say, for a start, it could further depress an already stagnant economy, as well as further depress the outlook of many on politicians' capacities to keep promises.",
      "On the other hand, increases to these taxes tend to lead to a reliable big uptick in tax revenue and because they reach significant swathes of the population, they don't energise smaller, often well organised sectors who can then vociferously oppose a more targeted and less revenue rich idea.",
      "A good example of this are the dozens of tractors on Whitehall as farmers in their thousands made their views known about changes to inheritance tax.",
      "Thinking about all this was hinted at, alongside changes to the fiscal rules, by the now former international development minister, Anneliese Dodds, in her resignation last month over the cut in the international aid budget to bolster defence spending.",
      "In her resignation letter to the prime minister, she wrote that she had hoped the government would \"collectively discuss our fiscal rules and approach to taxation, just as other nations are doing\".",
      "She added: \"It will be impossible to raise the substantial resources needed just through tactical cuts to public spending. These are unprecedented times, where strategic decisions for the sake of our country's security cannot be ducked.\"",
      "Smashing manifesto promises is not something governments do lightly and Labour would tread particularly carefully around these flagship pledges on the economy, so often for many a perceived weak spot in the party's credibility.",
      "The tax burden, on average, is also generationally high \u2013 another reason these ideas could be a mighty hard sell even if ministers were willing to break their promises.",
      "And if ideas from their own side, like these three, aren't palatable, all of which make an already big State even bigger, there are those suggested by the Conservatives and others.",
      "Reducing benefit spending",
      "Cutting benefits much more is one such idea.",
      "The former Conservative and UKIP MP Douglas Carswell, writing in the Telegraph, suggested closing eight government departments, saving \u00a324bn by cutting the public sector workforce and instituting a two year public sector pay freeze.",
      "He reckoned these ideas alongside others could cut government spending from 45% of national income to 40%.",
      "Many of these might not be instantly palatable to a Labour government, just like those from their own side, but all of this brings us back to where we began: has the world changed? By how much? For how long?",
      "And just how bold might the government have to think \u2013 and soon \u2013 if it really has?",

      "So what is the point of this Spring Statement?",
      "It is principally a spring forecast from the government's official forecasters, the Office for Budget Responsibility (OBR). In that process it has had to take into account a slower economy than expected, and higher government borrowing costs.",
      "This OBR forecast has wiped out the room for manoeuvre against the \"non-negotiable\" rules Chancellor Rachel Reeves has set on government borrowing in the future. She has made a number of further adjustments to keep the numbers on track.",
      "Essentially low growth and higher borrowing costs have blown the budgetary numbers off course.",
      "We will hear a lot from the chancellor about how \"the world has changed\".",
      "The reality is this course correction is likely to have been required even before US President Donald Trump transformed global diplomacy and trade.",

      "'As a student, \u00a3800 a month is quite tight'",
      "What are Rachel Reeves's borrowing rules?",
      "While no significant tax measures are expected, the chancellor may nonetheless leave the option on the table for the autumn Budget.",
      "Some economists do expect tax rises in the autumn, in particular to meet rising defence spending. There is talk of a \"conversation with the public\" on this matter.",
      "At her first Budget the chancellor rejected, for example, extending the Conservative freeze to income tax thresholds by another two years. The public could get a clear idea around this Spring Statement if that is back as an option.",
      "The \u00a35bn cut to welfare spending already announced is the biggest single welfare cut for a decade. That is likely to be the biggest saving. The chancellor is now set to expand the cuts after being told reforms to the system would save less than planned.",
      "Later on Wednesday, the number of people losing Personal Independence Payments (PIP) and Universal Credit, how much on average, and the split between current or future recipients should be revealed. Hundreds of thousands will lose thousands of pounds worth of health-related benefits.",
      "There is a \u00a32.2bn cut to civil service admin costs, including staffing by 2029-30. A 15% cut is a significant chunk of what is spent by central government on wages and consultants.",
      "However, the chancellor suggested a loss of 10,000 roles, which is only a pruning of a workforce of over half a million - especially as it sees 30-40,000 leavers every year.",
      "The unions say this cannot be done without harming front line services. There is a lot riding here on deployment of automation and Artificial Intelligence (AI).",
      "A further fractional trim to the rise in departmental budgets, a crackdown on tax avoidance, and the switch from aid to defence spending should all help restore the chancellor's room for manoeuvre by another few billion pounds.",
      "It will be difficult to characterise this as \"austerity\" given the early injection of significant upfront sums into public spending at the Budget.",
      "Divvying up the increase in defence spending will be a key feature of the Spring Statement.",
      "Defence spending (for example, on jets and tanks) is more capital intensive than aid spending, so more of it is exempted from the chancellor's self-imposed borrowing rules to limit day-to-day spending only to what is raised in taxes.",
      "Growth downgrade",
      "Understandably there will be a lot of focus on a chunky downgrade to the OBR forecast for the economy in 2025.",
      "The real question for the chancellor has been the extent to which that has carried through to the end of the forecast period, and so permanently dented the economy and tax revenues. It may have not, and therefore not impact the Budget numbers quite so much.",
      "The Treasury has also been trying to get the OBR to give it credit for growth-enhancing reforms such as planning changes.",
      "In theory, higher growth means lower forecast borrowing and more room for manoeuvre - a win-win. But the OBR may have become stricter on this after a recent external review of its methods.",
      "There is a bigger picture here about growth and the government's strategy. Investors and business are still awaiting the infrastructure, industrial and trade strategies of this government eight months since it took power.",
      "The new global reality means further uncertainty, but also creates a potential significant upside for a stable, rules-based advanced economy with cutting-edge frontier science, research and financial services.",
      "This is particularly the case for a nation that can simultaneously keep its trade and investment connections with the US, Europe, China and the Gulf, even amid the tariff tumult. In Cabinet they call it \"the most connected economy in the world\".",
      "Is the world hearing this? UK Government borrowing costs have risen again as markets await the new calendar of bond sales on Wednesday.",
      "UK bond yields went up with the US in January, but when that stopped they also rose in line with Europe after massive debt-fuelled rearmament plans. It's the worst of both worlds for the borrowing forecast.",
      "The Spring Statement might be an opportunity to project the opposite case - that the UK is uniquely placed to be the best of both worlds. Some sort of economic deal with the US is imminent, and talks over the Brexit reset are also progressing.",
      "There are some small signs of the economy breaking out of its recent rut, especially in the service sector. Small businesses in retail and hospitality fearing the rises to National Insurance and the National Living Wage are holding out for some sort of alleviation of the pain.",
      "So Wednesday, while definitely not a Budget, will answer some important questions about the economy."

    "story": [
      "The climate action group Just Stop Oil has announced it is to disband at the end of April. Its activists have been derided as attention-seeking zealots and vandals and it is loathed by many for its disruptive direct action tactics. It says it has won because its demand that there should be no new oil and gas licences is now government policy.  So, did they really win and does this mark an end to the chaos caused by its climate protests?",
      "Hayley Walsh's heart was racing as she sat in the audience at the Theatre Royal Drury Lane on 27 January this year.",
      "The 42 year-old lecturer and mother of three tried to calm her breathing. Hollywood star Sigourney Weaver was onstage in her West End debut production of Shakespeare's The Tempest.",
      "But Hayley, a Just Stop Oil activist, had her own drama planned.",
      "As Weaver's Prospero declaimed \"Come forth, I say,\" Hayley sprang from her seat and rushed the stage with Richard Weir, a 60-year-old mechanical engineer from Tyneside.",
      "They launched a confetti cannon and unfurled a banner that read \"Over 1.5 Degrees is a Global Shipwreck\" - a reference to the news that 2024 was the first year to pass the symbolic 1.5C threshold in global average temperature rise, and a nod to the shipwreck theme in the play.",
      "It was a classic Just Stop Oil (JSO) action. The target was high profile and would guarantee publicity. The message was simple and presented in the group's signature fluorescent orange.",
      "The reaction of those affected was also a classic response to JSO.  Amid the boos and whistles you can hear a shout of \"idiots\".",
      "\"Drag them off the stage\", one audience member can be heard shouting, \"I hope you [expletive] get arrested,\" another says.",
      "JSO is a UK-based environmental activist group that aims to end fossil fuel extraction and uses direct action to draw attention to its cause. It has been called a \"criminal cult\" and its activists branded \"eco-loons\" by the Sun. The Daily Mail has described it as \"deranged\" and says its members have \"unleashed misery on thousands of ordinary people though their selfish antics\".",
      "The group has thrown soup at a Van Gogh in the National Gallery, exploded a chalk dust bomb during the World Snooker Championship in Sheffield, smashed a cabinet containing a copy of the Magna Carta at the British Library, sprayed temporary paint on the stones of Stonehenge and even defaced Charles Darwin's grave.",
      "But it is the group's road protests that have probably caused the most disruption \u2013 and public anger. In November 2022, 45 JSO members climbed gantries around the M25 severely disrupting traffic for over four days. People missed flights, medical appointments and exams as thousands of drivers were delayed for hours. The cost to the Metropolitan Police was put at \u00a31.1 million.",
      "Just Stop Oil was born out of Extinction Rebellion (XR).  XR \u2013 founded in 2018 - brought thousands of people onto the streets in what were dubbed \"festivals of resistance\".  They came to a peak in April 2019, when protestors brought parts of the capital to a halt for more than a week and plonked a large pink boat in the middle of Oxford Circus.",
      "The spectacle and disruption XR caused generated massive media attention, but the police were furious.  Hundreds of officers were diverted from frontline duties and by the end of 2019 the bill for policing the protests had reached \u00a337m.",
      "And behind the scenes XR was riven by furious debates about tactics.  Many inside the movement said it should be less confrontational and disruptive but a hard core of activists argued it would be more effective to double down on direct action.",
      "It became clear that there was room for what Sarah Lunnon, one of the co-founders of Just Stop Oil, calls \"a more radical flank\".  They decided a new, more focused operation was needed, modelled on earlier civil disobedience movements like the Suffragettes, Gandhi's civil disobedience campaigns and the civil rights movement in the US.",
      "The group was formally launched on Valentine's Day, 2022. It was a very different animal to XR. Instead of thousands of people taking part in street carnivals, JSO's actions involved a few committed activists. A small strategy group oversaw the campaign and meticulously planned its activities. A mobilisation team worked to recruit new members, and another team focused on supporting activists after they were arrested.",
      "The dozens of actions the group has carried out generated lots of publicity, but also massive public opposition. There were confrontations between members of the public and protestors and an outcry from politicians across all the main political parties.",
      "The police said they needed more powers to deal with this new form of protest and they got them. New offences were created including interfering with national infrastructure, \"locking on\" \u2013 chaining or gluing yourself to something \u2013 and tunnelling underground. Causing a public nuisance also became a potential crime \u2013 providing the police with a powerful new tool to use against protestors who block roads.",
      "In the four years since it was formed dozens of the group's supporters have been jailed. Five activists were handed multi-year sentences for their role in the M25 actions in 2022. Those were reduced on appeal earlier this month but are still the longest jail terms for non-violent civil disobedience ever issued.",
      "Senior JSO members deny the crackdown had anything to do with the group's decision to \"hang up the hi-vis\" \u2013 as its statement this week announcing the end of campaign put it.",
      "JSO's public position is that it has won its battle. \"Just Stop Oil's initial demand to end new oil and gas is now government policy, making us one of the most successful civil resistance campaigns in recent history,\" the group claimed.",
      "The government has said it does not plan to issue any new licences for oil and gas production but strongly denies its policies have a link to JSO. Furthermore, the Prime Minister's official spokesperson told journalists: \"We have been very clear when it comes to oil and gas that it has a future for decades to come in our energy mix.\"",
      "And the group's wider goal \u2013 to end the production of oil and gas \u2013 has manifestly not been achieved. The members of the group I spoke to for this article all agree the climate crisis has deepened.",
      "In the face of stiffer sentences, some climate campaigners have said they will turn to more clandestine activities. One new group says it plans a campaign of sabotage against key infrastructure. In a manifesto published online it says it plans to \"kickstart a new phase of the climate activist movement, aiming to shut down key actors of the fossil fuel economy.\"",
      "That's not a direction the JSO members I spoke to said they wanted to go. Sarah Lunnon said a key principle of JSO and the civil disobedience movement generally was that activists would take responsibility for their actions. One of the first questions new joiners were asked is whether they would be willing to be locked up.",
      "\"As corporations and billionaires corrupt political systems across the world, we need a different approach.",
      "\"We are creating a new strategy, to face this reality and to carry our responsibilities at this time,\" the group says, suggesting they may be planning to form a new movement.",
      "JSO's most high-profile figure, Roger Hallam, is one of the five activists convicted for their role in the M25 protests. In a message from his prison cell he acknowledged that JSO has only had a \"marginal impact\".",
      "That is \"not due to lack of trying,\" he said. The failure lay with the UK's \"elites and our leaders\" who had walked away from their responsibility to tackle the climate crisis, Hallam claimed. A hint perhaps that the group's new focus might be on the political system itself.",
      "JSO has said its last protest \u2013 to be held at the end of April \u2013 will mark \"the end of soup on Van Goghs, cornstarch on Stonehenge and slow marching in the streets\". But don't believe it. When pressed, the JSO members I spoke to said they may well turn back to disruptive tactics but under a new name and with a new and as yet unspecified objective.",

    "summary": "Sewage spilled into England's waterways for a record number of hours last year, the Environmental Agency says.",
    "story": [
      "Water companies released raw sewage into England's rivers and seas for a record 3.61 million hours last year, a slight increase on 2023.",
      "The data released by Environment Agency on Thursday showed that although the number of spills was down each spill lasted longer on average - resulting in a higher total number of hours.",
      "Some spilling can be legal, but concern has been mounting amongst scientists about the harm that regular sewage spilling is causing the country's aquatic life.",
      "Water UK, the industry body, said sewage spills are a \"disgrace\" but has committed to a programme of investment worth \u00a3104bn over the next five years.",
      "How much sewage is spilled near you?",
      "Water company makes case for higher bill increases",
      "\"These figures are disgraceful and are a stark reminder of how years of underinvestment have led to water companies discharging unacceptable levels of sewage into our rivers, lakes, and seas,\" said Environment Secretary Steve Reed.",
      "His views were echoed by Water UK Chief Executive David Henderson: \"Any sewage flowing into waterways is a disgrace. Unfortunately, it's a system fault that we have in our network which mixes rainwater and wastewater. Nobody wants to see any spill of sewage in our waterways.\"",
      "England, like much of the world, has a combined sewage system meaning that rainwater and sewage share the same pipes. In some instances, when there is too much rain, treatment works can be overwhelmed, and sewage is spilled via overflow points into the country's rivers, lakes and seas to prevent a back up to the system.",
      "This practice is legal. But previous investigations by the BBC and Environment Agency have revealed that sewage has also been spilled by water companies under dry conditions in breach of their permits.",
      "Water companies collectively oversee more than 15,000 of these overflow sites and this was the first year where all sites were monitored, revealing for the first time the extent of spilling.",
      "Sewage was spilt for 3.614 million hours in 2024 compared to 3.606 million hours in 2023.",
      "CEO of River Action, James Wallace, said: \"A year on from last year's catastrophic pollution figures, the true scale of the UK's water crisis is only now coming to light. The figures have barely budged, testament to the deepening sewage scandal.\"",
      "In 2022, Prof Chris Whitty, chief medical office for the UK, outlined the serious health risks sewage spills can pose for those using the country's waterways. Chief amongst them is bacteria from human faeces which he said can \"increase the risk of significant infections including antibiotic resistant bacteria\".",
      "Sewage also poses significant environmental risks \u2013 it increases nutrients in the water leading to algal blooms which then eventually denies other wildlife \u2013 like fish - oxygen. These spills also have been shown to introduce microplastics, drugs and sanitary products into rivers and seas.",
      "The River Ver in St Albans is one such location - the banks are littered with condoms, tampon applicators and wet wipes likely from sewage releases from nearby Markyate sewage treatment works owned by Thames Water. This rare chalk stream \u2013 one of around 200 worldwide \u2013 which supports important wildlife like water voles, saw more than 3,300 hours of spills in 2024.",
      "Of the spills a Thames Water spokesperson said: \"The Markyate area experienced one of the wettest years on record in 2024 which has caused excessive amounts of groundwater which has infiltrated into the network. This has resulted in the system being overwhelmed which has led to discharges into the river.\"",
      "Liberal Democrats Leader Ed Davey said the scale of spilling showed that the sector regulator, Ofwat, was not up to the task.",
      "\"This has to be the final nail in the coffin for Ofwat, a regulator that has time and again proven it is completely inadequate to protect customers and our beautiful environment,\" he said.",
      "In October, the government launched an Independent Water Commission, chaired by former deputy Bank of England governor Sir Jon Cunliffe, to look into the sector - including the effectiveness of Ofwat.",
      "An Ofwat spokesperson said: \"Where companies miss their targets, they will be penalised and money will be returned to customers. In parallel, companies will be held to account for past failures through our ongoing enforcement work into the operation and maintenance of sewage works and networks.\"",
      "The Markyate site is one of a number across the country that is due an upgrade as part of a five-year \u00a3104bn investment programme by water companies \u2013 with \u00a324bn going specifically to improving infrastructure.",
      "These upgrades will be paid largely through bill rises \u2013 which are due to take effect from 1 April \u2013 and will see the average annual bill hit \u00a3603. This has angered consumer groups and environmental charities who argue that the burden of upgrades should be carried by shareholders not households.",
      "Prof Ewan McGaughey, Professor of Law at Kings College London, said: \"The water companies have paid over \u00a385bn out to shareholders since privatisation and that means they haven't been able to put the money into infrastructure.\"",
      "Ofwat and the industry have previously denied the figure\u2013 which comes from University of Greenwich research \u2013 is as high, but there is agreement that significant investment is required.",
      "Phillip Clisham, specialist adviser to the Institution of Civil Engineers on water and sanitation, has worked in the industry for more than three decades, and said the challenge of fixing the issue has been \"underestimated\".",
      "He said the two main solutions are building bigger storm tanks \u2013 which produce a huge amount of planet warming emissions in their construction \u2013 or to reduce excess rainwater by increasing green areas and the use of sustainable urban drainage systems.",
      "What are sustainable urban drainage systems?",
      "What are sustainable urban drainage systems?",
      "It is this second solution that is preferable for the environment, he said, but it requires coordination between government, planning officers and housing developers \u2013 and takes longer to implement.",

      "\"Should we have problems with water supply then what's going to happen to those plans for restoration that we've all been working on for the past three years?\"",
      "News broke of the difficulties facing the canal in a letter sent to local businesses by Gland\u0175r Cymru, the Canal and River Trust in Wales, in February.",
      "It explained the canal, which once transported iron and coal to Newport docks, had relied on funnelling water from the River Usk and its tributaries which accounted for 80-90% of its water supply.",
      "Recent changes in legislation, designed in part to protect rivers in the face of climate change, means licences are now required, restricting the amount of water that can be taken.",
      "Last year, Gland\u0175r Cymru lost an appeal against some of the conditions stipulated by environmental regulator Natural Resources Wales (NRW).",
      "The River Usk is a designated special area of conservation protected by law due to its importance for rare wildlife including the Atlantic salmon, which is threatened with extinction from Wales.",
      "\"The canal took around 30% of the total flow of the river in 2022 - which was the last dry year period,\" said Gail Davies-Walsh, chief executive of Afonydd Cymru which represents river groups across Wales.",
      "Limits on abstraction were needed to ensure the species and habitats had sufficient water to survive \"particularly during dry summers and low flow periods,\" she said.",

      "\"The amount of water we can take is starting to really concern us,\" he explained.",
      "\"It's urgent today, looking at the forecast for the next week.",
      "\"At some point we'll have to stop the boats from using the locks,\" he warned, adding that both the canal's users and its wildlife would be impacted as levels fell.",
      "Discussions have been taking place in recent weeks with Welsh Water over whether it could help to support the canal during periods of prolonged dry weather.",

      "Alasdair Kirkpatrick, owner of Beacon Park Boats, said he had already received phone calls from customers who had booked boat trips asking about the impact on them.",
      "\"I never saw this one coming,\" he said, \"it has really shocked us all.\"",
      "\"All my customers nip down to the local pubs and restaurants, 25% of them fly in from overseas from places like America and Australia, using local taxis and train services and spending a fortune locally,\" he added.",
      "He urged the Welsh government \"to fund Welsh Water to continue to maintain water levels and keep all the operators of this canal in business - it cannot be lost\".",
      "Gavin Bown from Natural Resources Wales said regulating water abstraction was \"a complex, evidence-based process that carefully balances environmental needs with those of local communities\".",

      "Unesco, the UN's Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization, calls the Mongolian Gobi Desert the largest dinosaur fossil reservoir in the world.",
      "The region is an especially important source of fossils from the later Cretaceous period, which is the last of the main three periods of the dinosaur age, representing the final phase of dinosaur evolution.",
      "At nearly a foot long, the claws themselves were much larger than their underlying bone, the study revealed.",
      "Besides better grasping, the two-fingered hands may have been used for display, digging, or as formidable weapons.",
      "The most famous two-fingered theropods are species within the group tyrannosaurids, which includes Tyrannosaurus rex, but Duonychus evolved its two-fingered hands separately from them and from other two-fingered theropods.",
      "The specimen also preserves the first keratinous sheath of a therizinosaur, an element that covers the claw much like human fingernails, aiding defence, movement, or prey catching."

    "summary": "Archaeologists say they have found more than 800 items dating back about 2,000 years.",
    "story": [
      "Archaeologists have helped uncover one of the \"largest and most important\" Iron Age finds in the UK.",
      "The Melsonby Hoard was discovered in a field near Melsonby, North Yorkshire, by metal detectorist Peter Heads and excavated with the help of Durham University.",
      "It includes more than 800 items, including two cauldrons or vessels, horse harness, bridle bits, ceremonial spears and 28 iron tyres, believed to have been buried about 2,000 years ago.",
      "Historians believe the \"unprecedented\" find could lead to a \"major re-evaluation\" of the wealth and status of the elite living in northern Britain at the time.",
      "After the initial discovery was reported to the authorities in December 2021, the site was excavated in 2022, with the support of the British Museum and a \u00a3120,000 grant from Historic England.",
      "Early analysis of the hoard, released on Tuesday, suggests a lot of the items had been purposefully burnt or broken before being buried as a show of power and wealth.",
      "Tom Moore, head of the department of archaeology at Durham University, said the size and scale of the find was \"exceptional for Britain and probably even Europe\".",
      "He said the hoard showed there was more wealth in the north of England at the time than previously thought.",
      "\"Whoever originally owned the material in this hoard was probably a part of a network of elites across Britain, into Europe and even the Roman world,\" he said.",
      "\"The destruction of so many high-status objects, evident in this hoard, is also of a scale rarely seen in Iron Age Britain and demonstrates that the elites of northern Britain were just as powerful as their southern counterparts.\"",
      "It is thought the objects may have been burnt on a funerary pyre before being buried, though no human remains were found.",
      "Analysis: Danny Savage, BBC News",
      "In the archaeology labs at Durham University there's a real buzz about the unveiling of the Melsonby Hoard. Curators feel this is the discovery of a lifetime.",
      "Hundreds of recovered artefacts are spread out in a climate controlled room on long tables.",
      "You have to use your imagination a bit, Iron Age artefacts from 2,000 years ago have rusted or faded and are far from their original glory.  Some of them were decorated with coral which has bleached over the centuries.",
      "But it's the story they tell that's extraordinary.",
      "Iron Age experts now have evidence that people 2,000 years ago had four wheel wagons as well as two wheel chariots.",
      "They now have proof that Iron Age residents of northern England had trading connections with the continent and the growing Roman Empire.",
      "This will keep experts busy for years.",
      "There's also a bit of secrecy too. The exact location of the discovery is not being revealed over concern that rogue treasure hunters will turn up at night and start looking for other artefacts.",
      "History is valuable - to different people in different ways.",
      "Among the items uncovered were the partial remains of more than seven four-wheeled wagons and/or two-wheeled chariots, including elaborate harnesses for at least 14 ponies, some which were adorned with red, Mediterranean coral and coloured glass, and 28 iron tyres from horse-drawn vehicles, some of which had been intentionally bent out of shape.",
      "They also found three ceremonial spears and two ornate cauldrons or vessels, one that was decorated in both Mediterranean and Iron Age styles and probably used as a wine mixing bowl.",
      "Some of the objects found were most closely related to others found in continental Europe, suggesting people shared technologies over this distance.",
      "The objects were identified using scanning technology at the University of Southampton, which helped the archaeologists figure out how to excavate the objects without causing damage.",
      "Duncan Wilson, chief executive of Historic England, said: \"This is one of the most important and exciting Iron Age period discoveries made in the UK.",
      "\"It sheds new light on Iron Age life in the north and Britain, but it also demonstrates connections with Europe.\"",
      "The Yorkshire Museum has launched a fundraising campaign to secure the hoard for its collections.",
      "Andrew Woods, senior curator at the museum said: \"This Iron Age hoard is an unprecedented find in the north, which will help us to understand more about this remarkable period in our history.",
      "\"We have the exciting opportunity to save the hoard for the nation and the people of Yorkshire.",
      "\"By acquiring the hoard, we will be able to make it accessible to everyone and, working in partnership with others, we can learn more about this fascinating period, why the hoard was buried, how the objects may have been used and to cast light on to whom it may have belonged.\"",

    "published": "Sat, 29 Mar 2025 10:56:23 GMT",
    "summary": "Just Stop Oil says it will disband but does this mark an end to the chaos caused by its climate protests?",
    "story": [
      "The climate action group Just Stop Oil has announced it is to disband at the end of April. Its activists have been derided as attention-seeking zealots and vandals and it is loathed by many for its disruptive direct action tactics. It says it has won because its demand that there should be no new oil and gas licences is now government policy.  So, did they really win and does this mark an end to the chaos caused by its climate protests?",
      "Hayley Walsh's heart was racing as she sat in the audience at the Theatre Royal Drury Lane on 27 January this year.",
      "The 42 year-old lecturer and mother of three tried to calm her breathing. Hollywood star Sigourney Weaver was onstage in her West End debut production of Shakespeare's The Tempest.",
      "But Hayley, a Just Stop Oil activist, had her own drama planned.",
      "As Weaver's Prospero declaimed \"Come forth, I say,\" Hayley sprang from her seat and rushed the stage with Richard Weir, a 60-year-old mechanical engineer from Tyneside.",
      "They launched a confetti cannon and unfurled a banner that read \"Over 1.5 Degrees is a Global Shipwreck\" - a reference to the news that 2024 was the first year to pass the symbolic 1.5C threshold in global average temperature rise, and a nod to the shipwreck theme in the play.",
      "It was a classic Just Stop Oil (JSO) action. The target was high profile and would guarantee publicity. The message was simple and presented in the group's signature fluorescent orange.",
      "The reaction of those affected was also a classic response to JSO.  Amid the boos and whistles you can hear a shout of \"idiots\".",
      "\"Drag them off the stage\", one audience member can be heard shouting, \"I hope you [expletive] get arrested,\" another says.",
      "JSO is a UK-based environmental activist group that aims to end fossil fuel extraction and uses direct action to draw attention to its cause. It has been called a \"criminal cult\" and its activists branded \"eco-loons\" by the Sun. The Daily Mail has described it as \"deranged\" and says its members have \"unleashed misery on thousands of ordinary people though their selfish antics\".",
      "The group has thrown soup at a Van Gogh in the National Gallery, exploded a chalk dust bomb during the World Snooker Championship in Sheffield, smashed a cabinet containing a copy of the Magna Carta at the British Library, sprayed temporary paint on the stones of Stonehenge and even defaced Charles Darwin's grave.",
      "But it is the group's road protests that have probably caused the most disruption \u2013 and public anger. In November 2022, 45 JSO members climbed gantries around the M25 severely disrupting traffic for over four days. People missed flights, medical appointments and exams as thousands of drivers were delayed for hours. The cost to the Metropolitan Police was put at \u00a31.1 million.",
      "Just Stop Oil was born out of Extinction Rebellion (XR).  XR \u2013 founded in 2018 - brought thousands of people onto the streets in what were dubbed \"festivals of resistance\".  They came to a peak in April 2019, when protestors brought parts of the capital to a halt for more than a week and plonked a large pink boat in the middle of Oxford Circus.",
      "The spectacle and disruption XR caused generated massive media attention, but the police were furious.  Hundreds of officers were diverted from frontline duties and by the end of 2019 the bill for policing the protests had reached \u00a337m.",
      "And behind the scenes XR was riven by furious debates about tactics.  Many inside the movement said it should be less confrontational and disruptive but a hard core of activists argued it would be more effective to double down on direct action.",
      "It became clear that there was room for what Sarah Lunnon, one of the co-founders of Just Stop Oil, calls \"a more radical flank\".  They decided a new, more focused operation was needed, modelled on earlier civil disobedience movements like the Suffragettes, Gandhi's civil disobedience campaigns and the civil rights movement in the US.",
      "The group was formally launched on Valentine's Day, 2022. It was a very different animal to XR. Instead of thousands of people taking part in street carnivals, JSO's actions involved a few committed activists. A small strategy group oversaw the campaign and meticulously planned its activities. A mobilisation team worked to recruit new members, and another team focused on supporting activists after they were arrested.",
      "The dozens of actions the group has carried out generated lots of publicity, but also massive public opposition. There were confrontations between members of the public and protestors and an outcry from politicians across all the main political parties.",
      "The police said they needed more powers to deal with this new form of protest and they got them. New offences were created including interfering with national infrastructure, \"locking on\" \u2013 chaining or gluing yourself to something \u2013 and tunnelling underground. Causing a public nuisance also became a potential crime \u2013 providing the police with a powerful new tool to use against protestors who block roads.",
      "In the four years since it was formed dozens of the group's supporters have been jailed. Five activists were handed multi-year sentences for their role in the M25 actions in 2022. Those were reduced on appeal earlier this month but are still the longest jail terms for non-violent civil disobedience ever issued.",
      "Senior JSO members deny the crackdown had anything to do with the group's decision to \"hang up the hi-vis\" \u2013 as its statement this week announcing the end of campaign put it.",
      "JSO's public position is that it has won its battle. \"Just Stop Oil's initial demand to end new oil and gas is now government policy, making us one of the most successful civil resistance campaigns in recent history,\" the group claimed.",
      "The government has said it does not plan to issue any new licences for oil and gas production but strongly denies its policies have a link to JSO. Furthermore, the Prime Minister's official spokesperson told journalists: \"We have been very clear when it comes to oil and gas that it has a future for decades to come in our energy mix.\"",
      "And the group's wider goal \u2013 to end the production of oil and gas \u2013 has manifestly not been achieved. The members of the group I spoke to for this article all agree the climate crisis has deepened.",
      "In the face of stiffer sentences, some climate campaigners have said they will turn to more clandestine activities. One new group says it plans a campaign of sabotage against key infrastructure. In a manifesto published online it says it plans to \"kickstart a new phase of the climate activist movement, aiming to shut down key actors of the fossil fuel economy.\"",
      "That's not a direction the JSO members I spoke to said they wanted to go. Sarah Lunnon said a key principle of JSO and the civil disobedience movement generally was that activists would take responsibility for their actions. One of the first questions new joiners were asked is whether they would be willing to be locked up.",
      "\"As corporations and billionaires corrupt political systems across the world, we need a different approach.",
      "\"We are creating a new strategy, to face this reality and to carry our responsibilities at this time,\" the group says, suggesting they may be planning to form a new movement.",
      "JSO's most high-profile figure, Roger Hallam, is one of the five activists convicted for their role in the M25 protests. In a message from his prison cell he acknowledged that JSO has only had a \"marginal impact\".",
      "That is \"not due to lack of trying,\" he said. The failure lay with the UK's \"elites and our leaders\" who had walked away from their responsibility to tackle the climate crisis, Hallam claimed. A hint perhaps that the group's new focus might be on the political system itself.",
      "JSO has said its last protest \u2013 to be held at the end of April \u2013 will mark \"the end of soup on Van Goghs, cornstarch on Stonehenge and slow marching in the streets\". But don't believe it. When pressed, the JSO members I spoke to said they may well turn back to disruptive tactics but under a new name and with a new and as yet unspecified objective.",

      "The government said it was \"making our streets and online spaces safer for children\" by delivering its Plan for Change.",

      "Those measures have already been introduced. A government spokesperson said those were \"just the beginning\", and more were due to come into effect this year.",
      "But the committee's report said the government should do more, including naming and shaming platforms which fail to comply with the rules, introducing an online safety scorecard to help young people avoid harmful content, and doing more research into the links between online and real-life violence.",
      "While the committee said the act does not go far enough, its report said banning social media for under-16s was not the answer.",
      "Many young people could find ways around age verification methods, and a ban would stop them accessing positive content on social media, the report said.",
      "The committee instead called on the government to hold social media companies to account more effectively.",

      "Bluesky is one of the social media firms gaining ground.",
      "Over the past year, Bluesky has gained tens of millions of new users, often at the expense of X.",
      "Apart from just timing, though, BlueSky's success can be largely attributed to its novel architecture, which pairs an X-like experience with a high degree of customization.",
      "Unlike centralized systems, where social media companies have complete control over content and identities, Bluesky users can choose how their feeds are moderated, and what kind of posts the algorithm recommends to them, thanks to the hundreds of options offered by both Bluesky and the community.",
      "Don't like the broader discourse on Bluesky? Jump on the \"popular with friends\" feed to see what the people you follow specifically are talking about.",
      "It will not be simple for Bluesky to scale up to the size of X and Facebook, says Andy Tattersall, an information specialist at the University of Sheffield.",
      "He ways it will have to strike a balance between \"generating revenue, keeping users safe, and moderating content, which is much easier said than done\".",
      "Celebrity-backed foundation, Free Our Feeds, hopes to do that.",
      "It's backed some notable names, including musician Brian Eno and actor Mark Ruffalo, and plans to raise $30m (\u00a323m) over the next three years to support an open social media ecosystem powered by the AT Protocol, the decentralized network powering Bluesky.",
      "\"Bluesky has created a strong foundation for shared social media infrastructure,\" says Robin Berjonone, one of Free Our Feeds' nine custodians, \"but so long as they are the primary operator of this infrastructure the risk remains that it will stop operating in the public interest\".",
      "A bigger worry for these emerging platforms, though, is the network barrier. This can be summed up with Metcalfe's Law, explains Evan Prodromou, co-author and current editor of ActivityPub, another open social media architecture, which is behind popular platforms like Meta's Threads.",
      "The law states that the value of a network goes up with the square of the number of users. That means that bigger social networks have way more resources than smaller ones. They can use those resources to get bigger and bigger and crowd out smaller social media services.",
      "Non-profits like Free Our Feeds and the Social Web Foundation, which Mr Prodromou heads, have a strategy that they hope will help them overcome that Metcalfe's Law.",
      "They hope to replace the current situation, where users of social media hop between their favourite services.",
      "Instead Social Web Foundation is developing a platform which can offer content from all of them.",
      "Threads for example supports a protocol called ActivityPub, which makes it easier to combine services with other social media firms that use that protocol - like Mastodon for instance.",
      "Using this kind of interoperability, Mr Prodromou hopes that services like Social Web Foundation will provide the same value as giant, monolithic platforms.",
      "It's not straightforward, as not all social media firms support the same protocol, for example, BlueSky uses the AT Protocol.",
      "But there are workarounds to that problem, and Free Our Feeds and Social Web Foundation are also working on ways to aggregate sites that use different tech.",
      "\"One thing we've learnt from the past decades is that the last thing the world needs is a one-size-fits all solution for eight billion people,\" says Robin Berjon, one of Free Our Feeds' custodians.",
      "At the other end of the spectrum are those that want to carve a niche out for themselves, rather than replace the incumbents.",
      "In the last couple of years, a cottage industry of unique, new social apps has cropped.",
      "One of those is Mozi, created by Twitter co-founder Ev Williams. Mozi doesn't want you to socialise online at all.",
      "Instead it informs you when you're going to be in the same place (city or event) as someone you know and encourages you to connect with people more often in person.",
      "\"Until Mozi, no combination of apps could tell me what city my friends are in at any given time, or even what my friends locally are up to,\" says Mozi co-founder, Molly DeWolf Swenson.",
      "Mike McCue, the CEO of Flipboard, is convinced such innovation will result in a new era of social networking, where numerous new, more interesting types of social networks will emerge and offer people more choices.",
      "He hopes that Flipboard's app, Surf will help people manage a messy social media ecosystem. It allows users to browse from a centralized feed that can draw posts and content from a variety of platforms, including Threads, Bluesky, and YouTube.",
      "\"In the end,\" says Mr McCue, \"it's unlikely one service will replace the Facebook or Twitter we once knew, but instead several services will start to take our time away from these old-style single feed experiences, our behaviours will shift with these new choices and new generations will expect more.\"",

      "The US exports less than $300,000 in jam each year to the bloc.",
      "It's an imbalance that US company JM Smucker, one of the biggest sellers of such products in America, blames on a 24%-plus import tax its fruit spreads face in the EU.",
      "\"The miniscule value of US exports to the European Union is entirely attributable to the high EU tariff,\" the company wrote in a letter to the White House this month, asking the Trump administration to address the issue as it prepares to levy \"reciprocal\" tariffs on America's biggest trading partners.",
      "\"Reciprocal US tariffs on EU jams and jellies would serve to level the playing field,\" the company said, noting that the highest US jam tariff is currently just 4.5%.",
      "Globally, Trump's push to deploy tariffs against close trading partners - many of which have average tariff levels similar to America's - has generated anger and bafflement, while drawing warnings from economists about higher prices and other potential economic pain.",
      "Some businesses in the US have echoed those concerns, but Trump's calls for tariffs are also channelling longstanding frustrations many firms feel about foreign competition and policies they face abroad.",
      "Smucker's letter was one of hundreds submitted to the White House, seeking to influence the next set of tariffs, expected to be unveiled on 2 April.",
      "Apple farmers raised the big disparity in import duties their fruit faces in countries such as India (50%), Thailand (40%) and Brazil (10%), as well as sanitary rules in countries such as Australia they said unfairly block their exports.",

      "The oil and natural gas lobby criticised regulations in Mexico that require partnership with the state-owned oil company and other policies.",

      "Trump has suggested that his plan for reciprocal tariffs will help remedy such grievances, pumping up his announcement as \"Liberation Day\".",
      "But even the businesses seeking action on their own issues have expressed hesitation about the president's tariff-first, ask-questions-later strategy, which risks retaliation and a wider trade war.",
      "With 2 April looming, there remains widespread uncertainty about the goals and scope of  White House plans, especially as Trump launches a broadside of other duties.",

      "\"He's used them all at different times - there's not a single thread here that you can rely on.\"",
      "The mismatch between the blunt tool of tariffs and the more niche issues firms want the White House to champion has led to a delicate dance, as businesses suggest tariffs in their own interest, while also hoping to avoid the repercussions of the kind of sweeping duties that Trump has suggested might be on the table.",
      "For example, steel manufacturer NorthStar BlueScope Steel, which employs 700 people in the US melting steel from recycled metal, urged Trump to expand tariffs on steel and aluminium to parts.",
      "At the same time, however, it asked for an exemption for the raw materials it needs, such as scrap metal.",
      "Likewise, the lobby group for JM Smucker and other big food manufacturers, the Consumer Brands Association, warned against \"overly broad and sweeping tariffs\" that might end up making it more expensive for its members to import ingredients like cocoa, which are not made in the US.",
      "\"I don't necessarily want the current administration to say, well, we'll impose a tariff,\" Tom Madrecki, the group's vice president of supply chain resiliency, said at a recent forum about tariffs, hosted by Farmers for Free Trade.",
      "\"It's this careful balance between yes, I want you to take an America First trade policy and action to counter unfair trade policies abroad ... but maybe not quite in that way.\"",
      "Wilbur Ross, who served as Trump's commerce secretary in his first term, said he thought business worries would dissipate as Trump's plans become clear, calling 2 April a \"big step\".",
      "But he noted that the president saw little downside to using tariffs, viewing them as either a source of new revenue, or a way to reduce imports and encourage more manufacturing.",
      "\"He's very committed,\" he said. \"People should have known that something like this was coming because he's been talking about it for many, many years.\"",
      "Republicans, traditionally the pro-trade party, have stayed supportive of Trump's strategy, even as tariff announcements have been blamed for the recent stock market sell-off and weakness in recent surveys of business and consumer confidence.",
      "At a recent hearing on trade, Representative Jodey Arrington, a Republican who represents Texas, acknowledged that there might be \"some pain associated on the front end\" but maintained Trump's focus on the issue would create opportunities for his constituents in the end.",
      "\"It just seems to me that it's un-American to not fight for our American manufacturers, producers and workers to simply have an even playing field,\" he said.",
      "\"We're simply attempting ... to reset those relationships such that we're playing by the same set of rules,\" he added. \"Then everyone wins.\""

    "story": [
      "They say writers are their own worst critics - but for the man who could become the next President of Poland, nothing could be further from the truth.",
      "Karol Nawrocki has been widely ridiculed after it emerged that several years ago he donned a disguise to praise his own book on TV.",
      "Written by a mysterious author called Tadeusz Batyr, the book documented the life of a gangster from 1980s communist Poland.",
      "But it has now been revealed that Tadeusz Batyr was a pseudonym created by Nawrocki, a historian and former museum director who is backed by the right-wing Law and Justice party (PiS) in the upcoming presidential election.",
      "In 2018, Nawrocki appeared on TV as his alter-ego Tadeusz Batyr, disguised in a hat and with his face blurred, and lavished praise on himself.",
      "\"This historian [Karol Nawrocki] actually really inspired me\u2026\" says the blurred figure. \"He was the first person to examine organised crime in communist Poland.\"",
      "Even more embarrassingly for the presidential candidate, a social media post has emerged in which Nawrocki claimed to have met the author.",
      "\"I spent several years studying organised crime\u2026so Tadeusz Batyr contacted me for some guidance,\" reads the post, which is still visible. \"He thanked me for my help with an interesting book, which I recommend.\"",
      "The scandal has led to a storm of mockery on Polish social media, with users wondering whether it would be Tadeusz Batyr or Karol Nawrocki campaigning in the presidential election.",
      "If Nawrocki is concerned about the impact of his deception on the election, he didn't show it when asked to comment on his apparent split personality.",
      "\"Literary pseudonyms are nothing new in Polish academia,\" he said, before going on to praise himself again: \"There was only one historian in Poland who had the courage to study organised crime, and I was that historian. But Tadeusz Batyr had no academic research or sources to refer to.\"",
      "According to the Polish Newsweek magazine, Nawrocki's \"fascination\" with the underworld is well-known. Local media have reported that the historian is acquainted with several figures associated with organised crime and biker gangs in Poland. Nawrocki says any interactions are strictly professional.",
      "He is currently in running second in the presidential race, behind Warsaw mayor Rafal Trzaskowski, who is from Prime Minister Donald Tusk's liberal Civic Coalition party.",
      "In third place is far-right candidate Slawomir Mentzen, who has recently seen a surge in popularity. His Confederation party advocates ultra-low taxes, stopping what it calls \"Leftist ideology\", and an end to immigration.",
      "The results of this election could have reverberations far beyond Warsaw, too.",
      "Poland is a key partner in the West's support for Ukraine. Up to 95% of military aid sent to the country passes through Poland, and around 10,000 US troops are stationed here.",
      "Poland shares borders with both Ukraine and Russia, and is rapidly expanding its armed forces, vowing to spend almost 5% of its GDP on the military this year - the highest among Nato nations.",
      "Nawrocki has blamed \"the decisions of the European elites\" for starting the war in Ukraine. Senior figures in the PiS party, which campaigns for lower taxes and energy security, have accused the EU of plotting to interfere in the election.",
      "\"This election is hugely important,\" says political analyst Marcin Zaborowski. \"[Tusk ally] Trzaskowski is the only candidate that is pro-European, an Atlanticist and supportive of Ukraine. He represents continuation in foreign policy.\"",
      "And this election matters for Poles at home, too. Better abortion access, same-sex marriage and rule of law reform were all promised by Tusk when his coalition came to power in 2023.",
      "But President Andrzej Duda, aligned with PiS, has the power of veto over legislation. That's why, so far, Tusk has been unable to pass any significant reforms.",
      "\"The people who voted for [Tusk], especially first-time voters or women, may be very disappointed,\" says Mr Zaborowski. \"But if Civic Coalition gets a president that supports their programme, that will be a real boost to what this government can do.\"",
      "With less than two months before the first round of voting, Civic Coalition's Trzaskowski remains favourite.",
      "But with the polls narrowing, Nawrocki has been out campaigning energetically - eager to persuade voters that he, and not the shadowy Tadeusz Batyr, should be their choice for president.",

      "The city lies on the strategic Gulf of Aden, on the northern coast of Somaliland. The territory, which declared independence in 1991 as Somalia descended into civil war, says the facilities are not Mogadishu's to give away.",
      "In a letter to US President Donald Trump, seen by Reuters news agency, Somalia's President Hassan Sheikh Mohamud also offered port and airbase within Somalia, saying all four would strengthen US security operations.",

    "summary": "Relatives and friends of people who have disappeared in Antigua speak to the BBC about their anguish.",
    "story": [
      "The worst part is the mental torture, Patricia Joseph says. The \"gut-wrenching\" flashes of wondering what her mother's last moments were. The infinite state of limbo.",
      "Six years after her mother's mysterious disappearance, Patricia still catches herself looking out for the distinctive orange-lined raincoat that Hyacinth Gage, 74, was wearing the day she vanished, in the hope it may hold a clue.",
      "Tragically, Hyacinth is just one of an ever-increasing number of people on the tiny Caribbean island of Antigua to disappear without trace in what some have dubbed an epidemic, others a crisis. At least nine have vanished in the last two years alone.",
      "That day back in May 2019 started out ordinarily enough. Hyacinth, described as sprightly and self-sufficient, had gone for a routine check-up at the public hospital, but failed to return. She has never been seen since.",
      "It was to trigger an excruciating series of fruitless, island-wide searches and desperate appeals for help.",
      "\"We became detectives. My sister and I teamed up to look for leads. I went back to the hospital asking questions,\" Patricia explains.",
      "She was able to verify that while her mother had completed scheduled blood tests, she had not shown up for an electrocardiogram. Further investigations revealed she had apparently handed her handbag briefly to another patient to keep an eye on, but never returned. The bag was found by security staff the next day.",
      "The family were also able to track down a motorist who said she had given Hyacinth a lift to a location a short distance from the hospital.",
      "\"The police got angry at us for investigating and told us to stop,\" Patricia recalls. \"Then they became annoyed at our constant questions, so eventually we had to back off and just pray.\"",
      "Anniversaries are particularly painful: 6 March would have been Hyacinth's 80th birthday, a milestone for which the family had long planned a big celebration. Instead, Patricia took the day off work to spend in quiet reflection.",
      "The number of people to vanish in Antigua appears to be disproportionately high compared with neighbouring islands, Patricia says, a notion supported by sources in several of the islands who spoke to the BBC.",
      "In St Kitts, for example, which has a population of 48,000, official police stats provided show that of the total 54 people reported missing in 2023 and 2024, all but two are accounted for. The remaining two are believed to be Haitian migrants who have since left the country.",
      "Antigua's small size of just 108 sq miles, home to fewer than 100,000 people, makes the phenomenon particularly perplexing.",
      "Read more: Antigua and Barbuda country profile",
      "Read more: Antigua and Barbuda country profile",
      "Speculation is rife. Theories range from the banal - a lack of will to investigate by an under-resourced and under-paid police force - to the sinister.",
      "\"Other islands find bodies eventually,\" Patricia says. \"My mind goes all over the place wondering what happened. People suggest organ trafficking. I've even thought of gang activity. Is it something they're required to do as an initiation?\"",
      "The disappearance of a nine-year-old girl on 12 March sent the nation reeling and sparked extensive searches. Chantel Crump's body was found two days later in a case that has caused widespread public outrage and protests - and sent rumours into overdrive. A woman has been charged with Chantel's murder.",
      "Antigua's Acting Police Commissioner Everton Jeffers acknowledges there is \"room for improvement\" when it comes to the force's public relations, but rejects the idea that it is uncaring.",
      "He also says he is keeping an open mind on the reason for the high number of disappearances, including a possible organ trade operating on the island.",
      "\"It's something we've been hearing and something we will look into. There's no evidence to support it, but it's very important we don't dismiss anything,\" he explains.",
      "Patricia has found some solace in connecting with families of other missing people and now plans to set up an action group to ask for international help.",
      "\"This isn't a random thing any more, this is serious, there's a crisis,\" she adds.",
      "Aaron (not his real name) has collated a list of almost 60 people missing in Antigua \u2013 more than a third in the last decade alone \u2013 and believes there are several more. Men account for roughly two in three of the disappearances, ranging from teenagers to people in their 70s.",
      "\"I've personally experienced this pain. One of my family members went missing and another was murdered,\" he says, speaking on condition of anonymity because of threats he says he has received for highlighting the issue.",
      "\"Families are suffering. Many have gone to their graves without ever seeing justice for their loved ones.",
      "\"While some may have disappeared due to their involvement in criminal activities, there's growing concern that an organised organ harvesting ring could be operating behind the scenes,\" Aaron adds.",
      "Police say they are collating official figures for missing people covering the last two decades but by the time of publication had not provided any figures.",
      "This year has already seen two more.",
      "In late January, Orden David did not return home after a night out at a local casino. Orden's burnt-out car has since been recovered, but there have been few other clues.",
      "Alline Henry recalls Orden as her \"best friend of 23 years\".",
      "\"The worst part is not knowing if he's being held against his will,\" Alline says.",
      "\"Is someone abusing him, torturing him? Every day my thoughts run wild. If, God forbid, it's the worst case scenario, we need closure,\" she adds.",
      "Orden, 39, is well known in Antigua as a key litigant in a landmark 2022 case that overturned legislation criminalising same-sex acts.",
      "\"I can't explain how much it hurts that instead of focussing on the fact he's missing, some people focus on him being gay.",
      "\"I believe the case may have made him a target,\" Alline says sadly.",
      "With swathes of bushland and ocean all around, the ostensible ease of concealing a body in Antigua may partly explain the absence of answers many families suffer.",
      "\"Clearly the local police can't solve these disappearances. They need to bring in outside help. How many more people have to go missing before they do something. Who's next?\" Alline adds.",
      "Keon Richards, 38, who works for the national school meals programme, was last seen leaving work on 26 February. His mother Dian Clarke says she is \"trying to stay positive\", adding: \"You hear about people going missing in the news and then it creeps up on you.\"",
      "With the exception of a 43-year-old woman, all those to vanish without trace in the last two years are men, aged between 18 and 76.",
      "Hindering investigations is the lack of a local forensic lab which means crucial DNA samples must be sent overseas for analysis, equating to lengthy waits for results.",
      "Director of Forensic Services Michael Murrell tells the BBC that a new lab capable of analysing trace evidence such as hair, blood and semen will become operational within months, but admits DNA capabilities are some way off because of meagre finances.",
      "Updated technology cannot come soon enough for some.",
      "Gregory Bailey's son Kevorn, 26, has not been seen since he received a phone call from an unknown person who he apparently left his home to meet in August 2022.",
      "Gregory says the telecoms firm claims to have given the caller's name to police long ago, but \"up to now the police can't tell me who it was\".",
      "His frustration and despair are evident.",
      "\"It's like a part of me is missing. Some people talk about closure, but I couldn't handle seeing him in a coffin; I prefer to picture him alive,\" he says.",
      "\"It's emotionally aggravating to pursue the police. If I don't call them I don't hear anything; if I do, I get sweet nothings,\" he adds. \"I want the government to know people are grieving; I don't know if they appreciate that.",
      "\"I put up missing posters everywhere, but I couldn't put up any around my home; I couldn't bear it. It's the most painful experience of my life.\"",
      "Gregory believes the high number of disappearances is largely due to the extent with which criminal factions get away with murder.",
      "Aaron has also collated a list of more than 100 unsolved killings.",
      "\"People don't trust the police; corruption is rampant in law enforcement,\" Gregory says.",
      "Aaron agrees: \"There've been cases where perpetrators have retaliated against the families of victims when reports were made.\"",
      "Police Chief Jeffers says \"no police force in the world is perfect\". But adds: \"I can guarantee 90% of our officers are good.\"",
      "He also admits limited finances impede investigations.",
      "\"There's no police force in the Caribbean that has enough resources to do everything we have to do.",
      "\"We do a lot to look for people, get leads from the public and follow them up as much as possible. But when there are no leads we can't just go in circles. We need the public's support as much as possible,\" he adds.",
      "For its part, the government has recognised the urgency of the matter and pledged a raft of new measures including the establishment of a designated missing persons' task force and the acquisition of dogs trained to detect cadavers.",
      "Whether that will be enough to appease those desperately awaiting answers remains to be seen.",
      "\"It's time to take serious action,\" Patricia urges. \"I hope this doesn't happen to someone close to them before they take a good fresh look at these disappearances.\""

    "story": [
      "A green shimmer, like a curtain of light being drawn across the night sky, formed beside the impossibly bright stars above Nuuk late on Friday evening.",
      "The appearance of the spectacular northern lights \u2013 a common wonder in these parts \u2013 seemed to mark the end of a hugely significant day in the arctic, one that brought icebound Greenland's hopes and challenges into the sharpest relief.",
      "It was a day in which an acquisitive foreign power had sent an uninvited delegation to the world's largest island with an uncomfortable message.",
      "On a brief visit to a remote US military base in the far north of Greenland, US Vice-President JD Vance may have tried at times to soften his boss's stated aim of simply annexing the autonomous Danish territory.",
      "\"We do not think that military force is ever going to be necessary,\" Vance said, perhaps attempting to sound reassuring.",
      "But the vice-president's overarching message remained stark and intimidating: the world, the climate, and the Arctic region are changing fast, and Greenland needs to wake up to threats posed by an expansionist China; long-standing Western security partnerships have run their course; the only way the island can protect itself, its values and its mineral wealth is by abandoning weak and miserly Danish overlords and turning instead to the muscular and protective embrace of the US.",
      "Ros Atkins on... Trump's plan for Greenland",
      "Greenlanders prepare for uncomfortable visit from US vice-president",
      "Greenland's opposition wins election dominated by independence and Trump",
      "\"We need to wake up from a failed, 40-year consensus that said that we could ignore the encroachment of powerful countries as they expand their ambitions,\" Vance told US troops at America's Pituffik military base.",
      "\"We can't just bury our head in the sand - or, in Greenland, bury our head in the snow - and pretend that the Chinese are not interested in this very large landmass.\"",
      "If you look at a map of the world that has the north pole at its centre, rather than the equator, it is easy to see how Greenland suddenly switches from being an easily overlooked smudge of uninhabited territory and into a key strategic landmass. It is at the heart of what many analysts now accept as an emerging power struggle between China, the US, and Russia, for control of the arctic, its minerals and its shipping lanes.",
      "But the speed and contempt with which the Trump White House has rejected its traditional reliance on Western allies \u2013 Nato in particular \u2013 has left its partners bewildered.",
      "\"Not justifiable,\" was the bristling response of Danish Prime Minister Mette Frederiksen after hearing Vance attack her government as he stood on its sovereign territory.",
      "'Like a threat'",
      "But 1,500km (930 miles) south of the Pituffik base, in Greenland's capital, Nuuk, the American story vied for attention with a very different local event on Friday.",
      "\"We will prevail,\" a smiling crowd sang, at a ceremony to celebrate the formation of a new coalition government for Greenland.",
      "The mood felt mostly joyful and communal, with people locking arms and swaying gently as a band played inside the town's house of culture.",
      "It was a powerful reminder of the shared values that bind Greenland's tiny, and overwhelmingly native Inuit population together - the need for consensus and co-operation in an often hostile natural climate, the desire to protect and celebrate Inuit culture and the wish to be respected by outsiders, be they from familiar but distant Denmark or marginally closer America.",
      "\"There are many ways to say things. But I think the way [Trump] is saying it is not the way. It's like a threat,\" said Lisbeth Karline Poulsen, 43, a local artist attending the ceremony.",
      "Her reaction appeared to capture the broader mood here - a recent poll showed just 6% of the population support the idea of being part of the US.",
      "The journey to independence",
      "Under its new government, and with overwhelming public support, Greenland is beginning a slow, very cautious move towards full independence from Denmark.",
      "It's a process that will likely take many years, and which will involve lengthy dialogue with both Copenhagen and Washington.",
      "After all, Greenlanders well understand that their economy needs to be far more developed if their bid for independence is to stand any realistic chance of success.",
      "But they need to balance that development against realistic fears of exploitation by powerful outside commercial forces.",
      "Which brings us to the fundamental confusion, in Greenland and beyond, about the Trump administration's approach towards their territory.",
      "What does America want?",
      "On his visit, Vance mentioned Greenland's aspirations for independence, and implied that America's real intention was not a sudden annexation of the island, but something far more patient and long-term.",
      "\"Our message is very simple, yes, the people of Greenland are going to have self-determination. We hope that they choose to partner with the United States, because we're the only nation on earth that will respect their sovereignty and respect their security.\"",
      "If that is genuinely the American pitch \u2013 Trump's messaging remains more aggressive than Vance's \u2013 then Greenlanders can surely relax a little and take their time.",
      "There are still large reserves of goodwill towards the US here, and a keen interest in doing more business with American companies.",
      "On the security front, a 74-year-old treaty with Denmark permitting the US to increase its military presence in Greenland at any time \u2013 from new bases to submarine harbours - should surely take care of Washington's concerns about countering the threat from China, just as it did during the Cold War years.",
      "What remains puzzling is Donald Trump's impatience \u2013 the same impatience he's displayed in attempting to negotiate an end to the war in Ukraine.",
      "Short of owning Greenland, America could get everything it desires and needs from this vast island without much difficulty. Instead, many people in Nuuk feel they're being bullied.",
      "It's a deeply counterproductive approach, which has already forced Washington into one humiliating climbdown \u2013 cancelling a planned cultural tour by Vance's wife, Usha, to Nuuk and another town in the face of planned local protests.",
      "A slower, more respectful, behind-the-scenes sort of engagement would, surely, make more sense.",

    "published": "Sun, 30 Mar 2025 01:24:12 GMT",
    "summary": "With UK school fees rising, Nigeria's elite can now choose to give their offspring a British education at home.",
    "story": [
      "For many years, well-off Nigerians have sent their children to prestigious British boarding schools - but now some of those institutions are setting up campuses in Africa's most populous nation.",
      "Last year, Charterhouse launched a primary school in the city of Lagos and will open a secondary school this September.",
      "Rugby School will also begin offering secondary education in September. Other well-known institutions, such as Millfield, Wellington School and Harrow, are also exploring opportunities in Nigeria.",
      "This obviously all comes with a price tag for Nigerian parents - but the country's well-heeled elite have historically sent their children to the UK for secondary education, drawn to the British curriculum's rigour, prestige and global opportunities.",
      "\"I'm actually excited about it,\" says Karima Oyede, a British-Nigerian management consultant, whose son is currently in year 10 at Rugby in the UK but will be moving to its Lagos school in September.",
      "Her family has been meaning to relocate to Nigeria for a while but has not done so earlier because of the children's education.",
      "\"Having the opportunity to experience the British system in his country of origin is the best of both worlds,\" she says.",
      "Nigeria already has a proliferation of private schools but high-quality, internationally recognised education within the country will appeal to many parents, particularly those who wish to preserve their children's cultural identity.",
      "\"African parents love the fact that they are giving their children international standing so they can compete with their counterparts in any other part of the world, but they don't want their children to lose their African-ness,\" says Ijay Uwakwe-Okoronkwo, the founder of Nkuzhi Learning Foundation in Nigeria's capital, Abuja.",
      "The educational consultant, who advises parents and schools on international boarding options, explains the more relaxed, less respectful attitude children return with after going to school abroad is not always appreciated.",
      "This cultural dilemma extends to the growing conversation around LGBTQ issues. Same-sex relationships and public displays of affection are illegal in Nigeria and homosexuality is not openly discussed or promoted.",
      "It is something that the new crop of British schools has taken on board. For example, while Charterhouse UK displays a rainbow flag, the Nigeria school does not.",
      "\"We're a British independent school but sitting firmly within Nigerian cultural needs,\" says John Todd, head of Charterhouse Nigeria.",
      "\"There's this huge concern about Western cultural views.",
      "\"For parents here, we know it's a really big issue. It's a reason parents are worried about the UK schools.",
      "\"I'm not making a judgement - it's just the way it is.\"",
      "British institutions in Nigeria have no choice but to \"follow the law of the land\", he acknowledges, adding: \"We are 100% compliant.\"",
      "Recognising Nigeria's deeply religious society, Charterhouse also permits parents to take their children home from the boarding house for Sunday church services, with the expectation that they return by Monday morning.",
      "There are several reasons behind the growing interest of prestigious British schools in opening campuses in Nigeria.",
      "While regions like the Middle East and China are already saturated with international schools, Africa is relatively virgin territory.",
      "\"Nigeria is the gateway to Africa, and Africa is kind of the last continent for British schools to establish in,\" says Mark Brooks, an export champion for the UK's Department for Business and Trade.",
      "He organises annual events in Nigeria where about 20 British schools meet prospective students and parents.",
      "\"Nigeria has an incredible reputation for producing driven, high-achieving students,\" says Mr Brooks.",
      "\"There is no school I work with that hasn't recently had a Nigerian student serve as head boy or deputy head boy. A student may join the sixth form and end up being the head boy within a year.",
      "\"I've brought hundreds of head teachers to Nigeria over the years, and the word is out in the UK that we need to take Nigeria seriously.\"",
      "Timing has also proved key, as the cost of sending children to the UK has soared. Just three years ago, the exchange rate of the local currency was 500 naira to \u00a31; now it stands at 2,200 naira.",
      "On top of that, the Labour government in the UK recently imposed 20% VAT on private school fees.",
      "Beyond tuition, families face additional expenses like flights for both students and visiting parents.",
      "Establishing these schools in Nigeria allows families to maintain the same standard of education while significantly reducing the financial strain.",
      "The annual fees at Charterhouse UK, for example, are around \u00a360,000 ($78,000), whereas the fees at its Lagos campus are equivalent to approximately \u00a315,000.",
      "\"Our main classroom teachers are expatriates, but 90% of the staff are local,\" says Mr Todd.",
      "By employing local people in roles such as assistant teachers, administration, finance, human resources, marketing, facilities, security, gardeners, drivers, PAs and secretaries, the school can significantly reduce costs compared to the UK, where labour is much more expensive.",
      "A vast education gap already exists in Nigeria, with many parents opting for private education of varying quality. Many struggle to pay the higher fees rather than sending their children to government schools, which are often free but plagued by poorly trained teachers and frequent strikes.",
      "As a result, the arrival of British schools may not drastically change Nigeria's education system.",
      "However, they could pose a threat to established elite schools like the British International School in Lagos and The Regent School in Abuja, which opened in the early 2000s.",
      "Such schools have long been top choices for those able to pay the annual tuition fees that often reach tens of thousands of dollars.",
      "\"Rugby School Nigeria is coming also to support, develop and learn from the schools currently in Nigeria,\" says Mr Brooks, who is in charge of the school's marketing.",
      "\"We are coming to help with partnerships as well, teacher training, and a whole range of initiatives.\"",
      "Mr Todd believes the Nigerian market is large enough to accommodate all the new schools without threatening existing ones. About 40% of the 200 million population is under 14.",
      "He expects the greatest impact to be felt in the UK.",
      "While Charterhouse UK typically has a long waiting list and should not be affected, less sought-after boarding schools may experience a decline in enrolment owing to the new competition in Nigeria.",
      "\"Interest in our secondary school is very strong,\" says Mr Todd. \"We already have Nigerian parents in the UK sending their children to the Charterhouse in Nigeria for September.\"",
      "In fact, reaching out to Nigerians in the UK has been one of their key marketing strategies.",
      "\"You get this premier brand at a lower price, and every Nigerian has an aunt or uncle in Lagos\" who can be a guardian, he adds.",
      "It could be that this trend extends to British universities. Nigeria's tertiary education system faces even greater challenges than its secondary sector, with many students opting to study abroad.",
      "In 2023, Nigeria ranked among the top 10 countries for UK student visas, according to UK government data.",
      "But with foreign exchange difficulties and stricter visa regulations, studying abroad is becoming increasingly challenging - and universities that rely on higher international tuition fees appear to be suffering.",
      "Earlier this month, British MP Helen Hayes, chair of the parliamentary Education Committee, acknowledged the UK's higher education sector was in trouble.",
      "\"Dozens of universities are making redundancies and cuts to courses, trying to stay afloat amid uncertainty over where their money is coming from,\" she said when announcing a session to consider the sector's future.",
      "If enough Nigerian students can no longer go to the UK to study, British universities may find it profitable to come to them, as they have elsewhere in the world.",
      "In fact, Nigeria's premier university, the University of Ibadan, was established in 1948 as a campus of the University of London, with degrees awarded carrying the same value and prestige.",
      "Ms Uwakwe-Okoronkwo believes many Nigerian parents would appreciate this opportunity, as it would allow their children to stay in Nigeria long enough to mature before potentially moving abroad, if they choose to do so.",
      "\"Many parents are worried about sending their children out of the nest too early,\" she says.",
      "For Ms Oyede, whose daughter will also be starting at Rugby School in Lagos come September, the timing of all this could not be better.",
      "She says the British school opening has already been an \"incentive to return home\".",

    "story": [
      "Whether you like the new Snow White film or you hate it, it's hard to escape the debate around its lead actress, Rachel Zegler.",
      "The 23-year-old star has dominated conversation about the film, as people either blame her for its poor reviews or leap to her defence, saying she's being unfairly maligned.",
      "And this debate is not new for Zegler.",
      "Way before Snow White came out, she has been at the centre of the storm, with many criticising her take on the original film and her political views, including those on US President Donald Trump and his voters.",
      "Others defended her, and expressed discomfort at seeing such a young actress suffer a pile-on.",
      "Film critic Kelechi Ehenulo calls Zegler a victim of \"culture wars\", and warns actors from underrepresented backgrounds (Zegler is Latina) often find themselves becoming \"targets for backlash\".",
      "So how did we get to this point \u2013 and where does Zegler go from here?",
      "A blame game",
      "Let's start with the film itself.",
      "Disney's live-action version of the classic fairy tale Snow White was released earlier this month, and has faced a slew of underwhelming reviews (the Observer's Wendy Ide described it as \"toe-curlingly terrible\".) US reviewers have been somewhat more positive \u2013 but despite it topping the North America box office chart, it hasn't made as much money as expected.",
      "On social media, some people have been quick to point their finger at Zegler, arguing she hampered the release.",
      "They include Jonah Platt, the son of Snow White producer Marc Platt. Earlier this week, he took aim at Zegler in a fiery social media post. It has since been deleted, but was screenshotted by multiple outlets including the New York Post.",
      "He said Zegler had \"[dragged] her personal politics\" into the film's promotional campaign, adding: \"Her actions clearly hurt the film's box office.\"",
      "Platt didn't respond to a request for comment from BBC News.",
      "The controversies started much earlier.",
      "Before the film was released, Zegler faced abuse online by people who disagreed with her casting in the role of a character deemed to have skin \"as white as snow\".",
      "Zegler made headlines after her comments, in 2022, about the original film. \"There's a big focus [in the original] on her love story with a guy who literally stalks her. Weird! So we didn't do that this time.\"",
      "Zegler also said the original film was \"extremely dated when it comes to the ideas of women being in roles of power\", adding: \"People are making these jokes about ours being the PC Snow White, where it's like, yeah, it is - because it needed that.\"",

      "Disney holds small-scale Snow White premiere amid controversy",
      "Many saw those words as a rebuke against Disney's tradition.",
      "The Daily Mail branded it a \"woke tirade\" and an article this week in Variety said she \"trashed the beloved original Snow White\".",
      "City AM's film editor Victoria Luxford says criticism of the original film \"was never going to work out well. These films are marketed on nostalgia, on making you feel like you did when you saw the original, so to speak of it negatively seemed puzzling\".",
      "Zegler declined to comment on this piece.",
      "But Anna Smith, film critic and host of the Girls On Film podcast, told BBC News that some of the headlines may have be misleading.",
      "\"Zegler pointed out that times and attitudes have changed, and that the new Snow White has been adapted for the current age. This is the case with many remakes and reboots, many of which do not make the headlines with comments about 'woke' culture.\"",
      "Zegler's political views have also sparked a backlash.",
      "Last summer, she thanked fans for their response to the film's trailer in a post on X, adding, \"and always remember, free Palestine\".",
      "According to the Variety article, Marc Platt - mentioned above - flew to New York to speak directly with Zegler after the post.",
      "Neither Zegler nor Platt have responded to a request for a comment on that.",
      "Zegler also stoked controversy with her views after the 2024 US presidential election. Writing on Instagram, she said she hoped \"Trump voters and Trump himself never know peace\".",
      "She later apologised for what she had said.",
      "Some commend her for speaking her mind. Ehenulo says that she is \"not the first and certainly not the last actor to be speaking about politics\".",
      "And Luxford told me she was \"hard-pressed\" to imagine the film's core audience, children under 10, being swayed by her politics.",

      "The timing of the film also didn't help, he added.",
      "\"Ultimately, [Zegler] became a lightning rod for controversy, not just due to her own actions, but because Snow White landed at the intersection of Hollywood's creative stagnation, racial politics, international conflict, and America's deep ideological divide,\" he said.",
      "'Targets for backlash'",
      "Some, like Luxford, argue that some of the pile-on comes from \"a place of prejudice\".",
      "\"She's a young Latina woman with political opinions that don't align with certain groups, who are quick to voice their anger,\" she said.",
      "Zegler is far from the first young female actress to find herself facing a toxic backlash. Recently, Stranger Things actor Millie Bobby Brown criticised press articles about her appearance, saying \"this isn't journalism, this is bullying\".",
      "Smith notes that women in positions of prominence are more likely to be targeted in this way.",

    "story": [
      "For decades, the gamchha has been a ubiquitous presence on Indian streets.",
      "The traditional scarf, made out of a red-and-white chequered piece of fabric, is used as a towel, pillow, turban, eye mask and even a shoulder drape, mostly by the working classes in West Bengal state and other regions of the country.",
      "But an exhibition in India's capital Delhi, that concluded two weeks ago, has highlighted the history of the ordinary fabric in a unique way.",
      "Titled Gamchha: From the Ordinary to the Extraordinary, it displayed more than 250 pieces of the short drape from 14 Indian states to show the variations of the scarf-towel across regions.",
      "From white gamchhas from Kerala with pencil-thin coloured borders, Ikat-woven ones from Odisha to Assam's cotton \"gamusa\" with red swans and large floral patterns, the interpretations varied from mill-made to hand-woven.",
      "\"The show is about speaking up for a social equality symbol that the garment can evoke, even after decades of being left out from the discourse,\" said textiles expert Jaya Jaitly, the founder of the Dastkari Haat Samiti, a crafts organisation which presented this show.",
      "The exhibition is part of a series of shows and endeavours, held in the past few months, that seek to redefine our understanding of Indian textiles by taking it in new directions.",
      "From rich woven silks, patterned brocades and intricate chintz to a range of less talked-about textiles, India's contribution to the global textile industry is unique.",
      "But despite the recognition, including at some of the world's largest museums, its documentation has been exclusionary and has not kept up with the contemporary practices within the industry.",
      "Until now.",
      "Held by art and craft foundations and curated by researchers in collaboration with private collectors and museums, a number of new exhibitions are sparking something of a renaissance within the industry.",
      "It's a departure from the more popular, glamourised take on fashion - there are no crowd-pulling Bollywood stars opening the show, or sponsored after-parties. And the venues are often away from big cities.",
      "Instead, the focus is on moving away from urban designers - most of whom are trained in elite colleges in India and abroad - and bring local artisans directly into the fold.",
      "These exhibitions are leading towards \"technology-prompted egalitarianism\" in the textiles ecosystem, says Ritu Sethi, founder of India's Crafts Revival Trust. \"Because of Instagram and other digital platforms, the anonymity around craftspeople is also shedding off,\" she says.",
      "What was once a small community of curators and patrons, has now grown to include experts from various fields, including art and architecture.",
      "Together, they want to take the history of textiles beyond its extolled richness - associated with the grandeur of palaces, and fineries of ceremonial rituals and weddings - to include diverse cloth-making traditions and the people behind it.",
      "The sculpting of a more inclusive contemporary identity is, according to acclaimed designer David Abraham, a homecoming and \"a reclamation of pride and value\".",
      "\"For Indians, the relationship with textiles is deep-rooted. We express ourselves culturally through colours, weaves and fabric and each of these has a meaning assigned to it. These shows are reaffirming a value in our system,\" he says.",
      "Consider these instances. Textiles of Bengal: A Shared Legacy, on display in Kolkata until the end of March, highlights the historic uniqueness of the textile traditions of undivided Bengal.",
      "On display are some never-seen-before fabrics and garments from the 17th Century to now. There are cotton sarees and dhotis (drapes worn by men) that showcase the region's famed hand weaving traditions such as Jamdani, which continues to be a sought-after fabric even today. Then, there are rare Indo-Portuguese embroideries and some Haji Rumals - embroidered religious cloth once exported to Indonesia and parts of the Arab world as a headdress for men.",
      "The programme includes talks and demonstrations of craft techniques as well as cultural performances - noted dancer Purnima Ghosh performed at one of the sessions dressed in a hand-painted Batik sari. Batik involves drawing designs on fabric with hot liquid wax and a metal object. Artists then use fine brushes to paint dyes within the wax outlines.",
      "\"The goal is to bring back attention to Bengal's shared legacy with Bangladesh, be it textiles, techniques, skills and trades, as well as narrative histories, culture and food, the shifting geographies notwithstanding, \"says Darshan Mekani Shah, founder of Weavers Studio Resource Centre, which is holding the exhibition.",
      "Elsewhere, curators are trying to introduce a more nuanced understanding of the history of textiles in India, including the ways in which it has been influenced by larger social realities of caste and class struggles.",
      "Take Pampa: Textiles of Karnataka presented by the Abheraj Baldota Foundation that concluded earlier this month in Hampi, a Unesco World Heritage Site. Among the hundreds of textiles on display there was the embroidery work of the Lambanis, a local nomadic tribe; the Kaudi quilts created by the Siddhi community of the state, which traces its origins to Africa; as well as sacred textiles made for Buddhist monasteries.",
      "Through these depictions, the show tries to tell the histories of the nomadic, tribal and agrarian communities for whom resilient survival was the leitmotif and cloth a way of narrating their marginalised experiences.",
      "And it's not just all about history - some exhibitions highlight the future of the industry too, as designers find new and innovative ways of imagining traditional textiles in a contemporary idiom.",
      "For instance, the recently concluded Surface: An Exhibition of Indian Embroideries and Surface Embellishment as Art, goes beyond apparel and home decor and spotlights the ways textiles are also being used in paintings, drawings, art installations and sculptures.",
      "The show, organised by Sutrakala Foundation and held around a stepwell in the old city of Jodhpur, featured a set of textile art pieces made by renowned contemporary painter Manisha Parekh.",
      "These shows also play an important role in updating the history of textiles by rigorously documenting it.",
      "\"Even some of the country's biggest fashion institutes do not have an archive of our textiles,\" says Lekha Poddar, co-founder of Devi Art Foundation, which has supported nine exhibitions on textiles in the past decade.",
      "The Devi Art Foundation's recent project, titled, Pehchaan: Enduring Themes in Indian Textiles, has tried to bridge that gap.",
      "Presented in collaboration with Delhi's National Museum, the show featured a survey of visual and material ideas that have recurred in Indian textiles for more than 500 years, with the oldest exhibit ranging from the 14th and 15th Centuries.",
      "\"How will young designers find inspiration for their work if they are not aware of their own histories and don't have visual references for it?\" Ms Poddar asks.",
      "The success of these shows has made organisers hopeful about its future.",
      "The next few years will be all about furthering this creative ecology, says Mayank Mansingh Kaul, who has served as curatorial adviser to 20 such exhibitions in the last 10 years.",

      "The worst part is the mental torture, Patricia Joseph says. The \"gut-wrenching\" flashes of wondering what her mother's last moments were. The infinite state of limbo.",
      "Six years after her mother's mysterious disappearance, Patricia still catches herself looking out for the distinctive orange-lined raincoat that Hyacinth Gage, 74, was wearing the day she vanished, in the hope it may hold a clue.",
      "Tragically, Hyacinth is just one of an ever-increasing number of people on the tiny Caribbean island of Antigua to disappear without trace in what some have dubbed an epidemic, others a crisis. At least nine have vanished in the last two years alone.",
      "That day back in May 2019 started out ordinarily enough. Hyacinth, described as sprightly and self-sufficient, had gone for a routine check-up at the public hospital, but failed to return. She has never been seen since.",
      "It was to trigger an excruciating series of fruitless, island-wide searches and desperate appeals for help.",
      "\"We became detectives. My sister and I teamed up to look for leads. I went back to the hospital asking questions,\" Patricia explains.",
      "She was able to verify that while her mother had completed scheduled blood tests, she had not shown up for an electrocardiogram. Further investigations revealed she had apparently handed her handbag briefly to another patient to keep an eye on, but never returned. The bag was found by security staff the next day.",
      "The family were also able to track down a motorist who said she had given Hyacinth a lift to a location a short distance from the hospital.",
      "\"The police got angry at us for investigating and told us to stop,\" Patricia recalls. \"Then they became annoyed at our constant questions, so eventually we had to back off and just pray.\"",
      "Anniversaries are particularly painful: 6 March would have been Hyacinth's 80th birthday, a milestone for which the family had long planned a big celebration. Instead, Patricia took the day off work to spend in quiet reflection.",
      "The number of people to vanish in Antigua appears to be disproportionately high compared with neighbouring islands, Patricia says, a notion supported by sources in several of the islands who spoke to the BBC.",
      "In St Kitts, for example, which has a population of 48,000, official police stats provided show that of the total 54 people reported missing in 2023 and 2024, all but two are accounted for. The remaining two are believed to be Haitian migrants who have since left the country.",
      "Antigua's small size of just 108 sq miles, home to fewer than 100,000 people, makes the phenomenon particularly perplexing.",
      "Read more: Antigua and Barbuda country profile",
      "Read more: Antigua and Barbuda country profile",
      "Speculation is rife. Theories range from the banal - a lack of will to investigate by an under-resourced and under-paid police force - to the sinister.",
      "\"Other islands find bodies eventually,\" Patricia says. \"My mind goes all over the place wondering what happened. People suggest organ trafficking. I've even thought of gang activity. Is it something they're required to do as an initiation?\"",
      "The disappearance of a nine-year-old girl on 12 March sent the nation reeling and sparked extensive searches. Chantel Crump's body was found two days later in a case that has caused widespread public outrage and protests - and sent rumours into overdrive. A woman has been charged with Chantel's murder.",
      "Antigua's Acting Police Commissioner Everton Jeffers acknowledges there is \"room for improvement\" when it comes to the force's public relations, but rejects the idea that it is uncaring.",
      "He also says he is keeping an open mind on the reason for the high number of disappearances, including a possible organ trade operating on the island.",
      "\"It's something we've been hearing and something we will look into. There's no evidence to support it, but it's very important we don't dismiss anything,\" he explains.",
      "Patricia has found some solace in connecting with families of other missing people and now plans to set up an action group to ask for international help.",
      "\"This isn't a random thing any more, this is serious, there's a crisis,\" she adds.",
      "Aaron (not his real name) has collated a list of almost 60 people missing in Antigua \u2013 more than a third in the last decade alone \u2013 and believes there are several more. Men account for roughly two in three of the disappearances, ranging from teenagers to people in their 70s.",
      "\"I've personally experienced this pain. One of my family members went missing and another was murdered,\" he says, speaking on condition of anonymity because of threats he says he has received for highlighting the issue.",
      "\"Families are suffering. Many have gone to their graves without ever seeing justice for their loved ones.",
      "\"While some may have disappeared due to their involvement in criminal activities, there's growing concern that an organised organ harvesting ring could be operating behind the scenes,\" Aaron adds.",
      "Police say they are collating official figures for missing people covering the last two decades but by the time of publication had not provided any figures.",
      "This year has already seen two more.",
      "In late January, Orden David did not return home after a night out at a local casino. Orden's burnt-out car has since been recovered, but there have been few other clues.",
      "Alline Henry recalls Orden as her \"best friend of 23 years\".",
      "\"The worst part is not knowing if he's being held against his will,\" Alline says.",
      "\"Is someone abusing him, torturing him? Every day my thoughts run wild. If, God forbid, it's the worst case scenario, we need closure,\" she adds.",
      "Orden, 39, is well known in Antigua as a key litigant in a landmark 2022 case that overturned legislation criminalising same-sex acts.",
      "\"I can't explain how much it hurts that instead of focussing on the fact he's missing, some people focus on him being gay.",
      "\"I believe the case may have made him a target,\" Alline says sadly.",
      "With swathes of bushland and ocean all around, the ostensible ease of concealing a body in Antigua may partly explain the absence of answers many families suffer.",
      "\"Clearly the local police can't solve these disappearances. They need to bring in outside help. How many more people have to go missing before they do something. Who's next?\" Alline adds.",
      "Keon Richards, 38, who works for the national school meals programme, was last seen leaving work on 26 February. His mother Dian Clarke says she is \"trying to stay positive\", adding: \"You hear about people going missing in the news and then it creeps up on you.\"",
      "With the exception of a 43-year-old woman, all those to vanish without trace in the last two years are men, aged between 18 and 76.",
      "Hindering investigations is the lack of a local forensic lab which means crucial DNA samples must be sent overseas for analysis, equating to lengthy waits for results.",
      "Director of Forensic Services Michael Murrell tells the BBC that a new lab capable of analysing trace evidence such as hair, blood and semen will become operational within months, but admits DNA capabilities are some way off because of meagre finances.",
      "Updated technology cannot come soon enough for some.",

      "Gregory says the telecoms firm claims to have given the caller's name to police long ago, but \"up to now the police can't tell me who it was\".",
      "His frustration and despair are evident.",
      "\"It's like a part of me is missing. Some people talk about closure, but I couldn't handle seeing him in a coffin; I prefer to picture him alive,\" he says.",
      "\"It's emotionally aggravating to pursue the police. If I don't call them I don't hear anything; if I do, I get sweet nothings,\" he adds. \"I want the government to know people are grieving; I don't know if they appreciate that.",
      "\"I put up missing posters everywhere, but I couldn't put up any around my home; I couldn't bear it. It's the most painful experience of my life.\"",
      "Gregory believes the high number of disappearances is largely due to the extent with which criminal factions get away with murder.",
      "Aaron has also collated a list of more than 100 unsolved killings.",
      "\"People don't trust the police; corruption is rampant in law enforcement,\" Gregory says.",
      "Aaron agrees: \"There've been cases where perpetrators have retaliated against the families of victims when reports were made.\"",
      "Police Chief Jeffers says \"no police force in the world is perfect\". But adds: \"I can guarantee 90% of our officers are good.\"",
      "He also admits limited finances impede investigations.",
      "\"There's no police force in the Caribbean that has enough resources to do everything we have to do.",
      "\"We do a lot to look for people, get leads from the public and follow them up as much as possible. But when there are no leads we can't just go in circles. We need the public's support as much as possible,\" he adds.",
      "For its part, the government has recognised the urgency of the matter and pledged a raft of new measures including the establishment of a designated missing persons' task force and the acquisition of dogs trained to detect cadavers.",
      "Whether that will be enough to appease those desperately awaiting answers remains to be seen.",
      "\"It's time to take serious action,\" Patricia urges. \"I hope this doesn't happen to someone close to them before they take a good fresh look at these disappearances.\""

      "Even though the south-east Asian nation is a high risk region for earthquakes, neighbouring Thailand and China - which were also affected by the quake - are not.",
      "The Thai capital, Bangkok, sits more than 1,000km (621 miles) from the epicentre of Friday's earthquake - and yet an unfinished high-rise building in the city was felled by it.",
      "Here we will explain what caused this earthquake, and how it was able to have such a powerful effect so far away.",
      "Follow updates on this story",
      "Follow updates on this story",
      "What caused the earthquake?",
      "The earth's upper layer is split into different sections, called tectonic plates, which are all moving constantly. Some move alongside each other, whilst others are above and below each other.",
      "It is this movement that causes earthquakes and volcanoes.",
      "Myanmar is considered to be one of the most geologically \"active\" areas in the world because it sits on top of the convergence of four of these tectonic plates - the Eurasian plate, the Indian plate, the Sunda plate and the Burma microplate.",
      "The Himalayas were formed by the Indian plate colliding with the Eurasian plate, and the 2004 Tsunami as a result of the Indian plate moving beneath the Burma microplate.",
      "Dr Rebecca Bell, a reader in tectonics at Imperial College London, said that to accommodate all of this motion, faults - cracks in the rock - form which allow tectonic plates to \"slither\" sideways.",
      "There is a major fault called the Sagaing fault, which cuts right through Myanmar north to south and is more than 1,200km (746 miles) long.",
      "Early data suggests that the movement that caused Friday's 7.7-magnitude earthquake was a \"strike-slip\" - where two blocks move horizontally along each other.",
      "This aligns with the movement typical of the Sagaing fault.",
      "As the plates move past each other, they can become stuck, building friction until it is suddenly released and the earth shifts, causing an earthquake.",
      "Why was the earthquake felt so far away?",
      "Earthquakes can happen at up to 700km (435 miles) below the surface. This one was just 10km from the surface, making it very shallow. This increases the amount of shaking at the surface.",
      "The earthquake was also very large - measuring 7.7 on the moment scale. It produced more energy than the atomic bomb dropped on Hiroshima, according to the US Geological Survey.",
      "The size of the earthquake was because of the type of fault, said Dr Bell.",
      "\"The straight nature [of the fault] means earthquakes can rupture over large areas - and the larger the area of the fault that slips, the larger the earthquake,\" she explained.",
      "\"There have been six magnitude 7 or greater earthquakes in this region in the last century.\"",
      "This straight fault also means a lot of the energy can be carried down its length - which extends for 1200km south towards Thailand.",
      "How earthquakes are felt at the surface is also determined by the type of soil.",
      "In soft soil - which is what Bangkok is built on - seismic waves (the vibrations of the earth) slow down and build up, getting bigger in size.",
      "So Bangkok's geology would have made the ground shaking more intense.",
      "Why did just one skyscraper collapse in Bangkok?",
      "While dramatic footage has emerged of high-rise buildings in Bangkok swaying during the quake - knocking water from rooftop pools - the unfinished headquarters for the auditor-general's office Bangkok's Chatuhak district appears to be the only skyscraper to collapse.",
      "Prior to 2009, Bangkok did not have a comprehensive safety standard for constructing buildings to withstand earthquakes, according to Dr Christian M\u00e1laga-Chuquitaype, a senior lecturer in earthquake engineering at Imperial College London.",
      "This means that older buildings would have been particularly vulnerable.",
      "This is not unusual, as earthquake-resistant buildings can be more expensive to construct and Thailand, unlike Myanmar, does not frequently experience earthquakes.",
      "Dr Emily So, a professor of architectural engineering at the University of Cambridge, noted that older buildings can and have been strengthened, such as in California, western Canada and New Zealand.",
      "Prof Amorn Pimarnmas, president of the Structural Engineers Association of Thailand, said that while there were regulations in 43 provinces on earthquake-proofing buildings, less than 10% of buildings are estimated to be quake-resistant.",
      "Yet the building that collapsed was new - in fact, it was still under construction when the earthquake hit - and the updated building standards would have applied.",

      "He added: \"However, there are other assumptions such as material (concrete and reinforcements) quality and some irregularity in [the] structural system. These remain to be investigated in detail.\"",
      "Having studied the video, Dr M\u00e1laga-Chuquitaype said it appears a \"flat slab\" construction process was being favoured - which is no longer recommended in earthquake-prone areas.",
      "\"A 'flat slab' system is a way of constructing buildings where floors are made to rest directly on columns, without using beams,\" he explained.",

      "Although Myanmar regularly experiences earthquakes, Dr Ian Watkinson, a lecturer in earth sciences at Royal Holloway University, thought it was unlikely that many buildings were constructed to be earthquake-proof.",
      "\"General poverty, major political upheaval, alongside other disasters - e.g. the Indian Ocean tsunami in 2004 - has distracted the country from concentrating on the unpredictable risks from earthquakes,\" he said.",
      "\"This means that, in many cases, building design codes are not enforced, and construction happens in areas that could be prone to enhanced seismic risk, for example flood plains and steep slopes.\"",
      "Parts of Mandalay and its buildings also lie along the floodplain of the Ayerwaddy River. This makes them very vulnerable to a process called liquefaction.",
      "This happens when the soil has a high water content, and the shaking causes the sediment to lose its strength and behave like a liquid. This increases the risk of landslides and building collapses, as the ground can no longer hold them up.",
      "Dr So warned that there was \"always a chance\" of further damage to buildings near a fault line due to aftershocks - tremors that follow an earthquake, which can be caused by the sudden transfer of energy into nearby rock.",

      "They are measured on a scale called the Moment Magnitude Scale (Mw). This has replaced the Richter scale, now considered outdated and less accurate.",
      "The number attributed to an earthquake represents a combination of the distance the fault line has moved and the force that moved it.",
      "A tremor of 2.5 or less usually cannot be felt, but can be detected by instruments. Quakes of up to five are felt and cause minor damage. The Myanmar earthquake at 7.7 is classified as major and usually causes serious damage, as it has in this instance.",

      "This earthquake and its aftershocks were relatively shallow - about 10km in depth.",
      "That means the impact on the surface is likely to have been more devastating than a deeper earthquake, with buildings shaken much harder and more likely to collapse.",
      "On 26 December 2004, one of the largest earthquakes ever recorded struck off the coast of Indonesia, triggering a tsunami that swept away entire communities around the Indian Ocean. That 9.1 magnitude quake killed about 228,000 people.",

      "In the US, there are 908 motor vehicles per 1,000 people. About 92% of households own a vehicle.",
      "Car ownership is typically higher in the US than in Europe, surveys suggest, partly because, in the absence of extensive public transport, many Americans have no other choice of how to get around.",

      "But the tariffs are likely to impact the domestic car industry as well.",
      "US auto manufacturing has been deeply intertwined with industries in Canada and Mexico for decades. Parts criss-cross the borders several times before they are assembled, which means that even a vehicle as iconically American as a Ford pickup truck could see a sticker price increase.",

    "story": [
      "President Trump on Thursday signed an\u00a0executive order\u00a0targeting funding for programs at the\u00a0Smithsonian Institution\u00a0that contain what he characterizes as \"divisive, race-centered ideology\" in his latest broadside against a liberalism that has critiqued Western culture and values.",
      "The president said in the order that there has been a \"concerted and widespread\" effort over the past decade to rewrite American history by replacing \"objective facts\" with a \"distorted narrative driven by ideology rather than truth.\" He said this narrative has cast the \"founding principles\" of the U.S. in a \"negative light.\"",
      "\"The Smithsonian Institution has, in recent years, come under the influence of a divisive, race-centered ideology,\" Mr. Trump said in the order. \"This shift has promoted narratives that portray American and Western values as inherently harmful and oppressive.\" He pointed to a sculpture exhibit at the Smithsonian American Art Museum representing that \"[s]ocieties including the United States have used race to establish and maintain systems of power, privilege, and disenfranchisement.\"",
      "The order tasks Vice President JD Vance, who serves on the Smithsonian Institution's Board of Regents, with overseeing efforts to \"remove improper ideology\" from all areas of the institution, including its museums, education and research centers and the National Zoo.",
      "It marks Mr. Trump's latest salvo against cultural pillars of society, such as universities and art, that he sees as out of step with conservative sensibilities. He recently had himself installed as chairman of the John F. Kennedy Center for the Performing Arts with the aim of overhauling programming, including the annual Kennedy Center Honors awards show. The administration also recently forced Columbia University to make a series of policy changes by threatening the Ivy League school with the loss of several hundred million dollars in federal funding.",
      "The executive order also hints at the return of statues and monuments of Confederate figures, many of which were taken down or replaced around the country after the police killing of George Floyd in Minneapolis in 2020 and the rise of the Black Lives Matter movement, which is detested by Trump and other conservatives.",
      "The president directed the secretary of the interior to determine whether, since Jan. 1, 2020, \"public monuments, memorials, statues, markers, or similar properties within the Department of the Interior's jurisdiction have been removed or changed to perpetuate a false reconstruction of American history, inappropriately minimize the value of certain historical events or figures, or include any other improper partisan ideology.\"",
      "The order also calls for improvements to Independence Hall in Philadelphia by July 4, 2026, in time for the 250th anniversary of the signing of the Declaration of Independence.",
      "Mr. Trump singled out the National Museum of African American History and Culture, which opened in 2016 near the White House, the Women's History Museum, which is in development, and the American Art Museum for criticism.",
      "\"Museums in our Nation's capital should be places where individuals go to learn \u2014 not to be subjected to ideological indoctrination or divisive narratives that distort our shared history,\" he said in the order.",
      "Linda St. Thomas, the Smithsonian Institution's chief spokesperson, said in an email late Thursday, \"We have no comment for now.\"",
      "Under the order, Vance is to work with the White House budget office to make sure future funding for the Smithsonian Institution isn't spent on programs that \"degrade shared American values, divide Americans based on race, or promote programs or ideologies inconsistent with federal law and policy.\" The president also wants to ensure that the women's history museum celebrates women and not \"recognize men as women in any respect.\"",
      "The Smithsonian Institution is the world's largest museum, education and research complex. It consists of 21 museums and the National Zoo. Eleven museums are located along the National Mall in Washington.",
      "The institution was established by Congress with money from James Smithson, a British scientist who left his estate to the United States to found \"at Washington, under the name of the Smithsonian Institution, an establishment for the increase and diffusion of knowledge.\"",

It's one where you can go and vent and let your hair down, hopefully in a safe manner. Fingers crossed, no bottles or pigs' hooves.\"",
      "Carter fronted the Sex Pistols last year for a few U.K. dates. The band said they did not reach out to Lydon to see if he wanted to participate in this reunion tour.",
      "\"The last thing he wants to do is have anything to do with us right now,\" Jones said, referring to a previous lawsuit between the singer and the band over music use in\u00a0their TV series \"Pistol.\"\u00a0The judge ruled against Lydon's opposition.",
      "\"We wish him the best,\" Jones said.",
      "\"Good luck to him,\" Matlock added. \"I wish he thinks, maybe, 'good luck' to us. Probably doesn't. But over the years, John (has had) all our phone numbers, and I can't see many missed calls from him.\"",
      "As for the 2025 tour: Fans shouldn't expect the violence of their 1978 run, but they should anticipate a tighter performance.",
      "\"We're a bit older but we play just as well, if not better,\" Matlock said. \"And I think that's something that's got a great deal of aplomb that we're going to bring to the public over there.\"",
      "Does this mean there could be new Sex Pistols music in the future? \"It's early days,\" Jones said. \"Let's see what happens.\"",

      "The iconic Sundance Film Festival will be moving from Park City, Utah to Boulder, Colorado, starting in 2027, the festival and the Colorado Governor's Office announced on Thursday.",
      "The search for a new host city has been years in the making, with the festival announcing the search in 2023 and several cities, including Boulder, as possible new hosts being announced last year.",
      "\"Colorado is thrilled to welcome the Sundance Film Festival to its new home in Boulder starting in 2027,\" Colorado Gov. Jared Polis said in a statement. \"Here in our state we celebrate the arts and film industry as a key economic driver, job creator, and important contributor to our thriving culture. Now, with the addition of the iconic Sundance Film Festival, we can expect even more jobs, a huge benefit for our small businesses including stores and restaurants.\"",
      "\"This decision was informed by a detailed evaluation of the key components essential to creating our Festival. During the process, it became clear that Boulder is the ideal location in which to build our Festival's future, marking a key strategic step in its natural evolution,\" Sundance Institute Board Chair  Ebs Burnough said.",
      "The Sundance Film Festival takes place every January. The Boulder Film Festival will likely be pushed back by about a month, officials behind that festival previously told CBS News Colorado.",
      "Utah was home to the international film festival for 42 years, but festival organizers said the festival has outgrown its home.",
      "Since entering the selection process, state and local leaders in Colorado have mounted considerable efforts to get the festival moved to Boulder, citing the city's concentration of artists, its history of culture, and the revenue benefits to the city and state.",
      "\"I founded the Sundance Institute with a commitment to discovering and developing independent artists, with the Sundance Film Festival serving as the platform for stories to help expand audiences and broaden the landscape,\" Robert Redford, Sundance Institute president and founder, said in a statement. \"This move will ensure that the Festival continues its work of risk taking, supporting innovative storytellers, fostering independence, and entertaining and enlightening audiences. I am grateful to the Boulder community for its support, and I look forward to seeing what the future holds for the Festival there.\"",
      "As part of Boulder's efforts to attract Sundance, the state legislature is considering up to $34 million in refundable tax credits, which would kick in by 2027, when Sundance is set to relocate here. Some state lawmakers oppose that move, however, with one saying it was unfair to ask the entire state to subsidize what would largely only benefit one community.",
      "Nonetheless, the efforts didn't stop there. City leaders in Boulder previously said that local hotels have already committed to capping room price increases during the 11-day event.",
      "\"Our walkable downtown, iconic venues, and beautiful landscape at the base of the Rocky Mountains sets the stage for the Sundance Film Festival to flourish in its next chapter,\" said Charlene Hoffman, CEO of Visit Boulder. \"It's been a remarkable experience getting to share our vibrant community with the Sundance Institute and we eagerly await the Festival's debut in beautiful Boulder, Colorado with excitement and gratitude.\"",
      "A study by the State of Utah found Sundance had nearly 73,000 attendees in 2024, generating $132 million in economic output, $14 million in tax revenue, and $70 million in wages.",
      "\"Boulder is an art town, tech town, mountain town, and college town. It is a place where the Festival can build and flourish. This is the beginning of a bold, new journey as we invite everyone to be part of our community and to be entertained and inspired,\" the Sundance Institute's acting CEO Amanda Kelso said. \"We can't imagine a better fit than Boulder.\"",

    "story": [
      "Paris\u00a0\u2014 French cinema icon G\u00e9rard Depardieu is in court in Paris this week, accused of sexually assaulting two women in 2021. A set designer, 34, and an assistant producer, 54, claim the actor grabbed and groped them while filming \"Les Volets Verts\" (\"The Green Shutters\") in Paris in August and September 2021.",
      "Taking the stand Tuesday for the first time, Depardieu told the court he was nothing like the man described by the two women.",
      "\"I don't see why I would grope a woman, her buttocks, her breasts,\" he said. \"I'm not somebody who rubs himself up against people on the metro.\"",
      "The actor said it was \"very emotional\" being in court.",
      "The two women did not immediately report the alleged offenses. However, after the actor published an open letter in Le Figaro newspaper in October 2023 in which he stated: \"Never, never have I abused a woman,\" the set designer went to the police. She reported Depardieu for alleged sexual assault, sexual harassment and sexist insults.",
      "The trial first opened in October, but it was adjourned due to Depardieu's failing health. His lawyer told the court the 76-year-old was diabetic and had recently undergone a quadruple-bypass heart surgery.",
      "Medical experts later deemed him fit to attend the trial, but limited the hearings to six hours per day, with a provision for 15-minute pauses if Depardieu needed them. The trial that opened Monday was scheduled to run for only two days, but it may go longer if his health requires breaks in the proceedings.",
      "Depardieu was in court for the trial's opening on Monday. As they walked in together, his lawyer told reporters the actor was happy to have the chance to present his side.",
      "\"G\u00e9rard Depardieu is someone who is very free, who can be extremely direct,\" said his lawyer J\u00e9r\u00e9mie Assous, who dismissed the accusations as \"lies.\"",
      "Dozens of protesters, mostly women, gathered outside the courthouse, denouncing what they called endemic sexism and impunity for sex offenders in French cinema and French society. They told reporters they were pleased the actor was finally in court to answer the allegations, and waved placards with messages including: \"Victims, we believe you; rapists, we see you\"; \"Touch one, you answer to all\".",
      "A giant of French cinema, Depardieu has been more infamous than famous in recent years. He's been accused of sexual misconduct by more than a dozen women in the movie industry. Many of the claims surfaced years after the alleged incidents took place, however, so under French law the actor cannot be tried for them.",
      "In a high-profile move, the actor left his native France for a few years about a decade ago, moving to Belgium, having criticized French tax increases.",
      "Depardieu has been open about his admiration for Russia under autocratic President Vladimir Putin, who bestowed Russian citizenship on him in 2013.",
      "He later also became a citizen of Dubai.",

    "story": [
      "With stars like Denzel Washington and Jake Gyllenhaal, maybe it's no wonder \"Othello\" just became the highest-grossing Broadway play ever, pulling in $2.8 million in a single week.",
      "Washington said, \"It's the most excited I've been this century. Seriously. I haven't been this excited about anything I've done as I am about this.\"",
      "That's saying something coming from Washington. Known for roles in films like \"Glory\" and \"Training Day\" (both of which won him Oscars), he's been called the greatest actor of the 21st century. But be careful before you call him a \"Hollywood actor.\"",
      "\"What's the definition of a Hollywood actor?\" he said. \"Myself, I'm from Mt. Vernon, so I'm a 'Mt. Vernon actor.' I don't know what 'Hollywood' means.\"",
      "\"Somebody who's famous on film? A film actor, great success on film?\"",
      "\"I'm a stage actor who does film; it's not the other way around,\" Washington said. \"I did stage first. I learned how to act on stage, not on film. Movies are a filmmaker's medium. You shoot it, and then you're gone and they cut together and add music and do all of that. Theater is an actor's medium. The curtain goes up, nobody can help you.\"",
      "\"Othello\" is the Tony-winner's sixth Broadway show. He plays the title character, Othello, the military commander stirred into a murderous rage after his ensign, Iago, convinces him his wife, Desdemona, has been unfaithful.",
      "Jake Gyllenhaal plays the deceitful Iago, who seeks revenge on his longtime comrade and commander because he was passed over for a promotion.",
      "Shakespeare wrote \"Othello\" around 1604. But this production sets the play in \"the near future,\" adding modern themes like service members suffering from PTSD.",
      "Washington said, \"People, you know, they ordinarily think, 'Oh yeah, it's about jealousy. And he betrays him.' No, it's about two soldiers who trust each other with their lives.\"",
      "\"Well, then\u2026\" Gyllenhaal laughed.",
      "\"Yeah, what are you so pissed off about? What did I do to you?\" Washington laughed.",
      "\"What you know, you know!\" Gyllenhaal replied. \"But I mean, that what is shared is theirs, you know? And what is shared beyond something that they would share with others. That's what makes their bond so strong.\"",
      "At 44 years old, Gyllenhaal is widely celebrated for the emotional range and intensity he brings to roles, in films such as \"Brokeback Mountain,\" \"Zodiac\" and \"Nightcrawler.\" And like Washington, he is a theater veteran, with \"Othello\" marking his fourth appearance on Broadway. But this is his first time performing Shakespeare (almost). \"You know what I realized? I did do 'Much Ado About Nothing' in high school,\" he said. \"And I realized that this morning.\"",
      "\"You forgot?\" an astonished Washington laughed.",
      "\"Probably the audience and I would probably like to forget!\"",
      "We visited Gyllenhaal before a performance this past week at the Barrymore Theatre. Standing on stage, the actor said, \"It's my favorite place to be.\"",
      "He explained his character feeds off the audience: \"[Iago] does have a lot of moments [where] he has interactions with the audience, they kind of become his partner in it, and every night it is different. And that's what I love so much about it.\"",
      "Washington, now 70, is no stranger to Shakespeare. On stage he's played Richard III and Julius Caesar, and he has starred in movie versions of \"Much Ado About Nothing\" and an adaptation of \"Macbeth.\" \u00a0He first played Othello as a student at Fordham University in New York City.",
      "Asked how he relates to the play and its language differently from when he was 22, Washington replied, \"I know a lot less now. I thought I knew everything then! I didn't really like the part, 'cause I wasn't wise enough to understand it. Now I understand it's really about a bond, you know, that these characters have. He loves not wisely, but too well.\"",
      "\"Othello\" has been staged on Broadway more than 20 times. For most of those performances, Othello was played by a white actor in blackface. That changed in 1943, when Paul Robeson gave a legendary performance in the role. The last actor to play him on Broadway was James Earl Jones, in 1982.",
      "\"James Earl Jones was my northern star when I was in college,\" said Washington. \"He was who I wanted to be. I didn't get to see his Othello, but I know it wasn't as good as my 22-year-old interpretation! But you know, it's my turn.\"",
      "And what a turn it's been. The show is already a box office hit. But record-breaking sales have driven prices sky-high; prime seats go for nearly $1,000, drawing some criticism.",
      "But audiences are showing up, and by the sound of it are enjoying themselves \u2013 as are the stars.",
      "Gyllenhaal said, \"You get to a point where you're like, 'Oh, I've worked my whole career for this, for this moment.'\"",
      "\"That's what it feels like for me, too,\" said Washington. \"I worked my whole career for this moment. This is a 48-year journey for me. It's fascinating to have been too young for the part, and some may say now too old. But 48 years of experience, so 48 years of pain and pleasure and life has informed my approach to playing the role.\"",
      "Gyllenhaal added, \"I feel tremendous gratitude. And he makes me feel it when I walk in that rehearsal room every day.\"",

      "A look back at the esteemed personalities who left us this year, who'd touched us with their innovation, creativity and humanity.",
      "By CBSNews.com senior producer David Morgan. The Associated Press contributed to this gallery.",
      "Boxer George Foreman (Jan. 10, 1949-March 21, 2025) rose up from poverty in a tough Houston neighborhood to become an Olympic gold medalist at 19, and heavyweight champion of the world twice. An uncommon man with the common touch, he also conquered success outside the ring as an advertising pitchman and star of infomercials.",
      "In 1973, at age 24, Foreman defeated Joe Frazier to become world champion. The following year, he defended his heavyweight title against Muhammad Ali in Kinshasa, Zaire, in one of the most touted boxing matches of all time, \"The Rumble in the Jungle.\" \"I beat him up for the first three rounds, four rounds. I think I even beat him up the sixth round, too,\" Foreman told \"Sunday Morning\" in 2005. \"Then all of a sudden I hit him in the seventh round and he whispered in my ear, `That all you got, George?' Oh, that was all I had. You've heard of the rope-a-dope? Well, here's the dope!\" Ali, then the underdog, won in the eighth round by a knockout; Foreman lost the title.",
      "At the time, he was devastated. \"I was young, only 25 years old. I didn't know what to do. I thought my life was over, because when you lose the championship it's not like you lost the title, you lose yourself, because it's like you're not a man anymore.\"",
      "Three years later, after another loss, Foreman had a religious experience that changed his life. He quit boxing and became an evangelist, preaching first on street corners, then in his own church. He opened the George Foreman Youth and Community Center, a safe place for kids to hang out. \"For 10 years, I didn't even make a fist,\" he said. \"I didn't box, I didn't try to box, I was done with it. I was a preacher, a happy, fat preacher.\"",
      "But money problems drove him back to the ring. So, at 37, Foreman began his comeback. He was ridiculed at first \u2014 too old, too fat, too slow, they said \u2014 but he was also too strong, and in 1994, more than 20 years after he beat Frazier for the title, Foreman knocked out the undefeated Michael Moorer. At age 45, Foreman became the oldest heavyweight champion ever.",
      "That same year, Foreman agreed to help market a kitchen grill that few were buying, in exchange for a piece of the company. In the first 15 years, Foreman said they sold 100 million of the George Foreman Lean Mean Fat Reducing Grilling Machines and its variations.",
      "\"When you go through the airport some time and people stop and say 'George, we love the grill!' that's greater than them telling me, 'George, you did a good job becoming the heavyweight champ of the world!'\" Foreman said.",
      "And he continued selling, not just grilling machines but also mufflers, chips, hot dogs, video games, home warranties, and a George Foreman clothing line.",
      "\"I'm driven,\" he said in 2005. \"I like the life I'm living, but I'm driven because there's so much more to obtain. I'm one of those guys who's going to have to fall out of the saddle. There's always one more star to reach for and I'm trying to.\"",
      "Married five times, Foreman had 12 children. And yes, he did name all five of his sons George. \"You got Muhammad Ali, Joe Frazier, Kenny Norton, Ron Lyle, you let those people hit you on the head and see how many names you're going to remember \u2014 it would be confusing,\" he told \"Sunday Morning.\" \"I kept it simple. I never forget a name!\"",
      "It also inspired a children's book he wrote, titled, \"Let George Do It!\""

      "Washington \u2014 On a night when half a dozen people made jokes about this being the last-ever Mark Twain Prize, Conan O'Brien made sure the ceremony at the John F. Kennedy Center for the Performing Arts ended on a high note.",
      "O'Brien accepted the award for lifetime achievement in comedy Sunday night while acknowledging the backstage turmoil that hangs over the future of the cultural center in Washington.",
      "O'Brien, 61, was named the 26th recipient of the Mark Twain Prize in mid-January.",
      "Last month, Mr. Trump\u00a0dissolved the Kennedy Center's board of directors and named himself chairman. The new board includes\u00a0political allies like White House chief of staff Susie Wiles, longtime senior Trump aide Dan Scavino, second lady Usha Vance and Fox News host Laura Ingraham.",
      "On Sunday, O'Brien specifically thanked Rubenstein and Rutter \u2014 drawing an extended round of applause \u2014 as well as Kennedy Center staffers who, he said, were \"worried about what the future might bring.\"",
      "He said the example of Mark Twain's own life and career was particularly resonant at this moment in American history.",
      "\"Twain hated bullies. ... He punched up, not down, and he deeply empathized with the weak,\" O'Brien said. \"Twain loved America, but he knew it was deeply flawed.\"",
      "A Mark Twain impersonator then emerged from the audience. After a back-and-forth debate with O'Brien, he joined him on stage and the pair slow danced for a while. They were then joined by a dozen more Twain impersonators and previous Twain Prize recipient Adam Sandler for a raucous rendition of Neil Young's \"Rockin in the Free World.\"",
      "Barbs aimed at Trump's Kennedy Center changes",
      "That musical ending capped off a night when the uncertain fate of the Kennedy Center itself was woven through the multiple tributes and testimonials to O'Brien.",
      "\"I think it would be insane not to address the elephant in the room,\" comic Nikki Glaser said on the red carpet before the ceremony. \"It's in the air tonight. This night is about Conan, but it can be both.\"",
      "Once the festivities began, Stephen Colbert joked that the Kennedy Center had announced two new board members: Bashar Assad, the ousted president of Syria, and Skeletor, a fictional supervillain.",
      "John Mulaney quipped that the entire building would soon be renamed \"the Roy Cohn Pavilion\" after one of Trump's mentors. And Sarah Silverman made multiple Trump jokes that were too vulgar to print.",
      "Mr. Trump, in announcing the Kennedy Center changes, posted\u00a0on his Truth Social social media platform that those who were dismissed \"do not share our Vision for a Golden Age in Arts and Culture.\"",
      "How that vision takes shape remains to be seen, but Mr. Trump has spoken about wanting to book more Broadway shows there and floated the idea of granting Kennedy Center Honors status to actor Sylvester Stallone and singer-songwriter Paul Anka.",
      "Conan O'Brien's comedy honored",
      "Into this maelstrom stepped O'Brien, whose comedic persona has rarely been particularly political.",
      "The comic has always tended more toward goofiness and self-deprecation. But he has also leaned into sensitive societal issues at times.",
      "In 2011, O'Brien officiated a gay wedding live on his show, overseeing the marriage of his longtime costume designer Scott Cronick and his partner David Gorshein.",
      "O'Brien vaulted into the spotlight from near-total obscurity in 1993 when he was chosen to replace David Letterman as host of \"Late Night\" despite no significant on-camera experience. The former Harvard Lampoon editor had spent the previous years as a writer for \"Saturday Night Live\" and \"The Simpsons,\" appearing on camera only as an occasional background extra in \"SNL\" skits.",
      "He went on to host \"Late Night\" for 16 years, longer than any other host. O'Brien was later tapped to replace Jay Leno as host of \"The Tonight Show,\" but that experiment ended in public failure. After seven months of declining ratings, NBC executives brought Leno back for a new show that would bump \"The Tonight Show\" back.

    "published": "Tue, 25 Mar 2025 13:34:45 -0400",
    "summary": "Disability rights advocates say income and asset caps for Medicaid buy-in programs are a \"poverty trap\" for millions of Americans.",
    "story": [
      "PLEASANTVILLE, Iowa \u2014 Zach Mecham has heard politicians demand that Medicaid recipients work or lose their benefits. He also has run into a jumble of Medicaid rules that effectively prevent many people with disabilities from holding full-time jobs.",
      "\"Which is it? Do you want us to work or not?\" he said.",
      "Mecham, 31, relies on the public insurance program to pay for services that help him live on his own despite a disability caused by muscular dystrophy. He uses a wheelchair to get around and a portable ventilator to breathe.",
      "A paid assistant stays with Mecham at night. Then a home health aide comes in the morning to help him get out of bed, go to the bathroom, shower, and get dressed for work at his online marketing business. Without the assistance, he would have to shutter his company and move into a nursing home, he said.",
      "Private health insurance plans generally do not cover such support services, so he relies on Medicaid, which is jointly financed by federal and state governments and covers millions of Americans who have low incomes or disabilities.",
      "Like most other states, Iowa has a Medicaid \"buy-in program,\" which allows people with disabilities to join Medicaid even if their incomes are a bit higher than would typically be permitted. About two-thirds of such programs charge premiums, and most have caps on how much money participants can earn and save.",
      "Some states have raised or eliminated such financial caps for people with disabilities. Mecham has repeatedly traveled to the Iowa Capitol to lobby legislators to follow those states' lead. The \"Work Without Worry\" bill would remove income and asset caps and instead require Iowans with disabilities to pay 6% of their incomes as premiums to remain in Medicaid. Those fees would be waived if participants pay premiums for employer-based health insurance, which would help cover standard medical care.",
      "Disability rights advocates say income and asset caps for Medicaid buy-in programs can prevent participants from working full time or accepting promotions. \"It's a trap \u2014 a poverty trap,\" said Stephen Lieberman, a policy director for the United Spinal Association, which supports the changes.",
      "Lawmakers in Florida, Hawaii, Indiana, Iowa, Maine, Mississippi, and New Jersey have introduced bills to address the issue this year, according to the National Conference of State Legislatures.",
      "Several other states have raised or eliminated their program's income and asset caps. Iowa's proposal is modeled on a Tennessee law passed last year, said Josh Turek, a Democratic state representative from Council Bluffs. Turek, who is promoting the Iowa bill, uses a wheelchair and earned two gold medals as a member of the U.S. Paralympics basketball team.",
      "Proponents say allowing people with disabilities to earn more money and still qualify for Medicaid would help ease persistent worker shortages, including in rural areas where the working-age population is shrinking.",
      "Turek believes now is a good time to seek expanded employment rights for people with disabilities, since Republicans who control the state and federal governments have been touting the value of holding a job. \"That's the trumpet I've been blowing,\" he said with a smile.",
      "The Iowa Legislature has been moving to require many nondisabled Medicaid recipients to work or to document why they can't. Opponents say most Medicaid recipients who can work already do so, and the critics say work requirements add red tape that is expensive to administer and could lead Medicaid recipients to lose their coverage over paperwork issues.",
      "Iowa Gov. Kim Reynolds has made Medicaid work requirements a priority this year. \"If you can work, you should. It's common sense and good policy,\" the Republican governor told legislators in January in her \"Condition of the State Address.\" \"Getting back to work can be a lifeline to stability and self-sufficiency.\"",
      "Her office did not respond to KFF Health News' queries about whether Reynolds supports eliminating income and asset caps for Iowa's buy-in program, known as Medicaid for Employed People with Disabilities.",
      "Spouse's income counts toward cap",
      "National disability rights activists say income and asset caps on Medicaid buy-in programs discourage couples from marrying or even pressure them to split up if one or both partners have disabilities. That's because in many states a spouse's income and assets are counted when determining eligibility.",
      "In Iowa, for example, the monthly net income cap is $3,138 for a single person and $4,259 for a couple.",
      "Iowa's current asset cap for a single person in the Medicaid buy-in plan is $12,000. For a couple, that cap rises only to $13,000. Countable assets include investments, bank accounts, and other things that could be easily converted to cash, but not a primary home, vehicle, or household furnishings.",
      "\"You have couples who have been married for decades who have to go through what we call a 'Medicaid divorce,' just to get access to these supports and services that cannot be covered in any other way,\" said Maria Town, president of the American Association of People with Disabilities.",
      "Town said some states, including Massachusetts, have removed income caps for people with disabilities who want to join Medicaid. She said the cost of adding such people to the program is at least partially offset by the premiums they pay for coverage and the increased taxes they contribute because they are allowed to work more hours. \"I don't think it has to be expensive\" for the state and federal governments, she said.",
      "Congress has considered a similar proposal to allow people with disabilities to work more hours without losing their Social Security disability benefits, but that bill has not advanced.",
      "Although most states have Medicaid buy-in programs, enrollment is relatively low, said Alice Burns, a Medicaid analyst at KFF, a health information nonprofit that includes KFF Health News.",
      "Fewer than 200,000 people nationwide are covered under the options, Burns said. \"Awareness of these programs is really limited,\" she said, and the income limits and paperwork can dissuade potential participants.",
      "In states that charge premiums for Medicaid buy-in programs, monthly fees can range from $10 to 10% of a person's income, according to a KFF analysis of 2022 data.",
      "Iowa bill to remove caps",
      "The Iowa proposal to remove income and asset caps has drawn bipartisan backing from legislators, including a 20-0 vote of approval from the House Health and Human Services Committee. \"This aligns with things both parties are aiming to do,\" said state Rep. Carter Nordman, a Republican who chaired a subcommittee meeting on the bill. Nordman said he supports the idea but wants to see an official estimate of how much it would cost the state to let more people with disabilities participate in the Medicaid buy-in program.",
      "Mecham, the citizen activist lobbying for the Iowa bill, said he hopes it allows him to expand his online marketing and graphic design business, \"Zach of All Trades.\"",
      "On a recent morning, health aide Courtnie Imler visited Mecham's modest house in Pleasantville, a town of about 1,700 people in an agricultural region of central Iowa. Imler chatted with Mecham while she used a hoist to lift him out of his wheelchair and onto the toilet. Then she cleaned him up, brushed his hair, and helped him put on jeans and a John Deere T-shirt. She poured him a cup of coffee and put a straw in it so he could drink it on his own, swept the kitchen floor, and wiped the counters. After about an hour, she said goodbye.",
      "After getting cleaned up and dressed, Mecham rolled his motorized wheelchair over to his plain wooden desk, fired up his computer, and began working on a social media video for a client promoting a book. He scrolled back and forth through footage of an interview she'd done, so he could pick the best clip to post online. He also shoots video, takes photos, and writes advertising copy.",
      "Mecham loves feeling productive, and he figures he could work at least twice as many hours if not for the risk of losing Medicaid coverage. He said he's allowed to make a bit more money than Iowa Medicaid's standard limit because he signed up for a federal option under which he eventually expects to work his way off Social Security disability payments.",
      "There are several such options for people with disabilities, but they all involve complicated paperwork and frequent reports, he said. \"This is such a convoluted system that I have to navigate to build any kind of life for myself,\" he said. Many people with disabilities are intimidated by the rules, so they don't apply, he said. \"If you get it wrong, you lose the health care your life depends on.\"",

    "story": [
      "West Virginia has outlawed foods that contain\u00a0some artificial dyes\u00a0or other additives, in one of the most comprehensive statewide bans of its kind. The move cites potentially harmful health effects and comes amid a broader push from scientists and government leaders to clamp down on synthetics in the nation's food supply.",
      "On Monday, West Virginia Gov. Patrick Morrisey signed into law a bill that was passed earlier by legislators to eliminate seven artificial dyes \u2014 Red Dye No. 3, Red Dye No. 40, Yellow Dye No. 5, Yellow Dye No. 6, Blue Dye No. 1, Blue Dye No. 2 and Green Dye No. 3 \u2014\u00a0 from food products and drugs sold in the state. The preservatives butylated hydroxyanisole and propylparaben will also be banned.",
      "The dyes will not be allowed in meals served as part of school nutrition programs starting on Aug. 1 this year, while the dyes and the two preservatives will not be permitted in drugs and food sold in the state starting on Jan. 1, 2028, according to the governor's office.",
      "\"West Virginia ranks at the bottom of many public health metrics, which is why there's no better place to lead the Make America Healthy Again mission,\" Morrisey said in a statement, citing the campaign slogan popularized by Health and Human Services Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr., who has said he is prioritizing the removal of artificial dyes from food and drinks sold around the United States. \"By eliminating harmful chemicals from our food, we're taking steps toward improving the health of our residents and protecting our children from significant long-term health and learning challenges.\"",
      "The latest ban in West Virginia follows a pair of laws passed in California in recent years to remove some additives from foods sold statewide and synthetic dyes from school meals. Dozens of other U.S. states have introduced legislation to ban or more strictly regulate certain food additives, including artificial dyes, since the beginning of the year, according to the Environmental Working Group, an advocacy organization focused on food safety.",
      "Thirty-six color additives are approved by the Federal Drug Administration for use in food and drinks in the U.S., including nine artificial dyes.",
      "Rising concerns from advocacy groups and scientists about possible health consequences of synthetic food components, particularly for children, prompted the FDA to undertake a new effort in December to review previously approved additives, although the agency's deputy commissioner for human foods warned at the time that budget restrictions might prevent a timely turnaround. In January, the FDA announced its decision to revoke the authorization for one dye, Red 3, to be added to foods, after evidence showed a link between the dye and cancer in laboratory animals.",

      "The protesters are trying to escalate a movement targeting Tesla dealerships and vehicles in opposition to Musk's role as the head of the newly created Department of of Government Efficiency, or DOGE, where he's gained access to sensitive data and shuttered entire agencies as he attempts to slash government spending. Most of Musk's estimated $340 billion fortune consists of the stock he holds in the electric vehicle company that he continues to run while also working alongside Mr. Trump.",
      "Earlier protests have been somewhat sporadic. Saturday marked the first attempt to surround all 277 of the automaker's showrooms and service centers in the U.S. in hopes of deepening\u00a0a recent decline in the company's sales.",
      "By early afternoon, crowds ranging from a few dozen to hundreds of protesters had flocked to Tesla locations in New Jersey, Massachusetts, Connecticut, New York, Maryland, Minnesota and the automaker's home state of Texas.

      "The Tesla Takedown movement also hoped to rally protestors at more than 230 Tesla locations in other parts of the world. Although the turnouts in Europe weren't as large as the crowds in the U.S., the anti-Musk sentiment was similar.",
      "About two dozen protesters held signs lambasting Musk outside a Tesla dealership in London as passing cars and trucks tooted horns in support.",
      "One of the signs displayed at the London protest showed a photo of Musk next to an image of Adolf Hitler making the Nazi salute \u2014 a\u00a0gesture that Musk has been accused of reprising shortly after Mr. Trump's Jan. 20 inauguration. A person in a tyrannosaurus rex costume held another sign with a picture of Musk's straight-arm gesture that said, \"You thought the Nazis were extinct. Don't buy a Swasticar.\"",

      "Some people opposed to Musk have gone beyond protests and set the automaker's vehicles on fire and committed\u00a0other acts of vandalism that U.S. Attorney General Pam Bondi has decried as \"nothing short of domestic terrorism.\" Musk indicated he was dumbfounded by the attacks during a March 20 company meeting and said the vandals should \"stop acting psycho.\"",
      "Crockett and other Tesla Takedown supporters have been stressing the importance for Saturday's protests to remain peaceful.",
      "But police were investigating a fire that destroyed seven Tesla vehicles in northwestern Germany early Saturday morning. It was wasn't immediately clear if the blaze, which was extinguished by firefighters, was related to the Tesla Takedown protests.",

      "But Musk didn't appear concerned about an extended slump in sales of new Tesla cars in his March 20 address to employees. He reassured the workers that the company's Model Y, which is undergoing a refresh, would remain \"the best-selling car on Earth again this year.\" He also predicted Tesla will have sold more than 10 million cars worldwide by next year, up from about 7 million cars now.",
      "\"There are times when there are rocky moments, where there is stormy weather, but what I am here to tell you is that the future is incredibly bright and exciting,\" Musk said.",
      "After Mr. Trump was elected last November, investors initially saw Musk's alliance with the president as a positive development for Tesla and its long-running efforts to launch\u00a0a network of self-driving cars.",

      "U.S. District Judge Amy Berman Jackson issued a preliminary injunction Friday that blocks the Trump administration from dismantling the Consumer Protection Financial Bureau.",
      "\"The court cannot look away or the CFPB will be dissolved and dismantled completely in approximately thirty days, well before this lawsuit has come to its conclusion,\" she wrote in a 112-page decision.",
      "Her order keeps the CFPB in existence until the case has been resolved on the merits. It also reinstates the agency's contracts, workforce, data and operational capacity.",

      "\"If the defendants are not enjoined, they will eliminate the agency before the Court has the opportunity to decide whether the law permits them to do it, and as the defendants' own witness warned, the harm will be irreparable,\" Berman Jackson said in her order.",
      "During a March 10 hearing, Jackson heard testimony about the chaos that erupted inside the agency after government employees were ordered to stop working last month. The bureau's chief operating officer, Adam Martinez, said the agency was in \"wind-down mode\" after Trump fired its previous director, Rohit Chopra, on Feb. 1.",
      "Trump installed a temporary replacement who ordered the immediate suspension of all agency operations, cancelled $100 million in contracts and fired 70 employees.",
      "Martinez said the agency's current leaders have adopted a more methodical approach than they initially did last month, when representatives of Elon Musk's Department of Government Efficiency arrived at its Washington headquarters.",
      "CFPB is responsible for protecting consumers from financial fraud and deceptive practices. It processes consumer complaints and examines banks to protect student loan borrowers.",
      "The National Treasury Employees Union, which represents more than 1,000 workers at the bureau, sued on Feb. 9 to block mass firings. Plaintiffs' attorneys argue that the administration doesn't have the constitutional authority to eliminate an agency that Congress created by statute.",
      "\"The defendants' unlawful action will have immediate consequences for the Americans that the CFPB was designed by Congress to protect,\"\u00a0the lawyers wrote.",

Trump's billionaire adviser, Elon Musk, posted \"CFPB RIP\" on X, his social media platform, and added an emoji of a tombstone. White House budget director Russell Vought said it has been \"a woke and weaponized agency against disfavored industries and individuals for a long time.\" Mr. Trump called it \"a very important thing to get rid of.\"",
      "Among the plaintiffs was 83-year-old Eva Steege, a Lutheran pastor in hospice care who had been working with CFPB to resolve her student loan debt before her death.

      "Mr. Trump has delayed 25% tariffs on Canadian and Mexican imports until April 2, but economists say the import duties could have detrimental effects on their economies given their deep reliance on the U.S. The drop in airline demand reflects \"a degradation of travel demand between the two countries, especially coming from the Canadian side,\" Scott Keyes, founder of Going.com, a flight deals website, told CBS MoneyWatch.",
      "As Mr. Trump promotes an \"America First\" trade policy, Canadians are similarly focusing on spending their dollars domestically, following former Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau's please last month for residents to \"choose Canada,\" former Canadian Member of Parliament Dr. Ruby Dhalla told CBS MoneyWatch.",
      "\"Instead of traveling to the U.S., we are seeing families travel visiting cities, towns and villages and exploring Canada's history and heritage,\" Dhalla said.",

      "Slashing routes to the U.S.",
      "Canadian airlines are expected to be hit harder than their American counterparts because the nation's residents are driving the downward trend, experts say. Americans typically prefer to fly American airlines because they might have loyalty accounts with a carrier, for example.",

      "The Trump administration's 25% tariffs on vehicles and auto parts imported into the U.S. could lead to sticker shock for American consumers, including for those buying cars manufactured domestically, analysts say.",
      "Few vehicle manufacturers will be spared by the fresh levies, which are aimed at revitalizing domestic automobile manufacturing. Industry analysts say the tax will surely raise car prices in the U.S. and squeeze some would-be car buyers out of the market.",
      "Some manufacturers could move a share of production to the U.S., but it would come \"at the expense of reduced competition, higher prices, and significantly lower production in the U.S.'s main trading partners,\" Oxford Economics analyst Abby Stamp said in a research note.",
      "The automobile supply chain is highly complex and intertwined with the economies of Mexico and Canada, from which American brands source finished vehicles and parts. Mr. Trump's tariff on passenger cars and light trucks imported into the U.S. will go into effect April 3, according to the executive order, and a 25% tariff on auto parts shipped from foreign countries goes into effect \"no later than May 3.\"",
      "While all car manufacturers will be impacted by the new tariffs, according to analysts, some will be hit much harder than others.",
      "Tesla",
      "Tesla CEO Elon Musk, a close ally of Mr. Trump, posted on X Wednesday that the new tariffs would affect the company's American-made electric vehicles.",
      "\"Important to note that Tesla is NOT unscathed here. The tariff impact on Tesla is still significant,\" Musk wrote on X Wednesday. \"To be clear, this will affect the price of parts in Tesla cars that come from other countries. The cost impact is not trivial,\" he wrote in a later post.",
      "That said, Tesla is expected to be among the automakers that are least affected by the tariffs, given that its vehicles are made in the U.S., and most of their parts are sourced domestically, too. The EV brand does, however, rely on China for some batteries, \"so the tariffs will have an impact,\" Art Wheaton, a transportation industry expert and director of labor studies at Cornell's School of Industrial and Labor Relations, told CBS MoneyWatch.",
      "Tesla rival Rivian could also be spared for similar reasons, according to UBS.",
      "\"We believe TSLA and RIVN could fare better as 100% of their production is in the U.S. (though not all components),\" UBS analysts said in a research note.",
      "General Motors",
      "General Motors, one of the so-called Big Three automakers, along with Stellantis and Ford, is widely expected to be the most exposed to the forthcoming auto tariffs. Headquartered in Detroit, the U.S. car company makes just 45% of vehicles it sells to U.S. customers domestically, leaving 55% of its lineup exposed to tariffs, according to Cox Automotive.",
      "GM, which makes Chevrolet, Buick, GMC and Cadillac vehicles, is heavily invested in Mexico and Canada, where it builds heavy-duty vehicles, according to Cornell's Wheaton.",
      "Stellantis",
      "Stellantis, whose brands include Jeep, Chrysler, Dodge and Ram, among others, is similarly susceptible to rising costs from the tariffs, as it makes between 73%-75% of vehicles for sale in the U.S. stateside, according to Cox Automotive.",
      "That means, a $80,000 RAM truck from Stellantis could cost $100,000 once it reaches the U.S., under the new policy.",
      "\"The impact is quite large,\" Wheaton said.",
      "Ford",
      "Ford is among the car companies better positioned to weather the tariffs, according to Cox Automotive analyst Erin Keating, as 80% of its vehicles are manufactured in the U.S. and therefore would not be subject to the 25% tariff on passenger cars. However, any imported parts used in Ford's U.S.-manufactured vehicles could be tariffed at 25%.",
      "Ford vehicles made in the U.S. include the F-150 pickup truck lineup. Some of its smaller vehicles, including the Maverick pickup truck and Bronco Sport SUV are made in Mexico and \"will take a hit,\" said Wheaton.",
      "While domestic automakers will face increased costs, it's unclear how much of the tax they'll pass along to consumers. The\u00a0Wall Street Journal,\u00a0reported that Mr. Trump warned the CEOs of the Big Three not to raise car prices because of tariffs, according to people familiar with the matter.",
      "Toyota and Honda",
      "Japanese automakers Toyota and Honda export a large number of vehicles and auto parts from Japan to the U.S., which represents a sizable market for the companies. Both also operate big plants in Canada, Wheaten noted, leaving them particularly vulnerable to added costs from new tariffs.",
      "The same goes for South Korean automakers Hyundai and Kia.",
      "BMW and Volkswagen",
      "German automakers, including BMW and Volkswagen, which makes Audi vehicles, both operate big plants in Mexico.",
      "The May 3 auto-parts tariff will likely apply to engines and transmission systems, and hit the company \"heavily,\" according to Wheaton.",
      "BMW, for instance, makes a lot of engines in Germany, which it then ships to South Carolina, where the automaker manufactures SUVs. The company could be hit \"heavily,\" by the auto-parts tariffs, according to Wheaton.",
      "Mercedes-Benz operates similarly, sending engines and transmission from Germany to a plant in Alabama, where the company manufactures SUVs. The 25% auto tariffs would also likely apply to fully assembled Mercedes vehicles shipped to the U.S.",
      "\"I don't think any brands will be spared, because none are 100% in the U.S.,\" Wheaton said. \"They all have products from Canada, Mexico or elsewhere. And even Tesla, which is the most American, still has non-U.S. content in their vehicles.\"",
      "Tariffs could spark affordability issues",
      "Even vehicles whose parts aren't subject to tariffs and that are assembled in the U.S. could face price hikes, as automakers attempt to spread new costs out across their lineups. While Cox Automotive expects price hikes of between 15%-20% on vehicles that are caught in the tariffs' crosshairs, those that are exempt could still go up by about 5%, Keating noted.",
      "The auto tariffs could ignite new affordability challenges for consumers by moving lower-cost vehicles closer to, or in some cases over the $30,000 threshold.",
      "Take, for example, a Hyundai Venue, a subcompact crossover SUV, with an average current list price of $24,000. Under Mr. Trump's auto tariffs, that price could rise to about $28,500, adding more than $4,000 to an affordable design.",
      "\"Sub- $30,000 compact SUVs and crossovers that are the most popular are almost all foreign-made, with the exception of one or two,\" Keating said. \"So they'd all be subjected to the 25% tariffs.\"",
      "At the other end of the economic spectrum, luxury Italian car maker Ferrari on Thursday said it would hike prices on certain car models by 10% after April 1, citing Mr. Trump's auto tariffs. The vehicles subject to price increase include the Ferrari 296, SF90 and Roma, which already retail for hundreds of thousands of dollars each.",

      "Stocks are taking a battering on Friday amid growing concerns on Wall Street about the impact of President Trump's tariff regime as well as hotter-than-expected price data, sparking worries that the Federal Reserve is far from declaring victory on inflation.",
      "The Dow Jones Industrial Average tumbled 758 points, or 1.8%, to 41,541.09 in Friday afternoon trading, while the broad-based S&P 500 shed 2%. The tech-heavy Nasdaq composite index skidded 2.8%.",
      "Friday's stock market rout comes after Wall Street has already suffered a pummeling this year, with the S&P 500 down 9% from its most recent February high.",
      "Mr. Trump on Wednesday said he is imposing a\u00a025% tariff on all vehicles\u00a0and auto parts imported into the U.S., a move that is expected to add thousands of dollars to the cost of many vehicles. He also plans to announce more tariffs on April 2. Because tariffs are import taxes that companies largely pass onto consumers, many economists are forecasting an uptick in inflation later this year.",
      "At the same time, new economic data released on Friday shows that core inflation heated up last month, posing a challenge to the Federal Reserve's goal of driving inflation down to a 2% annual rate.",
      "\"The recent U.S. stock market correction appears to have been partially triggered by investors realising that Trump may follow through with his tariff threats and that this will hurt the U.S. economy,\" said Oxford Economics lead economist Daniel Harenberg and senior economist Kiki Sondh in a Friday report. \"Similarly, consumer sentiment has weakened due to tariff-induced inflation fears.\"",
      "The economy has so far been holding up relatively well, but if it were to weaken while inflation stays high, it would produce a worst-case scenario called \"stagflation,\" which policymakers in Washington have few good tools to fix.",
      "A report on Friday morning showed that U.S. consumers, including Republicans, Independents and Democrats, getting more pessimistic about their future finances. Two out of three consumers surveyed by the University of Michigan expect unemployment to worsen in the year ahead. That's the the highest reading since 2009, and it raises worries about a job market that's been the linchpin keeping the U.S. economy solid.",
      "At the same time, recent CBS News polling shows that Americans have become more dour in their economic outlooks, with relatively more consumers bracing for a slowdown or\u00a0recession\u00a0over the next year.",
      "Automaker stocks",

      "On Wall Street, Ford Motor fell 2.6%, and General Motors sank 1.7%. Even U.S. automakers selling vehicles in the country can feel the pain of such tariffs because their supply chains are spread throughout North America. Trump says he wants more manufacturing to take place within the United States.",
      "The rout also hit shares outside the auto industry, with investors concerned that Mr. Trump's trade war may cause U.S. households and businesses to freeze their spending. Even if the tariffs end up being less painful than feared, all the uncertainty may filter into changed behaviors that hurt the economy.",
      "Leading the market lower on Friday was Lululemon Athletica, which dropped 15%. Even though the seller of athletic apparel reported a stronger profit for the latest quarter than analysts expected, it warned that its revenue growth may slow this upcoming year as consumers grow more cautious.",
      "\"Consumers are spending less due to increased concerns about inflation and the economy,\" said CEO Calvin McDonald.",
      "Lululemon also said tariffs and shifting foreign-currency values may account for about half of its expected drop in a key measure of performance: how much profit it can squeeze out of each $1 of revenue.",

      "Mr. Trump has referred to his April 2 tariff announcement as \"the big one,\" suggesting that the plans may be more far reaching than the import levies he's already unleashed on goods from other nations, such as his March 26 declaration of 25% tariffs on vehicles and auto parts imported into the\u00a0U.S.",
      "\"For DECADES we have been ripped off and abused by every nation in the World, both friend and foe. Now it is finally time for the Good Ol' USA to get some of that MONEY, and RESPECT, BACK. GOD BLESS AMERICA!!!\" Trump said about his April 2 plans in a post\u00a0earlier this month on Truth Social.",
      "On April 2, Mr. Trump is expected to announce his administration's plans for so-called reciprocal tariffs, which he deems necessary to erase trade imbalances with nations that export more goods to the U.S. than they import from America. But the addition of broad-based tariffs to a host of imports is likely to heat up a global trade war that could, at least in the short term, boost prices for U.S. consumers and juice inflation.",
      "\"Tariffs are a tax on imported goods, and research shows that that majority gets passed along to consumers,\" Colin Grabow, associate director of the Herbert A. Stiefel Center for trade policy studies at the Cato Institute, a libertarian think tank, told CBS MoneyWatch.",
      "Ultimately, the Trump administration's goal is to increase prices on imports to the point where it's economically favorable for companies to relocate their manufacturing to the U.S., he noted.",
      "\"If prices don't go up, it doesn't deter imports, and therefore there is no reason to set up shop in the U.S.,\" Grabow explained. \"Part of the logic is premised on prices going up, otherwise they are not going to accomplish their goal.\"",
      "Economists say that Mr. Trump's tariff agenda, including the uncertainty surrounding it, could drag down U.S. GDP by depressing financial markets and consumer sentiment.",
      "\"The main channel from trade policy uncertainty to GDP is via business investment. Under higher trade policy uncertainty, future revenue streams of an investment become more uncertain, raising the option value of delaying investment decisions until the situation is clearer,\" Oxford Economics analysts said in a research note.",
      "What tariffs will Trump announce April 2?",
      "Mr. Trump teased his April 2 announcement on Wednesday when he announced his new 25% tariffs on foreign-made cars and auto parts. \"That's Liberation Day, that's gonna be on the 2nd, and that's gonna be reciprocal, and I think people will be impressed,\" the president said.",
      "Reciprocal tariffs are designed to match the import duties placed on U.S. goods and services by other nations, as well as compensate for other trade barriers, according to the Yale Budget Lab, a non-partisan public policy think tank. According to a White House memo from Feb. 13, the U.S. faces additional trade barriers aside from tariffs such as regulatory requirements that can make it more difficult for American exports to reach other nations.",
      "While the size and scope of the reciprocal tariffs that Mr. Trump plans to announce are unknown, Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent last week said the administration's reciprocal tariffs would target countries with the biggest trade surpluses, as well as those which have imposed the highest tariffs plus non-tariff trade barriers on U.S. goods.",
      "Multiple nations run large annual trade surpluses with the U.S., including Germany, Ireland and Italy in the European Union, as well as Vietnam, Japan and Taiwan. The U.S. also has a large trade deficit with China, although Mr. Trump has already imposed new tariffs on that nation.",
      "\"It'll be in many cases less than the tariff that they've been charging us for decades ... I think we're trying to keep it somewhat conservative,\" Mr. Trump said on March 26.",
      "Mr. Trump added that he'll introduce a reciprocal tariff policy on \"all countries,\" which he said would be \"very lenient.\"",
      "Meanwhile, additional tariffs are also slated to go into effect on April 2, with Mr. Trump's one-month delay on 25% tariffs on Canadian and Mexican imports set to expire that day. The 25% auto tariff announced by the president on March 26 is also scheduled to take effect on April 2.",
      "What are reciprocal tariffs?",
      "Reciprocal tariffs enacted by the U.S. would match foreign nations' levies and other trade policies on American goods.",
      "A reciprocal tariff policy would include calculating a country-specific number that the Trump administration deems representative of all trade barriers. But import restrictions other than tariffs, such as regulatory requirements, could be hard to quantify, economists say.",
      "\"There are a lot of intangibles, like testing regulations for different products in countries, or perceived openness to business with American companies,\" Simon Macadam, deputy chief global economist at Capital Economics, told CBS MoneyWatch. \"These are things you can't easily put a number on.\"",
      "Because of this complexity, some experts expect Trump's reciprocal tariffs could be more limited in scope, and might not be truly \"reciprocal\" because they may not exactly match other countries' levies.",
      "\"We shouldn't be surprised if some of the stuff is rolled back, or not as sweeping as maybe originally talked about, because logistically, from a practical perspective, running the calculations and coming up with a number is extremely time consuming,\" Grabow of the Cato Institute said.",
      "Wilbur Ross, who served as the U.S. Secretary of Commerce during the first Trump administration, agreed that a truly reciprocal tariff policy would be \"very complicated to get to work.\"",
      "\"If you were literally going to be reciprocal, you would put the same tariff on a product that comes into the U.S. as that country charges on products from the U.S.,\" he said. \"But the problem is you'd be charging a different tariff on the same item from different countries.\"",
      "That would create loopholes for exporters to ship products through lower-tariffed countries to the U.S., Ross added. \"It would make it easy for people to game the system,\" he said.",
      "What does Trump want to achieve?",
      "Through his \"Fair and Reciprocal Plan\" on trade, Mr. Trump is aiming to bring about three outcomes: Boost U.S. manufacturing jobs; close the $1.2 trillion U.S. trade deficit; and gain leverage over U.S. trade partners.",
      "But experts say that trade barriers such as tariffs may not be enough to revitalize U.S. manufacturing jobs, which have fallen sharply over the last few decades. Fewer than 13 million people are employed in manufacturing today, down from a peak of 19.6 million in 1979,\u00a0according to federal data.",
      "\"To a large extent, and particularly in low- and medium-tech industries, the economics of production will not be significantly altered by a 10-20% tariff,\" Macadam said. \"When labor costs in hubs like Mexico are one-fifth of what they are in the U.S., in order to induce companies to seriously relocate a lot of production back to the U.S. a 20% tariff isn't going to cut it.\"",
      "There's also the unknown of how long any new tariffs announced by Mr. Trump will remain in place. Such uncertainty could deter American or foreign businesses from investing heavily in re-shoring manufacturing to the U.S.",
      "\"Even if for some companies it gets to the point where it seems to make financial sense to move back to the U.S., there's the question of, 'Are these tariffs actually going to last a long time?'\" Macadam said. \"If you think the tariff is going to be there forever, then yeah, absolutely relocate. But if it's reversed or rates are lowered, then it would have been silly to relocate.\"",
      "What will tariffs mean for consumers?",
      "Consumers typically pay the price for tariffs, as companies have said they plan on passing off much of the costs to their customers.",
      "As a result, a round of fresh tariffs could boost inflation, economists say. According to an analysis by Oxford Economics, if the effective tariff rate on imports into the U.S. rises from their 2024 level of 2.5% to 10% in April, which is what Oxford Economics expects, prices in aggregate would rise by half a percentage point.",
      "\"Inflation was on trend to fall \u2014 now we expect it to rise,\" Michael Pearce, senior U.S. economist at Oxford Economics, told CBS MoneyWatch.",

      "In December 2023, Milton was sentenced to four years in prison after he was convicted of exaggerating claims about his electric vehicle company's production of zero-emission 18-wheel trucks, which prosecutors claimed caused investors to lose hundreds of thousands of dollars. Milton's conviction came after a short seller called Hindenburg Research alleged in 2020 that the EV maker had misrepresented its technology.",
      "In his video, Milton said, \"The greatest comeback story in America is about to happen.\"",
      "Nikola filed\u00a0for Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection in February, a move that came months after it warned it could likely run out of cash in early 2025. Once valued at around $30 billion, exceeding the market capitalization of Ford Motor Co., the EV maker was a rising Wall Street star before it became embroiled in scandal.",
      "Last month, Nikola said it plans to to continue limited service and support operations for vehicles on the road, including fueling operations through the end of March, subject to court approval. The company said that it would need to raise more funding to support those types of activities after that time.",

      "Mr. Trump also reiterated his goal of making interest paid on auto loans tax deductible, while noting that such a deduction would apply only to cars made in the U.S.",

      "One analysis of Mr. Trump's tariffs estimated that auto prices could rise as much as\u00a0$12,200 for some models\u00a0due to the new import duties, according to a report from Anderson Economic Group, a Michigan-based economic consultancy.",
      "\"In the long-run, this could boost domestic investment and production. In the short-run, however, it will be inflationary and, assuming that domestic producers respond by substantially increasing their own prices, could make new vehicles something of a luxury item,\" Paul Ashworth, chief North America economist with Capital Economics, said in a report.",
      "Targeting imported cars also could strain ties with key trading U.S. partners including Canada, Japan, Mexico and South Korea, as well as Europe.",
      "\"I deeply regret the U.S. decision to impose tariffs on EU automotive exports,\" Ursula von der Leyen, president of the European Commission, said in a social media post. \"Tariffs are taxes \u2014 bad for businesses, worse for consumers in the U.S. and the EU. The EU will continue to seek negotiated solutions, while safeguarding its economic interests.\"",

A 25% tariff on auto imports isn't the only way to spur more auto plants here, but it is in my view necessary.\"",

      "Starting today, the Social Security Administration will begin clawing back overpayments from the retirement program by taking 100% of a beneficiary's monthly check until the money is repaid, up from the prior rate of 10%. The policy will impact new cases of overpayments starting on March 27. The benefits withholding rate for people who were overpaid before that date will remain at 10%.",
      "The agency's 100% recovery rate was announced earlier this month by SSA Acting Commissioner Lee Dudek, who has worked with Elon Musk's Department of Government Efficiency, or DOGE, to cut costs at the agency by firing thousands of workers and closing field offices.",
      "Dudek has\u00a0described the 100% clawback rate as part of the agency's responsibility to recover overpaid funds. But advocates for older Americans say the policy will cause financial distress for many people, especially those who rely on the program for all or most of their income.",
      "\"If an overpayment is being made, that means the Social Security Administration is withholding 100% of their payment for however long it takes to repay the agency \u2014 and they are without money to pay for food\" or other living expenses, Dan Adcock, director of government relations and policy for the National Committee to Preserve Social Security and Medicare, an advocacy group, told CBS MoneyWatch.",
      "The clawback policy could prove especially hard on the 40% of Social Security beneficiaries who rely on the program for 90% of more of their income, he added.",
      "In many cases, Social Security overpayments are the fault of agency, with a\u00a02022 report\u00a0by its inspector general finding that about 73,000 overpayments that year were due to a lack of \"effective controls over benefit-computation accuracy.\"",
      "Under the Biden administration, the Social Security Administration in 2024\u00a0capped the clawback rate at 10%, stepping back from its prior 100% level following reports that the higher rate had pushed some Americans into financial hardship and even\u00a0homelessness.",
      "\"The thing is, this administration has said, 'We're going back to the old way, we're getting 100% of the money back going forward,'\" CBS News business analyst Jill Schlesinger told CBS News.",
      "Can you avoid a Social Security overpayment?",
      "In some cases, overpayments are due to miscalculations on the part of the Social Security Administration, or because the agency doesn't update beneficiaries' records in a timely way. That can make it difficult for seniors to know if they're getting paid too much.",
      "But it's also important for beneficiaries to update the SSA with their latest information, such as increases in their income that can lead to overpayments. The importance of updating the agency about such changes may not be fully appreciated by some beneficiaries because of the complexity of the Social Security system, the agency's inspector general said in a 2024 report.",
      "\"We urge beneficiaries to keep a close eye on their benefits going forward,\" said Shannon Benton, executive director of The Senior Citizens League, an advocacy group for older Americans. \"If they notice any unscheduled changes to their benefits, they should contact Social Security immediately.\"",
      "It's important to keep records of your payments and flag any issues, such as if your check is larger than it previously was, Schlesinger said. \"Unfortunately the onus is on us\" to correct the record, she added.",
      "DOGE cuts, long waits",
      "Because of DOGE's job cuts at the Social Security Administration and the closure of agency field offices, it's recently become more difficult for seniors and other beneficiaries to contact the agency to report changes or ask for help, Adcock said.",
      "Those issues arose in a Tuesday Senate confirmation hearing for President Trump's nominee for Social Security commissioner, Frank Bisignano, who said that only about 46% of phone calls to the agency are answered \"because people get discouraged and hang up\" due to long wait times.",
      "Sen. Steve Daines, a Republican from Montana, told Bisignano that one of his staffers this week called the agency's 800 number to assess the level of customer service, but was disconnected three times, once after being on hold for an hour.",
      "\"We've got a lot of work to do to serve the taxpayers in this country,\" Daines said.",
      "Improvements to Social Security?",
      "In the hearing, Bisignano also said he wants to reduce what the agency calls \"improper payments,\" which include both overpayments and underpayments to beneficiaries. Currently, about 1% of Social Security's annual payments are improper, with Bisignano saying he believes that rate should be \"five decimal points to the right.\"",
      "Yet enhancing the accuracy of benefits will likely take a large investment in Social Security because it would require changes in systems, technology and other resources, Benton said.",
      "\"While improvements are possible, achieving such a low error rate is challenging due to the complexity of Social Security benefits and past challenges with fraud and reporting errors,\" she said. \"Some progress is likely and will probably be incremental, but a significant reduction over the next four years will be extremely challenging.\"",
      "In the meantime, seniors and other Social Security recipients should watch their benefits closely and report changes in their income to the agency. And if people receives a beneficiary letter from the agency, they can also request a waiver, which can be made through\u00a0SSA form 632.",
      "\"While we believe that overpayments should be recouped, we believe it's essential that beneficiaries have time to plan, and not face undue pressure from an almost immediate 100% reduction in benefits,\" Benton said.",

      "The S&P 500 dropped 64 points, or 1.1%, to close at 5,712, the Dow Jones Industrial Average fell 0.3% and the Nasdaq Composite nosed down 2% as investors pulled back from major technology players.",
      "After a delayed announcement, Mr. Trump said he is imposing a 25% tariff on all vehicles imported into the U.S. \"This will continue to spur growth like you haven't seen before,\" he said from the Oval Office Wednesday afternoon. \"We'll effectively be charging a 25% tariff. But if you build your car in the United States, there is no tariff.\"",
      "Shares of automakers slid ahead of the announcement, with General Motors sinking 3.2% and Stellantis, the parent company of Chrysler, Dodge, Jeep and Ram, dropping 3.5%. The Detroit automakers' manufacturing plants and supply chains are spread across North America, so additional tariffs would raise their costs and crimp profits.",
      "Tesla shares, which have slumped this year because of disappointing sales and consumer unhappiness over CEO Elon Musk's involvement with the Trump administration, fell nearly 6% and are down 33% this year.",
      "Consumers are also likely to feel the sting of additional import duties. New tariffs on U.S. car imports could drive up vehicle costs between $2,000 and $12,200 for some models, Anderson Economic Group has estimated.",
      "Beyond the impact on the auto sector, investors have been rattled by President Trump's protectionist trade policies. The U.S. is scheduled to announce a raft of tariffs on April 2, including 25% duties on imports from Mexico and Canada, along with even more sweeping matching levies on a number of U.S. trading partners.",
      "\"The fact of the matter is that Trump remains firmly wedded to a Tariff First policy, his pain threshold is high and there are no voices around him counseling restraint or prudence,\" Adam Crisafulli, head of investment advisory firm Vital Knowledge, said Wednesday in a note to investors.",
      "He added, \"Even those who might agree with the long-term benefits of tariffs have to acknowledge there will be a multi-quarter period of substantial disruption to the economy, with softer growth and higher inflation.\"",
      "The Federal Reserve earlier this month cited the likely impact of tariffs in\u00a0lowering its outlook for U.S. economic growth to 1.7%, while also forecasting a pickup in inflation.",
      "A new analysis by Oxford Economics found that U.S. tariffs could raise the cost of some products by as much as 4%, with home appliances, musical instruments, tableware and utensils, and personal care items potentially seeing the biggest price hikes.",

      "\"The Congressional Budget Office estimates that if the debt limit remains unchanged, the government's ability to borrow using extraordinary measures will probably be exhausted in August or September 2025,\" the nonpartisan budget office said Wednesday.",
      "The so-called \"X-date\" marks when the government could run out of borrowing power and face an unprecedented default without action from Congress to address the debt limit, which caps how much the Treasury can borrow to pay the government's obligations. The department is currently utilizing so-called \"extraordinary measures\" to delay a default for several months.",
      "The CBO analysis noted that if the government's borrowing needs are \"significantly greater\" than projections, the Treasury Department's resources could be exhausted as early as late May or June.",
      "The debt ceiling was last addressed in 2023, when Congress suspended it until Jan. 1, 2025, under the Fiscal Responsibility Act. Since January, the Treasury Department has been using \"extraordinary measures\" to pay its bills and extend the date when it will run out of money. Raising the debt limit doesn't greenlight new spending, but allows the government to pay what it already owes. The U.S. national debt currently stands at more than $36 trillion.",
      "The CBO estimate came after the Bipartisan Policy Center projected on Monday that the U.S. could default on its debt between July and October without congressional intervention. The Treasury Department is also expected to release a projected X-date in the coming weeks.",
      "Meanwhile, congressional leaders have weighed how to address the issue.

      "Sen. Ron Wyden, a Democrat from Oregon, pointed to a March 24 statement from a former senior SSA employee who claims that Bisignano has already been coordinating with DOGE despite not yet being confirmed as commissioner.

At the same time, Social Security is facing a potential financial crunch, with the program set to cut benefits starting in 2035 because its spending is outpacing income.",
      "Here's what Bisignano said during the hearing.",
      "Who is Frank Bisignano?",
      "Bisignano has served as the chief executive of Fiserv, a financial technology company, since July 2020. Under his leadership, Fiserv's stock price has more than doubled, while the company reported revenue of $20.5 billion for the year ended Dec. 31 2024, up from roughly $15 billion in 2020.",
      "Prior to serving as CEO of Fiserv, he was the chairman and CEO of First Data Corp., and oversaw the merger of First Data and Fiserv in 2019. Earlier in his career, Bisignano worked as co-chief operating officer of JPMorgan Chase & Co., and had also previously held senior positions at Citigroup.",
      "What does Bisignano say about Social Security?",
      "In an interview with CNBC in February, Bisignano said he views Social Security as both a technology and services organization, while pledging not to make any changes that affect the level of benefits.",
      "\"The objective isn't to touch benefits,\" Bisignano told CNBC. \"The objective is there is going to be fraud, waste and abuse in there,\" adding that he views himself as \"fundamentally a DOGE person.\"",
      "During Tuesday's hearing, the executive also said he plans to use artificial intelligence to identify and weed out fraud, waste or abuse within the system. He repeatedly referred to the current 1% payments error rate, which he said he believes is \"five decimal places too high.\" He added that he plans to \"focus on what we need to do to drive the 1% error rate down.\"",
      "Bisignano said part of that effort will start with what he described as an unsatisfied workforce at the agency.",
      "\"My objective is to come in and motivate the workforce we have ... to be able to get our job right the first time for the American public,\" Bisignano said in response to questioning.",
      "Mr. Trump and Musk have claimed on social media and in press briefings that people who are well over 100 years old are improperly and routinely drawing benefits from Social Security, a claim that has been refuted by the acting Social Security Administration commissioner.",
      "The program also automatically stops payments to people who are older than 115 years old, an agency rule that has been in effect since September 2015.",
      "On protecting Americans' data",
      "A key concern among some Social Security recipients and lawmakers is the potential exposure of millions of Americans' personal data after DOGE employees accessed the agency's systems. Bisignano claimed he is committed to protecting that data.",
      "When Sen. Wyden asked Bisignano if he would \"lock DOGE out of databases\" that workers have accessed, the nominee said that personally identifiable information \"will not be exposed.\"",
      "\"I am going to do whatever is required to protect the information,\" he said.",
      "On privatization and agency cuts",
      "Bisignano repeatedly said he had not thought about privatizing the agency, responding to a suggestion from Sen. Sheldon Whitehouse, a Democrat from Rhode Island, that the Trump administration's aim is to discredit the system and then send in \"tech bros and private equity folks\" to \"save\" it.",
      "Bisignano did not explicitly commit to opposing such a scheme, but rather answered that \"my job is to ensure claims are processed in the manner they should be.\"",
      "\"I've only been given one order, which is to run the agency in the right fashion,\" Mr. Bisignano said.",
      "Regarding customer service enhancements, Bisignano stressed the importance of meeting beneficiaries where they are, such as by providing customer service via phone as well as in person and online.

      "\"We write regarding our concerns about the Trump Administration's ongoing efforts \u2014 in conjunction with Elon Musk's Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE) \u2014 to hollow out the Social Security Administration (SSA) and deprive Americans of Social Security benefits they earned and need,\" the lawmakers wrote. \"In recent days, SSA officials have intensified their efforts to undermine the program, imposing burdensome administrative requirements on beneficiaries while simultaneously cutting thousands of agency jobs and closing dozens of Social Security offices.\"",
      "On the campaign trail in 2024, Mr. Trump\u00a0promised not to touch\u00a0the Social Security program, which provides monthly financial payments to\u00a0roughly\u00a01 in 5 Americans.",
      "Warren, a Democrat from Massachusetts, and Wyden, a Democrat from Oregon, also want Bisignano to vow not to privatize any part of Social Security, a move they say would benefit private-sector players like Fiserv.",

      "By contrast, Senate Finance Committee Chairman Mike Crapo and an Idaho Republican, said in a March\u00a0statement\u00a0that Bisignano's private-sector experience \"make him exceptionally qualified for the task ahead.\"",
      "In his Senate confirmation hearing on Tuesday, Bisignano repeatedly said he hasn't thought about privatizing the agency, responding to a suggestion from Sen.

      "Bisignano did not explicitly commit to opposing such a scheme, but rather answered that \"my job is to ensure claims are processed in the manner they should be.\"",
      "What do advocates for seniors have to say?",
      "Some advocacy groups that represent older Americans also question if Bisignano is the right person to lead the SSA.",
      "\"Mr. Bisignano's experience in the private sector could bring some fresh ideas to the SSA.

    "story": [
      "Americans are increasingly anxious about their financial prospects, with a closely watched gauge of consumer confidence slumping to a 12-year low amid growing concerns about tariffs and inflation.",
      "The Conference Board said\u00a0Tuesday that its consumer confidence index fell 7.2 points in March to 92.9, the fourth straight monthly decline and its lowest level since January of 2021. The reading was short of analysts expectations for a reading of 94.5, according to a survey by FactSet.",
      "The consumer confidence index measures both Americans' assessment of current economic conditions and their outlook for the next six months. The business group found that the measure of Americans' short-term expectations for income, business and the job market fell 9.6 points to 65.2. That's the lowest reading in 12 years and well below the threshold of 80, which the Conference Board says can signal a potential recession in the near future.",
      "The proportion of U.S. consumers anticipating a recession remains at a nine-month high, the board reported.",
      "\"Consumer confidence has come under a microscope in recent months as investors worry about retail sales and consumer spending \u2014 the engine of the U.S. economy,\" Bret Kenwell, U.S. investment analyst at eToro, said in an email. \"If consumer confidence continues to sag, it stands to reason that consumer spending, which accounts for roughly two-thirds of U.S. GDP, could also come under pressure.\"",
      "Consumer optimism has \"largely vanished\"",
      "\"Consumers' optimism about future income \u2014 which had held up quite strongly in the past few months \u2014 largely vanished, suggesting worries about the economy and labor market have started to spread into consumers' assessments of their personal situations,\" Stephanie Guichard, senior economist at The Conference Board, said in a statement.",
      "\"Like the Michigan survey results, this index says that consumers are rattled,\" added Carl Weinburg, chief economist at High Frequency Economics, referring to the University of Michigan's Survey of Consumers, which earlier this month showed that consumer sentiment had fallen to a two-year low. \"Their current situation is not so bad, but a growing do not feel so good about the future,\" he added.",
      "The Trump administration has largely played down the souring mood among Americans, saying it doesn't necessarily reflect what's happening in the actual economy. This argument is similar to what officials in former President Biden's administration said as high inflation dented consumer confidence without undermining growth.",
      "\"I just don't think that there's been a very strong correlation between the confidence data and actual consumer spending in recent years,\" Stephen Miran, chair of the White House Council of Economic Advisers, told CNBC on Tuesday. \"You go out in the street, people are going about their lives, you know, they're getting their paychecks, they're spending their paychecks, the economy is marching on ahead.\"",
      "Yet some of the nation's biggest retailers, who have noted a shift in consumer behavior, are telling a different story.",
      "Walmart and others lower profit forecasts",
      "Walmart has thrived with Americans trying to offset higher prices by seeking bargains. Late last month, however, the nation's largest retailer slashed its profit forecast for this year. Its sales outlook was also conservative and the company does not include the potential impact of tariffs in its expectations for 2025.",
      "Target's sales and profit slipped during the crucial holiday quarter, and the company predicted that there would be \"meaningful pressure\" on its profits to start the year in part because of tariffs on Mexico, Canada and China.",
      "Macy's, Best Buy, Abercrombie & Fitch, Dollar General and others also have grown cautious about their expectations for 2025, with many citing \"economic uncertainty.\"",
      "Home and car sales decline",
      "The Conference Board's survey showed that demand for both homes and cars has waned. However, in somewhat of a surprise given respondents' anxiety about the future, intentions to buy big-ticket items like appliances increased in March. The group said that could reflect a desire to buy before U.S. tariffs kick in, leading to price increases.",
      "While inflation has retreated from the highs during the post-pandemic rebound, it has remained above the Federal Reserve's 2% annual target. It is also important to note that while inflation isn't at the 9% high we saw in summer 2022, prices are still rising, just at a slower pace. Consumers have seen cumulative price increases above 20% since the inflation crisis began \u2014 higher than their income.",
      "\"Until there's more certainty on the tariff and macro front, sentiment and confidence remain vulnerable,\" eToro's Kenwell said.",
      "Consumers had appeared increasingly confident heading into the year-end holidays and spent generously. One month later, however, in January, U.S. retail sales fell sharply, though cold weather shared some of the blame.",
      "\"Consumers are spooked by headlines about higher tariffs and trade war, DOGE cuts and the stock market sell-off,\" Bill Adams, chief economist for Comerica Bank, said in a research note. \"When people fear for their jobs, they will cut back on discretionary spending on vacations and going out, and delay big purchases like new houses, cars, or appliances,\" he added.",
      "Adams predicts a weakening in discretionary consumer spending in the near-term, but sees a potential break in the clouds further ahead if, perhaps in 2026, tariff talk is replaced by tax cuts.",
      "\"If the public conversation turns from spending cuts to tax cut happy talk, consumer sentiment could rebound. But in the meantime, the economy is likely to slow and underperform its growth in 2023 and 2024,\" he said.",

    "summary": "Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth and other Trump officials allegedly used Signal for a group chat to discuss a highly sensitive operation.",
    "story": [
      "An encrypted messaging app called Signal is drawing attention and questions after top Trump officials \u2014 including Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth and Vice President JD Vance \u2014 allegedly used the service to discuss a highly sensitive military operation while inadvertently including The Atlantic's editor-in-chief, Jeffrey Goldberg, in the chat.",
      "On Monday, Goldberg published a piece in The Atlantic about how he was added to an 18-person chat on Signal earlier this month to discuss military strikes in Yemen, writing that at first he \"didn't think it could be real.\"",
      "The National Security Council said the messages seem to be \"authentic,\" in a statement to CBS News after the story was published.",
      "The use of Signal to discuss sensitive military operations is raising questions about the app, including its level of security against hackers and other bad actors. It's an app that many Americans may not be familiar with, given that Signal had about 70 million users in 2024, a fraction of the 1 billion active monthly users of Apple's iMessage, according to the national security publication Lawfare.",
      "President Trump told reporters on Tuesday that he had asked national security adviser Mike Waltz, who Goldberg said added him to the group chat, to \"immediately study\" the use of Signal by government officials.",
      "Here's what to know about the service.",
      "What is Signal?",
      "Signal is an encrypted service for text messaging, but it can also handle phone and video calls, making it a versatile app for talking on a secure channel with others. Up to 1,000 people can join a group chat, and messages can be set to disappear after a period of time.",
      "Signal has been gaining users because of its end-to-end encryption, which is boosting its \"adoption during uncertain times or specific events which reinforce its position as the go-to communication service,\" PP Foresight analyst Paolo Pescatore told CBS MoneyWatch.",
      "Its encryption prevents any third-party from viewing conversation content or listening in on calls. In other words, messages and calls sent on Signal are scrambled and only the sender and recipient at each end will have the key to decipher them.",
      "Unlike another popular messaging app, Telegram, encryption on Signal is turned on by default. Signal also says it doesn't collect or store any sensitive information.",
      "\"Signal messages and calls cannot be accessed by us or other third parties because they are always end-to-end encrypted, private and secure,\" according to the service.",
      "Signal didn't immediately reply to a request for comment about the Trump administration's use of the app.",
      "Who owns Signal?",
      "Signal is owned by the nonprofit Signal Foundation, which was set up by co-founders Moxie Marlinspike and Brian Acton to support the app's operations as well as \"investigate the future of private communication,\" according to the foundation's website. The foundation says it is a nonprofit \"with no advertisers or investors, sustained only by the people who use and value it.\"",
      "The foundation's board has five members, including Marlinspike and Acton, who co-founded WhatsApp and donated $50 million to set up the foundation.",
      "The Signal app was created more than a decade ago by Marlinspike, an entrepreneur, who was briefly head of product security at Twitter after he sold his mobile security startup, called Whisper Systems, to the social media company in 2011. Marlinspike merged two existing open source apps, one for texting and one for voice calls, to create Signal.",
      "Can Signal be hacked?",
      "Signal touts the privacy of its service, and experts agree it is more secure than conventional texting.",
      "But they also caution that it could be hacked. And in February 2025, the National Security Agency sent out an operational security special bulletin to its employees cautioning them of vulnerabilities in the Signal app, according to internal NSA documents obtained by CBS News.",
      "\"A vulnerability has been identified in the Signal Messenger Application. The use of Signal by common targets of surveillance and espionage activity has made the application a high value target to intercept sensitive information,\" the internal bulletin says.",
      "Signal\u00a0responded\u00a0to the bulletin in a social media post Tuesday, saying the NSA's \"memo used the term 'vulnerability' in relation to Signal-but it had nothing to do with Signal's core tech. It was warning against phishing scams targeting Signal users.\"",
      "\"Phishing isn't new, and it's not a flaw in our encryption or any of Signal's underlying technology,\" the company said. \"Phishing attacks are a constant threat for popular apps and websites.\"",
      "Government officials have used Signal for organizational correspondence, such as scheduling sensitive meetings. But in the Biden administration, people who had permission to download it on their White House-issued phones were instructed to use the app sparingly, according to a former national security official who served in the administration.",
      "\"Unlike other end-to-end encryption messaging services, Signal does boast a rich range of features,\" Pescatore said. \"However, hackers are always on the prowl to find weaknesses and use apps maliciously.\"",
      "What is Signal typically used for?",
      "Because of its end-to-end encryption, Signal is often used by national security and intelligence professionals, as well as activists, among others, according to Lawfare.",
      "A recent\u00a0Associated Press review\u00a0found that encrypted messaging apps are increasingly popular with government officials, with some using government mobile phone numbers, while others registered their accounts to personal numbers.",
      "Are there legal issues for government officials using Signal?",
      "Possibly, yes. Sharing sensitive national security details over Signal could violate the Espionage Act, CBS News national security contributor Sam Vinograd, who served in former President Barack Obama's Homeland Security Department, said Tuesday.",
      "\"By communicating classified information on a nonsecure platform like Signal, senior U.S. government officials ... increased the chance that foreign governments could get access to sensitive operational security plans \u2014 and that could put our own troops in harm's way,\" Vinograd said.",
      "While Mr. Trump told reporters from the Oval Office on Tuesday that \"I don't know anything about Signal, I wasn't involved in this,\" he indicated that other branches of government use the app.",
      "\"I hear it's used by a lot of groups, I hear it's used by the media a lot,\" he said. \"A lot of the military, I think successfully. Sometimes people can get onto those things, that's one of the prices you pay when you're not sitting in the Situation Room with no phones, which is always the best, frankly. The best is to be there.\"",
      "Mr. Trump said Signal is the \"No. 1 device or app that is used\" that he had asked Waltz to explore its use by government officials.",
      "Meanwhile, Democratic lawmakers are\u00a0demanding an investigation\u00a0into why highly\u00a0sensitive information\u00a0was being discussed on a commercially available messaging app, rather than secure government channels.",
      "The Atlantic's Goldberg also alleged that some of the messages in the group chat were designed to disappear after one week, and others after four weeks, which could be a violation of federal law requiring the preservation of official records.",

    "summary": "Disability rights advocates say income and asset caps for Medicaid buy-in programs are a \"poverty trap\" for millions of Americans.",
    "story": [
      "PLEASANTVILLE, Iowa \u2014 Zach Mecham has heard politicians demand that Medicaid recipients work or lose their benefits. He also has run into a jumble of Medicaid rules that effectively prevent many people with disabilities from holding full-time jobs.",
      "\"Which is it? Do you want us to work or not?\" he said.",
      "Mecham, 31, relies on the public insurance program to pay for services that help him live on his own despite a disability caused by muscular dystrophy. He uses a wheelchair to get around and a portable ventilator to breathe.",
      "A paid assistant stays with Mecham at night. Then a home health aide comes in the morning to help him get out of bed, go to the bathroom, shower, and get dressed for work at his online marketing business. Without the assistance, he would have to shutter his company and move into a nursing home, he said.",
      "Private health insurance plans generally do not cover such support services, so he relies on Medicaid, which is jointly financed by federal and state governments and covers millions of Americans who have low incomes or disabilities.",
      "Like most other states, Iowa has a Medicaid \"buy-in program,\" which allows people with disabilities to join Medicaid even if their incomes are a bit higher than would typically be permitted. About two-thirds of such programs charge premiums, and most have caps on how much money participants can earn and save.",
      "Some states have raised or eliminated such financial caps for people with disabilities. Mecham has repeatedly traveled to the Iowa Capitol to lobby legislators to follow those states' lead. The \"Work Without Worry\" bill would remove income and asset caps and instead require Iowans with disabilities to pay 6% of their incomes as premiums to remain in Medicaid. Those fees would be waived if participants pay premiums for employer-based health insurance, which would help cover standard medical care.",
      "Disability rights advocates say income and asset caps for Medicaid buy-in programs can prevent participants from working full time or accepting promotions. \"It's a trap \u2014 a poverty trap,\" said Stephen Lieberman, a policy director for the United Spinal Association, which supports the changes.",
      "Lawmakers in Florida, Hawaii, Indiana, Iowa, Maine, Mississippi, and New Jersey have introduced bills to address the issue this year, according to the National Conference of State Legislatures.",
      "Several other states have raised or eliminated their program's income and asset caps. Iowa's proposal is modeled on a Tennessee law passed last year, said Josh Turek, a Democratic state representative from Council Bluffs. Turek, who is promoting the Iowa bill, uses a wheelchair and earned two gold medals as a member of the U.S. Paralympics basketball team.",
      "Proponents say allowing people with disabilities to earn more money and still qualify for Medicaid would help ease persistent worker shortages, including in rural areas where the working-age population is shrinking.",
      "Turek believes now is a good time to seek expanded employment rights for people with disabilities, since Republicans who control the state and federal governments have been touting the value of holding a job. \"That's the trumpet I've been blowing,\" he said with a smile.",
      "The Iowa Legislature has been moving to require many nondisabled Medicaid recipients to work or to document why they can't. Opponents say most Medicaid recipients who can work already do so, and the critics say work requirements add red tape that is expensive to administer and could lead Medicaid recipients to lose their coverage over paperwork issues.",
      "Iowa Gov. Kim Reynolds has made Medicaid work requirements a priority this year. \"If you can work, you should. It's common sense and good policy,\" the Republican governor told legislators in January in her \"Condition of the State Address.\" \"Getting back to work can be a lifeline to stability and self-sufficiency.\"",
      "Her office did not respond to KFF Health News' queries about whether Reynolds supports eliminating income and asset caps for Iowa's buy-in program, known as Medicaid for Employed People with Disabilities.",
      "Spouse's income counts toward cap",
      "National disability rights activists say income and asset caps on Medicaid buy-in programs discourage couples from marrying or even pressure them to split up if one or both partners have disabilities. That's because in many states a spouse's income and assets are counted when determining eligibility.",
      "In Iowa, for example, the monthly net income cap is $3,138 for a single person and $4,259 for a couple.",
      "Iowa's current asset cap for a single person in the Medicaid buy-in plan is $12,000. For a couple, that cap rises only to $13,000. Countable assets include investments, bank accounts, and other things that could be easily converted to cash, but not a primary home, vehicle, or household furnishings.",
      "\"You have couples who have been married for decades who have to go through what we call a 'Medicaid divorce,' just to get access to these supports and services that cannot be covered in any other way,\" said Maria Town, president of the American Association of People with Disabilities.",
      "Town said some states, including Massachusetts, have removed income caps for people with disabilities who want to join Medicaid. She said the cost of adding such people to the program is at least partially offset by the premiums they pay for coverage and the increased taxes they contribute because they are allowed to work more hours. \"I don't think it has to be expensive\" for the state and federal governments, she said.",
      "Congress has considered a similar proposal to allow people with disabilities to work more hours without losing their Social Security disability benefits, but that bill has not advanced.",
      "Although most states have Medicaid buy-in programs, enrollment is relatively low, said Alice Burns, a Medicaid analyst at KFF, a health information nonprofit that includes KFF Health News.",
      "Fewer than 200,000 people nationwide are covered under the options, Burns said. \"Awareness of these programs is really limited,\" she said, and the income limits and paperwork can dissuade potential participants.",
      "In states that charge premiums for Medicaid buy-in programs, monthly fees can range from $10 to 10% of a person's income, according to a KFF analysis of 2022 data.",
      "Iowa bill to remove caps",
      "The Iowa proposal to remove income and asset caps has drawn bipartisan backing from legislators, including a 20-0 vote of approval from the House Health and Human Services Committee. \"This aligns with things both parties are aiming to do,\" said state Rep. Carter Nordman, a Republican who chaired a subcommittee meeting on the bill. Nordman said he supports the idea but wants to see an official estimate of how much it would cost the state to let more people with disabilities participate in the Medicaid buy-in program.",
      "Mecham, the citizen activist lobbying for the Iowa bill, said he hopes it allows him to expand his online marketing and graphic design business, \"Zach of All Trades.\"",
      "On a recent morning, health aide Courtnie Imler visited Mecham's modest house in Pleasantville, a town of about 1,700 people in an agricultural region of central Iowa. Imler chatted with Mecham while she used a hoist to lift him out of his wheelchair and onto the toilet. Then she cleaned him up, brushed his hair, and helped him put on jeans and a John Deere T-shirt. She poured him a cup of coffee and put a straw in it so he could drink it on his own, swept the kitchen floor, and wiped the counters. After about an hour, she said goodbye.",
      "After getting cleaned up and dressed, Mecham rolled his motorized wheelchair over to his plain wooden desk, fired up his computer, and began working on a social media video for a client promoting a book. He scrolled back and forth through footage of an interview she'd done, so he could pick the best clip to post online. He also shoots video, takes photos, and writes advertising copy.",
      "Mecham loves feeling productive, and he figures he could work at least twice as many hours if not for the risk of losing Medicaid coverage. He said he's allowed to make a bit more money than Iowa Medicaid's standard limit because he signed up for a federal option under which he eventually expects to work his way off Social Security disability payments.",
      "There are several such options for people with disabilities, but they all involve complicated paperwork and frequent reports, he said. \"This is such a convoluted system that I have to navigate to build any kind of life for myself,\" he said. Many people with disabilities are intimidated by the rules, so they don't apply, he said. \"If you get it wrong, you lose the health care your life depends on.\"",

    "summary": "A once-every-four-year report card on the upkeep of America's infrastructure gave it a \"C\" grade in 2025, up slightly from previous reports.",
    "story": [
      "A once-every-four-year report card on the upkeep of America's infrastructure\u00a0gave it a \"C\" grade on Tuesday, up slightly from previous reports, largely due to investments made during former President Joe Biden's administration.",
      "The report from the American Society of Civil Engineers, which examined everything from roads and dams to drinking water and railroads, warns that federal funding must be sustained or increased to avoid further deterioration and escalating costs.",
      "\"We have seen the investments start to pay off, but we still have a lot of work to do out there,\" said Darren Olson, chair of this year's report. He said decrepit infrastructure \u2014 from poor roads that damage cars to delayed flights to power outages that spoil groceries \u2014 hurts people and the economy.",
      "\"By investing in our infrastructure, we're making our economy more efficient, we're making it stronger (and) we're making ourselves globally more competitive,\" he said.",
      "The report was the first ever not to have any categories with a D-minus grade, CBS News senior transportation and national correspondent Kris Van Cleave notes.",
      "Eight categories saw grade increases, Van Cleave says. Many of them had been chronically stuck at D-minus or D for years",
      "Olson said it's especially critical that infrastructure can handle more extreme weather due to climate change, pointing to hurricanes that devastated the East Coast and parts of Appalachia last year. The U.S. saw 27 weather disasters last year that cost at least $1 billion, the second-most since 1980.",
      "The 2021 Infrastructure Investment and Jobs Act provided $550 billion in new infrastructure investments but is set to expire in 2026. Another $30 billion came from the 2022 Inflation Reduction Act, including for projects focused on clean energy and climate change, the engineering group said.",
      "President Trump's administration has targeted some of Biden's green policies. Public parks improved to a C-minus from a D-plus, for example, thanks in part to significant investments over several years. Recently, however, the Trump administration moved to slash National Park Service staffing.",
      "Massive spending needed",
      "In 2021, the U.S. earned a C-minus overall. The investments made since then are just a fraction of the $9.1 trillion the civil engineers group estimates is needed to bring all of the nation's current infrastructure into a state of good repair.",
      "Even if current federal infrastructure funding were maintained, there still would be a $3.7 trillion gap over a decade, according to the report.",
      "The bill to upgrade and maintain the nation's roughly 50,000 water utilities, for example, is $625 billion over the next two decades, according to the federal government. The grade for drinking water was C-minus, unchanged from four years ago.",
      "Many communities already struggling to maintain old, outdated drinking water systems also face new requirements to replace lead service lines and reduce per- and polyfluoroalkyl substances, collectively known as PFAS.",
      "The infrastructure bill helped complete or start \"a lot of really important projects,\" said Scott Berry, director of policy and governmental affairs at the US Water Alliance. \"But the gap has widened so much over the last couple of decades that a lot, lot more investment is going to be needed.\"",
      "The bill also provided billions to help the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers upgrade inland waterways, which move roughly $150 billion in commerce every year, improving the grade from a D-plus to a C-minus.",
      "Barges on the Mississippi River, for example, carry enormous amounts of coal, soybeans, corn and other raw materials to international markets. But critical infrastructure like locks and dams \u2014 many built more than a half-century ago and requiring regular maintenance and repair \u2014 is often invisible to the public, making it easy to neglect, said Mike Steenhoek, executive director of the Soy Transportation Coalition.",
      "And when big projects are funded, it too often comes in stages, he said. That forces projects to pause until more money is appropriated, driving up costs for materials and labor.",
      "\"If we really want to make the taxpayer dollars stretch further, you have got to be able to bring a greater degree of predictability and reliability in how you fund these projects,\" he said.",
      "The report's focus on engineering and money misses the importance of adopting policies that could improve how people use and pay for infrastructure, according to Clifford Winston, a microeconomist in the Brookings Institution's economic studies program.",
      "\"You fail to make the most efficient use of what you have,\" said Winston. For example, he noted that congestion pricing like that recently adopted by New York City\u00a0\u2014 charging people to drive in crowded areas \u2014 places the burden on frequent users and can pressure people to drive less, reducing the need for new bridges, tunnels and repairs.",
      "Roads remain in chronically poor shape, receiving a D-plus compared to a D in the last report, despite $591 billion in investments since 2021.",
      "Aviation also came in with a D-plus, Van Cleave notes.",
      "Two categories, rail and energy, received lower grades. Disasters like the derailment of a train carrying dangerous chemicals in East Palestine, Ohio, in 2023 lowered rail's previous B mark to a B-minus.",
      "The energy sector, stressed by surging demand from data centers and electric vehicles, got a D-plus, down from C-minus.",
      "Invest now or pay more later",
      "Engineers say problems in many sectors have festered for so long that the nation must figure out how to address the shortcomings now or pay for them when systems fail.",
      "On Wednesday, a delegation of engineers will visit Washington to talk to lawmakers about the funding impacts and \"the importance of continuing that investment,\" said Olson, who said the needs are a bipartisan issue.",
      "\"When we talk about it in ways of how better infrastructure saves the American family money, how better infrastructure supports economic growth, we're really confident that ... there is strong support,\" he said."

      "Deputy Postmaster General Doug Tulino will take on the role until the Postal Service Board of Governors names a permanent replacement for DeJoy, who became postmaster general in the summer of 2020 during Mr. Trump's first term. He was a Republican donor who owned a logistics business and was the first person to hold the position in nearly two decades who was not a career postal employee.",
      "DeJoy's tenure was marked by the COVID-19 pandemic, surges in mail-in election ballots and efforts to stem losses through cost and service cuts.",
      "\"I believe strongly that the organization is well positioned and capable of carrying forward and fully implementing the many strategies and initiatives that comprise our transformation and modernization, and I have been working closely with the Deputy Postmaster General to prepare for this transition,\"\u00a0DeJoy said in a statement.",
      "He added that \"much work remains that is necessary to sustain our positive trajectory.\"",
      "The National Association of Letter Carriers' president, Brian L. Renfroe, said in a statement Monday that the union stands ready to work with whomever the board selects as the next postmaster general.",
      "\"The future of the Postal Service is on the line, and choosing someone with innovative ideas and appreciation for our Constitutionally mandated service is essential,\" Renfroe said.",
      "Earlier this month, DeJoy said he planned to cut 10,000 workers and billions of dollars from the USPS budget and he'd do that working with DOGE, according to a letter sent to members of Congress.",
      "USPS workers, including mail carriers, have gathered over the past week to protest the cuts and the plan they say will dismantle the service.",
      "Critics of the plan fear negative effects of the cuts will be felt across the country. Democratic U.S. Rep. Gerald Connolly, of Virginia, has said in response that turning over the service to DOGE would result in it being undermined and privatized.",
      "DeJoy had introduced in 2021 a 10-year overhaul he has orchestrated\u00a0\u2014 including higher postal rates, slower standard delivery and fewer post offices \u2014 to stem the Postal Service's financial hemorrhaging. The USPS targeted a turn to profit in fiscal 2024 but instead reported two consecutive years of increasing losses.",

    "summary": "23andMe, which helped popularize ancestry tracing through genetic testing, filed for bankruptcy protection and will seek a sale.",
    "story": [
      "23andMe, a formerly high-flying genetic testing company, announced Sunday that it was declaring bankruptcy and that it would seek a buyer.",
      "The company also said CEO and co-founder Anne Wojcicki is resigning immediately and will be replaced by Chief Financial and Accounting Officer Joe Selsavage as interim chief executive.",
      "23andMe moved in November to slash 40% of its workforce as part of a restructuring plan, a step that came roughly two months after its entire board resigned.",
      "\"We expect the court-supervised process will advance our efforts to address the operational and financial challenges we face, including further cost reductions and the resolution of legal and leasehold liabilities,\" 23andMe Chair Mark Jensen said in a statement. \"We believe in the value of our people and our assets and hope that this process allows our mission of helping people access, understand and benefit from the human genome to live on for the benefit of customers and patients.\"",
      "23andMe offers two basic kinds of services \u2014 consumer and therapeutics. The former provides people with information on their ancestry and genetic health profile, including the risk of passing on certain conditions to their children, according to S&P Capital IQ. The therapeutics unit works to develop treatments and conducts research into cancer, immune diseases and other conditions.",
      "Data privacy concerns",
      "23andMe's struggles have raised concerns about the privacy of its customers' genetic data, which is used to trace people's ancestry, among other purposes. In filing for bankruptcy protection, the company said there will be no changes to how it manages and protects people's data.",
      "23andMe users must explicitly affirm that the company may share their personal data, although people's data could be included as part of a sale of the company. Some states have passed privacy laws that would require a person's consent before their genetic data is transferred from one entity to another.",
      "In its bankruptcy announcement, 23andMe said any buyer of its assets would have to observe applicable privacy laws for customer data. The company has also previously said that any customer data it shares with other parties is anonymous and can't be traced to individual users.",
      "23andMe also allows customers to delete their accounts. To do that, users must log in to their account and submit a request. The company will send an email confirming the request to delete the data, which the user must then verify.",
      "23andMe's stock, which once traded for more than $300 a share, fell to 79 cents before the start of trade Monday. In January, 23andMe reported a third-quarter net loss of $26.8 million on revenue of $60.3 million, an improvement over its loss of $259.7 million on revenue of $44.7 million in the year-ago period.",
      "The company filed for Chapter 11 protection in the U.S. Bankruptcy Court for the Eastern District of Missouri. 23andMe said that, if granted approval in bankruptcy court, the company would solicit bids from potential acquirers over a 45-day period and potentially conduct an auction.",
      "One possible buyer is Wojcicki herself. The executive, who recently submitted an acquisition offer that 23andMe rejected earlier this month, said in a social media post Monday that she may again bid for 23andMe.",
      "\"I have resigned as CEO of the company so I can be in the best position to pursue the company as an independent bidder,\" she wrote, adding that continues to believe in the company's brand and business.",
      "\"We have had many successes but I equally take accountability for the challenges we have today. There is no doubt that the challenges faced by 23andMe through an evolving business model have been real, but my belief in the company and its future is unwavering,\" she said.",

Mr. Trump on Monday also threatened 25% tariffs against any nation that continues to buy oil or gas from Venezuela as of April 2.

He reassured the workers that the company's Model Y, which is undergoing a refresh, would remain \"the best-selling car on Earth again this year.\" He also predicted Tesla will have sold more than 10 million cars worldwide by next year, up from about 7 million cars now.",
      "\"There are times when there are rocky moments, where there is stormy weather, but what I am here to tell you is that the future is incredibly bright and exciting,\" Musk said.",

      "That optimism helped lift Tesla's stock by 70% in the period between Mr. Trump's Nov. 5 election and his Jan. 20 inauguration, creating an additional $560 billion in shareholder wealth.

    "summary": "Billionaire Elon Musk on Friday clarified his reasons for visiting Wisconsin two days ahead of its hotly contested Supreme Court election after deleting a social media post saying he planned to \"personally hand over\" $2 million.",
    "story": [
      "Wisconsin's Democratic attorney general asked a court on Friday to block billionaire\u00a0Elon Musk from handing out $1 million checks to voters this weekend, just two days before the state's\u00a0hotly contested Supreme Court race was to be decided.",
      "Attorney General Josh Kaul filed the lawsuit in Dane County Circuit Court to stop Musk from making the payments, which he said he would make Sunday in Wisconsin. Musk initially said in a post on his social media platform, X, that he planned to \"personally hand over\" $2 million to a pair of voters who have already cast their ballots in the race.",
      "Musk later posted a clarification, saying the money will go to people who will be \"spokesmen\" for an online petition against \"activist\" judges. After first saying the event would only be open to people who had voted in the Supreme Court race, he said attendance would be limited to those who have signed the petition.",
      "Also on Friday, Musk's political action committee identified the recipient of its first $1 million giveaway \u2014 a Green Bay man who had donated to the Wisconsin GOP and the conservative candidate in the court race, and who has a history of posting support for President Donald Trump and his agenda.",
      "Musk deleted the post from his social media platform, X, about 12 hours after he initially posted it late Thursday night. He issued the clarification about an hour later.",
      "He had posted that he planned to give $1 million each to two voters at the event on Sunday, just two days before the election\u00a0that will determine ideological control of the court\u00a0in the battleground state.",
      "\"I will also personally hand over two checks for a million dollars each in appreciation for you taking the time to vote,\" Musk's now-deleted post said. \"This is super important.\"",
      "The Supreme Court race has\u00a0shattered previous spending records for a U.S. judicial election\u00a0and has become a referendum on Musk and the first months of President Donald Trump's administration.",
      "Trump, a Republican, endorsed Brad Schimel and hosted a telephone town hall with him on Thursday night.",
      "\"It's a very important race,\" Trump said in brief remarks by phone, in a call organized by Schimel's campaign. \"I know you feel it's local, but it's not. It's really much more than local. The whole country is watching.\"",
      "Schimel, a Waukesha County judge, faces Dane County Judge Susan Crawford in Tuesday's election. Crawford is backed by a wide range of Democrats, including the liberal justices who hold a 4-3 majority on the Wisconsin Supreme Court and former President Barack Obama. The retirement this year of a liberal justice puts majority control of the court in play.",
      "Musk's political action committee said Friday that it had awarded $1 million to Scott Ainsworth, a mechanical engineer from Green Bay, for signing its petition protesting against \"activist\" judges. In a video posted on X, Ainsworth encouraged people to sign the petition and \"get out and vote early for Brad Schimel.\"",
      "\"If everyone in the MAGA movement shows up and votes for Brad Schimel, we will win,\" Ainsworth said in the video.",
      "Ainsworth donated $350 to Schimel's campaign this year, campaign finance records show.",
      "Andrew Romeo, a spokesperson for Musk's political action committee, declined to say whether Ainsworth was one of the two who would be receiving $1 million on Sunday.",
      "Musk promised $100 to any registered Wisconsin voter\u00a0who signed the petition or forwarded it to someone who did.",
      "That raised questions about whether the petition violated Wisconsin law that makes it a felony to offer, give, lend or promise to lend or give anything of value to induce a voter to cast a ballot or not vote.",
      "Any legal challenge to Musk's payments could end up before the Wisconsin Supreme Court.",
      "A bipartisan coalition of government watchdog groups and former office holders, along with a liberal Madison law firm, asked the Wisconsin attorney general and the Milwaukee County district attorney to investigate the $1 million payment and the offer of $100 for signing the petition.",
      "The group, in its letter sent Thursday night, said the payments appear to violate the state law against election bribery.",
      "Attorney General Josh Kaul and Milwaukee County District Attorney Kent Lovern did not immediately return messages Friday seeking comment.",
      "Schimel, a former attorney general, was asked about the petition on Thursday by WISN-TV.",
      "\"I, frankly, thought, 'Should I sign that petition? I'm against activist judges, but I don't think I should do that,'\" Schimel said.",
      "When asked about the $1 million award, Schimel said, \"I don't know what the criteria to get it was.\"",
      "Crawford's campaign spokesperson Derrick Honeyman, called Musk's announced visit to Wisconsin a \"last-minute desperate distraction.\"",
      "\"Wisconsinites don't want a billionaire like Musk telling them who to vote for, and, on Tuesday, voters should reject Musk's lackey Brad Schimel,\" he said.",
      "Musk's political action committee used a nearly identical tactic before the White House election last year, offering to pay $1 million a day to voters in Wisconsin and six other battleground states\u00a0who signed a petition supporting the First and Second Amendments.",
      "During last year's presidential race, Philadelphia's district attorney sued in an attempt to stop the payments under Pennsylvania law. But a judge said prosecutors failed to show the effort was an illegal lottery and allowed it to continue through Election Day.",
      "Musk and groups he funds have already spent more than $20 million in an effort to elect Schimel, while billionaire George Soros has given $2 million to bolster Crawford, and Democratic Illinois Gov. JB Pritzker has donated $1.5 million.",
      "Musk got involved in the race just days after his electric car company, Tesla, filed a lawsuit against Wisconsin in an effort to open dealerships in the state.",
      "Crawford and her allies have accused Musk of trying to buy influence on the court given that Tesla's lawsuit could end up before the justices.",
      "The race comes as the Wisconsin Supreme Court is also expected to rule on abortion rights, congressional redistricting, union power and voting rules that could affect the 2026 midterms and the 2028 presidential election.",
      "Wisconsin is one of a handful of true battleground states, which only intensifies the focus on court races where rules for voting will be decided. Trump won Wisconsin in 2016 and 2024 by less than a percentage point, but he lost it in 2020 by a similar margin. Five of the past seven presidential elections in the state have been decided by less than a percentage point.",
      "More than $81 million has been spent on the Supreme Court race so far, obliterating the record for a judicial race in the U.S. of $51 million set in Wisconsin just two years ago, according to Brennan Center tallies.",

    "story": [
      "Update: A judge in Washington, D.C., issued a temporary restraining order on Friday, March 28, blocking the Trump administration's executive order against the law firm Jenner & Block.",
      "President Trump issued an executive order Tuesday targeting Chicago law firm Jenner & Block. The firm also has an office in Washington, D.C.",
      "Jenner & Block has been an active part of the legal challenges against Mr. Trump's executive orders, including successfully securing a preliminary injunction against an order from the administration that reduced health care access for transgender youth.",
      "That case is still pending in a Maryland-based federal court.",
      "This executive order instructs officials to review and revoke firm members' security clearance, identify any good, property, material and services provided by the federal government and stop providing them, terminate any government contracts that may exist with the law firm, and not hire any employees of the firm for any future federal government jobs.",
      "The order also singles out attorney Andrew Weissman, who worked on Robert Mueller's investigation into Russian interference in the 2016 election. The executive order says he was re-hired at Jenner & Block, but the firm clarified that Weissman hasn't worked there since 2021.",
      "The executive order specifies that Weissman is prohibited from being hired by or working for the federal government unless a waiver is issued.",
      "The Trump administration has targeted a number of law firms that have been active in challenging or pausing executive orders and policies in the courts.",
      "Previously, the president issued and then rescinded an executive order targeting international law firm Paul, Weiss, Rifkind, Garrison & Wharton after it pledged to review its hiring practices and provide tens of millions of dollars in free legal services to support certain White House initiatives.",
      "A spokesperson for Jenner & Block responded to the order in a statement, writing in part, \"Today, we have been named in an Executive Order similar to one which has already been declared unconstitutional by a federal court. We remain focused on serving and safeguarding our clients' interests with the dedication, integrity, and expertise that has defined our firm for more than one hundred years and will pursue all appropriate remedies.\"",

    "summary": "President Trump has issued executive orders targeting law firms that have employed his purported political opponents.",
    "story": [
      "Washington \u2014 President Trump announced Friday that the law firm Skadden, Arps, Slate, Meagher and Flom agreed to provide more than $100 million in pro bono work for initiatives backed by his administration.",
      "The agreement makes Skadden Arps the second major firm to reach a deal with Mr. Trump amid a recent blitz of executive orders targeting law firms that have employed his purported political opponents. The orders issued by the president have focused on the firms Perkins Coie, Jenner & Block, and Wilmer Cutler Pickering Hale and Dorr, known as WilmerHale.",
      "All three of those firms have filed federal lawsuits challenging the executive orders as a violation of the First Amendment. A federal judge in Washington blocked parts of Mr. Trump's executive order against Perkins Coie earlier this month, and on Friday, two separate judges issued temporary restraining orders halting the president's actions against Jenner & Block and WilmerHale.",
      "While Mr. Trump earlier in the month issued an order going after a fourth firm, Paul, Weiss, it was rescinded after the international firm agreed to provide $40 million in free legal services to support causes backed by the administration.",
      "The president said in a statement posted to Truth Social that in addition to providing $100 million in pro bono work, the firm will not engage in \"illegal DEI discrimination and preferences\" and work with an outside counsel to advise it on employment practices.",
      "Mr. Trump also said Skadden Arps \"will not deny representation to clients, such as members of politically disenfranchised groups, who have not historically received legal representation from major National Law Firms, including in pro bono matters, and in support of non-profits, because of the personal political views of individual lawyers.\"",
      "The White House said Skadden Arps approached the administration \"and declared the Firm's strong commitment to ending the Weaponization of the Justice System and the Legal Profession.\"",
      "Jeremy London, the firm's executive partner, said in a statement distributed by Mr. Trump that it is \"pleased to have achieved a successful agreement with President Trump and his Administration. We engaged proactively with the President and his team in working together constructively to reach this agreement. The Firm looks forward to continuing our productive relationship with President Trump and his Administration. We firmly believe that this outcome is in the best interests of our clients, our people, and our Firm.\"",
      "The executive orders targeting the law firms are among a number of actions taken by Mr. Trump since he returned to the White House that have gone after his perceived enemies. He revoked the security clearances of former Vice President Kamala Harris, former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton and other top Biden administration officials, as well as others who have been critical of him, last week. Mr. Trump also pulled the security details for Dr. Anthony Fauci and retired Gen. Mark Milley, who was chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff during the Trump and Biden administrations.",
      "Executive orders targeting major law firms",
      "The law firm-related orders take issue with the work they have performed and the lawyers previously on their payrolls. In the directive targeting Perkins Coie, Mr. Trump attacked the firm for representing Clinton during her 2016 presidential campaign and hiring a research firm that retained a former British spy, Christopher Steele, who\u00a0produced the infamous \"Steele Dossier.\"",
      "The president's order attacking Jenner & Block singles out the firm for hiring Andrew Weissmann, who worked with former special counsel Robert Mueller on his investigation into Russia's efforts to influence the 2016 presidential election. Weissmann left the firm in 2021. It also took issue with Jenner & Block's work on a challenge to Mr. Trump's executive order that seeks to strip federal funds from medical institutions that provide gender-affirming care to minors, among other lawsuits.",
      "In a ruling late Friday, Judge John D. Bates, an appointee of President George W. Bush, issued an order temporarily blocking the action, saying it likely violates the First, Fifth and Sixth Amendments. The judge called Mr. Trump's executive order \"disturbing\" and \"troubling\" on the grounds that it attacks pro bono practice.",
      "\"The court does not take lightly the power to enjoin the executive branch, but the government has not made any persuasive case that the public interest will be harmed\" by halting enforcement, he said.",
      "Mr. Trump's latest executive order, which targets WilmerHale, accused the firm of weaponizing the justice system by employing Mueller and two others who worked on his investigation, James Quarles and Aaron Zebley. Mueller left WilmerHale more than three years ago, according to the firm, and Quarles is retired. Zebley is a partner at WilmerHale.",
      "In his ruling Friday night temporarily blocking\u00a0portions of Mr. Trump's executive order, U.S. District Judge Richard Leon wrote: \"There is no doubt this retaliatory action chills speech and legal advocacy, or that it qualifies as a constitutional harm.\"",
      "Leon said WilmerHale \"faces more than economic harm\" from the executive order, \"it faces crippling losses and its very survival is at stake.\" He wrote that the injuries to the firm from the order \"would be so severe and would spill over to its clients and the justice system at large. The public interest demands protecting against harms of this magnitude.\"",
      "His temporary restraining order stops the Trump administration from requiring government contracting agencies to terminate all contracts with WilmerHale, and stops the administration from restricting WilmerHale employees' access to federal buildings and officials.",
      "The executive orders directed agency heads to suspend any active security clearances held by employees of three firms and require federal contractors to disclose any business with WilmerHale, Jenner & Block and Perkins Coie. The administration is also directed to review all contracts with the firms or with entities that disclose doing business with them.",
      "The fallout from the executive orders has been swift. In a declaration filed with the court, Thomas Perrelli, firm chair and a partner at Jenner & Block, warned that if allowed to take the effect, the restrictions laid out in Mr. Trump's order would be \"devastating and irreparable.\"",
      "According to Perrelli, one client has already informed Jenner & Block that the Justice Department notified them that they cannot bring their lawyers from the firm to a department meeting set for April 3. That client, Perrelli wrote, will need to attend the meeting without their outside representation or hire new counsel before it.",
      "Some Jenner & Block clients are also worried the firm cannot represent them in federal court or go into government buildings to engage with regulatory agencies or government officials, he said. Within 24 hours of Mr. Trump's order, Perrelli said several clients expressed concerns about the firm's representation because they were unsure whether Jenner & Block lawyers could enter federal buildings and courthouses, negotiate with government officials or participate in meetings with the Justice Department.",
      "As to the order's provisions targeting government contractors with a relationship with Jenner & Block, Perrelli said 40% of the firm's revenue came from clients who have federal contracts or subcontracts.",
      "\"If we lost that business, or even a portion of it, it would be a serious threat to the firm's financial health,\" Perrelli wrote.",

    "summary": "A recent poll\u200b shows 85% of Greenlanders do not want to be part of the United States.",
    "story": [
      "Washington \u2014 Vice President JD Vance\u00a0said Friday during a day trip to a U.S. base in Greenland that the Trump administration doesn't think that \"military force is ever going to be necessary\" there, the same day President Trump said, \"We have to have Greenland.\"",
      "Vance visited the Pituffik Space Base, the northernmost U.S. military installation, along with second lady Usha Vance, national security adviser Mike Waltz, Secretary of Energy Chris Wright and Sen. Mike Lee of Utah. While there, the vice president blasted Denmark for its handling of the island, as the Trump White House eyes the semi-autonomous Danish territory despite opposition from residents and leaders. While Vance was there, President Trump reiterated his strong desire to acquire the island.",
      "\"We need Greenland, very importantly, for international security,\" the president told reporters at the White House. \"We have to have Greenland. It's not a question of, 'Do you think we can do without it?' We can't.\"",
      "Mr. Trump hasn't ruled out military force in Greenland, while Vance on Friday said he believes the people of Greenland will seek independence from Denmark. A reporter asked Vance if his message is consistent with the president's. Vance said the president wants more of a U.S. presence in Greenland, but \"the president has said clearly he doesn't think that military force is going to be necessary.\"",
      "\"What we think is going to happen is that the Greenlanders are going to choose through self-determination to become independent of Denmark, and then we're going to have conversations with the people of Greenland from there,\" Vance said. \"So I think talking about anything too far in the future is way too premature. We do not think that military force is ever going to be necessary. We think this makes sense. And because we think the people of Greenland are rational and good, we think we're going to be able to cut a deal, Donald Trump style, to ensure the security of this territory but also the United States of America.\"",
      "Vance said his trip to the base helped him see up close how critical Greenland is for U.S. national security. If an enemy fired a missile on the U.S., it would be the American soldiers at the Greenland base who would alert their countrymen, he said. Vance said the U.S. knows Russia and China are taking serious interest in the Arctic, and the U.S. needs to make sure it's leading in the Arctic. But while Vance recognized Denmark has been an important security partner in the past, he launched into criticisms of the European country, saying the U.S. base in Greenland is less secure than it was decades ago because of Denmark's stewardship.",
      "\"There is no amount of bullying, no amount of obfuscating, no amount of confusing the issue,\" Vance said. \"Our message to Denmark is very simple: You have not done a good job by the people of Greenland, you have underinvested in the people of Greenland, and you have underinvested in the security architecture of this incredible, beautiful landmass filled with incredible people. That has to change. And because it hasn't changed, that's why President Trump's policy in Greenland is what it is.\"",
      "The second lady was originally scheduled to visit Greenland in an expanded cultural trip this week, and then the vice president\u00a0announced\u00a0Tuesday that he would be joining her for a shorter trip that was more focused on U.S. policy and defense.",
      "Vance also thanked soldiers on the base, who are there for a year at a time and can't bring their families with them.",
      "\"I know it's a lot of sacrifice to spend a year away from your families, but the mission is really important,\" Vance said. \"The Trump administration, the president, is really interested in Arctic security. As you all know, that's a big issue, and it's only going to get bigger over the coming decade, so thanks for doing what you do.\"",
      "Waltz told the soldiers they're carrying a \"tradition\" of U.S. soldiers in Greenland, and said the president is very serious about Arctic security.",
      "A statement earlier this week by the vice president's office that announced Vance would join his wife on the trip emphasized Greenland's role in U.S. national security.",
      "\"During World War II, the United States established over a dozen military bases in Greenland to defend the North Atlantic from Nazi incursion,\" the statement said. \"During the Cold War, the United States committed additional resources to Greenland to defend against Soviet missile attacks.\"",
      "The statement went on to criticize Denmark, claiming, \"In the decades since, neglect and inaction from Danish leaders and past U.S. administrations have presented our adversaries with the opportunity to advance their own priorities in Greenland and the Arctic. President Trump is rightly changing course.\"",
      "Mr. Trump hasn't given up on the idea of absorbing Greenland into the U.S., despite opposition from Greenland's leadership and people. Greenland is an expansive island to the north and east of Canada that's a semi-autonomous territory of Denmark. It's roughly three times the size of Texas, but mostly covered by ice. Most of its roughly 57,000 people \u2014 a population smaller than Carson City, Nevada \u2014 live along Greenland's southern coast.",
      "A\u00a0recent poll shows 85% of Greenlanders do not want to be part of the United States, and residents who spoke with CBS News ahead of Vance's visit to a remote U.S. installation on the island \u2014 America's furthest north military base \u2014 clearly reflected the sentiments shown in that poll.",
      "\"He can't just take it like that,\" said Daniel Rosing, a trainee electrician who said he was proud of being a Greenlander.",
      "And Greenland's prime minister, M\u00fate Bourup Egede,\u00a0has called the planned visits from U.S. officials \"aggressive.\" And Mette Frederiksen, the Danish prime minister, said the U.S. is putting \"unacceptable pressure\" on Greenland.",
      "Despite this opposition, Mr. Trump said earlier this month in a speech before the joint session of Congress that he had \"a message tonight for the incredible people of Greenland: We strongly support your right to determine your own future, and if you choose, we welcome you into the United States of America.\"",
      "Mr. Trump said the territory is important to U.S. national security and that his administration is \"working with everybody involved to try and get it.\"",
      "\"And I think we're going to get it, one way or the other,\" Mr. Trump said. \"We're going to get it. We will keep you safe, we will make you rich, and together, we will take Greenland to heights like you have never thought possible before.

    "summary": "Sources tell CBS News the Signal chat involving senior Trump administration officials included sensitive intelligence Israel provided to the U.S.",
    "story": [
      "Washington \u2014 Israeli officials are furious over the Signal chat leak involving senior Trump administration officials because it included sensitive intelligence Israel provided to the U.S. from a human intelligence source in Yemen, CBS News has learned.",
      "While the Signal chat messages published by Jeffrey Goldberg of The Atlantic this week may not have compromised the effectiveness of the airstrike, given the publication's restraint on releasing the information, it did compromise a human source who provided the intelligence to the Israelis, who then provided it to the U.S. for targeting, a senior American intelligence official and a source with knowledge of the Israelis' ire told CBS News. They spoke on condition of anonymity to discuss sensitive national security matters.",
      "The Wall Street Journal on Thursday first reported about the Israelis complaining to U.S. officials about Mike Waltz, President Trump's national security adviser, who set up the group chat and apparently added Goldberg by mistake. The group spent several days earlier this month exchanging messages about possible plans to strike Iranian-backed Houthi militants in Yemen, who have repeatedly launched missiles at Israel and targeted shipping in the Red Sea.",
      "CBS News reached out to the National Security Council and the Israeli Embassy in the U.S. for comment on Friday, but has not received a response.",
      "On March 15, Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth texted the group chat, composed of what's known as the principals committee \u2014 the highest level of the National Security Council, which includes Cabinet members and other senior U.S. officials.",
      "According to Goldberg's report, one of Hegseth's messages said:",
      "\"Trigger Based\" F-18 1st Strike Window Starts (Target Terrorist is @ his Known Location so SHOULD BE ON TIME \u2013 also, Strike Drones Launch (MQ-9s)",
      "The senior American intelligence official told CBS News that in this context, \"Trigger Based\" refers to an operation that is contingent upon a specific condition or event \u2014 essentially, a go or no-go decision to launch an airstrike based on confirmation of the target's presence.",
      "That day, Navy F/A-18F Super Hornets launched from the aircraft carrier Harry S. Truman located in the Red Sea, while the MQ-9 Reaper drones took flight from bases in the Middle East. U.S. Central Command said in a statement that they had begun an operation which consisted of \"precision strikes against Iran-backed Houthi targets across Yemen in order to restore freedom of navigation.\"",
      "Hegseth said in another text, prior to the decision to strike, that he supported doing so to restore freedom of navigation and reestablish deterrence, which he described as being \"cratered\" under the Biden administration.",
      "After the U.S. airstrikes began on the Iranian-backed Houthis, Waltz addressed Vice President JD Vance in the chat group to say the building had collapsed and that U.S. military forces had \"multiple positive ID,\" indicating positive identification of the Houthi member or members they were aiming to kill.",
      "Waltz added: \"The first target \u2014 their top missile guy \u2014 we had positive ID of him walking into his girlfriend's building and it's now collapsed,\" according to the texts posted by The Atlantic.",
      "As a barrage of criticism rolled in this week towards those involved in the Signal chat, senior Trump administration officials have repeatedly said the information was not classified and that no sources or methods were compromised.",
      "\"No locations. No sources & methods. No WAR PLANS,\" Waltz wrote on X on Wednesday. \"Foreign partners had already been notified that strikes were imminent.\"",
      "But the sources who spoke to CBS News say Israeli intelligence is angry that the intelligence they provided to the U.S. was revealed. It's unclear what the fallout will be, if any, between the U.S. and Israel over the situation.",
      "CBS News reported Thursday that President Trump has been privately venting his irritation about the Signal chat leak and is closely monitoring the news to see if the fallout quiets down, according to sources familiar with the matter.",
      "On Tuesday, National Intelligence Director Tulsi Gabbard and CIA Director John Ratcliffe, both of whom were in the Signal group chat, testified before a Senate Intelligence Committee hearing.",
      "\"There was no classified material that was shared in that Signal chat,\" Gabbard told lawmakers. The following day, testifying before a House panel, Gabbard acknowledged the conversation was \"sensitive\" but again denied classified information was shared in the chat. \"There were no sources, methods, locations or war plans that were shared,\" she said.",
      "Multiple U.S. intelligence officials and members of the U.S. military who have spoken to CBS News this week contended that this type of information is always classified, but even if the information was somehow unclassified, it would still be a violation of cybersecurity and operational security protocols.",
      "CBS News on Tuesday published unclassified internal documents from a National Security Agency bulletin warning of vulnerabilities in using the Signal app, even though it is encrypted. The NSA bulletin was widely distributed to NSA employees a month before the Signal chat group was created by Waltz.",
      "The bulletin also underscored to NSA employees that third-party messaging applications such as Signal and WhatsApp are permitted for certain \"unclassified accountability/recall exercises\" but not for communicating more sensitive information.",
      "NSA employees were also warned to not send \"anything compromising over any social media or Internet-based tool or application,\" and to not \"establish connections with people you do not know.\"",

      "\"Free speech is under attack. Unions are under attack,\" Fain told CBS News chief Washington correspondent Major Garrett in an interview airing Sunday on \"Face the Nation with Margaret Brennan.\"",
      "On Thursday, the president signed an executive order to stop or slow down collective bargaining with agencies that have national security responsibilities, claiming that unions have stood in the way of their management. It affects a broad swath of agencies across the federal government, including some that do not have direct national security duties. The departments of defense, homeland security, state, energy, treasury and health and human services are listed in the order.",

      "\"They want their fair share. They're not asking to be rich,\" Fain told Garrett. \"They just want a decent standard of living,\" which he distilled into four issues, \"living wages, adequate health care, retirement security and having some quality of life other than just everything revolving around work.\"",

    "summary": "A federal judge has blocked the mass firings of employees at the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau.",
    "story": [
      "U.S. District Judge Amy Berman Jackson issued a preliminary injunction Friday that blocks the Trump administration from dismantling the Consumer Protection Financial Bureau.",
      "\"The court cannot look away or the CFPB will be dissolved and dismantled completely in approximately thirty days, well before this lawsuit has come to its conclusion,\" she wrote in a 112-page decision.",
      "Her order keeps the CFPB in existence until the case has been resolved on the merits. It also reinstates the agency's contracts, workforce, data and operational capacity.",
      "Jackson ruled that, without a court order, President Trump's administration would move quickly to shut down the agency that Congress created in the wake of the 2008 financial crisis.",
      "\"If the defendants are not enjoined, they will eliminate the agency before the Court has the opportunity to decide whether the law permits them to do it, and as the defendants' own witness warned, the harm will be irreparable,\" Berman Jackson said in her order.",
      "During a March 10 hearing, Jackson heard testimony about the chaos that erupted inside the agency after government employees were ordered to stop working last month. The bureau's chief operating officer, Adam Martinez, said the agency was in \"wind-down mode\" after Trump fired its previous director, Rohit Chopra, on Feb. 1.",
      "Trump installed a temporary replacement who ordered the immediate suspension of all agency operations, cancelled $100 million in contracts and fired 70 employees.",
      "Martinez said the agency's current leaders have adopted a more methodical approach than they initially did last month, when representatives of Elon Musk's Department of Government Efficiency arrived at its Washington headquarters.",
      "CFPB is responsible for protecting consumers from financial fraud and deceptive practices. It processes consumer complaints and examines banks to protect student loan borrowers.",
      "The National Treasury Employees Union, which represents more than 1,000 workers at the bureau, sued on Feb. 9 to block mass firings. Plaintiffs' attorneys argue that the administration doesn't have the constitutional authority to eliminate an agency that Congress created by statute.",
      "\"The defendants' unlawful action will have immediate consequences for the Americans that the CFPB was designed by Congress to protect,\"\u00a0the lawyers wrote.",
      "Government lawyers have said the plaintiffs are seeking to impermissibly place the CFPB in a \"judicially managed receivership,\" with the court overseeing its day-to-day operations.",
      "Jackson started her 112-page ruling by quoting Mr. Trump and his allies' own words about the bureau. Trump's billionaire adviser, Elon Musk, posted \"CFPB RIP\" on X, his social media platform, and added an emoji of a tombstone. White House budget director Russell Vought said it has been \"a woke and weaponized agency against disfavored industries and individuals for a long time.\" Mr. Trump called it \"a very important thing to get rid of.\"",
      "Among the plaintiffs was 83-year-old Eva Steege, a Lutheran pastor in hospice care who had been working with CFPB to resolve her student loan debt before her death. The agency found she qualified for loan forgiveness and a $15,000 refund of overpayments, but the stop-work order went into effect before she could have a follow-up meeting and the official she was working with was fired.",
      "\"Steege's fear of leaving her surviving family members saddled with her student loan debt came to pass on March 15, when she died,\" the judge wrote.",

    "story": [
      "Washington \u2014 A federal appeals court in Washington, D.C., cleared the way for President Trump to fire members of the National Labor Relations Board and Merit Systems Protection Board after district courts had earlier blocked their removals and ordered them reinstated.",
      "A three-judge panel of judges on the U.S. Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit divided 2-1 in agreeing to halt the lower court orders that voided Mr. Trump's firings of Gwynne Wilcox from the National Labor Relations Board and Cathy Harris from the Merit Systems Protection Board while legal proceedings move forward.",
      "Wilcox and Harris had argued that their firings violated federal laws that limited their removals only for neglect of duty or malfeasance in office. The Trump administration, meanwhile, defended the terminations and said the restrictions on the president's ability to remove the officials are unconstitutional.",
      "\"The people elected the president to enforce the nation's laws, and a stay serves that purpose by allowing the people's chosen officer to control the executive branch,\" Judge Justin Walker, who was appointed by Mr. Trump in his first term, wrote in an opinion siding with the administration.",
      "Wilcox was nominated to the National Labor Relations Board by former President Joe Biden and confirmed by the Senate to a five-year term in September 2023. She was designated chair of the board in December 2024.",
      "Harris was selected to serve on the Merit Systems Protection Board by Biden and confirmed in 2022. She was approved by the Senate as chair last year.",
      "Soon after Mr. Trump returned to the White House for his second term, Wilcox received a letter from the president informing her that the labor board had not been operating in a manner consistent with his administration's objectives, and telling her she had been removed. In Harris' case, she received an email in early February from the White House Presidential Personnel Office that stated, \"On behalf of President Donald J. Trump, I am writing to inform you that your position on the Merit Systems Protection Board is terminated, effective immediately.\"",
      "Both officials filed lawsuits seeking reinstatement in the federal district court in Washington. District court judges separately ruled in favor of Wilcox and Harris, finding their removals were unlawful and returning them to their roles.",
      "The Trump administration appealed the decisions and asked the D.C. Circuit to put them on hold while it considered the matter.",
      "In his concurring opinion, Walker said the district court orders effectively nullify the president's power under Article II to remove executive officials.",
      "\"The people elected the president, not Harris or Wilcox, to execute the nation's laws,\" he said. \"The forcible reinstatement of a presidentially removed principal officer disenfranchises voters by hampering the president's ability to govern during the four short years the people have assigned him the solemn duty of leading the executive branch.\"",
      "Judge Patricia Millet, appointed by former President Barack Obama, dissented from the court's decision to grant a stay.",
      "\"The whole purpose of a stay is to avoid instability and turmoil. But the court's decision today creates them,\" she wrote.",
      "Millett wrote that majority's rationale \"openly calls into question\" the constitutionality of dozens of federal statutes that limit the circumstances for when an official on a multimember board can be removed, from the Federal Reserve to the National Transportation Safety Board to the Nuclear Regulatory Commission.",
      "\"I cannot join a decision that uses a hurried and preliminary first-look ruling by this court to announce a revolution in the law that the Supreme Court has expressly avoided, and to trap in legal limbo millions of employees and employers whom the law says must go to these boards for the resolution of their employment disputes,\" she said.",

    "summary": "President Trump invoked the wartime Aliens Enemies Act to deport alleged Venezuelan gang members earlier this month.",
    "story": [
      "Washington \u2014 The Trump administration on Friday asked the Supreme Court to lift lower court orders blocking deportations of alleged Venezuelan gang members under the wartime Alien Enemies Act.",
      "The Justice Department made the request for emergency relief just days after a federal appeals court in Washington declined to let the administration resume the deportations of people believed to be members of the Tren de Aragua gang to El Salvador under the wartime authority.",
      "\"This case presents fundamental questions about who decides how to conduct sensitive national-security-related operations in this country \u2014 the President, through Article II, or the Judiciary, through [temporary restraining orders],\" acting Solicitor General Sarah Harris wrote. \"The Constitution supplies a clear answer: the President. The republic cannot afford a different choice.\"",
      "The Supreme Court has asked lawyers for a group of five Venezuelan nationals who challenged the administration's efforts to invoke the Alien Enemies Act to respond to the Justice Department's request by April 1.",
      "The dispute over President Trump's effort to use the Alien Enemies Act to deport Venezuelan migrants believed to be members of the gang Tren de Aragua has played out amid a host of lawsuits challenging many aspects of his second-term agenda. The request for emergency relief from the Supreme Court is now the sixth made by the Justice Department. Three others are still awaiting action by the justices.",
      "As with the others, the latest bid for intervention by the high court attacks the scope of the order issued by the district judge presiding over the case, U.S. District Judge James Boasberg. But the criticisms of Boasberg by the president and his allies escalated the administration's ongoing tension with the courts. Mr. Trump called for the judge to be impeached after he issued an order that blocked the administration earlier this month from using the Alien Enemies Act to summarily deport migrants, prompting a rare rebuke from Chief Justice John Roberts.",
      "\"[T]he district court's orders have rebuffed the president's judgments as to how to protect the nation against foreign terrorist organizations and risk debilitating effects for delicate foreign negotiations,\" Harris wrote in her filing with the Supreme Court. \"More broadly, rule-by-TRO has become so commonplace among district courts that the Executive Branch's basic functions are in peril.\"",
      "The legal battle began earlier this month when the president invoked the Alien Enemies Act of 1798 to order the deportation of Venezuelan migrants suspected of being members of Tren de Aragua prison gang. Mr. Trump claimed in his proclamation that the gang was \"perpetrating, attempting, and threatening an invasion or predatory incursion against the territory of the United States,\" the legal threshold for using the authority, which has only been invoked three times before, and all during times of war.",
      "The president declared that all members of the gang who are in the U.S. unlawfully were \"subject to immediate apprehension, detention and removal.\"",
      "Five Venezuelan nationals who are being held at an immigration detention center in Texas filed a lawsuit in Washington, D.C., on March 15 that sought to stop the administration from removing them under the Alien Enemies Act.",
      "Boasberg agreed to block the removals\u00a0of the five Venezuelans for 14 days. Several hours later, the judge expanded his order to prevent the Trump administration from deporting any migrants believed to be members of Tren de Aragua under the Alien Enemies Act.",
      "The judge had also told the Justice Department in person during a hearing that any planes carrying people subject to Mr. Trump's proclamation that were going to take off or were already in the air needed to return to the U.S. Planes carrying migrants later landed in El Salvador, raising questions\u00a0about whether the government complied with Boasberg's order.",
      "The Justice Department has argued that it was not bound by the oral directive, though the district court has continued to examine whether the government complied with his order.",
      "The Trump administration appealed the court's two-week ban on deportations under the Alien Enemies Act to the U.S. Court of Appeals for the D.C. Circuit, which issued a 2-1 decision\u00a0Wednesday that declined to allow the administration to resume the deportations.",
      "In the filing with the Supreme Court, Harris argued that the Alien Enemies Act gives the president sweeping national-security authority, and she warned that the district court's orders are harming the administration's ability to conduct foreign policy.",
      "\"That order is forcing the United States to harbor individuals whom national-security officials have identified as members of a foreign terrorist organization bent upon grievously harming Americans,\" she argued. \"Those orders \u2014which are likely to extend additional weeks \u2014 now jeopardize sensitive diplomatic negotiations and delicate national-security operations, which were designed to extirpate TdA's presence in our country before it gains a greater foothold.\"",
      "In addition to this case, the Supreme Court is also weighing requests for emergency relief arising from challenges to Mr. Trump's executive order seeking to end birthright citizenship, the mass firings of federal probationary workers\u00a0and the Department of Education's cancellation of teacher preparation grants that purportedly funded diversity, equity and inclusion initiatives.",

      "The president said in the order that there has been a \"concerted and widespread\" effort over the past decade to rewrite American history by replacing \"objective facts\" with a \"distorted narrative driven by ideology rather than truth.\" He said this narrative has cast the \"founding principles\" of the U.S. in a \"negative light.\"",
      "\"The Smithsonian Institution has, in recent years, come under the influence of a divisive, race-centered ideology,\" Mr. Trump said in the order. \"This shift has promoted narratives that portray American and Western values as inherently harmful and oppressive.\" He pointed to a sculpture exhibit at the Smithsonian American Art Museum representing that \"[s]ocieties including the United States have used race to establish and maintain systems of power, privilege, and disenfranchisement.\"",
      "The order tasks Vice President JD Vance, who serves on the Smithsonian Institution's Board of Regents, with overseeing efforts to \"remove improper ideology\" from all areas of the institution, including its museums, education and research centers and the National Zoo.",
      "It marks Mr. Trump's latest salvo against cultural pillars of society, such as universities and art, that he sees as out of step with conservative sensibilities. He recently had himself installed as chairman of the John F. Kennedy Center for the Performing Arts with the aim of overhauling programming, including the annual Kennedy Center Honors awards show. The administration also recently forced Columbia University to make a series of policy changes by threatening the Ivy League school with the loss of several hundred million dollars in federal funding.",
      "The executive order also hints at the return of statues and monuments of Confederate figures, many of which were taken down or replaced around the country after the police killing of George Floyd in Minneapolis in 2020 and the rise of the Black Lives Matter movement, which is detested by Trump and other conservatives.",
      "The president directed the secretary of the interior to determine whether, since Jan. 1, 2020, \"public monuments, memorials, statues, markers, or similar properties within the Department of the Interior's jurisdiction have been removed or changed to perpetuate a false reconstruction of American history, inappropriately minimize the value of certain historical events or figures, or include any other improper partisan ideology.\"",
      "The order also calls for improvements to Independence Hall in Philadelphia by July 4, 2026, in time for the 250th anniversary of the signing of the Declaration of Independence.",
      "Mr. Trump singled out the National Museum of African American History and Culture, which opened in 2016 near the White House, the Women's History Museum, which is in development, and the American Art Museum for criticism.",
      "\"Museums in our Nation's capital should be places where individuals go to learn \u2014 not to be subjected to ideological indoctrination or divisive narratives that distort our shared history,\" he said in the order.",
      "Linda St. Thomas, the Smithsonian Institution's chief spokesperson, said in an email late Thursday, \"We have no comment for now.\"",
      "Under the order, Vance is to work with the White House budget office to make sure future funding for the Smithsonian Institution isn't spent on programs that \"degrade shared American values, divide Americans based on race, or promote programs or ideologies inconsistent with federal law and policy.\" The president also wants to ensure that the women's history museum celebrates women and not \"recognize men as women in any respect.\"",
      "The Smithsonian Institution is the world's largest museum, education and research complex. It consists of 21 museums and the National Zoo. Eleven museums are located along the National Mall in Washington.",

To estimate the impacts, the authors examined 26 countries that used foreign aid for HIV resources, including Albania, Cambodia, Colombia, C\u00f4te d'Ivoire, South Africa and Sri Lanka.",
      "They noted that international funding has been crucial in reducing HIV transmissions and deaths, and that five countries \u2014 the U.S., U.K., France, Germany and the Netherlands \u2014 provide over 90% of international HIV funding, with the U.S. being by far the largest contributor. The U.S. committed $5.71 billion in 2023, or about 73% of total donor government funding, according to analysis by KFF, a nonpartisan health policy organization.",
      "But as of February, they authors report, donor nations have announced reductions in aid of between 8% and 70% between 2025 and 2026. The Trump administration froze foreign aid\u00a0spending, including funding for HIV/AIDS programs, soon after taking office, and the Department of Government Efficiency, or DOGE, is spearheading major cutbacks.",
      "\"The United States has historically been the largest contributor to global efforts to treat and prevent HIV, but the current cuts to PEPFAR and USAID-supported programs have already disrupted access to essential HIV services including for antiretroviral therapy and HIV prevention and testing,\" co-lead study author Debra ten Brink of the Burnet Institute in Australia said in a news release.",
      "The study's authors said ongoing disruptions could undo decades of progress to end HIV/AIDS as a public health threat.",
      "\"Looking ahead, if other donor countries reduce funding, decades of progress to treat and prevent HIV could be unravelled. It is imperative to secure sustainable financing and avoid a resurgence of the HIV epidemic, which could have devastating consequences, not just in regions such as sub-Saharan Africa, but globally,\" said ten Brink.",
      "PEPFAR, or the President's Emergency Plan for AIDS Relief, was launched under then-President George W. Bush in 2003 and has invested over $100 billion in the global HIV/AIDS response over the years. According to the State Department, the program has saved the lives of\u00a026 million people since it began\u00a0\u2014 but its funding stopped after Secretary of State Marco Rubio ordered a\u00a0pause on foreign aid\u00a0earlier this year.",
      "\"PEPFAR is the largest commitment by any nation to address a single disease in history, enabled by strong bipartisan support across ten U.S. congresses and four presidential administrations, and through the American people's generosity,\" the government website HIV.gov reads. \"PEPFAR shows the power of what is possible through compassionate, cost-effective, accountable, and transparent American foreign assistance.\"",
      "Others have already warned about the devastation these cuts could bring to those who rely on it. Earlier this week, the UNAIDS chief warned that without funding, millions will die and the global AIDS pandemic will resurge.",
      "\"It is reasonable for the United States to want to reduce its funding over time, but the sudden withdrawal of lifesaving support is having a devastating impact,\" UNAIDS executive director Winnie Byanyima told reporters in Geneva. \"We urge for a reconsideration and an urgent restoration of services \u2014 lifesaving services.\"",
      "Dr. C\u00e9line Gounder, CBS News medical contributor and editor-at-large for public health at KFF Health News, said the U.S. contributions play a key role that could not be easily replaced.",

Some of them between 50 and 70% of their budgets for HIV diagnosis, treatment and prevention is coming from the United States,\" she said on \"CBS Mornings Plus.\" \"There's not really any other country that can easily step in. And big picture, this is sort of like telling a surgeon in the middle of surgery to walk away. It's just not that easy to jump in and take over.\"",

    "summary": "President Trump's use of the Alien Enemies Act of 1798\u200b to deport alleged Venezuelan gang members kicked off a legal battle.\u200b",
    "story": [
      "President Trump's invocation of the Alien Enemies Act of 1798 to deport Venezuelan migrants suspected of being members of the Tren de Aragua gang quickly kicked off a legal battle.",
      "A federal judge on March 15 issued a temporary restraining order that blocked the use of the 18th-century law. That order was upheld\u00a0by a federal appeals court on March 26. Two days later, the Trump administration asked the Supreme Court to lift the lower court orders.",
      "However, on the same day as the March 15 order, three flights carrying more than 200 Venezuelan men were flown to El Salvador to be held in the nation's maximum security prison.",
      "White House officials told CBS News last week that 137 of those Venezuelans were expelled under the Alien Enemies Act. Another 101 were removed under what officials described as \"regular\" proceedings under the 1952 Immigration and Nationality Act, including people who allegedly signed deportation papers after crossing the border illegally, officials said.",
      "Here's what to know about the Alien Enemies Act and how it has been used.",
      "What is the Alien Enemies Act of 1798?",
      "The Alien Enemies Act is one of the laws enacted as part of the Alien and Sedition Acts in 1798 under President John Adams and the Federalist-controlled Congress. At the time, the U.S. was anticipating a war with France.",
      "The law states that when the U.S. is at war or facing an \"invasion or predatory incursion\" by another nation, the president can detain and deport citizens of the enemy nation without due process.",
      "Two other laws in the Alien and Sedition Acts increased the number of years an immigrant needed to be in the U.S. to become a citizen and allowed the president to deport non-citizens deemed to be \"dangerous to the peace and safety of the United States,\" according to the National Archives. The fourth law, the Sedition Act, restricted speech that was considered critical of the government and was used to prosecute journalists and others.",
      "Opposition to the Alien and Sedition Acts contributed to the defeat of the Federalists in the election of 1800, which was won by Thomas Jefferson, the Democratic-Republican candidate.",
      "Jefferson allowed three of the four laws to expire, according to historians. But, there was no expiration written into the Alien Enemies Act, so it remained.",
      "The\u00a0Neighbors Not Enemies Act\u00a0is a proposed law that would repeal the Alien Enemies Act. It was reintroduced in January by Rep. Ilhan Omar of Minnesota and Sen. Mazie Hirono of Hawaii, both Democrats.",
      "How is Trump using the Alien Enemies Act?",
      "In a proclamation\u00a0invoking the Alien Enemies Act on March 15, Mr. Trump declared that Tren de Aragua, a Venezuelan gang, \"is perpetrating, attempting, and threatening an invasion or predatory incursion against the territory of the United States\" and that all Venezuelan citizens over 14 years old who are members of Tren de Aragua and are not U.S. citizens or lawful permanent residents are \"liable to be apprehended, restrained, secured, and removed as Alien Enemies.\"",
      "Chief D.C. District Judge James Boasberg, whose order has temporarily blocked Mr. Trump from removing immigrants under the law, questioned the legality of its use in this case.",
      "\"Despite the President's determination otherwise, Tren de Aragua is not a 'foreign nation or government,' and its actions, however heinous, do not amount to an 'invasion' or a 'predatory incursion,'\" he wrote.",
      "In a March 19 briefing, White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt said that \"when you read the act ... a predatory incursion is absolutely what has happened with Tren de Aragua. They have been sent here by the hostile Maduro regime in Venezuela. And the president, immediately upon taking office, designated TdA as a foreign terrorist organization.\"",
      "When else has the Alien Enemies Act been used?",
      "The law has been invoked three other times in U.S. history: during the War of 1812, World War I and World War II.",
      "In 1812, the Madison administration required British nationals in the U.S. to report information to the government, including their age, addresses, the length of time they'd been in the U.S. and their occupations, according to a document signed by then-Secretary of State James Monroe.",
      "President Woodrow Wilson used the act in 1917 to limit the activities and speech of citizens of Germany and its allies in World War I. The use of the act led to the internment of more than 6,000 German nationals and \"other enemy aliens,\" the National Archives says.",
      "Then, after the Japanese bombed Pearl Harbor in 1941, President Franklin D. Roosevelt invoked the Alien Enemies Act to detain citizens of Japan and the other Axis powers, Germany and Italy. But, Roosevelt also issued an executive order that allowed for the internment of Japanese Americans. More than 100,000 people of Japanese descent were sent to internment camps, which the federal government\u00a0formally apologized for\u00a0in 1988.",
      "In 1948, the Supreme Court ruled in Ludecke v. Watkins, a case involving a German national who was ordered to be removed in 1946 under the Alien Enemies Act, despite the end of fighting in World War II. In a 5-4 decision, the high court dismissed the German national's challenge, arguing \"a state of war\" remained and it was a matter of \"political judgment\" to determine if an individual could be removed under the Alien Enemies Act, which precludes judicial review.",
      "\"It is not for us to question a belief by the President that enemy aliens who were justifiably deemed fit subjects for internment during active hostilities do not lose their potency for mischief during the period of confusion and conflict which is characteristic of a state of war even when the guns are silent but the peace of Peace has not come,\" Justice Felix Frankfurter wrote in the opinion.",
      "In a dissent, Justice Hugo Black argued it is \"nothing but a fiction\" to say the U.S. was currently at war with Germany, and that \"the 1798 Act did not grant its extraordinary and dangerous powers to be used during the period of fictional wars.\"",

    "summary": "Health and Human Services Secretary Robert F. Kennedy will cut 3,500 jobs from the Food and Drug Administration and 2,400 from Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.",
    "story": [
      "The Trump administration plans to shrink the workforce of the Department of Health and Human Services by nearly a quarter, officials\u00a0announced Thursday, as part of a major restructuring of the department.",
      "Managers in several health agencies are now racing to figure out details on how the reorganization will impact their work.",
      "Trump officials in multiple parts of the department have said they are aiming to implement much of the changes quickly, often within 10 days.",
      "The changes amount to a workforce that will be around 33% smaller than it was at the end of the Biden administration. There were around 92,620 employees at the department in September 2024, according to federal\u00a0records, up from 81,917 at the end of the Trump administration.",
      "Some 10,000 full-time employees will be cut through the layoffs, in addition to other vacant positions that will not be replaced. Thousands of full-time staff have already left the department in recent months, in addition to thousands more contractor and fellowship positions that were also eliminated.",
      "\"When combined with HHS' other efforts, including early retirement and Fork in the Road, the restructuring results in a total downsizing from 82,000 to 62,000 full-time employees,\" the department said in a release, estimating that taxpayers would save $1.8 billion from the changes.",
      "A fact sheet shared with reporters and health officials says that \"no additional cuts are currently planned\" beyond those announced Thursday and in recent weeks.",
      "Health and Human Services Secretary Robert F. Kennedy will cut 3,500 jobs from the Food and Drug Administration, according to the fact sheet. \"This reduction will not affect drug, medical device, or food reviewers, nor will it impact inspectors,\" the fact sheet says of the FDA changes.",
      "At the CDC, the department says the workforce will decline by around 2,400 employees, to \"focus on returning to its core mission of preparing for and respond to epidemics and outbreaks.\" One U.S. official said the cuts are not intended to undermine infectious disease work at the agency.",
      "The administration is also cutting 1,200 jobs from the National Institutes of Health.",
      "From the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services, the workforce will decline by \"approximately 300 employees, with a focus on reducing minor duplication\" at CMS, which had already been facing hiring limits due to a budget crunch in recent years. The reorganization will not impact Medicare or Medicaid services, it says.",
      "The department's reduction-in-force \"is primarily aimed at administrative positions,\" according to a letter sent Thursday to unions in mutliple HHS agencies, but \"will also target roles in high-cost regions\" and who are \"determined to be redundant or duplicative\" with others.",
      "\"Specific notices to employees may be sent as early as Friday, March 28,\" according to the letter, a copy of which was obtained by CBS News.",
      "\"This will be a painful period for HHS\"",
      "On \"CBS Mornings\" on Friday, Dr. C\u00e9line Gounder, CBS News medical contributor and editor-at-large for public health at KFF Health News, said these cuts' impact on Americans' health remains to be seen but called the move \"very concerning.\"",
      "\"We're talking about agencies that touch so many parts of Americans' lives,\" she said. \"Will we see more food-borne disease outbreaks? Will we see delays in drug approvals or measures to improve our food supply? Which is, by the way, one of the agenda items for the new HHS secretary. Will we see a slowing in biomedical research?\"",
      "Gounder added China and European countries are already trying to recruit American scientists \u2014 \"Because scientists here are concerned about their job opportunities,\" she said.",
      "\"(These cuts are) very concerning, both in terms of the immediate impacts on health care, public health, and the longer term impacts on whether we will maintain our leadership in the health space,\" Gounder added.",
      "\"The entire federal workforce is downsizing now. So this will be a painful period for HHS,\" Kennedy said in a\u00a0video\u00a0announcement shared Thursday by the department.",
      "The Wall Street Journal\u00a0first reported details of the reorganization.",
      "Health officials had been bracing for steep cuts to be announced this week, as part of the sweeping restructuring architected with the White House's Department of Government Efficiency cost-cutting task force.",
      "Several health agency officials said they had seen stepped-up security measures coming into work Thursday morning. Managers have largely been in the dark about the changes, officials have said, aside from a handful of changes already announced within the department.",
      "One major change announced earlier this month would result in significantly cutting the number of general counsel offices, shrinking the ranks of the department's attorneys. One health official said the closures would amount to eliminating two-thirds of the HHS regional attorneys.",
      "Kennedy said earlier this week at the White House that the DOGE team headed by billionaire Elon Musk had \"identified extraordinary waste in my department and HHS.\" He cited what they considered duplicated work for communications, procurement, IT and HR departments across 40 operating divisions in HHS.",
      "\"We are with Elon's help eliminating the redundancies,\" Kennedy said Monday.",
      "Creating a new Administration for a Healthy America, and other changes",
      "One of Kennedy's biggest proposed changes is to create a new grouping of agencies called the Administration for a Healthy America, or AHA, which he says will save money and \"radically improve our quality of service.\"",
      "\"We're going to imbue the agency with a clear sense of mission to radically improve the health of Americans and to improve agency morale. We're going to eliminate an entire alphabet soup of departments and agencies while preserving their core functions,\" Kennedy said in the Thursday video.",
      "The new administration will consolidate work from the Office of the Assistant Secretary for Health, Health Resources and Services Administration, Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration, Agency for Toxc Substances and Disease Registry and National Institute for Occupational Safety and Healthy \"into a new, unified entity,\" the department said.",
      "This new AHA agency also effectively combines many of Kennedy's \"Make America Healthy Again\" priorities under one roof, ranging from this year's update to federal dietary guidelines to public health statements about the use of fluoride. The work will be supported by the U.S. surgeon general, the fact sheet says.",
      "Officials within the Health Resources and Services Administration are expecting deep cuts from the merger, including to the agency's human resources and Provider Relief Bureau staff, two officials said.",
      "HRSA's Provider Relief Bureau had been charged with oversight of aid dollars during the COVID-19 pandemic in the health care industry. More than $1 billion in debts to the federal government could go unrecouped if the team's work is left unfinished, one official said.",
      "\"Our budget was already covered with the original funding and would have been recouped five times over, had we been allowed to do our job,\" the official said.",
      "The Administration for Strategic Preparedness and Response, which was elevated into a separate agency under the Biden administration to oversee tasks like the pandemic stockpile, will be absorbed into the CDC.",
      "The two agencies are now scrambling to draw up plans by Saturday on how to merge the two, one health official said.",
      "Work from the Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality, which had been bracing for as much as 90% of their staff to be cut by DOGE, will be merged with another agency to create the Office of Strategy.",
      "And the functions from the Administration for Community Living targeted at older adults and people with disabilities will be moved to other agencies, the department said, including the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services.",
      "Details of who exactly will be cut from the department within the agencies remain unclear, under the new reorganization plans. As of Thursday morning, multiple federal health officials said they had received little guidance from the department, aside from Kennedy's announcement.",
      "In his remarks in the video, Kennedy said that they were \"focused on paring away excess administrators while increasing the number of scientists and frontline health providers\" in the changes.",
      "\"We're going to streamline our agency and eliminate redundancies and invite everyone to align behind a simple, bold mission: I want every HHS employee to wake up every morning asking themselves, 'What can I do to restore American health today,'\" he added.",

At least one account remained public for a day after the Atlantic report.",

On Wednesday, his account settings were changed to make his contacts private.",
      "Waltz's contacts on Venmo included journalists, government officials, active and retired service members and members of congress. There was no evidence Waltz had sent or received payments on the platform.",
      "Susie Wiles, President Trump's chief of staff, was listed on Waltz's Venmo friends list, but her account is now no longer searchable. On Wednesday, Wired magazine reported on Waltz' and Wiles' Venmo accounts and said their respective accounts were made private after the publication contacted the White House.",
      "\"Venmo is a commonly used app, and Mike Waltz has made necessary updates for his personal privacy protection,\" said NSC spokesman James Hewitt, after being contacted by CBS News Wednesday.",
      "Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth, who has faced a barrage of criticism this week for sharing details on the Signal chat about the March 15 U.S. strike on Iranian-backed Houthis, had an account in early March, but it has since been deactivated, CBS News has learned.",
      "In February, reporters with The American Prospect, a progressive political and public policy magazine, found that Hegseth's Venmo was previously left open for the public to view contacts he had in his cellphone who also had Venmo accounts. Among the contacts were defense contractors, UnitedHealth executives, fellow veterans and colleagues at Fox News.",

      "Der Spiegel reported Wednesday that private contact details for Waltz, Gabbard and Hegseth had been leaked online.

      "On Wednesday, Gabbard and CIA Director John Ratcliffe defended their participation in the group chat in testimony before the House Intelligence Committee at a hearing focused on the global security threats facing the United States.",
      "Gabbard acknowledged the conversation was \"sensitive\" but denied that classified information was shared in the chat. \"There were no sources, methods, locations or war plans that were shared,\" she told lawmakers. On Tuesday, Gabbard and Ratcliffe both said they were not aware of any information that was shared in the chat regarding weapons packages, targets or timing. The Atlantic on Wednesday released more of the texts on those topics after officials on the chat stated repeatedly that nothing disclosed in the Signal group was classified.",
      "The messages showed Hegseth provided detailed information to the group of senior Trump officials about the strikes targeting Houthi rebels earlier this month, including a timeline of when fighter jets would take off and what kind of weapons would be used.",
      "Multiple U.S. intelligence officials and members of the U.S. military who have spoken to CBS News this week have all contended that this type of information is always classified, but even if the information was somehow unclassified, it would still be a violation of cybersecurity and operational security protocols.",

      "But President Trump continues to privately vent his irritation about it and is closely monitoring the news to see if the fallout is quieting down, according to sources familiar with the matter. The issue is \"still a hot potato,\" one official told CBS News.",
      "Sources said Mr. Trump has been more irritated that Waltz had the phone number for the editor-in-chief of The Atlantic, Jeffrey Goldberg, than he was about the use of the Signal app by top national security officials to discuss coming plans for a military strike on Houthi targets in Yemen. The magazine published its account on Monday.",
      "After Waltz admitted behind closed doors the authenticity of the reporting, White House officials debated whether he should resign, multiple sources said. But in the end, Waltz never made the offer, and Mr. Trump has not asked him to step down, several sources said. Publicly, Mr. Trump signaled his support for Waltz by calling him \"a good man\" who \"learned a lesson.\"",
      "The Signal situation, which Waltz called \"a mistake,\" hasn't been the only snafu for the president's team this week. Mr. Trump on Wednesday evening was unaware that four U.S. military members had gone missing the day before in Lithuania until a reporter asked him about it during an on-camera event in the Oval Office.",
      "The Army soldiers went missing early Tuesday during a military exercise. The Pentagon had publicly released information about the overseas incident at midday Wednesday, but staff hadn't yet told the president.",
      "Asked if he had been briefed, Mr. Trump told the reporter: \"No, I haven't,\" before moving on to the next press question. Mr. Trump typically chooses to not receive daily classified intelligence briefings, unlike past presidents. The search for the soldiers was continuing Thursday.",
      "On Thursday, the White House still hadn't ruled out ousting someone over the Signal incident, sources said. White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt said Wednesday, the president \"continues to have confidence in his national security team.\"",
      "But Mr. Trump is still unhappy with Waltz, as are some other top White House and Cabinet officials, according to multiple people familiar with their thinking.",
      "Senate Armed Services Committee Chairman Roger Wicker, a Republican, sent a letter Thursday asking the acting inspector general for the Defense Department to conduct an inquiry into the incident and brief senators.",

Deputy national security adviser Alex Wong, who has been taking fire from staunch Trump supporters and the conservative media over the incident, wasn't involved in setting up the chat, although he was a participant in the conversation, sources said.",

    "story": [
      "Washington \u2014 The Signal group chat that conveyed details of the timing and weapons descriptions of a planned attack against the Houthis in Yemen included the names or initials of 18 Trump officials and, of course, Atlantic editor-in-chief Jeffrey Goldberg, who published his account of the messages.",
      "A spokesperson for the National Security Council has confirmed that the message thread \"appears to be authentic,\" and none of the reported participants has denied their appearance in the \"Houthi PC small group\" chat. The top Republican and Democrat on the Senate Armed Services committee have asked the Defense Department's Office of Inspector General to investigate the incident.",
      "So who are the officials whose contacts appear in the Signal chat, and what do they do?",
      "National security adviser Mike Waltz",
      "Goldberg said that on Tuesday, March 11, he received a connection request on Signal, from a user identified as Michael Waltz. That turned out to be national security adviser Michael Waltz, a top adviser to the president.",
      "\"Two days later\u2014Thursday\u2014at 4:28 p.m., I received a notice that I was to be included in a Signal chat group,\" Goldberg wrote. \"It was called the 'Houthi PC small group.'\"",
      "Waltz launched the group's conversation, saying, according to The Atlantic: \"Team \u2013 establishing a principles [sic] group for coordination on Houthis, particularly for over the next 72 hours.\"",
      "As national security adviser, Waltz is a presidential appointee and does not need to be confirmed by the Senate.",
      "President Trump told NBC he still has confidence in Waltz, saying, \"Michael Waltz has learned a lesson, and he's a good man.\"",
      "Waltz said\u00a0he took \"full responsibility\" and that he \"built\" the Signal chat group, but he also said he did not have Goldberg's contact information and he didn't know how Goldberg got into the chat. Goldberg said he received a Signal request from a user identified as \"Michael Waltz.\" And soon after, a screenshot Goldberg provided said, \"Michael Waltz added you to the group.\"",
      "Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth",
      "Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth is the official who sent out the times and types of weapons that would be used in the attack ahead of time, according to screenshots of the conversation published by The Atlantic. Neither the White House nor Hegseth has disputed the authenticity of Hegseth's communication, but they have insisted it doesn't constitute \"war plans.\"",
      "As the secretary of defense, Hegseth is the chief defense policy adviser to the president, as well as the second person in the chain of command to Mr. Trump.",
      "Speaking at the White House on Wednesday, March, 26, President Trump said Hegseth \"did nothing wrong\" and suggested that Hegseth himself could lead a review into whether any of the information should have been classified. \"Sure, I'll ask him to do that,\" Mr. Trump said. \"There are a lot of ways to answer that question. But I'd certainly ask him to take a look at it.\"",
      "Vice President JD Vance",
      "Vice President JD Vance also makes an appearance in the group chat, offering his concerns about the operation, such as risking a spike in oil prices. In the chat, Vance's account said he was \"willing to support the consensus of the team and keep these concerns to myself,\" while saying \"there is a strong argument for delaying this a month.\"",
      "Since The Atlantic articles published, Vance said Goldberg \"oversold what he had.\"",
      "As vice president, Vance is not only second in line to the presidency, but a key adviser on virtually all matters of domestic and foreign policy to the president.",
      "CIA Director John Ratcliffe",
      "CIA Director John Ratcliffe's name appears in the chat as well, and he confirmed it was him in testimony before the Senate this week. The Ratcliffe comments in the chat included saying that from a CIA perspective, \"we are mobilizing assets to support now but a delay would not negatively impact us and additional time would be used to identify better starting points for coverage on Houthi leadership.\"",
      "In his congressional testimony, Ratcliffe said his \"communications, to be clear, in the Signal message group were entirely permissible and lawful and did not include classified information.\"",
      "\"TG\" \u2014 Director of National Intelligence Tulsi Gabbard",
      "A user called \"TG\" in the Signal chat appears to be Director of National Intelligence Tulsi Gabbard, The Atlantic reported. In congressional testimony this week, Gabbard did not deny that she was in the message chain, but she said she was \"not directly involved\" in the part of the chat that discussed attack plans.",
      "As the director of national intelligence, Gabbard is a Cabinet-level head of the U.S. intelligence community.",
      "Gabbard testified Wednesday before the House Intelligence Committee, where she said Signal came pre-installed on government devices.",
      "Special envoy Steve Witkoff",
      "The name Steve Witkoff, U.S. special envoy to the Middle East and Ukraine, also appears in the chat.",
      "Witkoff was in Russia for a meeting with President Vladimir Putin during part of the period leading up to the attack.",
      "Sources told CBS News on Wednesday that no device the senior envoy brought with him to Russia had Signal on it. White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt told reporters Wednesday that Witkoff didn't have his personal device or government phone with him in Moscow, and that he was given access to a \"classified protected server\" by the U.S. government and was \"very careful\" about his communications while in Russia.",
      "In his own social media post Wednesday, Witkoff said he had \"no access to my personal devices until I returned from my trip.\"",
      "Witkoff had little communication in the chat.",
      "Scott B.",
      "Scott B. appears to be Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent, according to The Atlantic. The Scott B. account designated someone from the Treasury Department to be his point of contact for matters related to the strike. The Treasury Department oversees things like sanctions.",
      "White House chief of staff Susie Wiles",
      "The name of White House chief of staff Susie Wiles is a contact in the Signal group, although the screenshots The Atlantic published don't include contributions from Wiles' name.",
      "As the White House chief of staff, Wiles is responsible for managing the president's senior staff as well as overseeing the execution of his agenda.",
      "\"MAR\" \u2014 Secretary of State Marco Rubio",
      "The name \"MAR\" appears twice in the contacts list. The Atlantic points out the secretary of state's full name is Marco Antonio Rubio, and \"MAR\" chimed in on behalf of the State Department.",
      "On Wednesday, Rubio confirmed his presence in the chat, saying he only contributed twice.",
      "\"I can speak to myself for my presence on it \u2014 I think my role on it was just speaking for my role,\" Rubio said. \"I contributed to it twice. I identified my point of contact, which is my chief of staff. And then later on, I think three hours after the White House's official announcements have been made, I congratulated the members of the team.\"",
      "In the chain, \"MAR\" designates Mike Needham, Rubio's counselor and chief of staff, to be the State Department's point of contact. Needham's account does not converse in the chat.",
      "Deputy national security adviser Alex Wong",
      "Alex Wong is Waltz' deputy. In his initial messages, Waltz said Wong was \"pulling together a tiger team at deputies/agency chief of staff level following up from the meeting in the Sit Room this morning.\"",
      "Joe Kent",
      "Mr. Trump tapped former Green Beret Joe Kent to lead the National Counterterrorism Center, and Kent's name appears in the Signal chat. In the chat, Gabbard designated Kent to be the point of contact for her Office of the Director of National Intelligence.",

    "link": "https://www.cbsnews.com/news/epa-trump-presidential-exemption-clean-air/",
    "published": "Thu, 27 Mar 2025 22:58:00 -0400",
    "summary": "The EPA announced that it would speed up the process by which industry can bypass provisions of the Clean Air Act by emailing President Trump.",
    "story": [
      "In its latest move to dismantle environmental regulation under the Trump Administration, the Environmental Protection Agency announced Monday that it would speed up the process by which industry can bypass provisions of the Clean Air Act and other rules designed to limit air pollution with a simple offer: email us for a presidential exemption.",
      "Businesses that would like to avoid complying with certain EPA rules can email the agency with a reason justifying why it should be allowed an exemption and how it is in the best interest of the national security of the United States. According to the EPA website, all emails do not entitle the submitter to an exemption, but the president \"will make a decision\" based on the merits of the request.",
      "The EPA said in a statement to CBS News that section 112(i)(4) of the Clean Air Act \"specifically states that the President may exempt any stationary source 'if the President determines that the technology to implement such standard is not available and that it is in the national security interests of the United States to do so.'\"",
      "But many in the environmental sector were stunned by the proposal.",
      "\"This section of the Clean Air Act is designed to protect people from exposure to the most toxic chemicals \u2014 the ones that are dangerous in the smallest concentrations,\" environmental law expert Michael Gerrard said in an email. \"It's shocking that EPA is now providing industries with a simple form they can use to get out of these rules and keep on emitting these harmful substances.\"",
      "For years, heavy industry has abided by rules and regulations set by the EPA to comply with the Clean Air Act, which has often led companies to invest heavily in expensive technology to reduce toxic air emissions, an expense critics have often derided as onerous.",
      "So, on March 12, EPA Administrator Lee Zeldin announced the \"greatest day of deregulation\" and said the agency was reviewing 31 rules that, he claims, amount to \"trillions of dollars in regulatory costs and hidden taxes.\" The mission of the rollback is to reduce costly regulations that burden the industry. By reviewing the rules, Zeldin said in an op-ed in the Wall Street Journal that \"As we unleash American energy, revitalize domestic manufacturing, cut costs for families, and restore the rule of law, we do so with the firm belief that America's greatest days lie ahead.\"",
      "The rollbacks were cheered by Republican leaders and industry alike, \"The action taken by the Trump EPA today is exactly what needs to be done to secure American energy dominance and restore the communities who have been negatively impacted by regulations and overreach from the Biden administration,\" Sen. Shelley Moore Capito, a Republican from West Virginia, said in a statement. Capito is also the chair of the Senate Environment and Public Works Committee, which oversees the EPA.",
      "It could take years for the agency to finalize new rules to reduce the costs of environmental compliance, let alone the legal challenges it will face. In an attempt to fast-track this process, the EPA is offering this unique \"hall pass,\" as some describe the presidential exemption, to enable companies to stop complying now, rather than years later when the updated rules are complete.",
      "\"Under Administrator Zeldin, the EPA is now the Environmental Polluter Agency. His invitation for companies to put arsenic and mercury into the air if they claim it enhances 'national security' is a vast abuse of the President's given authority,\" Sen. Jeff Merkley, a Democrat from Oregon, said in a statement to CBS News. Merkley also sits on the Senate Committee on the Environment and Public Works and its first priority is to review legislation on air pollution.",
      "Merkley's fellow committee member, Sen. Sheldon Whitehouse, a Democrat from Rhode Island, had similar concerns, \"Trump and his puppets at EPA are giving the most toxic polluters carte blanche to poison our air,\" he said in an email to CBS News. \" As corrupt as this is, no one can have any confidence that either the technology or national security standards will be met.\"",
      "Rep. Zoe Lofgren, a Democrat from California and the ranking member of the House Science Committee, said in a statement, \"The idea that some obscure, rarely-used provision of the Clean Air Act empowers EPA to grant sweeping exemptions to polluting companies because they send an email is preposterous. It's clearly illegal \u2014 no doubt there.\"",
      "Environmental law experts believe the policy will be challenged in court. \"I've never seen anything like this before,\" said Mary Nichols, a distinguished counsel for the Emmett Institute on Climate Change and the Environment at UCLA Law School. Nichols says because the statute is so broad, it is subject to abuse. \"I think the likely first lawsuit is a blanket challenge to the entire procedure,\" she said.",
      "CBS News asked the EPA if it could explain how all the emails will be processed and assessed, whether each one will be individually considered by President Trump, and how many emails the agency has already received, but the EPA did not address those questions.",
      "But sending the email request to the EPA does create a paper trail that companies may want to consider. \"This is something that we will fight to make public,\" said Joe Bonfiglio, executive director of the U.S. region of the Environmental Defense Fund, a prominent environmental nonprofit. \"For companies who take advantage of this hall pass, there are organizations like ours who will make sure communities around those facilities know about the requests.\"",
      "Companies have until March 31 to email the EPA with the required information for the president to consider.",

    "summary": "The comments come amid two more high-profile detentions by ICE of a Tufts University student and a University of Alabama student.",
    "story": [
      "Secretary of State Marco Rubio said Thursday that 300 student visas have been revoked, asserting \"we have a right\" to rescind the visas of students who participate in campus protests, despite questions about due process and First Amendment objections.",
      "\"If you apply for a visa to enter the United States and be a student, and you tell us that the reason why you're coming to the United States is not just because you want to write op-eds, but because you want to participate in movements that are involved in doing things like vandalizing universities, harassing students, taking over buildings, creating a ruckus, we're not going to give you a visa,\" Rubio said. \"If you lie to us and get a visa then enter the United States, and with that visa, participate in that sort of activity, we're going to take away your visa.\"",
      "Rubio continued that if a student then lost his or her visa, \"you're no longer legally in the United States. And we have a right, like every country in the world has a right, to remove you from our country.\"",
      "Rubio said that at least 300 students had their visas revoked. \"We do it every day. Every time I find one of these lunatics, I take away their visa,\" he said.",
      "It's unclear if these students were notified of the revocations in advance.",
      "Rubio's remarks came in response to a question about\u00a0Tufts University graduate student Rumeysa Ozturk, a Turkish national who was taken into custody by Immigration and Customs Enforcement in Massachusetts on Tuesday.",
      "A Department of Homeland Security spokesperson said Ozturk had \"engaged in activities in support of Hamas,\" but did not provide details about her alleged activities. Ozturk was one of four university students who was listed as the author of a March 2024 campus newspaper opinion piece urging Tufts to adopt resolutions from the student government to \"acknowledge the Palestinian genocide\" and \"divest from companies with direct or indirect ties to Israel.\" That article does not mention Hamas.",
      "Ozturk is currently being held at a federal detention facility in Louisiana.",
      "The university said in a statement that she had been returning from a Ramadan iftar dinner when she was detained.\u00a0Surveillance video\u00a0showed she was taken into custody by six ICE agents who appear wearing masks and plain clothes and driving unmarked cars.",
      "A\u00a0University of Alabama doctoral student\u00a0originally from Iran was also taken into custody on Tuesday, according to the university. A search of an ICE database showed the student, Alireza Doroudi, was in custody. It was unclear as of Thursday why he was being detained or where he was being held.",
      "Both Ozturk and Doroudi were in the U.S. on F-1 visas, which allow international students to enter the country to study full-time at American universities.",
      "Labor unions representing university professors on Wednesday filed a lawsuit claiming the detentions of noncitizen students and faculty is a violation of the First Amendment, as is the threat to remove Columbia University's $400 million in federal funds if the university did not make changes.",
      "The lawsuit cites President Trump's March 4 post on social media that those participating in \"illegal protests\" would be arrested, saying that \"under First Amendment doctrine, the category 'illegal protests' is carefully circumscribed.\"",
      "\"Nevertheless, the post did not say how federal officials would identify 'illegal protests' or 'agitators' for purposes of implementing the President's stated policy, nor did it otherwise provide guidance to faculty, students, or administrators seeking to exercise (or allow others to exercise) First Amendment rights while avoiding the risk of imprisonment, deportation, expulsion, arrest, or loss of \"[a]ll\" federal funding,\" the lawsuit claims.",
      "The high-profile detentions of Ozturk and Doroudi  followed the detention earlier this month of Mahmoud Khalil, a former Columbia University grad student who had been active in the 2024 campus pro-Palestinian protests. Khalil is a Palestinian born in Syria with a green card, or legal permanent residency, not a student visa. Khalil's attorney, Amy Greer, said at the time of his detention that an ICE agent said\u00a0they were acting on a State Department order to revoke his student visa, but when they were informed that Khalil was in the U.S. as a permanent resident with a green card, the agent said they were revoking that, too.",
      "After he was taken into custody, the government said it was invoking a rarely used section of U.S. immigration law to justify Khalil's detention and eventual deportation that allows the secretary of state to make noncitizens subject to deportation if he determines their presence and activities threaten the foreign policy interests of the U.S., citing alleged support for Hamas, a U.S.-designated terror group. CBS News has not found evidence that Khalil has said he supports Hamas.",
      "In a court filing earlier this week, the government also alleged that\u00a0Khalil failed to disclose on his immigration forms\u00a0his involvement with UNRWA, the United Nations agency for Palestine refugees; the Syria office of the British embassy in Beirut; and a group known as Columbia University Apartheid Divest.",
      "The government also said in the filing that claims by Khalil's attorneys that his detention violated the First Amendment were a \"red herring.\"",
      "Khalil is currently in custody in a federal detention facility in Louisiana.",
      "Rubio said after Khalil was taken into custody that the administration would be revoking the visas and green cards \"of Hamas supporters in America so they can be deported.\"",
      "When asked on \"Face the Nation with Margaret Brennan\" if Rubio could provide evidence to support a link to terrorism, or whether Khalil was simply espousing a controversial political point of view, Rubio cited news footage, saying \"these guys take over entire buildings, they vandalize colleges.\"",
      "Rubio said Khalil is \"going to leave \u2014 and so are others.\"",

    "story": [
      "Canadian officials are making their voices heard against tariffs through digital billboards in multiple states.",
      "Billboards such as those spotted in the Metro Detroit area this week read, \"Tariffs are a tax on your grocery bill.\"",
      "CBS News Detroit reached out to the Government of Canada, which paid for the ad, on Wednesday. John Babcock, spokesperson for Global Affairs Canada, sent a statement Thursday, saying that the billboards were placed in Arizona, Colorado, Florida, Georgia, Michigan, Minnesota, Nevada, New Hampshire, North Carolina, Ohio, Pennsylvania and Wisconsin, as well as Washington, D.C., and surrounding areas.",
      "\"The Government of Canada has launched an educational campaign to inform Americans of the economic impacts of tariffs. The campaign is a strategic investment in Canada's long-term economic interests, and its trade relationship with the United States,\" Babcock said. \"Tariffs are a tax on hard-working Americans in their daily lives. They lead to increased costs on everyday essentials, including fuel and groceries. The purpose is to increase the understanding of the American public and to counter misinformation.\"",
      "President Trump's tariffs were answered by Canada, who then implemented tariffs against the United States. Mr. Trump proposed 25% tariffs on the country and on all steel and aluminum imports. In response, Canada threatened to implement nearly $21 billion in retaliatory tariffs.",
      "Mr. Trump said he would raise the tariffs on Canadian steel and aluminum imports to 50%, but retracted that proposal and stayed at the 25% rate.",
      "Earlier this month, Ontario announced it was adding a 25% surcharge on all electricity exports\u00a0sent to the U.S. That surcharge would have affected consumers and businesses in Michigan, Minnesota and New York, but then Ontario Premier Doug Ford announced Canada would suspend that plan and the Trump administration backed off doubling Canadian steel and aluminum tariffs.",
      "In his latest move, Mr. Trump imposed 25% tariffs on vehicles and auto parts imported into the U.S. on Wednesday. Experts say targeting imported cars could also strain ties with key trading U.S. partners, including Canada, Japan, Mexico, South Korea and Europe. Half of the cars sold in the U.S. are manufactured within the country. Among imports, about half come from Mexico and Canada, with Japan, South Korea and Germany also major suppliers.",
      "Meanwhile, United Auto Workers union President Shawn Fain backed Mr. Trump's imposed tariffs on foreign-made cars, applauding the administration for \"stepping up to end the free trade disaster that has devastated working-class communities for decades.\"",

    "link": "https://www.cbsnews.com/news/top-gop-senator-seeks-expedited-watchdog-investigation-into-signal-chat-leak/",
    "published": "Thu, 27 Mar 2025 17:20:19 -0400",
    "summary": "Sen. Roger Wicker, chairman of the Senate Armed Services Committee, penned a letter seeking an expedited inspector general report on the Signal chat leak.",
    "story": [
      "Washington \u2014 Sen. Roger Wicker, a Mississippi Republican and chairman of the Senate Armed Services Committee, on Thursday requested an expedited inspector general investigation into the leak of a sensitive Signal group chat about strikes in Yemen that has stunned Washington in recent days.",
      "Earlier this week, Jeffrey Goldberg, the editor of The Atlantic, revealed that he was added to the group on the encrypted messaging app and observed as top Trump officials discussed sensitive plans to strike targets in Yemen. On Wednesday, a day after top administration officials claimed that \"no war plans\" were discussed, The Atlantic\u00a0published screenshots of more texts that showed Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth provided operational details about the timing of the strikes and the weapons and aircraft that would carry them out.",
      "Wicker on Thursday announced a letter had been sent to Steven Stebbins, the acting Inspector General of the Department of Defense, requesting an inquiry into the \"facts and circumstances surrounding the above referenced Signal chat incident, including an accounting of what was communicated and any remedial actions taken as a result.\" The letter also asked for clarity on the Defense Department's policies surrounding employees sharing \"sensitive and non-classified information on non-goverment networks and electronic applications\" and whether this chat violated them.",
      "Speaking to reporters at the Capitol Wednesday, Wicker previewed the committee's path forward. He said he and ranking member Jack Reed, a Rhode Island Democrat, would be sending a letter asking the administration to expedite an investigation by the Defense Department's Office of Inspector General and provide the findings to the committee. The chairman said another letter to the administration would seek \"to get ground truth,\" and he noted that the committee wants to determine whether the published transcript is accurate.",
      "Wicker also noted Wednesday to reporters that the information that has been published \"appears to me to be of such a sensitive nature that, based on my knowledge, I would have wanted it classified.\" Intelligence officials again said in testimony on Wednesday that no information in the chats was classified, an assertion that has been met with intense skepticism from Democrats and former government officials, given the nature of the information that Hegseth disclosed.",
      "Separately, a federal judge in Washington, D.C., on Thursday ordered the administration officials who were part of the Signal chat to preserve all messages exchanged on the platform from March 11 to March 15 \u2014 the time frame during which the app was used to discuss the strikes in Yemen.",
      "The order from U.S. District Judge James Boasberg represented agreement between the Justice Department and American Oversight, a watchdog group that had sued and claimed officials failed to follow federal recordkeeping laws. Ahead of the hearing, the Justice Department submitted a declaration from a top lawyer at the Treasury Department who said the messages had been preserved.",
      "\"We're committed to preserving what the agencies have,\" Amber Richer, a Justice Department lawyer, told Boasberg.",
      "She said the department is working with the agencies to determine the records they have and ensure they are maintained as required by law.",
      "The judge, who has faced attacks by the president over his decision in a separate case, told the parties that the government is \"moving toward implementing what the plaintiffs seek.\"",
      "\"What I see here is a real chance to reach common ground on a number of the issues raised,\" Boasberg said.",
      "The Trump administration fired the inspector general at the Defense Department shortly after President Trump took office, part of a broader purge of internal watchdogs at agencies across the government. The Pentagon's IG office is currently being overseen on an acting basis by Stebbins, formerly the principal deputy inspector general. Asked whether he had confidence that the Pentagon would comply with his request for an inspector general probe given the vacancy, Wicker said he did.",
      "Wicker said that he and Reed are seeking a classified briefing to the Armed Services Committee \"relatively soon\" with a senior administration official.",
      "\"The chair and the ranking member are working together on a bipartisan basis, as we've always tried to do,\" Wicker said.",
      "The Mississippi Republican defended the mission at the center of the group chat, saying \"the strike on the Houthis was a hugely successful mission, of which I greatly approved.\" He said it was \"a shame that this security question is distracting the public from \u2014 and all of us from \u2014 a big success internationally.\"",
      "Earlier in the day, Wicker said he did not believe Hegseth should resign. Asked later about any consequences he should face, Wicker said he's \"glad, in this case, no real damage was done.\"",
      "\"The fact is that the plans for the strike, the timing, the locations, were not revealed to the enemy, and it was a very successful operation,\" Wicker said. \"If, early on in this administration, there were mistakes, I would hope they can be rectified. ... If mistakes were made, I think we're all human, and they should be acknowledged.\"",

    "summary": "No Senate confirmation hearing had been scheduled for U.N. ambassador nominee Elise Stefanik, a congresswoman from New York.",
    "story": [
      "Washington \u2014 Rep. Elise Stefanik's nomination to be U.N. ambassador has been withdrawn, President Trump confirmed Thursday, with the president saying he's asked her to remain in Congress.",
      "The president's decision to pull her nomination ends two months of limbo for the New York Republican.",
      "\"As we advance our America First Agenda, it is essential that we maintain EVERY Republican Seat in Congress,\" Mr. Trump wrote on Truth Social. \"We must be unified to accomplish our Mission, and Elise Stefanik has been a vital part of our efforts from the very beginning. I have asked Elise, as one of my biggest Allies, to remain in Congress to help me deliver Historic Tax Cuts, GREAT Jobs, Record Economic Growth, a Secure Border, Energy Dominance, Peace Through Strength, and much more, so we can MAKE AMERICA GREAT AGAIN. With a very tight Majority, I don't want to take a chance on anyone else running for Elise's seat.\"",
      "Earlier Thursday, CBS News reported her nomination was in jeopardy as GOP pressure mounted for her to back away from the position.",
      "Multiple sources told CBS News there were ongoing discussions about whether she should withdraw from consideration. Stefanik had not resigned from her seat in Congress, and with the narrow majority in the House, Republicans need all the votes they can muster. House Speaker Mike Johnson was aware of some of the conversations about Stefanik that took place Thursday.",
      "Republicans hold just 218 seats in the House, while Democrats hold 213 seats. There are currently four vacant seats. After the president's announcement, Johnson acknowledged the Republicans' slim majority on social media as he hailed Stefanik's \"selfless decision.\"",
      "\"It is well known Republicans have a razor-thin House majority, and Elise's agreement to withdraw her nomination will allow us to keep one of the toughest, most resolute members of our Conference in place to help drive forward President Trump's America First policies,\" Johnson said on social platform X, calling Stefanik \"a great leader and a devoted patriot.\"",
      "The speaker said he would invite Stefanik to return to the House Republicans' leadership team immediately.",
      "Democrats pounced on the withdrawal, with House Minority Leader Hakeem Jeffries noting Mr. Trump's margin of victory in Stefanik's district during November's presidential election.",
      "\"Donald Trump won the Elise Stefanik district by 21 points in November 2024. He withdrew her nomination to be U.N. Ambassador because the extremists are afraid they will lose the special election to replace her,\" Jeffries said in a statement. \"The Republican agenda is extremely unpopular, they are crashing the economy in real time and House Republicans are running scared. What happened to their so-called mandate?\"",
      "In the Senate, there was little doubt Stefanik would have the votes to be confirmed. Her nomination was advanced by the Senate Foreign Relations Committee on Jan. 30.",
      "Republicans had discussed waiting to take further action on Stefanik's nomination to see how the Florida special elections go on April 1 for two vacant GOP seats. Both are expected to remain in Republican control.",
      "Stefanik did not immediately respond to CBS News' request for comment.",
      "Stefanik\u00a0has been among President Trump's most faithful allies and was the second nominee he announced for a Senate-confirmed position after the 2024 election. She was elected to Congress in 2014 and rose to House GOP leadership to be the highest-ranking Republican woman in the House.",

    "story": [
      "U.S. Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem on Wednesday visited the high-security El Salvador prison where Venezuelans who the Trump administration alleges are gang members have been held since their removal from the United States. The tour included two crowded cell blocks, the armory and an isolation unit.",
      "Noem's trip to the prison \u2014 where inmates are packed into cells and never allowed outside \u2014 comes as the Trump administration seeks to show it is deporting people it describes as the \"worst of the worst.\"",
      "The Trump administration is arguing in federal court that it was justified in sending the Venezuelans to El Salvador, while activists say officials have sent them to a prison rife with human rights abuses while presenting little evidence that they were part of the Venezuelan Tren de Aragua gang.",
      "Noem notably dodged questions by the press about if the Venezuelan deportees were going to be in the prison indefinitely and if the Venezuelans could ever be brought back to the U.S. if a court orders the administration to do so.",
      "\"We're going to let the courts play out,\" she told reporters following the visit.",
      "Noem toured an area holding some of the Venezuelans accused of being gang members. In the sweltering building, the men in white T-shirts and shorts stared silently from their cell, then were heard shouting an indiscernible chant when she left.",
      "In a cell block holding Salvadoran prisoners, about a dozen were lined up by guards near the front of their cell and told to remove their T-shirts and face masks. The men were heavily tattooed, some bearing the letters MS, for the Mara Salvatrucha gang, on their chests.",
      "After listening to Salvadoran officials, Noem turned her back to the cell and recorded a video message.",
      "If an immigrant commits a crime, \"this is one of the consequences you could face,\" Noem said. \"First of all, do not come to our country illegally. You will be removed and you will be prosecuted. But know that this facility is one of the tools in our toolkit that we will use if you commit crimes against the American people.\"",
      "Noem also met with El Salvador President Nayib Bukele, a populist who has gained right-wing admiration in the U.S. due to his crackdown on the country's gangs, despite the democratic and due process implications that have come with it.",
      "\"This unprecedented relationship we have with El Salvador is going to be a model for other countries on how they can work with America,\" Noem said to reporters Wednesday.",
      "Since taking office, Noem has frequently been front and center in efforts to highlight the immigration crackdown. She took part in immigration enforcement operations, rode horses with Border Patrol agents and was the face of a television campaign warning people in the country illegally to self-deport.",
      "Noem's Wednesday visit is part of a three-day trip. She'll also travel to Colombia and Mexico.",
      "The Venezuelans were removed from the U.S. this month after Trump invoked the Alien Enemies Act of 1798 and said the U.S. was being invaded by the Tren de Aragua gang. The Alien Enemies Act gives the president wartime powers and allows noncitizens to be deported without the opportunity to go before an immigration or federal court judge.",
      "An appeals court Wednesday kept in place an order barring the administration from deporting more Venezuelan immigrants to El Salvador under the Alien Enemies Act.",
      "A central outstanding question about the deportees' status is when and how they could ever be released from the prison, called the Terrorism Confinement Center, known as CECOT, as they are not serving sentences. They no longer appear in U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement's online detainee locator and have not appeared before a judge in El Salvador.",
      "The Trump administration refers to them as the \"worst of the worst\" but hasn't identified who was deported or provided evidence that they're gang members.",
      "Relatives of some of the deportees have categorically denied any gang affiliation. The Venezuelan government and a group called the Families of Immigrants Committee in Venezuela hired a lawyer to help free those held in El Salvador. A lawyer for the firm, which currently represents about 30 Venezuelans, said they aren't gang members and have no criminal records.",
      "The U.S. government has acknowledged that many do not have such records.",
      "Flights were in the air March 15 when a federal judge issued a verbal order temporarily barring the deportations and ordered planes to return to the U.S.",
      "The Trump administration has argued that the judge's verbal directions did not count, that only his written order needed to be followed and that it couldn't apply to flights that had already left the U.S.",
      "White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt told reporters that about 261 people were deported on the flights, including 137 under the Alien Enemies Act.",
      "Bukele opened the prison in 2023 as he made the Central American country's stark, harsh prisons a trademark of his fight against crime. The facility has eight sprawling pavilions and can hold up to 40,000 inmates. Each cell can fit 65 to 70 prisoners.",
      "Prisoners can't have visitors. There are no workshops or educational programs.",
      "El Salvador hasn't had diplomatic relations with Venezuela since 2019, so the Venezuelans imprisoned there do not have consular support from their government.",
      "Video released by El Salvador's government after the deportees' arrival showed men exiting airplanes onto an airport tarmac lined by officers in riot gear. The men, who had their hands and ankles shackled, struggled to walk as officers pushed their heads down.",
      "They were later shown at the prison kneeling on the ground as their heads were shaved before they changed into the prison's all-white uniform \u2014 knee-length shorts, T-shirt, socks and rubber clogs \u2014 and placed in cells.",
      "For three years, El Salvador has been operating under a state of emergency that suspends fundamental rights as Bukele wages an all-out assault on the country's powerful street gangs. During that time, some 84,000 people have been arrested, accused of gang ties and jailed, often without due process.",
      "Bukele offered to hold U.S. deportees in the prison when Secretary of State Marco Rubio visited in February.",
      "At the prison Wednesday, El Salvador Justice Minister Gustavo Villatoro showed Noem a cell holding Salvadorans he said had been there since the prison opened. \"No one expects that these people can go back to society and behave,\" he said.",

The office has recently gotten attention around Washington as a key government office for commercial space companies.",

      "Washington \u2014 Soon after the revelation that the editor-in-chief of The Atlantic had inadvertently been added to a Signal chat with top Trump administration officials about Yemen attack plans, some of those officials began changing or deleting their Venmo accounts. At least one account remained public for a day after the Atlantic report.",

      "According to screenshots obtained by CBS News, White House national security adviser Michael Waltz's friends list on Venmo was open to the public to view as late as Tuesday \u2014 a day after the Atlantic report about the Signal chat was published. On Wednesday, his account settings were changed to make his contacts private.",
      "Waltz's contacts on Venmo included journalists, government officials, active and retired service members and members of congress. There was no evidence Waltz had sent or received payments on the platform.",
      "Susie Wiles, President Trump's chief of staff, was listed on Waltz's Venmo friends list, but her account is now no longer searchable. On Wednesday, Wired magazine reported on Waltz' and Wiles' Venmo accounts and said their respective accounts were made private after the publication contacted the White House.",
      "\"Venmo is a commonly used app, and Mike Waltz has made necessary updates for his personal privacy protection,\" said NSC spokesman James Hewitt, after being contacted by CBS News Wednesday.",
      "Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth, who has faced a barrage of criticism this week for sharing details on the Signal chat about the March 15 U.S. strike on Iranian-backed Houthis, had an account in early March, but it has since been deactivated, CBS News has learned.",
      "In February, reporters with The American Prospect, a progressive political and public policy magazine, found that Hegseth's Venmo was previously left open for the public to view contacts he had in his cellphone who also had Venmo accounts. Among the contacts were defense contractors, UnitedHealth executives, fellow veterans and colleagues at Fox News.",

    "story": [
      "An encrypted messaging app called Signal is drawing attention and questions after top Trump officials \u2014 including Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth and Vice President JD Vance \u2014 allegedly used the service to discuss a highly sensitive military operation while inadvertently including The Atlantic's editor-in-chief, Jeffrey Goldberg, in the chat.",
      "On Monday, Goldberg published a piece in The Atlantic about how he was added to an 18-person chat on Signal earlier this month to discuss military strikes in Yemen, writing that at first he \"didn't think it could be real.\"",
      "The National Security Council said the messages seem to be \"authentic,\" in a statement to CBS News after the story was published.",
      "The use of Signal to discuss sensitive military operations is raising questions about the app, including its level of security against hackers and other bad actors. It's an app that many Americans may not be familiar with, given that Signal had about 70 million users in 2024, a fraction of the 1 billion active monthly users of Apple's iMessage, according to the national security publication Lawfare.",
      "President Trump told reporters on Tuesday that he had asked national security adviser Mike Waltz, who Goldberg said added him to the group chat, to \"immediately study\" the use of Signal by government officials.",
      "Here's what to know about the service.",
      "What is Signal?",
      "Signal is an encrypted service for text messaging, but it can also handle phone and video calls, making it a versatile app for talking on a secure channel with others. Up to 1,000 people can join a group chat, and messages can be set to disappear after a period of time.",
      "Signal has been gaining users because of its end-to-end encryption, which is boosting its \"adoption during uncertain times or specific events which reinforce its position as the go-to communication service,\" PP Foresight analyst Paolo Pescatore told CBS MoneyWatch.",
      "Its encryption prevents any third-party from viewing conversation content or listening in on calls. In other words, messages and calls sent on Signal are scrambled and only the sender and recipient at each end will have the key to decipher them.",
      "Unlike another popular messaging app, Telegram, encryption on Signal is turned on by default. Signal also says it doesn't collect or store any sensitive information.",
      "\"Signal messages and calls cannot be accessed by us or other third parties because they are always end-to-end encrypted, private and secure,\" according to the service.",
      "Signal didn't immediately reply to a request for comment about the Trump administration's use of the app.",
      "Who owns Signal?",
      "Signal is owned by the nonprofit Signal Foundation, which was set up by co-founders Moxie Marlinspike and Brian Acton to support the app's operations as well as \"investigate the future of private communication,\" according to the foundation's website. The foundation says it is a nonprofit \"with no advertisers or investors, sustained only by the people who use and value it.\"",
      "The foundation's board has five members, including Marlinspike and Acton, who co-founded WhatsApp and donated $50 million to set up the foundation.",
      "The Signal app was created more than a decade ago by Marlinspike, an entrepreneur, who was briefly head of product security at Twitter after he sold his mobile security startup, called Whisper Systems, to the social media company in 2011. Marlinspike merged two existing open source apps, one for texting and one for voice calls, to create Signal.",
      "Can Signal be hacked?",
      "Signal touts the privacy of its service, and experts agree it is more secure than conventional texting.",
      "But they also caution that it could be hacked. And in February 2025, the National Security Agency sent out an operational security special bulletin to its employees cautioning them of vulnerabilities in the Signal app, according to internal NSA documents obtained by CBS News.",
      "\"A vulnerability has been identified in the Signal Messenger Application. The use of Signal by common targets of surveillance and espionage activity has made the application a high value target to intercept sensitive information,\" the internal bulletin says.",
      "Signal\u00a0responded\u00a0to the bulletin in a social media post Tuesday, saying the NSA's \"memo used the term 'vulnerability' in relation to Signal-but it had nothing to do with Signal's core tech. It was warning against phishing scams targeting Signal users.\"",
      "\"Phishing isn't new, and it's not a flaw in our encryption or any of Signal's underlying technology,\" the company said. \"Phishing attacks are a constant threat for popular apps and websites.\"",
      "Government officials have used Signal for organizational correspondence, such as scheduling sensitive meetings. But in the Biden administration, people who had permission to download it on their White House-issued phones were instructed to use the app sparingly, according to a former national security official who served in the administration.",
      "\"Unlike other end-to-end encryption messaging services, Signal does boast a rich range of features,\" Pescatore said. \"However, hackers are always on the prowl to find weaknesses and use apps maliciously.\"",
      "What is Signal typically used for?",
      "Because of its end-to-end encryption, Signal is often used by national security and intelligence professionals, as well as activists, among others, according to Lawfare.",
      "A recent\u00a0Associated Press review\u00a0found that encrypted messaging apps are increasingly popular with government officials, with some using government mobile phone numbers, while others registered their accounts to personal numbers.",
      "Are there legal issues for government officials using Signal?",
      "Possibly, yes. Sharing sensitive national security details over Signal could violate the Espionage Act, CBS News national security contributor Sam Vinograd, who served in former President Barack Obama's Homeland Security Department, said Tuesday.",
      "\"By communicating classified information on a nonsecure platform like Signal, senior U.S. government officials ... increased the chance that foreign governments could get access to sensitive operational security plans \u2014 and that could put our own troops in harm's way,\" Vinograd said.",
      "While Mr. Trump told reporters from the Oval Office on Tuesday that \"I don't know anything about Signal, I wasn't involved in this,\" he indicated that other branches of government use the app.",
      "\"I hear it's used by a lot of groups, I hear it's used by the media a lot,\" he said. \"A lot of the military, I think successfully. Sometimes people can get onto those things, that's one of the prices you pay when you're not sitting in the Situation Room with no phones, which is always the best, frankly. The best is to be there.\"",
      "Mr. Trump said Signal is the \"No. 1 device or app that is used\" that he had asked Waltz to explore its use by government officials.",
      "Meanwhile, Democratic lawmakers are\u00a0demanding an investigation\u00a0into why highly\u00a0sensitive information\u00a0was being discussed on a commercially available messaging app, rather than secure government channels.",
      "The Atlantic's Goldberg also alleged that some of the messages in the group chat were designed to disappear after one week, and others after four weeks, which could be a violation of federal law requiring the preservation of official records.",
      "The Associated Press\n                  \n        contributed to this report.",

      "Jan Cilliers: The fact that they're both in the same house text messaging each other \u2026 they need to leave is very worrying.",
      "That was the last text message that Christy or Hilda ever sent. That Uber arrived, waited five minutes, and drove away empty.",

      "Acting on information supplied by Cilliers, Vander Lee and his partner headed to 8641 West Olympic Boulevard a little after midnight on Nov. 14 \u2014 only a few hours after getting that call from the second hospital.",
      "Jonathan Vigliotti: And this is where the Uber that Christy and Hilda called that night would have waited?",
      "Det. Jonathan Vander Lee: Right out front, yep.",
      "Jonathan Vigliotti: Ten minutes between life and death.",
      "Det. Jonathan Vander Lee: That's all it takes.",
      "It was the home of 39-year-old David Pearce. Police would learn Christy and Hilda had met him for the first time at that warehouse party. Police also discovered Pearce had a registration for a black Prius and found it parked behind the building. It matched the car seen at both hospitals \u2014down to the black rims. Pearce lived on the second floor with a roommate \u2014 Brandt Osborn, 42.",

      "Det. Jonathan Vander Lee: Yes, completely\u2014LAPD, open the door. And then it's just complete silence.",
      "After about 15 minutes, he says, Pearce and Osborn came out. Pearce denied owning a Prius.",
      "Det. Jonathan Vander Lee: So I immediately get a lie.",
      "Jonathan Vigliotti: Do you leave?",
      "Det. Jonathan Vander Lee: No. I interviewed Mr. Osborn.",
      "At first, he says, Osborn denied seeing Christy and Hilda at all.",
      "Det. Jonathan Vander Lee: He changes his stories numerous times. At first, there's no girls had been on that location whatsoever.",

      "Vander Lee says Osborn eventually admitted the women had been at their apartment, but said he'd been asleep and when he woke up realized Christy and Hilda were in distress. He said he and Pearce chose to go to two separate hospitals because quote \"we didn't know how it would look.\"",
      "Pearce, police say, did later admit he owned the Prius, but lied again, saying his license plates had been stolen. Vander Lee says he saw those plates on the ground by the vehicle.",
      "Then, the men agreed to let detectives inside.",

      "By now, Vander Lee says he knew Pearce and Osborn had dropped Hilda and Christy off, and believed Pearce had drugged them, but he didn't have enough evidence to make an arrest.",
      "Det. Jonathan Vander Lee: He thought he'd beat us that night, for sure. And he was happy.",
      "Jonathan Vigliotti: He smiled and said goodbye?",

      "Lt. Calvin You: Well, the first thing is \u2026 Who did he sexually assault this time?",
      "Detective You had investigated Pearce in 2020 for sexually assaulting a 19-year-old.",
      "Lt. Calvin You: She was raped while she was unconscious.",
      "The victim said Pearce had given her drugs to knock her out during a date. But the investigation had stalled and wasn't prosecuted at the time. Detective You knew Pearce had other prior charges, including another rape charge from 2014 that was also not prosecuted.",
      "Lt. Calvin You: He has a pattern. \u2026 His first step is trying to find his victim. So that could be through \u2026 a dating app through online listings or meeting them at bars or events. \u2026 When he picks his victim, he goes to step two, which is bragging about himself.",
      "Pearce relies on lies, detectives say, to set his trap.",
      "Det. Jonathan Vander Lee: He'd introduce himself as a producer, as doctor, all these different things. \u2026 He's none of these things \u2026 He might have been an intern at the time or something at a production company.",
      "Jonathan Vigliotti: An intern?",
      "Det. Jonathan Vander Lee: Yeah.",
      "They say his next step is to drug his victims and incapacitate them, often with a drink.",
      "Lt. Calvin You: After they take this drink, he goes to step four, which is the sexual assault.",
      "Police would learn both Christy and Hilda showed signs of sexual assault, but they feared they would face challenges making the case.",
      "Jonathan Vigliotti: How difficult is it to prove a crime took place when the victims were recreationally using drugs?",
      "Det. Jonathan Vander Lee: \u2026 it makes \u2026 the case extremely hard. \u2026 I had told Jan early on that this was gonna be a near impossible case to prove.",
      "FATAL ENCOUNTER",
      "Det. Jonathan Vander Lee: At first, it's a whodunit. But \u2026 it just became what actually happened \u2026 and that's what was difficult in this case.",
      "Detective Vander Lee says the pressure was on to locate any evidence of what happened after Christy and Hilda met David Pearce that night.",
      "Det. Jonathan Vander Lee:\u00a0 Video starts expiring. \u2026 these DVRs, it's a constant \u2026 you gotta get this evidence before it disappears.",
      "Police did have some luck, starting with footage from outside that warehouse party. They say it shows the women leaving with Pearce, Osborn, and a friend of theirs \u2014 47-year-old Michael Ansbach \u2014 on their way to Pearce's apartment.",
      "Police also uncovered this text exchange from moments earlier, when the women were still inside that party. \"Do you want coke,\" asks Hilda. \"Yes,\" replies Christy. Hilda texted back, \"I'm in the kitchen. Let's do a line.\"",
      "Witnesses say Pearce supplied that cocaine, which Cilliers says was not a common choice for Christy.",
      "Jan Cilliers: Maybe it was late at night and she wanted to get less tired \u2026 it's not something that she would do regularly.",
      "Police determined the group arrived at Pearce's apartment a little after 5 a.m. The women aren't seen again until 11 hours later, when, at 4:30 p.m. a security camera recorded the grainy image showing Pearce with Christy over his shoulder at the top of the stairs. Police say Osborn is carrying her bag. 35 minutes later, at the hospital, Pearce, wearing a black sweatshirt, helps take Christy's body out of the car. Osborn looks on.",
      "A full hour-and-a-half later, a dark image shows the men leaving the apartment again, with Hilda. Police say Pearce is carrying her and Osborn has her boots and coat. Half-an-hour later, the Prius arrives at that second hospital where the men take Hilda out of the car together.",
      "It had been more than 13 hours since Christy texted Hilda: \"let's go.\"",
      "For two weeks Hilda was on life support. With no hope of regaining consciousness, her family gathered to say their goodbyes.",
      "Jonathan Vigliotti: Hilda, what were your final moments with your daughter?",
      "Dr. Hilda Marcela Arzola-Plascencia: Oh, they were so hard you know \u2026 and I just was asking God to not let her suffer more.",
      "Fernanda Cabrales-Arzola: I remember telling her that you can leave \u2026 and just thanking her for being my sister.",
      "Luis Cabrales: I told her \u2026 baby when I pass away I will see you again. \u2026and I give you a big hug, a kiss.",
      "The family decided to donate Hilda's organs. Her mom remembers the medical staff lining the halls as the family accompanied Hilda to the OR.",
      "Dr. Hilda Marcela Arzola-Plascencia: The medical team was clapping \u2026 to honor her, to say thank you for giving life to others.",
      "Like Christy, Hilda had suffered a drug overdose. Toxicology reports would later reveal that she had cocaine, MDMA or ecstasy, and elevated levels of fentanyl in her system. Police would also learn that while the women were in that apartment, the downstairs neighbor heard someone \"in pain and moaning on-and-off\" for six hours. Police believe that was Hilda. Neither Pearce, nor Osborn, nor Ansbach called for help.",
      "Dr. Hilda Marcela Arzola-Plascencia: It makes me get angry \u2026 because she was suffering and nobody, nobody helped her.",
      "Jonathan Vigliotti: How hard is it to prove this narrative when the victims \u2026 can't even testify on their own behalf?",
      "Lt. Calvin You: If we were just investigating Christy and Hilda's alone, very difficult.",
      "But the district attorney at the time went public asking other women who knew Pearce to call in, so police could better understand what he did to Hilda and Christy.",
      "D.A. GEORGE GASCON (to reporters): \u00a0If you feel comfortable moving forward so that we can evaluate your case and charge it\u00a0 we're here for you.",
      "Lt. Calvin You: We started getting a lot of calls.",
      "As police continued building their case, Cilliers received a call that Pearce and Osborn were on the move. He recorded video of the men loading up a moving van the day after Hilda died. Police say Pearce had also changed his phone number, and it took them a week to locate him again.",
      "Jonathan Vigliotti: So the pressure is on. You gotta get this guy.",
      "Det. Jonathan Vander Lee: I gotta come up with something quick, yes.",
      "On Dec. 15, 2021, David Pearce, Brandt Osborn, and Michael Ansbach were arrested in connection with Hilda and Christy's deaths. The detectives still knew next to nothing about what had happened inside that apartment. Vander Lee says they decided to take a gamble and bring the men in.",
      "Det. Jonathan Vander Lee: This is the only way we're going to get the info we need.",
      "Once the men were in custody, police conducted interviews with them one by one.",
      "Det. Jonathan Vander Lee: We kind of played with a rotation and it worked out exceedingly well.",
      "They secretly recorded Pearce and Osborn while Ansbach was talking to police.",
      "Det. Jonathan Vander Lee: Pearce \u2026 says, \"I hope Ansbach is not up there telling him \u2026 I gave them drugs and wine.\"",
      "When it was his turn, Pearce denied giving the women drugs.",
      "DAVID PEARCE (police interview): I was told \u2026 there was like a very bad batch of fentanyl that was going around.",
      "This was suspicious because information that the women had likely died from fentanyl had not been released.",
      "Det. Jonathan Vander Lee: I knew \u2026 these girls died from fentanyl but nobody else knew.",
      "Two months after his arrest, Ansbach reached out to police with details of what he says he witnessed that night. He says Pearce had offered the women a ride to an after party, and then said he needed to make a quick stop at his house. Ansbach says Pearce was \"very insistent they stay and have a drink,\" and, after the women talked about leaving, Pearce gave all three of them so-called \"special cocaine.\"",
      "Ansbach says he, Christy and Hilda got sick immediately, and... when he woke up hours later, he saw Christy without any signs of life. Ansbach says he told Pearce to take Christy and Hilda to the hospital and says Pearce then said repeatedly, \"dead girls don't talk.\"",
      "Jackie | Jane Doe No. 2: I wouldn't say survivor. I'm a fighter. That's what I am.",
      "But police had at least one woman who could talk about David Pearce at his upcoming trial.",
      "Jackie: He asked me if I wanted a drink \u2026 but it tasted really funny \u2026 And then I don't remember the next several hours after that.",
      "SURVIVORS SPEAK OUT AT TRIAL",
      "On Jan. 9 2025, opening arguments begin in the trial of David Pearce, charged with felony murder, and Brandt Osborn, charged with accessory after the fact.",
      "CATHERINE MARIANO (in court): The evidence will show that the defendant knowingly gave Hilda and Christy GHB and fentanyl, knowing that it was dangerous to their lives, knowing that it could kill them, but he just didn't care. \u2026 Defendant Osborn helped him get rid of any evidence to implicate defendant Pearce in the deaths of Christy and Hilda.",
      "Prosecutor Catherine Mariano has marshalled the forensic evidence to make her case: the toxicology results that found fentanyl in both women and the date rape drug GHB in Christy. Also, Pearce's DNA discovered on Christy's body and under Hilda's fingernails.",
      "CATHERINE MARIANO (in court): This is no accident. This is no mistake.",
      "But in order to prove felony murder, she must show that Pearce incapacitated Christy and Hilda to rape them. Without their testimony, she needs to establish he had a history of doing this to other women: putting drugs in their drinks and then sexually assaulting them.",
      "CATHERINE MARIANO (in court): He didn't care whether they lived or died, all he cared about taking advantage of them.",
      "JEFF VOLL (in court): Here's where there's a problem \u2026",
      "But defense attorney Jeff Voll says the fact that Christy and Hilda were using drugs before meeting Pearce that night means there is no case for murder.",
      "JEFF VOLL (in court): \u2026 these young ladies unfortunately ingested fentanyl and they died \u2026 it's a shame but Mr. Pearce didn't kill them.",
      "Voll is sixth in a long line of lawyers who have represented Pearce in this case. He knows his client is problematic.",
      "Jeff Voll: \u2026 he's very demanding \u2026 he's very sure of himself. \u2026 what David Pearce wants David Pearce gets.",
      "Mariano has her own version of who David Pearce is based on the accounts of the women who talked to investigators and chose to be anonymous.",
      "Jackie is Jane Doe No. 2.",
      "Jackie: It was important for me to come forward \u2026 and, you know, get any information I could regarding this vile man.",
      "No cameras were allowed in the courtroom for any of the testimony, but Jackie agreed to talk with \"48 Hours\" about her experience with Pearce in 2010 when she was a 24-year-old law student looking for a room to rent. She testified about her meeting with Pearce at his apartment on West Olympic Boulevard, where he gave her a tour and offered a drink.",
      "Jackie: I started to spin and, you know, I \u2014 I just became, like, disoriented.",
      "Jonathan Vigliotti: You drink this drink, you start to feel dizzy, I'm sure confused. What happens next?",
      "Jackie: So the next thing I know, um, he was, you know, basically trying, I would say, trying to rape me \u2026 So I started fighting him back.",
      "According to Jackie he continued to assault her.",
      "Jackie: He threw me onto the floor. \u2026 he punched me in the face.",
      "When she tried to take her phone out, he grabbed her arm so hard the phone flew and smashed into the wall. Unsteady on her feet and unable to call for help, she did everything she could to escape.",
      "Jackie: I had to crawl down the stairs I was so disoriented and crawled down West Olympic Boulevard to my car \u2026 screaming for help.",
      "Though seriously injured and traumatized, she did not report it.",
      "Jackie: There's a huge stigma that surrounds women that come forward with sexual assault.",
      "But when she heard about Christy and Hilda, she decided to act.",
      "In all, 20 women came forward. Pearce was charged with seven sexual assaults. Detective Calvin You thinks that's just a fraction of those who suffered at the hands of David Pearce.",
      "Jonathan Vigliotti: Are there more Jane Does out there?",
      "Lt. Calvin You: Yes. I would definitely say so.",
      "Jonathan Vigliotti: How many do you believe?",
      "Lt. Calvin You: I'd say a hundred.",
      "Jonathan Vigliotti: A hundred. That's incredible. And that's just based on the people that you have spoken with directly?",
      "Lt. Calvin You: Yes.",
      "Jan Cilliers: I'm just so grateful that they came forward \u2026 I can't even imagine how the level of bravery that you have to have in order to \u2026 testify to a room of strangers that you were so intimately violated.",
      "And as the women testified one by one, defense attorney Voll could see what was happening; the prosecution strategy was working.",
      "Jeff Voll: The victims coming to court testifying, some who broke down in tears, all gave the same testimony \u2026 and I am watching the jury.",
      "Jeff Voll: They're looking at him and the expression on the juror's faces are like, how could you? How could you do this?",
      "After the Jane Does testified, the prosecution called Pearce's friend Michael Ansbach, who was in the apartment that night and later arrested along with Pearce and Osborn.",
      "Ansbach took video of Christy and Hilda minutes after Pearce gave them wine and cocaine at the apartment.",
      "Det. Jonathan Vander Lee: Christy's lying on the couch. It looks like she's on her way to becoming unconscious.",
      "In his testimony, Ansbach again said he also used the same cocaine, got violently ill and then passed out. When he woke up, he said, Pearce asked him to check on Christy and when he did, Ansbach said, it looked like she was not breathing. Hilda, he said, was in Pearce's bedroom. According to Ansbach, this is when Pearce told him \"dead girls don't talk.\"",
      "Like Pearce and Osborn, Ansbach never called for help. His charges were later dropped.",
      "On day 11 \u2014 and against the advice of his attorney \u2014 David Pearce, who pleaded not guilty, was sworn in and testified.",
      "Lt. Calvin You: So he got on the stand and he did his best to try to say everybody was wrong and he was right.",
      "Det. Jonathan Vander Lee: He was apparently the only one telling the truth at the entire trial.",
      "On the 12th day, Pearce's roommate Brandt Osborn, who also pleaded not guilty, takes the stand.",
      "Det. Jonathan Vander Lee: So, Osborn's role was to help get rid of the bodies, first and foremost. \u2026 He helped carry the girls at first \u2026 He helped formulate the plan in terms of what they're gonna tell the security guards.",
      "Osborn testified he was \"dumbfounded\" by Pearce's behavior and was emotional \u2013 crying more than once on the stand \u2014 saying he played no part in a cover-up because he didn't have a complete picture of what was really going on.",
      "Cilliers, for one, was not buying it.",
      "Jan Cilliers: He's basically claiming to be an innocent bystander in the situation and that he's also a victim in the situation. \u2026 but there are facts that prove that he helped David Pearce cover it up.",
      "The question is whether the jury will believe either man. After three weeks, the trial took a toll on Christy's family.",
      "Dusty Giles: We sat and had to hold our mouth closed while they battered, and I feel like they destroyed my daughter's reputation.",
      "Jan Cilliers: It was definitely difficult being in the same room as them. \u2026 did I have an overwhelming urge to throw something really hard at their heads? Yeah.",
      "In closing, Prosecutor Mariano hits back at the defense \u2013 just because Christy and Hilda did drugs on their own that night doesn't make them responsible for their own deaths. David Pearce took care of that, Mariano argued.",
      "CATHERINE MARIANO (in court): He didn't care about violating them in the most awful way. He didn't care that by drugging Christy and Hilda, that they could die.",
      "And she repeats the words of Ansbach attributed to David Pearce \u2014 the words that rang in the ears of everyone who loved Christy and Hilda.",
      "CATHERINE MARIANO (in court): He wanted them to die because \"dead girls don't talk.\"",
      "Attorneys for Osborn and Pearce told jurors there simply was not enough direct evidence linking them to the crime and that there's a strong case for reasonable doubt.",
      "Now it's up to the jury to draw its own conclusion about Brandt Osborn and David Pearce.",
      "Dusty Giles made her decision about that a long time ago.",
      "Dusty Giles: Pearce is a sick, slimy \u2026 lizard that sits and preys and sneaks \u2026 and his bite is deadly.",

      "For Christy's family, it's been a long and wrenching road to get here.",
      "Jonathan Vigliotti: For you, what does justice for Christy look like?",
      "Jan Cilliers: I mean (sigh) there's no justice for Christy \u2026 There is only preventing him from doing it again, I think. \u2026 That's the only justice we can get.",
      "And for Hilda's mother, who could not travel to be in court, the last three years without her daughter have been its own trial.",

      "Dusty Giles: I was just told, \"I'm very sorry to inform you, Ms. Giles. \u2026 But she was dropped off at our hospital on the outside, kind of like a bag of garbage.\" And, um \u2026 \"she didn't make it.\" \u2026 And I said, \"what do you mean she didn't make it?\"",

      "Jan planned to pop the question just seven months after meeting at the Burning Man arts festival in the Nevada desert. But, in the moment, they figured why wait.",
      "Jan Cillier: Instead, we just decided to elope. We just got married right there.",

      "The newlyweds came to Alabama, and Christy and her mom found the perfect wedding dress to wear at a later date.",

      "Like Christy, Hilda had suffered a drug overdose. Toxicology reports would later reveal that she had cocaine, MDMA or ecstasy, and elevated levels of fentanyl in her system.

      "Jan Cilliers: I texted her back and sort of didn't hear anything from her.",
      "At first, he just assumed she was sleeping in. But after a few hours with no word, he noticed something strange. They shared locations on their phones.",

      "Jan Cilliers: So \u2026 a little orange flag at the back of your head.",

      "Jan Cilliers: I called her parents \u2026 let them know that something terrible had happened and that she's in the emergency room \u2026 and then, her mom called the emergency room and called me back probably five minutes later, letting me know that Christy passed away.",
      "Jonathan Vigliotti: In less than 24 hours, your world was turned upside down.",
      "Jan Cilliers: Shattered.",
      "Jan went straight to the hospital. Christy and Hilda's friend who had been at the warehouse party with them, but left early, was already here. She had been desperately trying to get in touch with Hilda but couldn't reach her. They were about to find out why.",
      "Jan Cilliers: She \u2026 got a call from a different hospital like two hours later saying that Hilda was just checked in there \u2026 And then \u2014 like, obviously, all our alarm bells are going off in our heads when both girls are dropped off at two different hospitals, two hours apart. Like something terrible happened that night.",
      "And Jan believed, whatever happened, took place at that mysterious address on Olympic Blvd. He put it on Instagram asking for help.",
      "Jonathan Vigliotti: You blast out this address and very quickly, you got responses.",
      "Jan Cilliers: Yeah.",
      "Jonathan Vigliotti: What are those responses?",
      "Jan Cilliers: That there's somebody that lives at this location that is very unsavory person, um, that there's a lot of stuff out on the Internet about him.",
      "His name was David Pearce.\u00a0 Hilda and Christy were believed to have met him for the first time at the warehouse party.",

      "Mary Fulginiti: A murderer.",
      "RETRACING CHRISTY AND HILDA'S NIGHT OUT",
      "As Hilda Marcela lay in a hospital bed fighting for her life in LA, Dusty and Leslie Giles were preparing to bury their daughter Christy in Alabama.",
      "Half her ashes would go to Jan to scatter in the places they loved. Dusty placed the rest in an urn inside a butterfly box and gently wrapped it in the wedding dress she never had the chance to wear.",
      "Dusty Giles: It was important because I know how happy she was when she found it. She swirled like a princess literally in it.",
      "Within hours of Christy's death, detectives on the case were following clues from Christy herself.\u00a0 Her pinging phone had led them straight to the apartment of David Pearce at 8641 West Olympic Blvd.",
      "Barry Telis: Police drive over there. Oh, my God. There's the car. Boom. There's the car. \u2026 Same car.",
      "Telis says police believed it was the same black Prius with no license plates that dropped Christy off at the hospital.",
      "Barry Telis: And it's like, OK, I think \u2014 I think we have our man.",
      "They retraced the movements of the women that night, which would become the basis of a police affidavit. When they combed through those pictures from the party at the warehouse, there was David Pearce with Hilda partying it up in the VIP section.",
      "Jonathan Vigliotti: it sounds like VIP access gave David Pearce \u2026 instant credibility.",
      "Barry Telis: Absolutely. It's all part of the manipulation \u2026 He must be a good guy. He's in the VIP section.",
      "It was likely all part of a plan to meet women \u2014 a plan that included drugs, says the retired detective.",
      "Barry Telis: Based on the witnesses' statements and the police investigation\u2026 David Pearce comes with a bag of cocaine \u2014 an ounce estimated \u2014 and David Pearce came here to share it with whoever he could meet.",
      "According to Telis, cocaine is a hot ticket at these parties, at least on that night, even for Hilda and Christy.\u00a0 The police recovered this text exchange between the two women starting at 4:21 a.m. while still at the warehouse party: \"Do you want coke?\" asks Hilda. \"Yes,\" replies Christy. Hilda texted back \"I'm in the kitchen. Let's do a line.\"",
      "According to the police affidavit, a witness \"observed Pearce provide what looked like cocaine to Giles and Cabrales who consumed it.\"",
      "Police say half an hour later, surveillance video obtained by \"48 Hours\" shows Hilda and Christy leaving with David Pearce and two other men \u2014 his roommate Brandt Osborn and their friend, photographer Michael Ansbach. They all get into Osborn's car.",
      "At 5:11 a.m., according to the police affidavit, surveillance video \u2014 which has not been released because of the ongoing investigation \u2014 shows Osborn's car arriving in front of the apartment. According to the affidavit, several people got out of the vehicle and headed to the entrance of the residence.",
      "Nineteen minutes later, at 5:30 a.m., Christy sends \u2014 from inside Pearce's apartment \u2014 a wide-eyed emoji text to Hilda saying, \"let's go.\" Hilda replies \"I'll call an Uber 10 min away.\"",
      "Thirteen minutes later, according to the affidavit, a car, believed to be the Uber, pulls up. After waiting five minutes it drives away without Christy and without Hilda.",
      "Jonathan Vigliotti: How did you process that?",
      "Jan Cilliers: I mean it's just confirming my worst fears again that they were there at that place against their will. They didn't want to be there. They wanted to leave.",
      "Mary Fulginiti, a former federal prosecutor and defense attorney and a CBS News consultant, has reviewed the police affidavit and court documents. She says this text is an important piece of evidence.",
      "Mary Fulginiti: Something or someone stopped them in their tracks because they never got out and they never left.",
      "No one knows exactly what went on inside that apartment for the next 13 hours. But, according to the affidavit, a neighbor heard someone \"in pain and moaning on-and-off during the hours of 10:30 a.m. \u2026until 4 p.m.\" For reasons not known, the neighbor did not call police.",
      "Mary Fulginiti: She's clearly in a distressed state that everyone seems to just be ignoring. And when I say everyone, not just Pearce or Osborn, but there's a third individual that appears to have been at that apartment, at least for part or all of the night, and that's Michael Ansbach.",
      "Whatever happened inside the apartment was hidden from public view, not so outside the apartment. Another key piece of evidence: images captured on security cameras.",
      "Barry Telis (standing outside Pearce's apartment): But the cameras are in the adjacent building right next door, pointing right in this direction.",
      "Although Telis has not seen the video, the police affidavit describes it in detail. At 4:19 in the afternoon \u2014 11 hours after they'd arrived at the apartment \u2014 Pearce and Osborn are caught on camera carrying Christy down the back stairs.",
      "Barry Telis: It shows Pearce exit the door \u2026 the back door, looks \u2026 in both directions.",
      "Barry Telis: Making sure the coast is clear \u2026 making sure there's not gonna be any witnesses that sees me carrying this body to my car.",
      "Both men get in the Prius. According to the affidavit, the men are captured on security cameras trying to disguise themselves.",
      "Mary Fulginiti: You see them putting on a hat, a mask and a hoodie. And then they drive away, and they drive to a hospital. Southern California Medical Center.",
      "Shortly after, according to police, Ansbach leaves the residence carrying bags \"of unknown items.\"\u00a0 Pearce and Osborn return to the apartment to get Hilda. They carry her partially clad body out to the Prius.",
      "Mary Fulginiti: And again, they leave \u2026 They don't go to the same hospital. They go to a different hospital, Kaiser Permanente.",
      "Jonathan Vigliotti: Why not bring them at the same time to the same hospital?",
      "Barry Telis: Who knows? They're trying to conceal their actions. They're trying to keep the police at bay, and they don't want to hit the radar.",
      "Mary Fulginiti: And they do the same thing \u2026 They drop the body, they tell the same story, and then they take off without leaving their name, their phone number or anything to identify themselves with.",
      "Jonathan Vigliotti: And Hilda \u2026 what is her state at this point.",
      "Barry Telis: Hilda was still alive \u2026 when they got her to the hospital \u2026 and then she was declared what we call brain dead.",

      "Fernanda Cantisani: We brought her favorite thing to drink and her favorite cake \u2026 at first \u2026 we were crying. \u2026 But at some point \u2026 we put her favorite music on \u2026 and we just started dancing and we were laughing and hugging.

      "Erica Bergman, who also goes by Erykah Poe, is not one of the Jane Does. But she says she was so traumatized by Pearce, she tried to warn other women about him on a blog called \"The Dirty\" as far back as 2013. She discovered she had a lot of company.",
      "Erica Bergman: There's a lot of commonalities in our stories.",

But Osborn, who has been charged as an accessory to murder after the fact, may have unwittingly explained why. According to the police affidavit, Osborn told coworkers if cops had found the \"drugs hidden underneath the cash\" inside the car they would've been in \"big trouble.\"",
      "Not finding fentanyl-laced drugs creates a big challenge for the prosecution, says Fulginiti.",
      "Mary Fulginiti: They're going to have to prove that David Pearce gave the girls these drugs and he knew at the time that it could harm them, and he did so with conscious disregard. \u2026 so, they're gonna have to prove that David Pearce intended to kill these young women. That's not an easy threshold to overcome.",
      "Especially in light of witness statements that the women were doing drugs willingly \u2014 cocaine at the warehouse and earlier in the evening, as well. Friends told police Christy and Hilda both had taken cocaine and ketamine, a popular club drug.",
      "Jonathan Vigliotti: How does this work in the defense's favor?",

      "Jonathan Vigliotti: Is GHB, is the date-rape drug something these women would have taken knowingly?",
      "Mary Fulginiti: Absolutely not \u2026 that is a drug that's usually used by sexual predators, guys that want to, you know, take advantage of women and don't want them to remember and know about it.",

      "Jonathan Vigliotti: Why include sexual assault charges in a murder case?",
      "Mary Fulginiti: If you look at this case in its totality, I mean, this is David Pearce's MO. \u2026 He lures women back to his apartment. He provides them with a drink. \u2026 And then they start to feel dizzy or they blackout, and he sexually assaults them.",

      "An American woman was freed by the Taliban after she, two British nationals and their Afghan translator were detained in Afghanistan earlier this year, according to a source with knowledge of the matter and a former U.S. envoy to Kabul.",
      "\"American citizen Faye Hall, just released by the Taliban, is now in the care of our friends, the Qataris in Kabul, and will soon be on her way home,\" Zalmay Khalilzad, who has been part of an American delegation working on Taliban hostage releases, wrote on X.",
      "Hall was detained in February along with Peter and Barbie Reynolds, who are in their 70s, as they traveled to the British couple's home in central Bamiyan province. The Reynolds remain in Taliban custody, CBS News learned.",
      "Sources told CBS News that Hall was detained on charges of using a drone without authorization.",
      "Hall was released Thursday as part of a deal that Qatari negotiators helped broker, the source said. She was in \"good health\" after undergoing a series of medical checks.",
      "Suhail Shaheen, the Taliban's ambassador in Qatar, told CBS News that Hall was released as a \"goodwill gesture.\"",
      "\"Better for bilateral relations, that such gestures are reciprocated,\" Shaheen said. \"Actually, after (the) liberation of our country, we are in a new phase of reconstruction of Afghanistan. We want to have positive relations with (the) U.S. and other countries. This is an area which needs to be explored.\"",
      "Khalilzad posted a picture of Hall smiling with Qatar representatives ahead of her departure from Afghanistan with his announcement.",
      "CBS News has reached out to the U.S. State Department for comment.",
      "The Reynolds, who married in Kabul in 1970, have run school training programs in the country for 18 years. Hall is a friend of the Reynolds and had travelled to Afghanistan in February to visit them and help them with their education training business, a member of the Reynolds family told CBS News.",
      "The Reynolds are parents to two American citizens.",
      "Their daughter has expressed grave fears for her father's health and appealed to the Taliban authorities to free them. They remained in Afghanistan after the Taliban takeover in 2021 when the British embassy withdrew its staff.",

      "Following their visit, the Taliban government announced the release of U.S. citizen George Glezmann after a deal brokered by Qatar. Glezmann, an Atlanta native, had been in custody after being detained by Taliban authorities while on a tourist visit to Afghanistan in December 2022.",
      "The U.S. government had said Glezmaan had been wrongfully detained by the Taliban. Khalilzad called Glezmann's release \"a goodwill gesture\" to President Trump by the Taliban.",
      "Glezmann and Hall are two of several Americans to be released from Taliban custody this year.",

    "summary": "Protesters are trying to escalate a movement targeting Tesla dealerships and vehicles in opposition to Elon Musk's role in DOGE.",
    "story": [
      "Crowds protesting billionaire Elon Musk's purge of the U.S. government under President Trump began amassing outside Tesla dealerships throughout the U.S. and in some cities in Europe on Saturday in the latest attempt to dent the fortune of the world's richest man.",
      "The protesters are trying to escalate a movement targeting Tesla dealerships and vehicles in opposition to Musk's role as the head of the newly created Department of of Government Efficiency, or DOGE, where he's gained access to sensitive data and shuttered entire agencies as he attempts to slash government spending. Most of Musk's estimated $340 billion fortune consists of the stock he holds in the electric vehicle company that he continues to run while also working alongside Mr. Trump.",
      "Earlier protests have been somewhat sporadic. Saturday marked the first attempt to surround all 277 of the automaker's showrooms and service centers in the U.S. in hopes of deepening\u00a0a recent decline in the company's sales.",
      "By early afternoon, crowds ranging from a few dozen to hundreds of protesters had flocked to Tesla locations in New Jersey, Massachusetts, Connecticut, New York, Maryland, Minnesota and the automaker's home state of Texas. Pictures posted on social media accounts showed protesters brandishing signs such as\u00a0\"Honk if you hate Elon\"\u00a0and\u00a0\"Fight the billionaire broligarchy.\"",
      "The Tesla Takedown movement also hoped to rally protestors at more than 230 Tesla locations in other parts of the world. Although the turnouts in Europe weren't as large as the crowds in the U.S., the anti-Musk sentiment was similar.",
      "About two dozen protesters held signs lambasting Musk outside a Tesla dealership in London as passing cars and trucks tooted horns in support.",
      "One of the signs displayed at the London protest showed a photo of Musk next to an image of Adolf Hitler making the Nazi salute \u2014 a\u00a0gesture that Musk has been accused of reprising shortly after Mr. Trump's Jan. 20 inauguration. A person in a tyrannosaurus rex costume held another sign with a picture of Musk's straight-arm gesture that said, \"You thought the Nazis were extinct. Don't buy a Swasticar.\"",
      "\"We just want to get loud, make noise, make people aware of the problems that we're facing,\" said Cam Whitten, an American who showed up at the London protest.",
      "Tesla Takedown was organized by a group of supporters that included disillusioned owners of the automaker's vehicles, celebrities such as actor John Cusack, and at least one Democratic Party lawmaker, Rep. Jasmine Crockett from Dallas.",
      "\"I'm going to keep screaming in the halls of Congress. I just need you all to make sure you all keep screaming in the streets,\" Crockett said during a\u00a0Tesla Takedown organizing call\u00a0held earlier this month.",
      "In New York City, mayoral hopeful and New York state Rep. Zohran Mamdani joined protesters at a Tesla showroom on Saturday.",
      "\"We are here in a moment that demands all of us,\" Mandani told the crowd through a megaphone. \"It demands all of us because the richest man in the world has purchased the president of the United States.\"",
      "Some people opposed to Musk have gone beyond protests and set the automaker's vehicles on fire and committed\u00a0other acts of vandalism that U.S. Attorney General Pam Bondi has decried as \"nothing short of domestic terrorism.\" Musk indicated he was dumbfounded by the attacks during a March 20 company meeting and said the vandals should \"stop acting psycho.\"",
      "Crockett and other Tesla Takedown supporters have been stressing the importance for Saturday's protests to remain peaceful.",
      "But police were investigating a fire that destroyed seven Tesla vehicles in northwestern Germany early Saturday morning. It was wasn't immediately clear if the blaze, which was extinguished by firefighters, was related to the Tesla Takedown protests.",
      "There have been vandalisms at Tesla dealerships acrossing the U.S., including fires in Nevada and Missouri, and graffiti at locations in Massachusetts and Maryland, CBS News previously reported.",
      "Since January 2025, incidents targeting Tesla EVs have occurred in at least nine states, according to a joint intelligence bulletin issued by the Department of Homeland Security and FBI and obtained by CBS News.\u00a0Although U.S. intelligence suggests lone actors are behind them, Trump administration officials are promising to crack down on what they say are coordinated attacks.",
      "There have also been reports of vandalism to parked Teslas, making individual owners nervous.",
      "\"My wife cautions me, 'Be careful where you are at with it,'\" Bill Fonte told CBS New York. \"If you don't like the product, don't buy it. But they're going above and beyond, creating panic and concern for normal people like me.\"",
      "A growing number of consumers who bought Tesla vehicles before Musk took over DOGE have been looking to sell or trade in their cars while others have slapped on bumper stickers seeking to distance themselves from the billionaire's efforts to prune or shut down government agencies.",
      "But Musk didn't appear concerned about an extended slump in sales of new Tesla cars in his March 20 address to employees. He reassured the workers that the company's Model Y, which is undergoing a refresh, would remain \"the best-selling car on Earth again this year.\" He also predicted Tesla will have sold more than 10 million cars worldwide by next year, up from about 7 million cars now.",
      "\"There are times when there are rocky moments, where there is stormy weather, but what I am here to tell you is that the future is incredibly bright and exciting,\" Musk said.",
      "After Mr. Trump was elected last November, investors initially saw Musk's alliance with the president as a positive development for Tesla and its long-running efforts to launch\u00a0a network of self-driving cars.",
      "That optimism helped lift Tesla's stock by 70% in the period between Mr. Trump's Nov. 5 election and his Jan. 20 inauguration, creating an additional $560 billion in shareholder wealth. But virtually all those gains have evaporated amid investor worries about the Tesla backlash, lagging sales in the U.S., Europe and China, and Musk spending time overseeing DOGE.",
      "\"This continues to be a moment of truth for Musk to navigate this brand tornado crisis moment and get onto the other side of this dark chapter for Tesla,\" Wedbush Securities analyst Dan Ives said in a research note leading up to Saturday's protests.",

      "Wisconsin's Democratic attorney general asked a court on Friday to block billionaire\u00a0Elon Musk from handing out $1 million checks to voters this weekend, just two days before the state's\u00a0hotly contested Supreme Court race was to be decided.",
      "Attorney General Josh Kaul filed the lawsuit in Dane County Circuit Court to stop Musk from making the payments, which he said he would make Sunday in Wisconsin. Musk initially said in a post on his social media platform, X, that he planned to \"personally hand over\" $2 million to a pair of voters who have already cast their ballots in the race.",
      "Musk later posted a clarification, saying the money will go to people who will be \"spokesmen\" for an online petition against \"activist\" judges. After first saying the event would only be open to people who had voted in the Supreme Court race, he said attendance would be limited to those who have signed the petition.",
      "Also on Friday, Musk's political action committee identified the recipient of its first $1 million giveaway \u2014 a Green Bay man who had donated to the Wisconsin GOP and the conservative candidate in the court race, and who has a history of posting support for President Donald Trump and his agenda.",
      "Musk deleted the post from his social media platform, X, about 12 hours after he initially posted it late Thursday night. He issued the clarification about an hour later.",
      "He had posted that he planned to give $1 million each to two voters at the event on Sunday, just two days before the election\u00a0that will determine ideological control of the court\u00a0in the battleground state.",
      "\"I will also personally hand over two checks for a million dollars each in appreciation for you taking the time to vote,\" Musk's now-deleted post said. \"This is super important.\"",

      "Trump, a Republican, endorsed Brad Schimel and hosted a telephone town hall with him on Thursday night.",

      "Schimel, a Waukesha County judge, faces Dane County Judge Susan Crawford in Tuesday's election. Crawford is backed by a wide range of Democrats, including the liberal justices who hold a 4-3 majority on the Wisconsin Supreme Court and former President Barack Obama. The retirement this year of a liberal justice puts majority control of the court in play.",
      "Musk's political action committee said Friday that it had awarded $1 million to Scott Ainsworth, a mechanical engineer from Green Bay, for signing its petition protesting against \"activist\" judges. In a video posted on X, Ainsworth encouraged people to sign the petition and \"get out and vote early for Brad Schimel.\"",
      "\"If everyone in the MAGA movement shows up and votes for Brad Schimel, we will win,\" Ainsworth said in the video.",
      "Ainsworth donated $350 to Schimel's campaign this year, campaign finance records show.",
      "Andrew Romeo, a spokesperson for Musk's political action committee, declined to say whether Ainsworth was one of the two who would be receiving $1 million on Sunday.",
      "Musk promised $100 to any registered Wisconsin voter\u00a0who signed the petition or forwarded it to someone who did.",
      "That raised questions about whether the petition violated Wisconsin law that makes it a felony to offer, give, lend or promise to lend or give anything of value to induce a voter to cast a ballot or not vote.",
      "Any legal challenge to Musk's payments could end up before the Wisconsin Supreme Court.",
      "A bipartisan coalition of government watchdog groups and former office holders, along with a liberal Madison law firm, asked the Wisconsin attorney general and the Milwaukee County district attorney to investigate the $1 million payment and the offer of $100 for signing the petition.",
      "The group, in its letter sent Thursday night, said the payments appear to violate the state law against election bribery.",
      "Attorney General Josh Kaul and Milwaukee County District Attorney Kent Lovern did not immediately return messages Friday seeking comment.",
      "Schimel, a former attorney general, was asked about the petition on Thursday by WISN-TV.",
      "\"I, frankly, thought, 'Should I sign that petition? I'm against activist judges, but I don't think I should do that,'\" Schimel said.",
      "When asked about the $1 million award, Schimel said, \"I don't know what the criteria to get it was.\"",
      "Crawford's campaign spokesperson Derrick Honeyman, called Musk's announced visit to Wisconsin a \"last-minute desperate distraction.\"",
      "\"Wisconsinites don't want a billionaire like Musk telling them who to vote for, and, on Tuesday, voters should reject Musk's lackey Brad Schimel,\" he said.",
      "Musk's political action committee used a nearly identical tactic before the White House election last year, offering to pay $1 million a day to voters in Wisconsin and six other battleground states\u00a0who signed a petition supporting the First and Second Amendments.",
      "During last year's presidential race, Philadelphia's district attorney sued in an attempt to stop the payments under Pennsylvania law. But a judge said prosecutors failed to show the effort was an illegal lottery and allowed it to continue through Election Day.",
      "Musk and groups he funds have already spent more than $20 million in an effort to elect Schimel, while billionaire George Soros has given $2 million to bolster Crawford, and Democratic Illinois Gov. JB Pritzker has donated $1.5 million.",
      "Musk got involved in the race just days after his electric car company, Tesla, filed a lawsuit against Wisconsin in an effort to open dealerships in the state.",
      "Crawford and her allies have accused Musk of trying to buy influence on the court given that Tesla's lawsuit could end up before the justices.",
      "The race comes as the Wisconsin Supreme Court is also expected to rule on abortion rights, congressional redistricting, union power and voting rules that could affect the 2026 midterms and the 2028 presidential election.",
      "Wisconsin is one of a handful of true battleground states, which only intensifies the focus on court races where rules for voting will be decided. Trump won Wisconsin in 2016 and 2024 by less than a percentage point, but he lost it in 2020 by a similar margin. Five of the past seven presidential elections in the state have been decided by less than a percentage point.",
      "More than $81 million has been spent on the Supreme Court race so far, obliterating the record for a judicial race in the U.S. of $51 million set in Wisconsin just two years ago, according to Brennan Center tallies.",

      "Update: A judge in Washington, D.C., issued a temporary restraining order on Friday, March 28, blocking the Trump administration's executive order against the law firm Jenner & Block.",
      "President Trump issued an executive order Tuesday targeting Chicago law firm Jenner & Block. The firm also has an office in Washington, D.C.",
      "Jenner & Block has been an active part of the legal challenges against Mr. Trump's executive orders, including successfully securing a preliminary injunction against an order from the administration that reduced health care access for transgender youth.",
      "That case is still pending in a Maryland-based federal court.",
      "This executive order instructs officials to review and revoke firm members' security clearance, identify any good, property, material and services provided by the federal government and stop providing them, terminate any government contracts that may exist with the law firm, and not hire any employees of the firm for any future federal government jobs.",
      "The order also singles out attorney Andrew Weissman, who worked on Robert Mueller's investigation into Russian interference in the 2016 election. The executive order says he was re-hired at Jenner & Block, but the firm clarified that Weissman hasn't worked there since 2021.",
      "The executive order specifies that Weissman is prohibited from being hired by or working for the federal government unless a waiver is issued.",
      "The Trump administration has targeted a number of law firms that have been active in challenging or pausing executive orders and policies in the courts.",
      "Previously, the president issued and then rescinded an executive order targeting international law firm Paul, Weiss, Rifkind, Garrison & Wharton after it pledged to review its hiring practices and provide tens of millions of dollars in free legal services to support certain White House initiatives.",
      "A spokesperson for Jenner & Block responded to the order in a statement, writing in part, \"Today, we have been named in an Executive Order similar to one which has already been declared unconstitutional by a federal court. We remain focused on serving and safeguarding our clients' interests with the dedication, integrity, and expertise that has defined our firm for more than one hundred years and will pursue all appropriate remedies.\"",

    "summary": "President Trump has issued executive orders targeting law firms that have employed his purported political opponents.",
    "story": [
      "Washington \u2014 President Trump announced Friday that the law firm Skadden, Arps, Slate, Meagher and Flom agreed to provide more than $100 million in pro bono work for initiatives backed by his administration.",
      "The agreement makes Skadden Arps the second major firm to reach a deal with Mr. Trump amid a recent blitz of executive orders targeting law firms that have employed his purported political opponents. The orders issued by the president have focused on the firms Perkins Coie, Jenner & Block, and Wilmer Cutler Pickering Hale and Dorr, known as WilmerHale.",
      "All three of those firms have filed federal lawsuits challenging the executive orders as a violation of the First Amendment. A federal judge in Washington blocked parts of Mr. Trump's executive order against Perkins Coie earlier this month, and on Friday, two separate judges issued temporary restraining orders halting the president's actions against Jenner & Block and WilmerHale.",
      "While Mr. Trump earlier in the month issued an order going after a fourth firm, Paul, Weiss, it was rescinded after the international firm agreed to provide $40 million in free legal services to support causes backed by the administration.",
      "The president said in a statement posted to Truth Social that in addition to providing $100 million in pro bono work, the firm will not engage in \"illegal DEI discrimination and preferences\" and work with an outside counsel to advise it on employment practices.",
      "Mr. Trump also said Skadden Arps \"will not deny representation to clients, such as members of politically disenfranchised groups, who have not historically received legal representation from major National Law Firms, including in pro bono matters, and in support of non-profits, because of the personal political views of individual lawyers.\"",
      "The White House said Skadden Arps approached the administration \"and declared the Firm's strong commitment to ending the Weaponization of the Justice System and the Legal Profession.\"",
      "Jeremy London, the firm's executive partner, said in a statement distributed by Mr. Trump that it is \"pleased to have achieved a successful agreement with President Trump and his Administration. We engaged proactively with the President and his team in working together constructively to reach this agreement. The Firm looks forward to continuing our productive relationship with President Trump and his Administration. We firmly believe that this outcome is in the best interests of our clients, our people, and our Firm.\"",
      "The executive orders targeting the law firms are among a number of actions taken by Mr. Trump since he returned to the White House that have gone after his perceived enemies. He revoked the security clearances of former Vice President Kamala Harris, former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton and other top Biden administration officials, as well as others who have been critical of him, last week. Mr. Trump also pulled the security details for Dr. Anthony Fauci and retired Gen. Mark Milley, who was chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff during the Trump and Biden administrations.",
      "Executive orders targeting major law firms",
      "The law firm-related orders take issue with the work they have performed and the lawyers previously on their payrolls. In the directive targeting Perkins Coie, Mr. Trump attacked the firm for representing Clinton during her 2016 presidential campaign and hiring a research firm that retained a former British spy, Christopher Steele, who\u00a0produced the infamous \"Steele Dossier.\"",
      "The president's order attacking Jenner & Block singles out the firm for hiring Andrew Weissmann, who worked with former special counsel Robert Mueller on his investigation into Russia's efforts to influence the 2016 presidential election. Weissmann left the firm in 2021. It also took issue with Jenner & Block's work on a challenge to Mr. Trump's executive order that seeks to strip federal funds from medical institutions that provide gender-affirming care to minors, among other lawsuits.",
      "In a ruling late Friday, Judge John D. Bates, an appointee of President George W. Bush, issued an order temporarily blocking the action, saying it likely violates the First, Fifth and Sixth Amendments. The judge called Mr. Trump's executive order \"disturbing\" and \"troubling\" on the grounds that it attacks pro bono practice.",
      "\"The court does not take lightly the power to enjoin the executive branch, but the government has not made any persuasive case that the public interest will be harmed\" by halting enforcement, he said.",
      "Mr. Trump's latest executive order, which targets WilmerHale, accused the firm of weaponizing the justice system by employing Mueller and two others who worked on his investigation, James Quarles and Aaron Zebley. Mueller left WilmerHale more than three years ago, according to the firm, and Quarles is retired. Zebley is a partner at WilmerHale.",
      "In his ruling Friday night temporarily blocking\u00a0portions of Mr. Trump's executive order, U.S. District Judge Richard Leon wrote: \"There is no doubt this retaliatory action chills speech and legal advocacy, or that it qualifies as a constitutional harm.\"",
      "Leon said WilmerHale \"faces more than economic harm\" from the executive order, \"it faces crippling losses and its very survival is at stake.\" He wrote that the injuries to the firm from the order \"would be so severe and would spill over to its clients and the justice system at large. The public interest demands protecting against harms of this magnitude.\"",
      "His temporary restraining order stops the Trump administration from requiring government contracting agencies to terminate all contracts with WilmerHale, and stops the administration from restricting WilmerHale employees' access to federal buildings and officials.",
      "The executive orders directed agency heads to suspend any active security clearances held by employees of three firms and require federal contractors to disclose any business with WilmerHale, Jenner & Block and Perkins Coie. The administration is also directed to review all contracts with the firms or with entities that disclose doing business with them.",
      "The fallout from the executive orders has been swift. In a declaration filed with the court, Thomas Perrelli, firm chair and a partner at Jenner & Block, warned that if allowed to take the effect, the restrictions laid out in Mr. Trump's order would be \"devastating and irreparable.\"",
      "According to Perrelli, one client has already informed Jenner & Block that the Justice Department notified them that they cannot bring their lawyers from the firm to a department meeting set for April 3. That client, Perrelli wrote, will need to attend the meeting without their outside representation or hire new counsel before it.",
      "Some Jenner & Block clients are also worried the firm cannot represent them in federal court or go into government buildings to engage with regulatory agencies or government officials, he said. Within 24 hours of Mr. Trump's order, Perrelli said several clients expressed concerns about the firm's representation because they were unsure whether Jenner & Block lawyers could enter federal buildings and courthouses, negotiate with government officials or participate in meetings with the Justice Department.",
      "As to the order's provisions targeting government contractors with a relationship with Jenner & Block, Perrelli said 40% of the firm's revenue came from clients who have federal contracts or subcontracts.",
      "\"If we lost that business, or even a portion of it, it would be a serious threat to the firm's financial health,\" Perrelli wrote.",

      "Kansas health officials have confirmed 23 measles cases, marking an outbreak for the state as infections in at least 17 states have led to the most cases in the U.S. in a single year since 2019.",
      "The Kansas outbreak is spread across 6 southwest counties, the state's\u00a0Department of Health and Environment\u00a0said Wednesday.",
      "The majority of cases, 20, are individuals who were not vaccinated against the infection. Fifteen cases are in school-aged children, between ages 5 and 17, six patients are 4 years old or younger and two are over 18, officials said.",
      "Health officials in Ohio have also\u00a0reported 10 cases this week.",
      "\"Given the measles activity in Texas, New Mexico, and other states around the country, we're disappointed but not surprised we now have several cases here in Ohio and known exposure in some counties,\" Ohio Department of Health Director Dr. Bruce Vanderhoff said in a news release Tuesday.",

      "While most people's symptoms improve, about 1 in 5 unvaccinated people who get measles will be hospitalized. About 1 out of every 1,000 children with measles will develop brain swelling that can lead to brain damage, and up to 3 of every 1,000 children who become infected will die, the CDC says.",
      "So far, no cases in Kansas have led to hospitalization or death, according to the data from the state's health department.",
      "The Kansas cases come as other states are facing rising infections too. The majority of the cases have been reported in an outbreak in Texas that has sickened more than 400 people since late January and has caused the death of a child. An adult with measles also\u00a0died in New Mexico.",

    "story": [
      "Washington \u2014 Vice President JD Vance\u00a0said Friday during a day trip to a U.S. base in Greenland that the Trump administration doesn't think that \"military force is ever going to be necessary\" there, the same day President Trump said, \"We have to have Greenland.\"",
      "Vance visited the Pituffik Space Base, the northernmost U.S. military installation, along with second lady Usha Vance, national security adviser Mike Waltz, Secretary of Energy Chris Wright and Sen. Mike Lee of Utah. While there, the vice president blasted Denmark for its handling of the island, as the Trump White House eyes the semi-autonomous Danish territory despite opposition from residents and leaders. While Vance was there, President Trump reiterated his strong desire to acquire the island.",
      "\"We need Greenland, very importantly, for international security,\" the president told reporters at the White House. \"We have to have Greenland. It's not a question of, 'Do you think we can do without it?' We can't.\"",
      "Mr. Trump hasn't ruled out military force in Greenland, while Vance on Friday said he believes the people of Greenland will seek independence from Denmark. A reporter asked Vance if his message is consistent with the president's. Vance said the president wants more of a U.S. presence in Greenland, but \"the president has said clearly he doesn't think that military force is going to be necessary.\"",
      "\"What we think is going to happen is that the Greenlanders are going to choose through self-determination to become independent of Denmark, and then we're going to have conversations with the people of Greenland from there,\" Vance said. \"So I think talking about anything too far in the future is way too premature. We do not think that military force is ever going to be necessary. We think this makes sense. And because we think the people of Greenland are rational and good, we think we're going to be able to cut a deal, Donald Trump style, to ensure the security of this territory but also the United States of America.\"",
      "Vance said his trip to the base helped him see up close how critical Greenland is for U.S. national security. If an enemy fired a missile on the U.S., it would be the American soldiers at the Greenland base who would alert their countrymen, he said. Vance said the U.S. knows Russia and China are taking serious interest in the Arctic, and the U.S. needs to make sure it's leading in the Arctic. But while Vance recognized Denmark has been an important security partner in the past, he launched into criticisms of the European country, saying the U.S. base in Greenland is less secure than it was decades ago because of Denmark's stewardship.",
      "\"There is no amount of bullying, no amount of obfuscating, no amount of confusing the issue,\" Vance said. \"Our message to Denmark is very simple: You have not done a good job by the people of Greenland, you have underinvested in the people of Greenland, and you have underinvested in the security architecture of this incredible, beautiful landmass filled with incredible people. That has to change. And because it hasn't changed, that's why President Trump's policy in Greenland is what it is.\"",
      "The second lady was originally scheduled to visit Greenland in an expanded cultural trip this week, and then the vice president\u00a0announced\u00a0Tuesday that he would be joining her for a shorter trip that was more focused on U.S. policy and defense.",
      "Vance also thanked soldiers on the base, who are there for a year at a time and can't bring their families with them.",
      "\"I know it's a lot of sacrifice to spend a year away from your families, but the mission is really important,\" Vance said. \"The Trump administration, the president, is really interested in Arctic security. As you all know, that's a big issue, and it's only going to get bigger over the coming decade, so thanks for doing what you do.\"",
      "Waltz told the soldiers they're carrying a \"tradition\" of U.S. soldiers in Greenland, and said the president is very serious about Arctic security.",
      "A statement earlier this week by the vice president's office that announced Vance would join his wife on the trip emphasized Greenland's role in U.S. national security.",
      "\"During World War II, the United States established over a dozen military bases in Greenland to defend the North Atlantic from Nazi incursion,\" the statement said. \"During the Cold War, the United States committed additional resources to Greenland to defend against Soviet missile attacks.\"",
      "The statement went on to criticize Denmark, claiming, \"In the decades since, neglect and inaction from Danish leaders and past U.S. administrations have presented our adversaries with the opportunity to advance their own priorities in Greenland and the Arctic. President Trump is rightly changing course.\"",
      "Mr. Trump hasn't given up on the idea of absorbing Greenland into the U.S., despite opposition from Greenland's leadership and people. Greenland is an expansive island to the north and east of Canada that's a semi-autonomous territory of Denmark. It's roughly three times the size of Texas, but mostly covered by ice. Most of its roughly 57,000 people \u2014 a population smaller than Carson City, Nevada \u2014 live along Greenland's southern coast.",
      "A\u00a0recent poll shows 85% of Greenlanders do not want to be part of the United States, and residents who spoke with CBS News ahead of Vance's visit to a remote U.S. installation on the island \u2014 America's furthest north military base \u2014 clearly reflected the sentiments shown in that poll.",
      "\"He can't just take it like that,\" said Daniel Rosing, a trainee electrician who said he was proud of being a Greenlander.",
      "And Greenland's prime minister, M\u00fate Bourup Egede,\u00a0has called the planned visits from U.S. officials \"aggressive.\" And Mette Frederiksen, the Danish prime minister, said the U.S. is putting \"unacceptable pressure\" on Greenland.",
      "Despite this opposition, Mr. Trump said earlier this month in a speech before the joint session of Congress that he had \"a message tonight for the incredible people of Greenland: We strongly support your right to determine your own future, and if you choose, we welcome you into the United States of America.\"",
      "Mr. Trump said the territory is important to U.S. national security and that his administration is \"working with everybody involved to try and get it.\"",
      "\"And I think we're going to get it, one way or the other,\" Mr. Trump said. \"We're going to get it. We will keep you safe, we will make you rich, and together, we will take Greenland to heights like you have never thought possible before. It's a very small population, but very, very large piece of land, and very, very important for military security.\"",

      "Palace Resorts, a Florida-based company that owns multiple resorts and properties in Mexico, shared documents with CBS News Detroit detailing the reasons behind its decision to pursue criminal fraud charges against the couple.",
      "In a statement, the company says, \"Between 2016 and 2021, the Akeos knowingly and willingly entered into 19 separate membership agreements with Palace Elite, investing over $1.4 million USD in exchange for exclusive benefits and rates intended strictly for personal use.\"",
      "A nearly 50-page contract shows the money Paul and Christy Akeos paid and the guidelines the couple was expected to follow when using the properties.",
      "Their attorney, John Manly, says the decision to pursue criminal charges is overblown.",
      "\"This is just a bunch of lies and I think what the documents illustrate is this is a civil dispute,\" Manly said. \"We don't put people in prison in this country or in Mexico for breach of contract. This is a timeshare, not a crime share,\" said Manly.",
      "Palace says the Akeos were found to be in \"material breach\" of the agreements in 2021 and alleges that the couple promoted and profited from their benefits on social media, which the company says is explicitly prohibited under the terms of the contract.",
      "\"Last time I looked, we had the First Amendment, we had free speech,\" said Manly.",
      "Palace claims they notified Akeos of the violation and sent the couple a waiver they signed in April 2022. In it, they acknowledge what they did and agree to refrain from posting any future comments about the company. Palace claims the Akeos then began disputing their membership charges with their credit card companies, getting more than $100,000 in reversed fees.",
      "In Facebook posts shared with CBS News Detroit, the company alleges the Akeos bragged about these chargebacks and encouraged others to follow suit. That's when attorneys for Palace sent a cease-and-desist letter accusing the couple of providing \"specific instructions to current palace elite members on how to purportedly 'terminate' their respective membership agreement using illegal and fraudulent means.\"",
      "That led Palace to file a criminal complaint against the couple in August 2023.",
      "\"I'm sorry, if you use inflammatory language about your hotel or your vacation timeshare in Mexico, you go to jail? Really? That's their complaint? These people have no business being in prison anywhere. This is a contract dispute,\" said Manly.",
      "Manly says Palace recently offered the Akeos a settlement if the couple paid $250,000, signed a non-disclosure agreement, helped take down the Facebook group, and publicly apologized.",
      "The family declined, calling it extortion.",
      "\"But more importantly, Palace could say, 'Oh, you violated this. You've committed fraud. We're putting a red notice out on you. We're going to charge you with a crime,' and they'd be right back in prison in Mexico. They can't sign it, and they're not going to sign it,\" said Manly.",
      "Manly says the couple is still fighting the recent order by a Mexican court that gave Palace Resorts six more months to gather evidence and denied the Akeos' request for house arrest, ordering them to remain in jail until then.",

    "summary": "A federal judge has blocked the mass firings of employees at the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau.",
    "story": [
      "U.S. District Judge Amy Berman Jackson issued a preliminary injunction Friday that blocks the Trump administration from dismantling the Consumer Protection Financial Bureau.",
      "\"The court cannot look away or the CFPB will be dissolved and dismantled completely in approximately thirty days, well before this lawsuit has come to its conclusion,\" she wrote in a 112-page decision.",
      "Her order keeps the CFPB in existence until the case has been resolved on the merits. It also reinstates the agency's contracts, workforce, data and operational capacity.",
      "Jackson ruled that, without a court order, President Trump's administration would move quickly to shut down the agency that Congress created in the wake of the 2008 financial crisis.",
      "\"If the defendants are not enjoined, they will eliminate the agency before the Court has the opportunity to decide whether the law permits them to do it, and as the defendants' own witness warned, the harm will be irreparable,\" Berman Jackson said in her order.",
      "During a March 10 hearing, Jackson heard testimony about the chaos that erupted inside the agency after government employees were ordered to stop working last month. The bureau's chief operating officer, Adam Martinez, said the agency was in \"wind-down mode\" after Trump fired its previous director, Rohit Chopra, on Feb. 1.",
      "Trump installed a temporary replacement who ordered the immediate suspension of all agency operations, cancelled $100 million in contracts and fired 70 employees.",
      "Martinez said the agency's current leaders have adopted a more methodical approach than they initially did last month, when representatives of Elon Musk's Department of Government Efficiency arrived at its Washington headquarters.",
      "CFPB is responsible for protecting consumers from financial fraud and deceptive practices. It processes consumer complaints and examines banks to protect student loan borrowers.",
      "The National Treasury Employees Union, which represents more than 1,000 workers at the bureau, sued on Feb. 9 to block mass firings. Plaintiffs' attorneys argue that the administration doesn't have the constitutional authority to eliminate an agency that Congress created by statute.",
      "\"The defendants' unlawful action will have immediate consequences for the Americans that the CFPB was designed by Congress to protect,\"\u00a0the lawyers wrote.",
      "Government lawyers have said the plaintiffs are seeking to impermissibly place the CFPB in a \"judicially managed receivership,\" with the court overseeing its day-to-day operations.",
      "Jackson started her 112-page ruling by quoting Mr. Trump and his allies' own words about the bureau. Trump's billionaire adviser, Elon Musk, posted \"CFPB RIP\" on X, his social media platform, and added an emoji of a tombstone. White House budget director Russell Vought said it has been \"a woke and weaponized agency against disfavored industries and individuals for a long time.\" Mr. Trump called it \"a very important thing to get rid of.\"",
      "Among the plaintiffs was 83-year-old Eva Steege, a Lutheran pastor in hospice care who had been working with CFPB to resolve her student loan debt before her death. The agency found she qualified for loan forgiveness and a $15,000 refund of overpayments, but the stop-work order went into effect before she could have a follow-up meeting and the official she was working with was fired.",
      "\"Steege's fear of leaving her surviving family members saddled with her student loan debt came to pass on March 15, when she died,\" the judge wrote.",

      "Flight bookings between Canada and the U.S. are plunging amid rising trade tensions between the two allied nations.",
      "Demand, measured by passenger bookings on flights between Canada and the U.S., has \"collapsed,\" falling 70% compared to the same period last year, according to a March 26\u00a0report\u00a0from OAG aviation, a flight analytics company.",
      "Visits from Canada to the U.S. account for the sharpest projected decline in travel this year, with analysts pointing to President Trump's plan to slap tariffs on Canadian imports as causing some Canadians to hold off on traveling to the U.S.",
      "\"This sharp drop suggests that travellers are holding off on making reservations, likely due to ongoing uncertainty surrounding the broader trade dispute,\" the report states.",
      "Mr. Trump has delayed 25% tariffs on Canadian and Mexican imports until April 2, but economists say the import duties could have detrimental effects on their economies given their deep reliance on the U.S. The drop in airline demand reflects \"a degradation of travel demand between the two countries, especially coming from the Canadian side,\" Scott Keyes, founder of Going.com, a flight deals website, told CBS MoneyWatch.",
      "As Mr. Trump promotes an \"America First\" trade policy, Canadians are similarly focusing on spending their dollars domestically, following former Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau's please last month for residents to \"choose Canada,\" former Canadian Member of Parliament Dr. Ruby Dhalla told CBS MoneyWatch.",
      "\"Instead of traveling to the U.S., we are seeing families travel visiting cities, towns and villages and exploring Canada's history and heritage,\" Dhalla said.",

      "The most significant airline capacity cuts are scheduled for July and August, during the peak travel summer period. Airlines cut more than 320,000 seats worth of flight capacity from March through October between the two countries, according to the OAG report.",
      "Weaker-than-usual demand could lead to deals on airfare for passengers who still plan to travel from Canada to the U.S., OAG said.",
      "\"For those that are still planning to travel there may be some airlines offering particularly cheap airfares over the next few months as they seek to stimulate demand but for the airlines it will be a nervous few months, especially as the traditional 'snowbird' market from Canada to the U.S. could be badly impacted next year if the situation doesn't improve quickly,\" the report states.",
      "Slashing routes to the U.S.",
      "Canadian airlines are expected to be hit harder than their American counterparts because the nation's residents are driving the downward trend, experts say. Americans typically prefer to fly American airlines because they might have loyalty accounts with a carrier, for example.",
      "Flair Airlines, a budget airline based in Canada, said last week it is cutting flights from Toronto to Nashville, as well as from Calgary to Las Vegas and Edmonton to Las Vegas.",
      "\"These are thee types of routes they are not confident in being able to sell at a rate that would make it profitable, so they are re-allocating some of the lax capacity elsewhere,\" Keyes said.",

    "published": "Fri, 28 Mar 2025 16:23:24 -0400",
    "summary": "These automakers are the most and least exposed to President Trump's sweeping tariffs on automobiles.",
    "story": [
      "The Trump administration's 25% tariffs on vehicles and auto parts imported into the U.S. could lead to sticker shock for American consumers, including for those buying cars manufactured domestically, analysts say.",
      "Few vehicle manufacturers will be spared by the fresh levies, which are aimed at revitalizing domestic automobile manufacturing. Industry analysts say the tax will surely raise car prices in the U.S. and squeeze some would-be car buyers out of the market.",
      "Some manufacturers could move a share of production to the U.S., but it would come \"at the expense of reduced competition, higher prices, and significantly lower production in the U.S.'s main trading partners,\" Oxford Economics analyst Abby Stamp said in a research note.",
      "The automobile supply chain is highly complex and intertwined with the economies of Mexico and Canada, from which American brands source finished vehicles and parts. Mr. Trump's tariff on passenger cars and light trucks imported into the U.S. will go into effect April 3, according to the executive order, and a 25% tariff on auto parts shipped from foreign countries goes into effect \"no later than May 3.\"",
      "While all car manufacturers will be impacted by the new tariffs, according to analysts, some will be hit much harder than others.",
      "Tesla",
      "Tesla CEO Elon Musk, a close ally of Mr. Trump, posted on X Wednesday that the new tariffs would affect the company's American-made electric vehicles.",
      "\"Important to note that Tesla is NOT unscathed here. The tariff impact on Tesla is still significant,\" Musk wrote on X Wednesday. \"To be clear, this will affect the price of parts in Tesla cars that come from other countries. The cost impact is not trivial,\" he wrote in a later post.",
      "That said, Tesla is expected to be among the automakers that are least affected by the tariffs, given that its vehicles are made in the U.S., and most of their parts are sourced domestically, too. The EV brand does, however, rely on China for some batteries, \"so the tariffs will have an impact,\" Art Wheaton, a transportation industry expert and director of labor studies at Cornell's School of Industrial and Labor Relations, told CBS MoneyWatch.",
      "Tesla rival Rivian could also be spared for similar reasons, according to UBS.",
      "\"We believe TSLA and RIVN could fare better as 100% of their production is in the U.S. (though not all components),\" UBS analysts said in a research note.",
      "General Motors",
      "General Motors, one of the so-called Big Three automakers, along with Stellantis and Ford, is widely expected to be the most exposed to the forthcoming auto tariffs. Headquartered in Detroit, the U.S. car company makes just 45% of vehicles it sells to U.S. customers domestically, leaving 55% of its lineup exposed to tariffs, according to Cox Automotive.",
      "GM, which makes Chevrolet, Buick, GMC and Cadillac vehicles, is heavily invested in Mexico and Canada, where it builds heavy-duty vehicles, according to Cornell's Wheaton.",
      "Stellantis",
      "Stellantis, whose brands include Jeep, Chrysler, Dodge and Ram, among others, is similarly susceptible to rising costs from the tariffs, as it makes between 73%-75% of vehicles for sale in the U.S. stateside, according to Cox Automotive.",
      "That means, a $80,000 RAM truck from Stellantis could cost $100,000 once it reaches the U.S., under the new policy.",
      "\"The impact is quite large,\" Wheaton said.",
      "Ford",
      "Ford is among the car companies better positioned to weather the tariffs, according to Cox Automotive analyst Erin Keating, as 80% of its vehicles are manufactured in the U.S. and therefore would not be subject to the 25% tariff on passenger cars. However, any imported parts used in Ford's U.S.-manufactured vehicles could be tariffed at 25%.",
      "Ford vehicles made in the U.S. include the F-150 pickup truck lineup. Some of its smaller vehicles, including the Maverick pickup truck and Bronco Sport SUV are made in Mexico and \"will take a hit,\" said Wheaton.",
      "While domestic automakers will face increased costs, it's unclear how much of the tax they'll pass along to consumers. The\u00a0Wall Street Journal,\u00a0reported that Mr. Trump warned the CEOs of the Big Three not to raise car prices because of tariffs, according to people familiar with the matter.",
      "Toyota and Honda",
      "Japanese automakers Toyota and Honda export a large number of vehicles and auto parts from Japan to the U.S., which represents a sizable market for the companies. Both also operate big plants in Canada, Wheaten noted, leaving them particularly vulnerable to added costs from new tariffs.",
      "The same goes for South Korean automakers Hyundai and Kia.",
      "BMW and Volkswagen",
      "German automakers, including BMW and Volkswagen, which makes Audi vehicles, both operate big plants in Mexico.",
      "The May 3 auto-parts tariff will likely apply to engines and transmission systems, and hit the company \"heavily,\" according to Wheaton.",
      "BMW, for instance, makes a lot of engines in Germany, which it then ships to South Carolina, where the automaker manufactures SUVs. The company could be hit \"heavily,\" by the auto-parts tariffs, according to Wheaton.",
      "Mercedes-Benz operates similarly, sending engines and transmission from Germany to a plant in Alabama, where the company manufactures SUVs. The 25% auto tariffs would also likely apply to fully assembled Mercedes vehicles shipped to the U.S.",
      "\"I don't think any brands will be spared, because none are 100% in the U.S.,\" Wheaton said. \"They all have products from Canada, Mexico or elsewhere. And even Tesla, which is the most American, still has non-U.S. content in their vehicles.\"",
      "Tariffs could spark affordability issues",
      "Even vehicles whose parts aren't subject to tariffs and that are assembled in the U.S. could face price hikes, as automakers attempt to spread new costs out across their lineups. While Cox Automotive expects price hikes of between 15%-20% on vehicles that are caught in the tariffs' crosshairs, those that are exempt could still go up by about 5%, Keating noted.",
      "The auto tariffs could ignite new affordability challenges for consumers by moving lower-cost vehicles closer to, or in some cases over the $30,000 threshold.",
      "Take, for example, a Hyundai Venue, a subcompact crossover SUV, with an average current list price of $24,000. Under Mr. Trump's auto tariffs, that price could rise to about $28,500, adding more than $4,000 to an affordable design.",
      "\"Sub- $30,000 compact SUVs and crossovers that are the most popular are almost all foreign-made, with the exception of one or two,\" Keating said. \"So they'd all be subjected to the 25% tariffs.\"",
      "At the other end of the economic spectrum, luxury Italian car maker Ferrari on Thursday said it would hike prices on certain car models by 10% after April 1, citing Mr. Trump's auto tariffs. The vehicles subject to price increase include the Ferrari 296, SF90 and Roma, which already retail for hundreds of thousands of dollars each.",

      "Washington \u2014 A federal appeals court in Washington, D.C., cleared the way for President Trump to fire members of the National Labor Relations Board and Merit Systems Protection Board after district courts had earlier blocked their removals and ordered them reinstated.",
      "A three-judge panel of judges on the U.S. Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit divided 2-1 in agreeing to halt the lower court orders that voided Mr. Trump's firings of Gwynne Wilcox from the National Labor Relations Board and Cathy Harris from the Merit Systems Protection Board while legal proceedings move forward.",
      "Wilcox and Harris had argued that their firings violated federal laws that limited their removals only for neglect of duty or malfeasance in office. The Trump administration, meanwhile, defended the terminations and said the restrictions on the president's ability to remove the officials are unconstitutional.",
      "\"The people elected the president to enforce the nation's laws, and a stay serves that purpose by allowing the people's chosen officer to control the executive branch,\" Judge Justin Walker, who was appointed by Mr. Trump in his first term, wrote in an opinion siding with the administration.",
      "Wilcox was nominated to the National Labor Relations Board by former President Joe Biden and confirmed by the Senate to a five-year term in September 2023. She was designated chair of the board in December 2024.",
      "Harris was selected to serve on the Merit Systems Protection Board by Biden and confirmed in 2022. She was approved by the Senate as chair last year.",
      "Soon after Mr. Trump returned to the White House for his second term, Wilcox received a letter from the president informing her that the labor board had not been operating in a manner consistent with his administration's objectives, and telling her she had been removed. In Harris' case, she received an email in early February from the White House Presidential Personnel Office that stated, \"On behalf of President Donald J. Trump, I am writing to inform you that your position on the Merit Systems Protection Board is terminated, effective immediately.\"",
      "Both officials filed lawsuits seeking reinstatement in the federal district court in Washington. District court judges separately ruled in favor of Wilcox and Harris, finding their removals were unlawful and returning them to their roles.",
      "The Trump administration appealed the decisions and asked the D.C. Circuit to put them on hold while it considered the matter.",
      "In his concurring opinion, Walker said the district court orders effectively nullify the president's power under Article II to remove executive officials.",
      "\"The people elected the president, not Harris or Wilcox, to execute the nation's laws,\" he said. \"The forcible reinstatement of a presidentially removed principal officer disenfranchises voters by hampering the president's ability to govern during the four short years the people have assigned him the solemn duty of leading the executive branch.\"",
      "Judge Patricia Millet, appointed by former President Barack Obama, dissented from the court's decision to grant a stay.",
      "\"The whole purpose of a stay is to avoid instability and turmoil. But the court's decision today creates them,\" she wrote.",
      "Millett wrote that majority's rationale \"openly calls into question\" the constitutionality of dozens of federal statutes that limit the circumstances for when an official on a multimember board can be removed, from the Federal Reserve to the National Transportation Safety Board to the Nuclear Regulatory Commission.",
      "\"I cannot join a decision that uses a hurried and preliminary first-look ruling by this court to announce a revolution in the law that the Supreme Court has expressly avoided, and to trap in legal limbo millions of employees and employers whom the law says must go to these boards for the resolution of their employment disputes,\" she said.",

    "story": [
      "The Danish foreign minister scolded the Trump administration on Saturday for its \"tone\" criticizing Denmark and Greenland during Vice President JD Vance's visit to the strategic island.",
      "Vance \u2014 joined by his wife, second lady Usha Vance, national security adviser Mike Waltz, Secretary of Energy Chris Wright and Sen. Mike Lee of Utah \u2014 on Friday visited the Pituffick Space Base, the northernmost U.S. military installation, in Greenland. The trip had been scaled back after an uproar among Greenlanders and Danges who were not consulted about the original itinerary. While there, the vice president blasted Denmark for its handling of the island, saying the U.S. base in Greenland is less secure than it was decades ago because of Denmark's stewardship.",
      "\"There is no amount of bullying, no amount of obfuscating, no amount of confusing the issue,\" Vance said. \"Our message to Denmark is very simple: You have not done a good job by the people of Greenland, you have underinvested in the people of Greenland, and you have underinvested in the security architecture of this incredible, beautiful landmass filled with incredible people. That has to change. And because it hasn't changed, that's why President Trump's policy in Greenland is what it is.\"",
      "Mr. Trump has eyed the semi-autonomous Danish territory\u00a0despite opposition from residents and leaders.",
      "On Saturday, Danish Foreign Minister Lars L\u00f8kke Rasmussen posted a video on social media scolding the Trump administration, saying his country is already investing more into Arctic security and remains open to more cooperation with the U.S.",
      "\"Many accusations and many allegations have been made. And of course, we are open to criticism,\" Rasmussen said speaking in English. \"But let me be completely honest: we do not appreciate the tone in which it is being delivered. This is not how you speak to your close allies. And I still consider Denmark and the United States to be close allies.\"",
      "Danish Prime Minister Mette Frederiksen also pushed back on Vance's claim that Denmark isn't doing enough for defense in the Arctic, calling her country \"a good and strong ally.\"",
      "Vivian Motzfeldt, Greenland's foreign minister told CBS News she wants cooperation with the U.S., not domination.",
      "\"You just don't take over. You speak and you talk. That's all politics is about,\" she said.",
      "Danish King Frederik X posted on Facebook: \"We live in an altered reality. There should be no doubt that my love for Greenland and my connectedness to the people of Greenland are intact.\"",
      "Hundreds of protesters demonstrated Saturday outside the U.S. Embassy in the Danish capital Copenhagen with some lifting signs saying, \"back off, USA\"\u00a0Danish broadcaster TV2 reported.",
      "L\u00f8kke Rasmussen, in his video, reminded viewers of the 1951 defense agreement between Denmark and the United States. Since 1945, the American military presence in Greenland has decreased from thousands of soldiers over 17 bases and installations on the island, he said, to the remote Pituffik Space Base in the northwest with some 200 soldiers today.",
      "The 1951 agreement \"offers ample opportunity for the United States to have a much stronger military presence in Greenland,\" the foreign minister said. \"If that is what you wish, then let us discuss it.\"",
      "L\u00f8kke Rasmussen added that Denmark has increased its own investment into Arctic defense. In January, Denmark announced 14.6 billion Danish kroner (US$2.1 billion) in financial commitments for Arctic security covering three new naval vessels, long-range drones and satellites.",
      "The second lady was originally scheduled to visit Greenland in an expanded cultural trip this week, and then the vice president\u00a0announced\u00a0Tuesday that he would be joining her for a shorter trip that was more focused on U.S. policy and defense.",
      "A\u00a0recent poll\u00a0shows 85% of Greenlanders do not want to be part of the United States.",

    "story": [
      "Crowds protesting billionaire Elon Musk's purge of the U.S. government under President Trump began amassing outside Tesla dealerships throughout the U.S. and in some cities in Europe on Saturday in the latest attempt to dent the fortune of the world's richest man.",
      "The protesters are trying to escalate a movement targeting Tesla dealerships and vehicles in opposition to Musk's role as the head of the newly created Department of of Government Efficiency, or DOGE, where he's gained access to sensitive data and shuttered entire agencies as he attempts to slash government spending. Most of Musk's estimated $340 billion fortune consists of the stock he holds in the electric vehicle company that he continues to run while also working alongside Mr. Trump.",
      "Earlier protests have been somewhat sporadic. Saturday marked the first attempt to surround all 277 of the automaker's showrooms and service centers in the U.S. in hopes of deepening\u00a0a recent decline in the company's sales.",
      "By early afternoon, crowds ranging from a few dozen to hundreds of protesters had flocked to Tesla locations in New Jersey, Massachusetts, Connecticut, New York, Maryland, Minnesota and the automaker's home state of Texas. Pictures posted on social media accounts showed protesters brandishing signs such as\u00a0\"Honk if you hate Elon\"\u00a0and\u00a0\"Fight the billionaire broligarchy.\"",
      "The Tesla Takedown movement also hoped to rally protestors at more than 230 Tesla locations in other parts of the world. Although the turnouts in Europe weren't as large as the crowds in the U.S., the anti-Musk sentiment was similar.",
      "About two dozen protesters held signs lambasting Musk outside a Tesla dealership in London as passing cars and trucks tooted horns in support.",
      "One of the signs displayed at the London protest showed a photo of Musk next to an image of Adolf Hitler making the Nazi salute \u2014 a\u00a0gesture that Musk has been accused of reprising shortly after Mr. Trump's Jan. 20 inauguration. A person in a tyrannosaurus rex costume held another sign with a picture of Musk's straight-arm gesture that said, \"You thought the Nazis were extinct. Don't buy a Swasticar.\"",
      "\"We just want to get loud, make noise, make people aware of the problems that we're facing,\" said Cam Whitten, an American who showed up at the London protest.",
      "Tesla Takedown was organized by a group of supporters that included disillusioned owners of the automaker's vehicles, celebrities such as actor John Cusack, and at least one Democratic Party lawmaker, Rep. Jasmine Crockett from Dallas.",
      "\"I'm going to keep screaming in the halls of Congress. I just need you all to make sure you all keep screaming in the streets,\" Crockett said during a\u00a0Tesla Takedown organizing call\u00a0held earlier this month.",
      "In New York City, mayoral hopeful and New York state Rep. Zohran Mamdani joined protesters at a Tesla showroom on Saturday.",
      "\"We are here in a moment that demands all of us,\" Mandani told the crowd through a megaphone. \"It demands all of us because the richest man in the world has purchased the president of the United States.\"",
      "Some people opposed to Musk have gone beyond protests and set the automaker's vehicles on fire and committed\u00a0other acts of vandalism that U.S. Attorney General Pam Bondi has decried as \"nothing short of domestic terrorism.\" Musk indicated he was dumbfounded by the attacks during a March 20 company meeting and said the vandals should \"stop acting psycho.\"",
      "Crockett and other Tesla Takedown supporters have been stressing the importance for Saturday's protests to remain peaceful.",
      "But police were investigating a fire that destroyed seven Tesla vehicles in northwestern Germany early Saturday morning. It was wasn't immediately clear if the blaze, which was extinguished by firefighters, was related to the Tesla Takedown protests.",
      "There have been vandalisms at Tesla dealerships acrossing the U.S., including fires in Nevada and Missouri, and graffiti at locations in Massachusetts and Maryland, CBS News previously reported.",
      "Since January 2025, incidents targeting Tesla EVs have occurred in at least nine states, according to a joint intelligence bulletin issued by the Department of Homeland Security and FBI and obtained by CBS News.\u00a0Although U.S. intelligence suggests lone actors are behind them, Trump administration officials are promising to crack down on what they say are coordinated attacks.",
      "There have also been reports of vandalism to parked Teslas, making individual owners nervous.",
      "\"My wife cautions me, 'Be careful where you are at with it,'\" Bill Fonte told CBS New York. \"If you don't like the product, don't buy it. But they're going above and beyond, creating panic and concern for normal people like me.\"",
      "A growing number of consumers who bought Tesla vehicles before Musk took over DOGE have been looking to sell or trade in their cars while others have slapped on bumper stickers seeking to distance themselves from the billionaire's efforts to prune or shut down government agencies.",
      "But Musk didn't appear concerned about an extended slump in sales of new Tesla cars in his March 20 address to employees. He reassured the workers that the company's Model Y, which is undergoing a refresh, would remain \"the best-selling car on Earth again this year.\" He also predicted Tesla will have sold more than 10 million cars worldwide by next year, up from about 7 million cars now.",
      "\"There are times when there are rocky moments, where there is stormy weather, but what I am here to tell you is that the future is incredibly bright and exciting,\" Musk said.",
      "After Mr. Trump was elected last November, investors initially saw Musk's alliance with the president as a positive development for Tesla and its long-running efforts to launch\u00a0a network of self-driving cars.",
      "That optimism helped lift Tesla's stock by 70% in the period between Mr. Trump's Nov. 5 election and his Jan. 20 inauguration, creating an additional $560 billion in shareholder wealth. But virtually all those gains have evaporated amid investor worries about the Tesla backlash, lagging sales in the U.S., Europe and China, and Musk spending time overseeing DOGE.",
      "\"This continues to be a moment of truth for Musk to navigate this brand tornado crisis moment and get onto the other side of this dark chapter for Tesla,\" Wedbush Securities analyst Dan Ives said in a research note leading up to Saturday's protests.",

      "State-run television MRTV reported that 694 people have now been found dead and another 1,670 injured, with 68 others missing, according to a statement from the military-led government. The same figures were also reported by the independent news site The Irrawaddy.",
      "Myanmar is in the throes of a prolonged and bloody civil war, which is already responsible for a massive humanitarian crisis. It makes movement around the country both difficult and dangerous, complicating relief efforts and raising fears that the death toll could still rise precipitously.",

      "It was not immediately clear what relief efforts the ruling military regime would be able to provide, but it issued appeals for any help available, including blood supplies, from the international community. The major hospital in the country's capital that sustained significant damage was described as a mass casualty area, as medics raced to treat the wounded in an outdoor triage area.",
      "The hospital's emergency department was heavily damaged, and images showed a car crushed under the concrete roof that had covered its entrance.",

    "summary": "A recent poll\u200b shows 85% of Greenlanders do not want to be part of the United States.",
    "story": [
      "Washington \u2014 Vice President JD Vance\u00a0said Friday during a day trip to a U.S. base in Greenland that the Trump administration doesn't think that \"military force is ever going to be necessary\" there, the same day President Trump said, \"We have to have Greenland.\"",
      "Vance visited the Pituffik Space Base, the northernmost U.S. military installation, along with second lady Usha Vance, national security adviser Mike Waltz, Secretary of Energy Chris Wright and Sen. Mike Lee of Utah. While there, the vice president blasted Denmark for its handling of the island, as the Trump White House eyes the semi-autonomous Danish territory despite opposition from residents and leaders. While Vance was there, President Trump reiterated his strong desire to acquire the island.",
      "\"We need Greenland, very importantly, for international security,\" the president told reporters at the White House. \"We have to have Greenland. It's not a question of, 'Do you think we can do without it?' We can't.\"",
      "Mr. Trump hasn't ruled out military force in Greenland, while Vance on Friday said he believes the people of Greenland will seek independence from Denmark. A reporter asked Vance if his message is consistent with the president's. Vance said the president wants more of a U.S. presence in Greenland, but \"the president has said clearly he doesn't think that military force is going to be necessary.\"",
      "\"What we think is going to happen is that the Greenlanders are going to choose through self-determination to become independent of Denmark, and then we're going to have conversations with the people of Greenland from there,\" Vance said. \"So I think talking about anything too far in the future is way too premature. We do not think that military force is ever going to be necessary. We think this makes sense. And because we think the people of Greenland are rational and good, we think we're going to be able to cut a deal, Donald Trump style, to ensure the security of this territory but also the United States of America.\"",
      "Vance said his trip to the base helped him see up close how critical Greenland is for U.S. national security. If an enemy fired a missile on the U.S., it would be the American soldiers at the Greenland base who would alert their countrymen, he said. Vance said the U.S. knows Russia and China are taking serious interest in the Arctic, and the U.S. needs to make sure it's leading in the Arctic. But while Vance recognized Denmark has been an important security partner in the past, he launched into criticisms of the European country, saying the U.S. base in Greenland is less secure than it was decades ago because of Denmark's stewardship.",
      "\"There is no amount of bullying, no amount of obfuscating, no amount of confusing the issue,\" Vance said. \"Our message to Denmark is very simple: You have not done a good job by the people of Greenland, you have underinvested in the people of Greenland, and you have underinvested in the security architecture of this incredible, beautiful landmass filled with incredible people. That has to change. And because it hasn't changed, that's why President Trump's policy in Greenland is what it is.\"",
      "The second lady was originally scheduled to visit Greenland in an expanded cultural trip this week, and then the vice president\u00a0announced\u00a0Tuesday that he would be joining her for a shorter trip that was more focused on U.S. policy and defense.",
      "Vance also thanked soldiers on the base, who are there for a year at a time and can't bring their families with them.",
      "\"I know it's a lot of sacrifice to spend a year away from your families, but the mission is really important,\" Vance said. \"The Trump administration, the president, is really interested in Arctic security. As you all know, that's a big issue, and it's only going to get bigger over the coming decade, so thanks for doing what you do.\"",
      "Waltz told the soldiers they're carrying a \"tradition\" of U.S. soldiers in Greenland, and said the president is very serious about Arctic security.",
      "A statement earlier this week by the vice president's office that announced Vance would join his wife on the trip emphasized Greenland's role in U.S. national security.",
      "\"During World War II, the United States established over a dozen military bases in Greenland to defend the North Atlantic from Nazi incursion,\" the statement said. \"During the Cold War, the United States committed additional resources to Greenland to defend against Soviet missile attacks.\"",
      "The statement went on to criticize Denmark, claiming, \"In the decades since, neglect and inaction from Danish leaders and past U.S. administrations have presented our adversaries with the opportunity to advance their own priorities in Greenland and the Arctic. President Trump is rightly changing course.\"",
      "Mr. Trump hasn't given up on the idea of absorbing Greenland into the U.S., despite opposition from Greenland's leadership and people. Greenland is an expansive island to the north and east of Canada that's a semi-autonomous territory of Denmark. It's roughly three times the size of Texas, but mostly covered by ice. Most of its roughly 57,000 people \u2014 a population smaller than Carson City, Nevada \u2014 live along Greenland's southern coast.",
      "A\u00a0recent poll shows 85% of Greenlanders do not want to be part of the United States, and residents who spoke with CBS News ahead of Vance's visit to a remote U.S. installation on the island \u2014 America's furthest north military base \u2014 clearly reflected the sentiments shown in that poll.",
      "\"He can't just take it like that,\" said Daniel Rosing, a trainee electrician who said he was proud of being a Greenlander.",
      "And Greenland's prime minister, M\u00fate Bourup Egede,\u00a0has called the planned visits from U.S. officials \"aggressive.\" And Mette Frederiksen, the Danish prime minister, said the U.S. is putting \"unacceptable pressure\" on Greenland.",
      "Despite this opposition, Mr. Trump said earlier this month in a speech before the joint session of Congress that he had \"a message tonight for the incredible people of Greenland: We strongly support your right to determine your own future, and if you choose, we welcome you into the United States of America.\"",
      "Mr. Trump said the territory is important to U.S. national security and that his administration is \"working with everybody involved to try and get it.\"",
      "\"And I think we're going to get it, one way or the other,\" Mr. Trump said. \"We're going to get it. We will keep you safe, we will make you rich, and together, we will take Greenland to heights like you have never thought possible before. It's a very small population, but very, very large piece of land, and very, very important for military security.\"",

    "story": [
      "Washington \u2014 Israeli officials are furious over the Signal chat leak involving senior Trump administration officials because it included sensitive intelligence Israel provided to the U.S. from a human intelligence source in Yemen, CBS News has learned.",
      "While the Signal chat messages published by Jeffrey Goldberg of The Atlantic this week may not have compromised the effectiveness of the airstrike, given the publication's restraint on releasing the information, it did compromise a human source who provided the intelligence to the Israelis, who then provided it to the U.S. for targeting, a senior American intelligence official and a source with knowledge of the Israelis' ire told CBS News. They spoke on condition of anonymity to discuss sensitive national security matters.",
      "The Wall Street Journal on Thursday first reported about the Israelis complaining to U.S. officials about Mike Waltz, President Trump's national security adviser, who set up the group chat and apparently added Goldberg by mistake. The group spent several days earlier this month exchanging messages about possible plans to strike Iranian-backed Houthi militants in Yemen, who have repeatedly launched missiles at Israel and targeted shipping in the Red Sea.",
      "CBS News reached out to the National Security Council and the Israeli Embassy in the U.S. for comment on Friday, but has not received a response.",
      "On March 15, Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth texted the group chat, composed of what's known as the principals committee \u2014 the highest level of the National Security Council, which includes Cabinet members and other senior U.S. officials.",
      "According to Goldberg's report, one of Hegseth's messages said:",
      "\"Trigger Based\" F-18 1st Strike Window Starts (Target Terrorist is @ his Known Location so SHOULD BE ON TIME \u2013 also, Strike Drones Launch (MQ-9s)",
      "The senior American intelligence official told CBS News that in this context, \"Trigger Based\" refers to an operation that is contingent upon a specific condition or event \u2014 essentially, a go or no-go decision to launch an airstrike based on confirmation of the target's presence.",
      "That day, Navy F/A-18F Super Hornets launched from the aircraft carrier Harry S. Truman located in the Red Sea, while the MQ-9 Reaper drones took flight from bases in the Middle East. U.S. Central Command said in a statement that they had begun an operation which consisted of \"precision strikes against Iran-backed Houthi targets across Yemen in order to restore freedom of navigation.\"",
      "Hegseth said in another text, prior to the decision to strike, that he supported doing so to restore freedom of navigation and reestablish deterrence, which he described as being \"cratered\" under the Biden administration.",
      "After the U.S. airstrikes began on the Iranian-backed Houthis, Waltz addressed Vice President JD Vance in the chat group to say the building had collapsed and that U.S. military forces had \"multiple positive ID,\" indicating positive identification of the Houthi member or members they were aiming to kill.",
      "Waltz added: \"The first target \u2014 their top missile guy \u2014 we had positive ID of him walking into his girlfriend's building and it's now collapsed,\" according to the texts posted by The Atlantic.",
      "As a barrage of criticism rolled in this week towards those involved in the Signal chat, senior Trump administration officials have repeatedly said the information was not classified and that no sources or methods were compromised.",
      "\"No locations. No sources & methods. No WAR PLANS,\" Waltz wrote on X on Wednesday. \"Foreign partners had already been notified that strikes were imminent.\"",
      "But the sources who spoke to CBS News say Israeli intelligence is angry that the intelligence they provided to the U.S. was revealed. It's unclear what the fallout will be, if any, between the U.S. and Israel over the situation.",
      "CBS News reported Thursday that President Trump has been privately venting his irritation about the Signal chat leak and is closely monitoring the news to see if the fallout quiets down, according to sources familiar with the matter.",
      "On Tuesday, National Intelligence Director Tulsi Gabbard and CIA Director John Ratcliffe, both of whom were in the Signal group chat, testified before a Senate Intelligence Committee hearing.",
      "\"There was no classified material that was shared in that Signal chat,\" Gabbard told lawmakers. The following day, testifying before a House panel, Gabbard acknowledged the conversation was \"sensitive\" but again denied classified information was shared in the chat. \"There were no sources, methods, locations or war plans that were shared,\" she said.",
      "Multiple U.S. intelligence officials and members of the U.S. military who have spoken to CBS News this week contended that this type of information is always classified, but even if the information was somehow unclassified, it would still be a violation of cybersecurity and operational security protocols.",
      "CBS News on Tuesday published unclassified internal documents from a National Security Agency bulletin warning of vulnerabilities in using the Signal app, even though it is encrypted. The NSA bulletin was widely distributed to NSA employees a month before the Signal chat group was created by Waltz.",
      "The bulletin also underscored to NSA employees that third-party messaging applications such as Signal and WhatsApp are permitted for certain \"unclassified accountability/recall exercises\" but not for communicating more sensitive information.",
      "NSA employees were also warned to not send \"anything compromising over any social media or Internet-based tool or application,\" and to not \"establish connections with people you do not know.\"",

      "Pabrade, Lithuania\u00a0\u2014 Lithuania's president said Friday that he hoped for \"a miracle\" as he visited the site of a rescue operation to recover four missing U.S. Army soldiers from their submerged vehicle. The four soldiers, assigned to the Army's 1st Brigade, 3rd Infantry Division, went missing early Tuesday morning during a maintenance mission to recover another U.S. Army vehicle in the Pabrade training area, near Lithuania's border with Belarus, during a scheduled training missing, the Army has said.",
      "Search and rescue teams were at the scene on Friday using heavy military equipment and excavators to remove silt from the body of water where the vehicle was found on Wednesday.",
      "\"I am still hoping for a miracle,\" Lithuanian President Gitanas Nauseda told reporters in Pabrade. \"Although many sceptics would probably say that there is nothing to hope for in these circumstances, I want to believe.\"",
      "In a statement issued Friday, the U.S. Army said the hulking, 70-ton M88 Hercules armored recovery vehicle the missing U.S. soldiers had been operating \"was found submerged approximately 15 feet under a body of water and mud in a boggy area\" connected to a nearby lake.",
      "\"The area around the site is incredibly wet and marshy and doesn't support the weight of the equipment,\" the U.S. Army Europe and Africa's public affairs office said in a statement Friday. \"Draining the area has been slow and difficult due to ground water seepage,\" it said.",
      "\"This will be a long and difficult recovery operation, but we are absolutely committed to bringing our soldiers home,\" said Curtis Taylor, Commanding General of the 1st Armored Division.",
      "The main goal Friday was to remove the mud from the submerged vehicle and identify possible attachment points for extraction, Lithuanian Armed Forces chief General Raimundas Vaiksnoras said.",
      "\"We are working and will continue to work until we can give clear and honest answers to those who need to know the most \u2014 family members,\" Vaiksnoras said on Facebook on Friday.",

      "The U.S. Army's Europe command said in its statement that a \"large capacity slurry pump, cranes, more than 30 tons of gravel, and subject matter experts from the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers are just some of the assets that arrived on site to assist with accessing the M88.",
      "The Polish Armed Forces have also volunteered a unit of military engineers, which is moving toward the site.\"",

      "\"We need Greenland for national security and even international security,\" the president said during his address. \"I think we're going to get it. One way or the other, we're going to get it.\"",
      "Greenland's prime minister responded: \"We are not for sale and cannot simply be taken.\"",
      "A few weeks later, Vice President JD Vance and second lady\u00a0Usha Vance\u00a0paid a\u00a0visit to Greenland\u00a0along with\u00a0national security adviser Mike Waltz.\u00a0Donald Trump Jr. visited in January\u00a0before the president took office.",
      "On the Panama Canal, Mr. Trump said in his March 4 address, \"To further enhance our national security, my administration will be reclaiming the Panama Canal, and we've already started doing it,\" referring to a deal to give an American company control of key ports.",
      "Panama's president denounced Mr. Trump's remarks and said \"The Canal is Panamanian\" in a social media post.",
      "Below is a look at where the two places are and what Mr. Trump has said about wanting the U.S. to control them.",
      "Where is Greenland and why does President Trump want it?",
      "Greenland is located to the northeast of Canada. The largest island in the world, it is about 836,000 square miles, around the size of Sweden. It is largely covered by the Greenland Ice Sheet and is home to only around 60,000 people. It is a semi-autonomous territory of the Kingdom of Denmark and has its own elected government.",
      "Its location between the U.S., Russia and Europe makes it strategic for both economic and defense purposes \u2014 especially as melting sea ice has opened up new shipping routes through the Arctic. It is also the location of the northernmost U.S. military base.",
      "Mr. Trump has repeatedly claimed the U.S. needs Greenland for national security purposes. \"I'm talking about protecting the free world,\" he said in early January. \"You look at \u2014 you don't even need binoculars \u2014 you look outside. You have China ships all over the place. You have Russian ships all over the place. We're not letting that happen. We're not letting it happen.\"",
      "The Northwest Passage, or Northern Sea route, was first crossed in the winter months by a Russian commercial vessel several years ago, and is a shorter route linking east Asia's major ports to Europe and the Atlantic Ocean. Western powers have already voiced concern about Russia and China using it to boost their presence in the North Atlantic.",
      "\"The Americans have a strong interest in overseeing the activities of foreign countries in Greenland because it's such a big security asset for foreign states, and due to that, any investment or activity, from the American point of view, may be seen as a security threat,\" Frank Sejersen, associate professor at the University of Copenhagen, told CBS News.",
      "Pernille Benjaminsen, a human rights lawyer in Greenland, told CBS News the ties between the territory's semi-autonomous government and the Danish government had grown tense in recent years, and Mr. Trump could be trying to take advantage of that.",
      "\"He has noticed that there is this tense relationship between Denmark and Greenland and seen opportunities in that,\" she said.",
      "Greenland also has oil, natural gas and highly sought after mineral resources.",
      "Those mineral resources, which include rare earth elements, \"have only been lightly explored and developed,\" Jose W. Fernandez, the U.S. Department of State's undersecretary for economic growth, energy and the environment, said at a\u00a0Minerals Security Partnership event in Greenland in November.",
      "Greenland may have significant reserves of up to 31 different minerals, including lithium and graphite, both of which are needed to produce electric vehicle batteries, according to a 2023 report assessing the island's resources.",
      "Currently, lithium production is dominated by Australia, Chile and China, while China produces about 65% of the world's graphite, the report noted.",
      "Greenland also has the potential to provide a significant amount of rare earth minerals like Neodymium, which is used to make the magnets used in electric motors, the 2023 report said.",
      "Currently, China produces about 70% of rare earth elements.",
      "\"The world is currently too dependent on a small set of actors for mining and processing many critical minerals,\" Fernandez said in November.",
      "Demand for rare earth minerals is outstripping supply, which has kept prices high, according to the Swiss newspaper Neue Z\u00fcrcher Zeitung. Still, there are significant hurdles to mining in Greenland, including environmental and cost issues.",
      "Inside the Vances' Greenland visit",
      "Usha Vance was originally supposed to visit Greenland solo in late March as part of an expanded cultural trip, but then the vice president announced he would join her.",
      "The Vances arrived along with national security adviser Mike Waltz on Friday, March 28, to spend the day at Pituffik Space Base, the United States' northernmost military installation. The base, formerly known as Thule Air Base, is locked in by ice for much of the year, according to its website, but operates its airfield year-round.",
      "They met with service members at the base and received a briefing on Arctic security issues.",
      "\"As you've heard, we have some interest in Greenland from the Trump administration,\" the vice president told a group of service members at the dining hall.",
      "Vance said Mr. Trump wants more of a U.S. presence in Greenland, but \"the president has said clearly he doesn't think that military force is going to be necessary.\"",
      "While announcing his visit, Vance said \"a lot of other countries\" pose\u00a0a threat to Greenland and its waterways, and would use them to threaten the U.S.",
      "\"Unfortunately, leaders in both America and in Denmark, I think, ignored Greenland for far too long,\" he said in a video message before his trip. \"That's been bad for Greenland, it's also been bad for the security of the entire world. We think we can take things in a different direction, so I'm gonna go check it out.\"",
      "A\u00a0recent poll showed\u00a0that 85% of Greenlanders do not want to be part of the United States.",
      "\"He can't just take it like that,\" Daniel Rosing, a trainee electrician who said he was proud of being a Greenlander, told CBS News.",
      "What is the Panama Canal and why does Trump want it?",
      "About 40% of U.S. container shipping currently travels through the Panama Canal, according to the trade publication CargoNOW. The canal serves as a shortcut between the Pacific Ocean and the Caribbean Sea and, beyond that, the Atlantic Ocean.",
      "Mr. Trump has said that the United States needs the Panama Canal for \"economic security,\" falsely alleging that it is being \"operated by China.\"",
      "\"The Panama Canal is vital to our country. It's being operated by China. China! And we gave the Panama Canal to Panama. We didn't give it to China, and they've abused it. They've abused that gift. It should have never been made,\" he said before taking office again on Jan. 20.",
      "Panama President Jose Raul Mulino has disputed claims that China controls the canal.",
      "\"There is absolutely no Chinese interference nor involvement in anything to do with the Panama Canal,\" he said in late December.",
      "But in February, Panama decided not to renew a key infrastructure agreement with Beijing after a visit from Secretary of State Marco Rubio.",
      "Ahead of Mr. Trump's address to Congress, a Hong Kong-based conglomerate that operates ports at either end of the canal announced an agreement to sell shares of its units to an investment group led by American company BlackRock.",
      "Mr. Trump touted the deal in his speech. \"The Panama Canal was built by Americans for Americans, not for others. But others could use it,\" he said.",
      "In his response, Mulino said, \"President Trump is lying.\"",
      "\"The Panama Canal is not in the process of being restored, and this is certainly not the task that was even discussed in our conversations with Secretary Rubio or anyone else,\" he wrote on social media. \"The Canal is Panamanian and will continue to be Panamanian!\"",
      "China has denied trying to claim any control over the canal, with Foreign Ministry spokesperson Mao Ning saying in December that Beijing would \"always respect Panama's sovereignty over the Canal and recognize the Canal as a permanently neutral international waterway.\"",
      "The history of Greenland",
      "The Kingdom of Denmark began colonizing Greenland in the early 18th century, hundreds of years after Vikings from the same distant land first arrived to set up residency. It was not until World War II that the U.S. established a presence on the island, when then-Danish Ambassador to the U.S., Henrik Kauffmann, refused to surrender to the rule of Denmark's Nazi occupiers.",
      "Denmark was liberated from Nazi occupation in 1945, but the U.S. did not leave its military base, Pituffik Space Base, which to this day remains the American military's northernmost installation.",
      "The history of the Panama Canal",
      "The Panama Canal\u00a0was built by the U.S. between 1904 and 1914. It serves as a shortcut between the Pacific Ocean and the Caribbean, dramatically shortening shipping routes from Asia to ports in the eastern U.S.",
      "It was first managed by the U.S. government for decades, which caused tension with Panama.",
      "In the 1970s, the U.S. and Panama signed a treaty agreeing to the permanent neutrality of the canal. The U.S. committed to relinquishing control of the canal and did so fully in 1999. The canal is now run by the Panama Canal Authority.",

Associated Press reporters in Beirut heard a loud boom and witnessed smoke rising from the area that Israel's military had warned it would strike.",
      "The strike came after Israel's army urgently warned people to evacuate parts of a Beirut suburb, vowing to retaliate against strikes which it said were launched from Lebanon into northern Israel. Israel's defense minister said Friday that if there was no peace in Israel's northern communities there would be no peace in Beirut either.",
      "The Israel Defense Forces said the strike in Beirut had targeted a Hezbollah drone storage facility in the Dahiyeh neighborhood, which Israel has long described as a key Hezbollah stronghold. Israel accuses Hezbollah of using civilians as human shields and the IDF noted its advanced warning for people to leave the area on Friday.",
      "Hezbollah denied firing the rockets at northern Israel, and accused Israel of seeking a pretext to continue attacking Lebanon.",
      "Lebanon's government ordered all schools and universities in Beirut's southern suburb of Hadath to close for the day. Residents were seen fleeing the area in cars and on foot ahead of the strike.",
      "It was the first strike on Beirut since a ceasefire took hold on Nov. 27, 2024, between Israel and Hezbollah, a U.S.- and Israeli-designated terrorist organization that has long been powerful political force in Lebanon, although Israel has struck targets in southern Lebanon almost daily since then.",
      "Hezbollah began launching rockets, drones and missiles into Israel the day after its ally Hamas' unprecedented Oct. 7, 2023 terrorist attack, which ignited the war in Gaza. The Israel-Hezbollah conflict boiled over into all-out war in September as Israel carried out waves of airstrikes and killed most of the militant group's senior leaders. The fighting killed over 4,000 people in Lebanon and displaced about 60,000 Israelis who live in communities near the country's shared border.",
      "Israeli forces were supposed to withdraw from all Lebanese territory by late January under the ceasefire deal. The deadline was extended to Feb. 18, but Israel has remained in five locations in Lebanon across from communities in northern Israel. Meanwhile, Israel has carried out dozens of airstrikes on southern and eastern Lebanon, saying it attacked Hezbollah, while continuing drone attacks that have killed several members of the militant group.",
      "Last week, Israeli airstrikes on several locations in Lebanon killed six people.",
      "The United Nations Special Coordinator for Lebanon, Jeanine Hennis-Plasschaert, said the exchange of fire was deeply concerning. \"This is a critical period for Lebanon and the wider region,\" she said Friday.",
      "The Israeli strikes on Beirut came as Lebanon's President Joseph Aoun made his first visit to Paris as his country's leader. He met Friday with President Emmanuel Macron who, following their meeting, called the Israeli strike \"unacceptable\" and a \"violation of the ceasefire\" that he argued would \"play into the hands of Hezbollah.\"",
      "Aoun called the Friday strike a continuation \"of Israel's violations\" of the November ceasefire agreement, which was sponsored by the U.S. and France.",
      "Israel continues bombing Gaza as humanitarian crisis deepens",
      "The escalation comes 11 days after Israel abruptly ended its separate ceasefire agreement with Hamas in Gaza, by launching a surprise wave of strikes that killed hundreds of people in the decimated Palestinian territory.",
      "Earlier this month, Israel halted deliveries of food, fuel, medicine and humanitarian aid to Gaza's roughly 2 million inhabitants.",
      "Israel has vowed to escalate the war until Hamas returns the 59 hostages it still holds in Gaza \u2014 24 of whom are still believed to be alive. Israel is demanding that Hamas give up power, disarm and send its leaders out of Gaza into exile.",
      "Hamas has said it will only release the remaining captives in exchange for Palestinian prisoners, a lasting ceasefire, and an Israeli withdrawal from Gaza.",
      "The war triggered by Hamas' terrorist attack has killed more than 50,000 Palestinians in Gaza, many of them women and children, according to the enclave's Hamas-run Health Ministry. The attack on Israel saw Hamas and its allies kill some 1,200 people, mostly civilians, and take 251 others hostage.",
      "Almost 40 more people were killed in Israeli strikes across the Gaza Strip overnight, Palestinian media outlets said Friday, including 14 who were reportedly killed in a strike that hit a house in the al-Zaytoun neighborhood in Gaza city. The Gaza Health Ministry said Thursday that 855 people had been killed since the resumption of Israeli attacks on March 18. The Hamas-run ministry's figures do not differentiate between civilian and combatant casualties.",
      "The World Central Kitchen charity said in a social media post that one of its volunteers in Gaza was killed in an Israeli airstrike Thursday that hit near one of its kitchens during a meal distribution.",
      "\"Our hearts are heavy today,\" the organization, founded by American-Spanish chef Jos\u00e9 Andr\u00e9s,\u00a0said in a social media post, adding that six other people were wounded in the same strike. About a year ago, Andr\u00e9s accused Israeli forces of \"targeting us in a deconflicting zone\" in Gaza. The charity acknowledged dismissing some staff in Gaza in December after Israeli authorities provided a list of about 60 WCK volunteers whom it alleged were linked to terrorism.",
      "\"This should not be taken as a conclusion by WCK that the individuals are affiliated with any terror organization,\" the Washington D.C-based charity said at the time. \"Prior to receiving the results of the COGAT [Israeli government] security check, we had no reason for concern regarding any of these individuals and, because Israel does not share intelligence with aid organizations, we do not know the basis for Israel's decision to flag these individuals. However, we felt this step was necessary to protect our team and operations.\"",
      "The United Nations' World Food Program also sounded alarm Friday over the deepening hunger crisis in Gaza more than two weeks after Israel cut off the flow of most humanitarian aid into the territory, with its director in the region telling the Al Jazeera network that more than 90% of the enclave's population lacked food security.",
      "According to a report by the U.N.'s Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs, Israel obstructed 82% of aid convoys intended for Gaza between March 18 and March 24), hampering relief efforts.",

    "summary": "A new study shows how cuts to foreign aid could lead to millions of HIV/AIDS deaths and soaring rates of infections, undoing decades of progress against the virus.",
    "story": [
      "Proposed cuts to global foreign aid, including slashing programs in the United States, could lead to millions of HIV deaths and soaring rates of infections around the world in the coming years, according to a new study.",
      "Published Wednesday in\u00a0The Lancet HIV journal, the modeling study estimates that by 2030, there could be between 4.4 million to 10.8 million additional new HIV infections in low- and middle-income countries and 770,000 to 2.9 million HIV-related deaths in children and adults. To estimate the impacts, the authors examined 26 countries that used foreign aid for HIV resources, including Albania, Cambodia, Colombia, C\u00f4te d'Ivoire, South Africa and Sri Lanka.",
      "They noted that international funding has been crucial in reducing HIV transmissions and deaths, and that five countries \u2014 the U.S., U.K., France, Germany and the Netherlands \u2014 provide over 90% of international HIV funding, with the U.S. being by far the largest contributor. The U.S. committed $5.71 billion in 2023, or about 73% of total donor government funding, according to analysis by KFF, a nonpartisan health policy organization.",
      "But as of February, they authors report, donor nations have announced reductions in aid of between 8% and 70% between 2025 and 2026. The Trump administration froze foreign aid\u00a0spending, including funding for HIV/AIDS programs, soon after taking office, and the Department of Government Efficiency, or DOGE, is spearheading major cutbacks.",
      "\"The United States has historically been the largest contributor to global efforts to treat and prevent HIV, but the current cuts to PEPFAR and USAID-supported programs have already disrupted access to essential HIV services including for antiretroviral therapy and HIV prevention and testing,\" co-lead study author Debra ten Brink of the Burnet Institute in Australia said in a news release.",
      "The study's authors said ongoing disruptions could undo decades of progress to end HIV/AIDS as a public health threat.",
      "\"Looking ahead, if other donor countries reduce funding, decades of progress to treat and prevent HIV could be unravelled. It is imperative to secure sustainable financing and avoid a resurgence of the HIV epidemic, which could have devastating consequences, not just in regions such as sub-Saharan Africa, but globally,\" said ten Brink.",
      "PEPFAR, or the President's Emergency Plan for AIDS Relief, was launched under then-President George W. Bush in 2003 and has invested over $100 billion in the global HIV/AIDS response over the years. According to the State Department, the program has saved the lives of\u00a026 million people since it began\u00a0\u2014 but its funding stopped after Secretary of State Marco Rubio ordered a\u00a0pause on foreign aid\u00a0earlier this year.",
      "\"PEPFAR is the largest commitment by any nation to address a single disease in history, enabled by strong bipartisan support across ten U.S. congresses and four presidential administrations, and through the American people's generosity,\" the government website HIV.gov reads. \"PEPFAR shows the power of what is possible through compassionate, cost-effective, accountable, and transparent American foreign assistance.\"",
      "Others have already warned about the devastation these cuts could bring to those who rely on it. Earlier this week, the UNAIDS chief warned that without funding, millions will die and the global AIDS pandemic will resurge.",
      "\"It is reasonable for the United States to want to reduce its funding over time, but the sudden withdrawal of lifesaving support is having a devastating impact,\" UNAIDS executive director Winnie Byanyima told reporters in Geneva. \"We urge for a reconsideration and an urgent restoration of services \u2014 lifesaving services.\"",
      "Dr. C\u00e9line Gounder, CBS News medical contributor and editor-at-large for public health at KFF Health News, said the U.S. contributions play a key role that could not be easily replaced.",
      "\"Many of these countries rely heavily on the United States. Some of them between 50 and 70% of their budgets for HIV diagnosis, treatment and prevention is coming from the United States,\" she said on \"CBS Mornings Plus.\" \"There's not really any other country that can easily step in. And big picture, this is sort of like telling a surgeon in the middle of surgery to walk away. It's just not that easy to jump in and take over.\"",

He reappeared Friday morning, leaving his London residence Clarence House and waving to well-wishers from inside a black Audi.",
      "Tourist Julian Mati told The Associated Press he was relieved to see Charles looking well as he left Clarence House.",

      "The king has maintained a busy schedule of official events in recent weeks, having steadily ramped up his work after returning to public duties in April last year, just several months after beginning his treatment. He made his first foreign trip during the treatment in July 2024, to Australia.",
      "Last week, Charles was in Northern Ireland with Queen Camilla, and he met with Ukraine's President Volodymyr Zelenskyy earlier this month.",

      "\"The Government of Canada has launched an educational campaign to inform Americans of the economic impacts of tariffs. The campaign is a strategic investment in Canada's long-term economic interests, and its trade relationship with the United States,\" Babcock said. \"Tariffs are a tax on hard-working Americans in their daily lives.

Hodak, of Cambridge Springs, Pennsylvania, was a gunner aboard a B-29 \"Superfortress\" aircraft.

      "Tokyo \u2014\u00a0President Trump in early March criticized what he characterized as a one-sided security alliance between the U.S. and Japan. Officials in Japan have heard these comments from Mr. Trump before, and so far, they've continued shaping the country's national security plans based on the assurance of backing from the United States.",
      "Government officials admit they really have no other choice.",
      "\"There is no Plan B for Japan other than the U.S.,\" Takuya Akiyama, Principal Deputy Director of the North American Affairs Bureau at the Japanese Ministry of Foreign Affairs, told CBS News. \"Treaty wise and also as a physical presence, no other country can substitute the U.S. It is unthinkable.\"",
      "The U.S. may be pulling back from Europe under President Trump, but despite his remarks about Japan, U.S. military cooperation with Tokyo has appeared stable, and may even expand as the White House ramps up its standoff with Asia's increasingly assertive superpower, China.",
      "China's threat to its neighbors",
      "Japanese officials may have breathed a sigh of relief after Prime Minister Shigeru Ishiba's visit to the White House in February. The Trump administration reaffirmed its commitment to Japan's defense, including amid Tokyo's dispute with Beijing over ownership of the Senkaku islands.",
      "It is one of many land ownership disputes between China and its neighbors over islands in the South China Sea \u2014 virtually all of which Beijing claims as its territory. The White House has repeatedly condemned Chinese aggression and militarization in the South China Sea, and U.S. warships and aircraft routinely carry out \"freedom of navigation\" exercises in the area \u2014 often drawing sharp rebukes from Beijing.",
      "Advisers to the Japanese prime minister spent the months after the U.S. election preparing him for the meeting with Mr. Trump. They focused on using clear and concise language to convey the benefits of the security alliance to the U.S., and the increase Japan has made in its own defense spending and military procurement from America, according to officials at the Japanese foreign ministry.",
      "China has been rapidly bolstering its military capabilities, including its nuclear program, in recent years, according to U.S. officials. Last year, China announced a 7.2% increase in its defense budget, which was already the world's second-highest, behind only the United States.",
      "In February, Taiwan condemned China and deployed its own forces in response as the Chinese military held \"shooting training\" drills in the Taiwan Strait.",
      "\"From an American perspective, it's clear that if Taiwan falls, and if Japan falls, that our alliances in the Indo-Pacific are over,\" Kenneth Weinstein, Japan Chair at the Hudson Institute think tank, told CBS News. \"China will exercise extraordinary military sway \u2014 will be able to close down global shipping such as they see it, will be able to throttle access to the South China Sea and elsewhere.\"",
      "There have already been tense encounters between Japanese and Chinese naval vessels around the Senkaku islands, a group of uninhabited islands claimed by both Beijing and Tokyo. According to data from Japan's coast guard, Chinese government vessels entered the maritime zone around the islands, which China calls the Diaoyus, on 355 of the 366 days of 2024 \u2014 the highest number of intrusions reported by Japan since China started operating around the islands in 2008.",
      "The Chinese vessels operating around the islands have increased not only in number, but in armament, carrying more and larger weapons as they circle the disputed territories, according to officials at the foreign and defense ministries.",
      "While Japanese analysts don't believe a Chinese military invasion of the Senkaku islands is imminent, they say there's a risk that an accident or incident involving fishing or other non-military vessels in the area could lead to a rapid military escalation.",
      "\"The Chinese Communist Party believes in power. They have started to act because they believe they now have the power to do so,\" China expert Akio Takahara, a professor at the Tokyo Woman's Christian University, told CBS News. \"We want the U.S. to increase their presence in this region, because the Chinese are certainly going to enhance their presence in the region.\"",
      "Major boost to U.S.-Japan defense cooperation coming?",
      "Japan has revamped its approach to defense in recent years, including by committing to spend 2% of its GDP on defense by 2027. Japan announced a major policy shift in 2022, abandoning the country's post-World War II, exclusively defense posture with a decision to acquire counterstrike capabilities.",
      "The Trump administration has seemingly approved of the changes, and it has not asked Japan for even greater increases in defense spending as some Japanese officials feared it might.",
      "While Mr. Trump complained specifically this month about Japan's hypothetical preparedness to meet its mutual defense obligation to the U.S. under Article 5 of the U.S.-Japan Security Treaty, Japanese officials have tried to focus more on Article 6, under which Japan provides bases and facilities for U.S. forces. And that aspect of the relationship could be set to expand.",
      "The U.S. and Japan have been in discussions since before Mr. Trump came back to the White House about the possible establishment of a Joint Force Headquarters in Japan. If it happens, it would upgrade the role of the U.S. forces in Japan to a command headquarters with operational authority. The dialogue over the upgrade was announced under the Biden administration, after being requested by the Japanese.",
      "In the event of a regional security crisis \u2014 such as a Chinese attack on Taiwan or a disputed South China Sea island \u2014 having a Joint Force Headquarters in Japan would give the U.S. military the capacity to respond with commands from the region, rather than waiting for orders to come from the U.S. Indo-Pacific Command in Hawaii.",
      "U.S. Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth is expected to meet with his Japanese counterpart in late March to discuss efforts to bolster U.S. forces in the Pacific region.",
      "Concern over Ukraine",
      "The dramatic vacillations by the Trump administration in its stance on Ukraine have also raised concern in Japan. Since Russia launched its full-scale invasion in February 2022, Japan has been a staunch supporter of Ukraine. Japanese officials worry about the precedent that would be set if the U.S. is seen to abandon a partner nation in the face of an invasion by a more powerful neighbor.",
      "\"In light of Russia's aggression against Ukraine, countries' perceptions on security have drastically changed around the world,\" then-Japanese Prime minister Fumio Kishida said at a regional security summit In June 2022, several months into Russia's invasion. \"I myself have a strong sense of urgency that Ukraine today may be East Asia tomorrow.\"",
      "The Japanese fear that if the U.S. and the world at large are prepared to accept a change in Europe's borders forced by Russian aggression, they could also decline to intervene in the case of a Chinese attack on Taiwan.",
      "\"The Chinese will be encouraged that, perhaps if Xi Jinping did something similar, Trump will be as kind to Xi Jinping as he's been to Putin,\" professor Takahara told CBS News. \"That kind of message will be received in Beijing.\"",
      "Officials in Tokyo are trying to remain focused on the long-term bilateral relationship with Washington, looking beyond the Trump administration, but they know China is watching closely as the relationship develops, especially given the volatile nature of the Trump administration's foreign policy.",
      "\"We don't know what Mr. Trump will be saying tomorrow and doing the day after. So, at least the Ishiba visit, the first round, went okay. We were happy about that,\" Takahara said. \"But what about the next round? When is it coming? No one knows.\"",

    "story": [
      "Authorities in Belize said Wednesday that three American women who were found dead last month while\u00a0on vacation in the country died as a result of carbon monoxide poisoning.",
      "The three women from Revere, Massachusetts, 23-year-old Kaoutar Naqqad, 24-year-old Imane Mallah and 26-year-old Wafae El-Arar, were found unconscious in their hotel room at the Royal Kahal Beach Resort in February. Investigators in Belize said last month that the women had a build-up of fluids in their lungs but were still awaiting final test results for the cause of death.",
      "Gian Cho, executive director of the National Forensics Science Service, said Wednesday that all three women had carboxyhemoglobin levels higher than 60%. Carboxyhemoglobin levels are typically lower than 2% in nonsmokers and lower than 5% in smokers.",
      "Carbon monoxide is an odorless, colorless gas and is produced any time a fossil fuel is burned.\u00a0 Accidental poisoning can occur when home appliances like furnaces, kerosene heaters, stoves, lanterns and generators produce fumes that people breathe in.",
      "Belize Police Commissioner Chester Williams said that as a result of the findings, authorities have conducted a second test of the hotel room for carbon monoxide poisoning after initial testing showed no signs. Williams said they are still awaiting the final test results.",
      "Authorities also found and tested the alcohol and gummies found in the room. THC was found in one of the items, but no illicit substances were found in the bodies of the three women, Cho said.",
      "The families of the deceased said in a joint statement, \"While we remain shattered by the loss of these three bright lights in our world, we are incredibly heartened by the results of this investigation and grateful to those who completed it in a thorough and independent manner.\"",
      "\"We have said since the beginning of this investigation that their deaths were suspicious and raised concerns about initial reports in the news media. While today's official finding puts to rest those initial reports, we hope this will give authorities in law enforcement pause before they make similar suggestions during future investigations,\" the families said, noting they were still awaiting results of an independent review being conducted by Massachusettes authorities. \"Survivors such as our families deserve their best, honest work. We received it today but needed it throughout this investigative process.\"",
      "\"Our families remain incredibly grateful to the outpouring of support we have received from family, friends, leaders and loved ones since their passing. We appreciate the privacy that has been extended to our families as we grieve and are also grateful to the media who have helped ensure that Wafae, Imane, Kaoutar and the impact of their loss are a central part of your news coverage,\" they added. \"Our families ask for continued prayers, patience, and privacy as we navigate this unimaginable loss. May their beautiful souls rest in eternal peace. We will forever love and miss you, Kaoutar, Imane and Wafae.",

      "These AI-generated voice clones can be used to manipulate loved ones, coworkers or even financial institutions into transferring money or sharing sensitive information, making it increasingly difficult to distinguish between genuine and fraudulent calls.",
      "Today's AI tools can generate convincing fake identification documents with AI-generated images. Criminals use these to verify identity when fraudulently opening accounts or taking over existing ones. These AI-generated fake IDs are becoming increasingly sophisticated, often including realistic holograms and barcodes that can bypass traditional security checks and even fool automated verification systems.",
      "Many financial institutions use selfies for customer verification. However, fraudsters can take images from social media to create deepfakes that bypass these security measures. These AI-generated deepfakes are not limited to still images; they can also produce realistic videos that can fool liveness detection checks during facial recognition processes, posing a significant threat to biometric authentication systems.",
      "Similarly, GenAI now crafts flawlessly written, highly personalized\u00a0phishing emails that analyze your online presence to create messages specifically tailored to your interests and personal details.

Those with substantial retirement savings or investments naturally represent more valuable targets \u2014 the more assets you have, the more attention you'll attract from criminals looking for bigger payoffs. Many older adults are particularly vulnerable as they didn't grow up with today's technology and may be less familiar with AI's capabilities. This knowledge gap makes it harder to recognize when AI is being used maliciously. Compounding this risk is an extensive digital footprint: if you're active on social media or have a significant online presence, you're inadvertently providing fraudsters with the raw materials they need to create convincing deepfakes and highly personalized scams designed specifically to exploit your trust.",

Awareness is your first line of defense \u2014 understanding how these scams work helps you spot red flags before you become a victim. This awareness should be paired with both digital safeguards and \"analog\" verification systems that exist entirely offline. Here are some key steps to protect yourself:",
      "1.\u00a0Invest in personal data removal services: Generative AI fundamentally needs your personal data to craft convincing scams, which is why limiting your online footprint has become paramount in today's fraud landscape. The less information about you that's publicly available, the fewer raw materials scammers have to work with. Going completely off-grid is unrealistic for most of us today \u2014 much like never leaving your home. But you can reduce your online footprint substantially with a personal data removal service like Incogni, making yourself significantly less exposed to AI-powered scams.",

Initially seen in targeted attacks, it has now gone mainstream, affecting industries like hospitality and healthcare.",
      "The scam begins when you visit a hacked or malicious website and see a fake CAPTCHA-style prompt. Clicking the \"I\u2019m not a robot\" button triggers a set of instructions asking you to press specific keyboard shortcuts. First, you are told to press Windows + R, which opens the Windows Run dialog. Then you are instructed to press CTRL + V, which pastes a malicious script copied from the website\u2019s virtual clipboard. If you press enter, a script is executed that downloads and runs malware.",

      "Cybercriminals are using phishing emails and malicious websites to spread ClickFix. The hospitality industry has been heavily targeted, with attackers impersonating Booking.com and sending fake emails referencing guest reviews or promotions. Clicking on links in these emails directs you to a ClickFix trap. Healthcare workers have also been targeted, with malicious code embedded into the widely used physical therapy site HEP2go.",
      "Once ClickFix is on your PC, it installs various types of malware, including password stealers like XWorm, Lumma Stealer and DanaBot, which extract your login credentials and financial information. Some versions deliver remote access trojans like VenomRAT and AsyncRAT, giving attackers full control over your system.

Just like in the current campaign, attackers prompted victims to click a button that copied a PowerShell \"fix\" to the clipboard, then paste and run it in a Run dialog or PowerShell prompt.",

The scam started with an email containing a link to a Google Meet session, often disguised to appear as if it were from the victim's organization.

      "2. Don\u2019t click links from unverified emails and use strong antivirus software:\u00a0Many ClickFix attacks start with phishing emails that impersonate trusted services like Booking.com or Google Meet. Always verify the sender before clicking on links. If an email seems urgent or unexpected, go directly to the company\u2019s official website instead of clicking any links inside the email.",
      "GET FOX BUSINESS ON THE GO BY CLICKING HERE",
      "The best way to safeguard yourself from malicious links that install malware, potentially accessing your private information, is to have strong antivirus software installed on all your devices.

      "3. Enable two-factor authentication:\u00a0Enable two-factor authentication whenever possible. This adds an extra layer of security by requiring a second form of verification, such as a code sent to your phone, in addition to your password.",
      "4. Keep devices updated: Regularly\u00a0updating your operating system, browser and security software ensures you have the latest patches against known vulnerabilities. Cybercriminals exploit outdated systems, so enabling automatic updates is a simple but effective way to stay protected.",
      "5. Monitor your accounts for suspicious activity and change your passwords:\u00a0If you\u2019ve interacted with a suspicious website, phishing email or fake login page, check your online accounts for any unusual activity. Look for unexpected login attempts, unauthorized password resets or financial transactions that you don\u2019t recognize. If anything seems off, change your passwords immediately and report the activity to the relevant service provider. Also, consider using a\u00a0password manager to generate and store complex passwords. Get more details about my\u00a0best expert-reviewed password managers of 2025 here.",
      "6. Invest in personal data removal service: Consider using a service that monitors your personal information and alerts you to potential breaches or unauthorized use of your data. These services can provide early warning signs of identity theft or other malicious activities resulting from ClickFix or similar attacks. While no service promises to remove all your data from the internet, having a removal service is great if you want to constantly monitor and automate the process of removing your information from hundreds of sites continuously over a longer period of time.\u00a0Check out my top picks for data removal services here.",

      "Kurt\u2019s key takeaway",
      "ClickFix is a reminder that malware doesn\u2019t always rely on complex exploits. It often just needs you to follow the wrong instructions. Attackers are refining their methods, making scams like fake CAPTCHAs, phishing emails and deceptive pop-ups more convincing than ever. The best way to stay ahead is to question anything that seems even slightly off. If a website asks you to run commands or paste something into PowerShell, it\u2019s a red flag. If an email pressures you into clicking a link, verify it first.",

      "Hackers worldwide are exploiting any type of free document converter or downloader tool to carry out this scheme. The scam may involve websites that promise to convert files, such as turning a .doc into a .pdf, or tools that claim to merge multiple images into a single document. Some even pose as MP3 or MP4 downloaders. While these tools perform the advertised task, the resulting file may contain hidden malware, giving attackers access to the victim\u2019s computer.",

Use official conversion tools:\u00a0Instead of relying on random online tools, download and use reputable document conversion software provided by reputable companies like Adobe Acrobat, LibreOffice or Microsoft Office. These programs let you convert files securely without exposing your data to potential threats.",
      "2. Check the website\u2019s reputation:\u00a0Before using an online converter, research the site. Look for reviews and see if cybersecurity forums or sources have flagged it as unsafe. If the site lacks basic security measures, avoid it.",
      "3. Avoid downloading executable files:\u00a0If an online document converter provides an .exe, .bat or .scr file instead of a standard document format, do not download or run it. Legitimate converters should only generate files like .pdf, .docx or .png, not executables that could contain malware.",
      "4. Scan files after conversion: Even if you use a trusted converter, always scan the converted file with up-to-date\u00a0strong antivirus software before opening it.",
      "5. Check file permissions: After conversion, verify that the new file doesn't have unexpected permissions or properties that could indicate malware.",
      "6. Create backups and enable ransomware protection:\u00a0Regularly\u00a0back up important documents on an external drive or a secure cloud service. Some security suites, like Microsoft Defender, offer ransomware protection features that prevent unauthorized changes to your files.",
      "7. Be cautious of browser extensions: Avoid installing browser extensions for file conversion, as these can often be browser hijackers or adware.",
      "8. Consider paid services: If you frequently need to convert files, invest in a reputable paid service that offers better security and privacy protection.",
      "9. Use cloud-based solutions: Consider using cloud-based productivity suites that offer built-in conversion tools, reducing the need for third-party converters.",
      "FBI'S NEW WARNING ABOUT AI-DRIVEN SCAMS THAT ARE AFTER YOUR CASH",
      "Kurt\u2019s key takeaway",
      "The convenience of free online tools often blinds us to the risks they carry. Many users assume that if a website looks professional or ranks high on Google, it must be safe. Cybercriminals understand this mindset and take full advantage of it.",
      "The real issue is not just malware-laced converters but the habit of trading security for convenience without a second thought. The internet is filled with services that appear free but come at the hidden cost of stolen data, financial fraud or compromised devices. Instead of trusting every tool that offers an easy solution, it is important to think critically about what we are giving away whenever we upload a file or click a download button.",

      "5) Request data deletion: If you no longer wish for your data to be stored by 23andMe, request its deletion through your account settings. Ensure you also ask for the destruction of any physical samples.",
      "6) Use strong passwords and multifactor authentication:\u00a0Creating unique, complex passwords for each of your accounts and devices is essential. Avoid reusing passwords across multiple accounts; this kind of password reuse was a factor in the recent\u00a023andMe data breach. Enable two-factor authentication wherever it\u2019s offered to add an extra layer of security that helps prevent unauthorized access even if your password is compromised.\u00a0Check out my best expert-reviewed password managers for 2025 here.",
      "7) Monitor for suspicious activity and use identity theft protection: Genetic data leaks can lead to identity theft or medical fraud. Consider signing up for an identity theft protection service that monitors personal information, such as your Social Security number, phone number and email, alerting you if this data is found on the dark web. Some identity theft services also include up to $1 million in identity theft insurance to cover losses and legal fees and a dedicated fraud resolution team with a U.S.-based case manager to help you recover any stolen assets or identity.\u00a0See my expert recommendations here: Best identity theft protection services for 2025 here.",

    "summary": "Tech expert Kurt \u201cCyberGuy&quot; Knutsson says Apple&apos;s Passwords app had a three-month phishing flaw from iOS 18 to 18.2 patch.",
    "story": [
      "Tech expert Kurt Knutsson urges you to use Apple\u2019s App Privacy Report to see what your apps are really up to.",
      "Do you remember Apple\u2019s\u00a0\"Privacy. That's iPhone\" marketing campaigns? If you\u2019re not aware, the company likes to portray its products as being synonymous with privacy. However, the recent wave of security vulnerabilities affecting iPhones and Macs suggest Apple\u2019s products may not be as secure as advertised.",
      "A recent security blunder only reinforces this point. Security researchers discovered that Apple\u2019s built-in password manager app, Passwords, was vulnerable to phishing attacks for nearly three months after launch. This meant an attacker on the same Wi-Fi network as you, like at an airport or coffee shop, could redirect your browser to a lookalike phishing site to steal your login credentials.",

      "A person holding an iPhone (Kurt \"CyberGuy\" Knutsson)",
      "What you need to know",
      "Security researchers at\u00a0Mysk, noticed that Apple's Passwords app, introduced with iOS 18 in September 2024, had a significant security flaw that left users vulnerable to phishing attacks for nearly three months.",
      "The app used unencrypted HTTP connections instead of the more secure HTTPS to fetch logos and icons displayed alongside stored passwords. This allowed attackers on the same network, such as public Wi-Fi at a coffee shop or airport, to intercept these requests and potentially redirect users to phishing sites designed to steal login credentials.",
      "The issue remained unresolved from iOS 18\u2019s launch in September 2024 until Apple fixed it in December 2024, leaving users exposed for nearly three months. If someone opened the Passwords app and tapped a link, like \"Change Password,\" while connected to an insecure network, an attacker could intercept the request and redirect them to a fraudulent site mimicking a legitimate one, such as a fake Yelp login page. Since the app did not enforce HTTPS, users might not notice the switch, putting their sensitive information at risk.",

The iOS 18.2 update, released in December, patched the vulnerability by enforcing HTTPS for all network communications within the Passwords app, making it much harder for attackers to intercept or redirect traffic.",
      "If you\u2019re using an iPhone or iPad with the Passwords app, ensure your device is updated to iOS 18.2 or later. This ensures you\u2019re protected from this vulnerability. If you haven\u2019t updated yet and used the app on public Wi-Fi between September and December 2024, consider changing passwords for any accounts you accessed during that period, just to be safe.",

      "Apple's recent security blunder with the Passwords app highlights the importance of taking steps to protect your digital identity. Here are some ways you can stay safe from hackers targeting your passwords.",
      "1) Use a reliable password manager:\u00a0Apple apps are generally more secure than third-party options, but the Passwords app clearly wasn\u2019t. The fact that the security vulnerability existed for three months before Apple fixed it proves that Apple needs to put more emphasis on keeping customer data secure. I\u2019d suggest opting for a reliable password manager instead of relying on Apple\u2019s offering. Get more details about my\u00a0best expert-reviewed password managers of 2025 here.",
      "2) Enable two-factor authentication (2FA): It\u2019s good to have a password manager, but you know what\u2019s even better? 2FA.\u00a0Adding an extra layer of security with 2FA can prevent hackers from accessing your accounts, even if they steal your password. Use authentication apps like Google Authenticator, Microsoft Authenticator or hardware security keys instead of SMS-based codes, which are vulnerable to SIM-swapping attacks.",
      "3) Avoid public Wi-Fi for sensitive activities and use a VPN:\u00a0Hackers can exploit unsecured public networks to intercept your login credentials. If you must access sensitive accounts on\u00a0public Wi-Fi, use a VPN to encrypt your internet traffic and prevent attackers from snooping on your data. VPNs will protect you from those who want to track and identify your potential location and the websites that you visit. A reliable VPN is essential for protecting your online privacy and ensuring a secure, high-speed connection.\u00a0For the best VPN software, see my expert review of the best VPNs for browsing the web privately on your\u00a0Windows, Mac, Android and iOS devices.",
      "4) Beware of phishing attacks and install strong antivirus software:\u00a0You can have all the protection in the world but a phishing email or SMS can still cause havoc. Hackers often use fake login pages to trick you into entering your credentials. Always verify URLs before entering login details, avoid clicking on suspicious links in emails or messages. The best way to safeguard yourself from malicious links is to have antivirus software installed on all your devices. This protection can also alert you to phishing emails and ransomware scams, keeping your personal information and digital assets safe.\u00a0Get my picks for the best 2025 antivirus protection winners for your Windows, Mac, Android and iOS devices.",
      "5) Keep your devices updated: Regularly\u00a0update your devices and software to ensure you have the latest security patches.",
      "6) Regularly monitor all your accounts:\u00a0Monitor your accounts for suspicious activity and report any unusual transactions or login attempts to Apple.",
      "APPLE RELEASES EMERGENCY SECURITY UPDATE FOR SERIOUS VULNERABILITY",
      "Kurt's key takeaway",
      "Three months is a long time for a security flaw in a password manager to go unpatched, especially from a company that presents itself as a leader in privacy and security. This incident highlights a troubling reality. Apple\u2019s security measures are not infallible, and even built-in system apps can expose users to serious risks. While the fix eventually arrived, it should not have taken this long for such a fundamental issue to be addressed. If Apple wants to maintain its privacy-first image, it needs to do better by ensuring more rigorous security testing before launch.",

      "When President Donald Trump signed a sprawling election executive order this week, he set up his administration for a lengthy fight over documentary proof of citizenship, the power of the executive branch and existing federal election law.",
      "But in an overlooked portion of the order, he also set Elon Musk's Department of Government Efficiency on its next mission: hunting for voter fraud.",
      "The order directs the Department of Homeland Security to team up with DOGE to review states\u2019 \u201cpublicly available voter registration list and available records concerning voter list maintenance activities,\u201d and compare them against federal and state records in search of voter fraud committed by noncitizens \u2014 which is illegal and seldom occurs.",
      "It\u2019s not a small ask, and it\u2019s one Trump is familiar with. During his first term, a voting integrity commission led by then-Vice President Mike Pence and then-Kansas Secretary of State Kris Kobach attempted to assemble a national voter file back in 2017 in pursuit of fraud.",
      "It didn\u2019t pan out: 44 states and the District of Columbia refused to share at least some data, according to CNN, citing privacy concerns and balking at a federal commission wanting to hunt through voter information, despite little evidence that voter fraud exists.",
      "Even Republican state officials gave fiery refusals. \u201cThey can go jump in the Gulf of Mexico, and Mississippi is a great state to launch from,\u201d then-Mississippi Secretary of State Delbert Hosemann, a Republican, said at the time. In the end, the commission disbanded without ever finding proof of widespread fraud.",
      "It could serve as a potential cautionary tale for DOGE as it embarks on a similar mission.",
      "\u201cThe Pence-Kobach commission ran into a bunch of political resistance \u2014 but also legal resistance \u2014 whether it had the power to assemble a national voter file, and the answer was no. They never got a ruling on that from the courts, because enough secretaries of state said, \u2018Over my dead body,\u2019\u201d recalled Justin Levitt, a constitutional law scholar at Loyola Law School who was a voting rights adviser to the Biden administration.",
      "This time around, Trump seems keen on offering his team more aggressive tools to fuel its search, suggesting the use of \u201csubpoena where necessary and authorized by law\u201d and, in another portion of the order, suggesting that the federal government withhold law enforcement grants if states aren\u2019t amenable to sharing information about potential election law violations.",
      "\u201cI definitely see similarities, with the possibility of a lot more damage this time around,\u201d said Charles Stewart III, a professor at MIT who studies elections. DOGE, he warned, could end up crunching inadequate data and producing inaccurate results claiming fraud.",
      "\u201cStates are required to release their voter list to the public under the NVRA, the National Voter Registration Act. But states vary in what they release, and what they release to the public makes it difficult \u2014 if not impossible \u2014 to have high-quality matches to other databases,\u201d he said. \u201cNow you\u2019re left with amateurs in this business doing data matches.\u201d",
      "Comparing datasets from across the country that weren\u2019t built to comport with other states\u2019 data or federal immigration records could result in millions of bad matches and claims of fraud, he said.",
      "\u201cThe amount of just chaos that\u2019s going to ensue because of really terrible cross-state matches is going to be, I think could be \u2014 mind-boggling,\u201d he said.",
      "The White House declined to comment further on the executive order beyond a fact sheet it released.",
      "The order has led to familiar concerns among Democratic state election officials.",
      "\u201cIt sounds a lot like 2017 with the Pence-Kobach commission,\u201d recalled Minnesota Secretary of State Steve Simon, a Democrat. \u201cAnd Minnesota was one of many states that declined the request for data because there\u2019s private information in there on people that shouldn\u2019t be shared, that they don\u2019t want shared, that they didn\u2019t know when they signed up or registered to vote would be shared.\u201d",
      "Simon said he worried about the Trump\u2019s team\u2019s intentions \u2014 particularly after the executive order, which he said could turn  democracy into an obstacle course \u2014 and that it may try to \u201cbully\u201d states into providing voters\u2019 data.",
      "Simon also noted the limitations of the data he\u2019s required by law to present to the public.",
      "The voter file that\u2019s available to the public in Minnesota wouldn\u2019t give DOGE the kind of data it would need to truly review the state\u2019s voter files, Simon said.",
      "\u201cFor $46 you can get voter files in Minnesota, but there\u2019s a lot of data you don\u2019t get with that,\u201d he said. \u201cPolitical campaigns do it all the time. You get year of birth, but not date of birth. You don\u2019t get things like personal, identifying information. You don\u2019t get if someone registered using a driver\u2019s license, you don\u2019t get their driver\u2019s license number. You don\u2019t get things like that. You get the basics.\u201d",
      "Simon, who said he\u2019s considering litigation over the executive order, isn\u2019t the only one balking at the idea.",
      "\u201cIt is a huge violation of our citizens\u2019 privacy to suggest that DOGE or the federal government should have any right to access private information held by the states,\u201d said Maine Secretary of State Shenna Bellows, a Democrat who is also running for governor. \u201cEspecially when DOGE has such an abysmal record of keeping data safe.\u201d",
      "She added it was particularly frustrating to see this push after the Trump administration cut funding that went to help secure election cybersecurity.",
      "\u201cThe Trump administration and Elon Musk have eliminated all funding for these actual election security measures that really worked in 2024 in all 50 states,\u201d she said. \u201cThis executive order is the opposite of security in that it compromises citizen privacy and threatens to take away vital local law enforcement funding that would actually keep our election safe.\u201d"

      "The airline said it was aware of reports that a kite hit United Flight 654, and that the flight from Houston landed safely.",
      "\"Customers deplaned normally,\" it said, \"and upon inspection there was no damage to the aircraft.\"",

      "He said he spotted the United flight approaching and saw it hit the kite between an engine and the fuselage.",
      "The kite took a dive, he said, but reemerged in the air briefly before it was seen on the ground with a family, its string tangled and in a ball.",
      "Airport police arrived with emergency lights and sirens activated, and officers began interviewing the family \u2014 two adults and a child \u2014 as they took possession of the kite, Larounis said.",

    "story": [
      "San Bernardino County sheriff\u2019s deputies involved in a 2022 shootout along a California freeway that killed a teenage girl and her fugitive father will not face any criminal charges, state Attorney General Rob Bonta announced Friday.",
      "Bonta released a report compiled by the California Department of Justice following an investigation that included interviews with officers, witnesses who were driving along the road that day and family members who recalled that the man and his daughter had a close relationship.",
      "The attorney general called the incident a tragic situation with a tragic outcome.",
      "\u201cThis report was quite difficult to publish, and I sincerely hope it provides the community with the answers they\u2019ve been waiting for,\u201d Bonta said in a statement. \u201cThe California Department of Justice aims to partner with law enforcement to build a just and equitable legal environment, ensuring that the rule of law is upheld, and justice is accessible to everyone.\u201d",
      "Video and audio released by the San Bernardino County Sheriff\u2019s Department showed Savannah Graziano, 15, was shot and killed as she approached deputies amid a hail of gunfire on Sept. 27, 2022. The video footage recorded by a sheriff\u2019s helicopter and witness dashboard cameras was released in 2024 in response to public records requests made by The Associated Press and other media outlets.",
      "According to the Department of Justice review, 45-year-old Anthony Graziano drove off with his daughter after he shot and killed Tracy Martinez \u2014 his 45-year-old estranged wife \u2014 as she tried to flee from his pickup truck. Authorities said the teen was in the truck when her mother was shot, and an Amber Alert was issued.",
      "San Bernardino County deputies spotted the truck the next day, and a 41-mile pursuit ensued on Interstate 15. As Anthony Graziano was driving, authorities said numerous rounds were fired at deputies from the rear and passenger-side windows of the vehicle. Audio from the deputies\u2019 belt recorders included the sounds of rounds hitting their patrol vehicles. One deputy sustained gunshot wounds to his arm and to fingers on both of his hands.",
      "Authorities said shots continued to be fired from Graziano\u2019s truck after he drove off the freeway and up an embankment. About 65 spent casings and four firearms were found in the truck. The investigation also determined that 21 deputies returned fire.",
      "The report states that the vehicle came to a stop and the teen \u2014 wearing a tactical helmet and vest \u2014 got out of the front passenger door and initially crouched on the ground. She then got up and moved toward a deputy as he called out to her. She raised her right hand, and that is when other deputies opened fire, according to the report.",
      "Anthony Graziano was found dead in the driver\u2019s seat. Autopsy results showed he died from a gunshot wound to the head and also suffered gunshot wounds to his shoulder, lower back and leg. A toxicology report showed he had methamphetamine and amphetamine as well as morphine and hydrocodone in his blood and urine.",
      "No drugs or alcohol were found in Savannah Graziano\u2019s blood or urine. Her cause of death was listed as gunshot wounds.",
      "Gunshot residue was present in samples taken from the hands of both the teen and her father. The report notes that gunshot residue particles can be deposited by firing a firearm, being in proximity of a discharging firearm, or by handling a firearm or ammunition.",
      "The report states \u201cno conclusion\u201d can be drawn from the residue testing as to whether the teen or her father fired a firearm. But in attempting to recreate multiple shooting positions from inside the truck given the location of powder burns left by the muzzle of a rifle found in the vehicle, investigators found that the driver would not have been able to shoot the rifle and still maintain control of the gas and brake pedals.",
      "Prosecutors noted in the report that evidence suggested that deputies believed both Graziano and his daughter \u2014 who was experienced at handling firearms and had participated in firearms training drills with her father \u2014 posed an imminent threat and that the need to use lethal force was reasonable.",
      "Family members told authorities that Graziano had been living in his truck and that his daughter would often stay with him, sleeping in the truck next to a park. They said the teen was upset about her parents\u2019 divorce.",
      "The report also included recommendations related to training and dash-mounted and body-worn camera policies. The attorney general\u2019s office said the sheriff\u2019s department had implemented the training recommendations following the incident."

      "In the wide-ranging interview, Trump also discussed his commitment to annexing Greenland and reiterated that a military option was not off the table.",
      "Following a week of headlines about Signal, tariffs and Greenland, the president waved off concerns that his agenda is causing volatility on Wall Street or decreasing consumer confidence, pointing to polling that shows that the share of Americans who believe the country is on the right track is at record highs.",
      "\u201cWhat I see is right track, wrong track. And the right track was the first time in like 40 years where it was right track,\u201d the president said, at one point putting Alexander Stubb, the president of Finland, on the phone as well. The two men were golfing in Florida on Saturday.",
      "More from Trump\u2019s interview with NBC News:",
      "No concern if automakers raise their prices",
      "The president said he \u201ccouldn\u2019t care less\u201d if automakers raised prices after he announced he would impose 25% tariffs on all foreign-made automobiles.",
      "Asked what his recent message was to motor industry CEOs, and whether he had warned them against raising prices, Trump said, \u201cThe message is congratulations, if you make your car in the United States, you\u2019re going to make a lot of money. If you don\u2019t, you\u2019re going to have to probably come to the United States, because if you make your car in the United States, there is no tariff.\u201d",
      "When pressed if he told CEOs not to raise prices, as reported in the The Wall Street Journal, Trump added, \u201cNo, I never said that. I couldn\u2019t care less if they raise prices, because people are going to start buying American-made cars.\u201d",
      "Trump continued, \u201cI couldn\u2019t care less. I hope they raise their prices, because if they do, people are gonna buy American-made cars. We have plenty.\u201d",
      "Asked if he was concerned about car prices going up, Trump said, \u201cNo, I couldn\u2019t care less, because if the prices on foreign cars go up, they\u2019re going to buy American cars.\u201d",
      "After the interview, an aide to the president followed up with NBC News to say that Trump was referring specifically to foreign car prices.",
      "NBC News reported earlier this week that foreign auto parts would also be taxed at 25% even if the vehicles they go into are assembled domestically. Companies that import vehicles under the United States-Mexico-Canada Agreement (USMCA) will get special consideration until the government establishes a process for levying the 25% duties, according to the\u00a0 White House.",
      "Until that time, USMCA-compliant auto parts will remain tariff-free.",
      "The president also said the tariffs would be permanent.",
      "\u201cAbsolutely, they\u2019re permanent, sure. The world has been ripping off the United States for the last 40 years and more. And all we\u2019re doing is being fair, and frankly, I\u2019m being very generous,\u201d Trump said.",
      "Trump\u2019s tariff announcement on Wednesday came just weeks before his planned April 2 \u201cLiberation Day,\u201d when tariffs on a variety of consumer goods are set to take effect. They drew swift condemnation from international leaders like Japanese Prime Minister Shigeru Ishiba and Canadian Prime Minister Mark Carney.",
      "In remarks on Thursday, Carney told reporters the tariffs were \u201cunjustified\u201d and that \u201cthe old relationship we had with the United States based on deepening integration of our economies and tight security and military cooperation is over.\u201d",
      "Trump on Saturday maintained that he does not plan to further delay the imposition of the April 2 tariffs, and he would consider negotiating on that point \u201conly if people are willing to give us something of great value. Because countries have things of great value, otherwise, there\u2019s no room for negotiation.\u201d",
      "Signal incident",
      "Trump said he has no plans to fire anyone following news that national security adviser Michael Waltz added a journalist to a Signal app group chat with senior members of the Trump administration who were discussing plans to strike Houthi militants in Yemen earlier this month.",
      "\u201cI don\u2019t fire people because of fake news and because of witch hunts,\u201d Trump said, calling the story \u201cfake news\u201d throughout the interview.",
      "\u201cI do,\u201d the president said when asked whether he still has confidence in Waltz and Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth, who was also in the Signal chat and sent a detailed timeline of the planned strikes before they happened.",
      "\u201cI think it\u2019s just a witch hunt and the fake news, like you, talk about it all the time, but it\u2019s just a witch hunt, and it shouldn\u2019t be talked [about],\u201d Trump added. \u201cWe had a tremendously successful strike. We struck very hard and very lethal. And nobody wants to talk about that. All they want to talk about is nonsense. It\u2019s fake news.\u201d",
      "Trump\u2019s comments come as he has faced calls \u2014 including from his allies \u2014 to fire Waltz after The Atlantic\u2019s editor-in-chief Jeffrey Goldberg wrote on Monday that he had been added to a chat group on a private messaging app with senior administration officials.",
      "In the chat, the officials appeared to discuss their plans to strike Houthi rebels, which the Trump administration has since repeatedly claimed were not classified.",
      "\u201cI have no idea what Signal is. I don\u2019t care what Signal is,\u201d Trump said on Saturday. \u201cAll I can tell you is it\u2019s just a witch hunt, and it\u2019s the only thing the press wants to talk about, because you have nothing else to talk about. Because it\u2019s been the greatest 100-day presidency in the history of our country.\u201d",
      "Everything is on the table to obtain Greenland",
      "The president on Saturday also said he has \u201cabsolutely\u201d had real conversations about annexing Greenland, which is currently a semiautonomous Danish territory.",
      "\u201cWe\u2019ll get Greenland. Yeah, 100%,\u201d Trump said.",
      "He added that there\u2019s a \u201cgood possibility that we could do it without military force\u201d but that \u201cI don\u2019t take anything off the table.\u201d",
      "This comes one day after Vice President JD Vance visited Greenland with his wife, Usha, and spoke to service members at Pituffik Space Base, a U.S. Space Force base on the northwestern coast of Greenland.",
      "While there, Vance said, \u201cOur message to Denmark is very simple \u2014 you have not done a good job by the people of Greenland.\u201d",
      "Asked what message acquiring Greenland would send to Russia and the rest of the world, Trump said, \u201cI don\u2019t really think about that. I don\u2019t really care. Greenland\u2019s a very separate subject, very different. It\u2019s international peace. It\u2019s international security and strength.\u201d",
      "\u201cYou have ships sailing outside Greenland from Russia, from China and from many other places. And we\u2019re not going to allow things to happen that are going to be \u2014 that are going to hurt the world or the United States,\u201d he added.",
      "CLARIFICATION: This article was updated to reflect that after the interview, an aide to Trump followed up with NBC News to say that Trump was referring to foreign car prices."

    "story": [
      "Hamas has agreed to a ceasefire proposal it received from mediators, the group\u2019s leader in Gaza said Saturday.",
      "\"Two days ago, we received a proposal from our mediating brothers,\" the leader, Khalil al-Hayya, said during a speech. \"We dealt with it positively and approved it. We hope that the occupation will not obstruct it and thwart the mediators\u2019 efforts.\"",
      "While the details of the ceasefire proposal were not immediately available, al-Hayya said Egypt suggested the formation of \"a community support committee to manage the Gaza Strip.\"",
      "\"This committee would bear full responsibility for the Strip in all areas,\" he said. \"It would be composed of independent national figures, and they would assume their duties immediately upon reaching an agreement to block any propaganda that the enemy might practice.\"",
      "Egypt had not released any comment about the proposed details Saturday, but its State Information Service said Friday that its minister of foreign affairs and emigration spoke with his Turkish counterpart to discuss ceasefire efforts.",
      "Israel has submitted a counterproposal to mediators after Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu \"held a series of consultations yesterday,\" according to his office, adding that it is \"in full coordination with the United States.\"",
      "It is not clear what, if any, objections Israel has to the ceasefire proposal.",
      "If adopted, this ceasefire would come after Israel broke a previously-established ceasefire with Hamas, launching a barrage of deadly airstrikes at Gaza and killing more than 400 people. That ceasefire agreement had gone into effect on Jan. 19.",
      "Israel blamed Hamas for the attack, citing the group\u2019s\u00a0refusal to meet Israel\u2019s demand\u00a0to release more hostages in return for the resumption of talks.",
      "But that was not part of that original ceasefire agreement, which included a first phase, where Hamas released 25 living hostages and the bodies of eight in exchange for around 1,800 of Palestinian prisoners by March 1. The second phase was meant to begin 16 days later and would have included the exchange of all the remaining hostages and the establishment of a permanent ceasefire.",
      "The second phase never came. Netanyahu accepted a plan by Steve Witkoff, President Donald Trump's special envoy to the Middle East, to extend the ceasefire for 50 days to discuss phase two, which Hamas rejected.",
      "After Hamas' rejection, Israel blocked the flow of aid and goods into Gaza and eventually hit the enclave with airstrikes on the night of March 18. In remarks following the airstrikes, Netanyahu said \"this is just the beginning.\"",
      "The strikes ended nearly two months of relative peace between Israel and Hamas.",
      "It is not clear how the new ceasefire proposal differs from the last, or whether Hamas will accept Israel's counterproposal."

      "If you\u2019ve inherited an\u00a0individual retirement account, you may have big plans for the balance \u2014 but costly mistakes can quickly shrink the windfall, experts say.",
      "Many investors roll pre-tax 401(k) plans into\u00a0traditional IRAs, which trigger\u00a0regular income taxes\u00a0on future withdrawals. The\u00a0tax rules are complicated\u00a0for the heirs who inherit these IRAs.",
      "The\u00a0average IRA balance\u00a0was $127,534 during the fourth quarter of 2024, up 38% from 2014, based on a Fidelity analysis of 16.8 million IRA accounts as of Dec. 31.",
      "But some inherited accounts are significantly larger, and errors can be expensive, said IRA expert Denise Appleby, CEO of Appleby Retirement Consulting in Grayson, Georgia.",
      "More from CNBC:",
      "This inherited IRA rule change for 2025 could trigger a 25% tax penalty Half of parents still financially support adult children, report finds Treasury scraps reporting rule for U.S. small business owners",

      "Half of parents still financially support adult children, report finds",
      "Treasury scraps reporting rule for U.S. small business owners",
      "Here are some big inherited IRA mistakes and how to avoid them, according to financial experts.",
      "What to know about the \u201910-year rule\u2019",
      "Before the\u00a0Secure Act\u00a0of 2019, heirs could empty inherited IRAs over their lifetime to reduce yearly taxes, known as the \u201cstretch IRA.\u201d",
      "But since 2020, certain heirs must follow the \u201c10-year rule,\u201d and IRAs must be depleted by the 10th year after the original account owner\u2019s death. This applies to beneficiaries who are not a spouse, minor child, disabled, chronically ill or certain trusts.",
      "Many heirs still don\u2019t know how the 10-year rule works, and that can cost them, Appleby said.",
      "If you don\u2019t drain the balance within 10 years, there\u2019s a 25% IRS penalty on the amount you should have withdrawn, which could be reduced or eliminated if you fix the issue within two years.",
      "Inherited IRAs are a \u2018ticking tax bomb\u2019",
      "For pre-tax inherited IRAs, one big mistake could be waiting until the 10th year to withdraw most of the balance, said certified financial planner Trevor Ausen, founder of Authentic Life Financial Planning in Minneapolis.",
      "\u201cFor most, it\u2019s a ticking tax bomb,\u201d and the extra income in a single year could push you into a \u201cmuch higher tax bracket,\u201d he said.",
      "Similarly, some heirs cash out an inherited IRA soon after receiving it without weighing the tax consequences, according to IRA expert and certified public accountant Ed Slott. This move could also bump you into a higher tax bracket, depending on the size of your IRA.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s like a smash and grab,\u201d he said.",
      "Rather than depleting the IRA in one year, advisors typically run multi-year tax projections to help heirs decide when to strategically take funds from the inherited account.",
      "Generally, it\u2019s better to spread out withdrawals over 10 years or take funds if there\u2019s a period when your income is lower, depending on tax brackets, experts say.",
      "Many heirs must take RMDs in 2025",
      "Starting in 2025, most non-spouse heirs must take\u00a0required minimum distributions, or RMDs, while emptying inherited IRAs over 10 years, if the original account owner reached RMD age before death, according to\u00a0final regulations\u00a0released in July.",
      "That could surprise some beneficiaries since the IRS previously\u00a0waived penalties\u00a0for missed RMDs from inherited IRAs, experts say.",
      "While your custodian calculates your RMD, there are instances where it could be inaccurate, Appleby explained.",
      "For example, there may be mistakes if you rolled over a balance in December or there\u2019s a big age difference between you and your spouse.",
      "\u201cYou need to communicate those things to your tax advisor,\u201d she said.",
      "Generally, you\u00a0calculate RMDs\u00a0for each account by dividing your prior Dec. 31 balance by a \u201clife expectancy factor\u201d provided by the IRS.",
      "If you skip RMDs or don\u2019t withdraw enough in 2025, you could see a 25% IRS penalty on the amount you should have withdrawn, or 10% if fixed within two years.",
      "But the agency could waive the fee \u201cif you act quickly enough\u201d by sending\u00a0Form 5329\u00a0and attaching a letter of explanation, Appleby said.",
      "\u201cFix it the first year and tell the IRS you\u2019re going to make sure it doesn\u2019t happen again,\u201d she said."

      "According to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, nearly half of adults in the U.S. have hypertension; among them, less than 1 in 4 have their blood pressure under control.",
      "Hypertension is diagnosed when a person has a blood pressure of 130/80 mm Hg or higher. A systolic measurement between 120 and 129 mm Hg is considered to be elevated. A normal measurement is 120/80 mm Hg or below.",
      "Uncontrolled hypertension \u2014 which Laffin defined as a measurement of 130/80 mm Hg or higher even with medication \u2014 is linked to a higher risk of heart attacks, strokes, heart failure and kidney failure.",
      "Among patients taking medication for hypertension, the rate of control is 60% to 70%, said Dr. Ajay Kirtane, a cardiologist and professor of medicine at the Columbia University Vagelos College of Physicians and Surgeons in New York City, who wasn\u2019t involved with the research. That leaves 30% to 40% of patients who need another option.",
      "Lorundrostat is meant for this group of patients. The drug, part of a class called aldosterone synthase inhibitors, works by blocking the adrenal glands\u2019 synthesis of a hormone called aldosterone, which controls the amount of salt retained by the body. When aldosterone is reduced, so are salt levels and therefore blood pressure.",
      "To test the safety and efficacy of lorundrostat, Laffin and his colleagues recruited 285 adults with uncontrolled hypertension whose average age was 60. More than half (53%) of the participants were Black.",
      "Black patients are among those most at risk, Laffin said. About 55% of Black adults have high blood pressure, according to the American Heart Association.",
      "Dr. Oscar Cingolani, director of the hypertension program at Johns Hopkins Medicine, said the inclusion of so many Black patients is \u201ca big, big thing,\u201d noting that \u201cAfrican Americans \u2026 tend to be more responsive to this pathway.\u201d",
      "All of the patients in the trial were already taking a mix of blood pressure drugs. When the trial began, the researchers standardized those treatments by putting all of the patients on two or three specific medications. Three weeks later, they randomly assigned the participants to get either a placebo or one of two doses of lorundrostat for the next 12 weeks.",
      "At three points, the participants wore a blood pressure cuff for a 24-hour period: at the beginning, four weeks after treatment started and then again at 12 weeks.",
      "Participants taking the lower dose of lorundrostat, 50 milligrams, plus standard medications saw an average systolic blood pressure decrease of 15.4 points, while the group receiving the placebo plus standard drugs saw a decrease of 7.4 points \u2014 so the drug-related decrease in blood pressure after accounting for the placebo response was 8 points.",
      "Increasing the dose of the drug didn\u2019t improve the results.",
      "While the placebo response may seem high, it\u2019s most likely due to people being in a study and having the attention of health professionals, making them more scrupulous about taking their medications, experts said.",
      "With a decrease of 8 points, say from 170 to 162, \u201cthat is the range where you would in a longer-term study see reductions in heart attacks and strokes,\u201d said Dr. Deepak Bhatt, director of the Mount Sinai Fuster Heart Hospital in New York City.",
      "Aldosterone synthase inhibitors are a new class of drugs, some of which are closer to being considered for approval by the Food and Drug Administration than others, Bhatt said. One other, baxdrostat, is currently in Phase 3 trials.",
      "Lorundrostat has shown promise in the three levels of clinical trials needed for approval. The last one, the Phase 3 trial, is completed, though the results haven\u2019t been published yet, Laffin said. The researchers are working on the trials with drugmaker Mineralys Therapeutics, which funded the trials.",
      "The drug could potentially be available within 12 to 18 months, Laffin said.",
      "Patients in the trial who got lorundrostat were more likely than those who got the placebo to develop high potassium levels. That\u2019s something patients\u2019 doctors would need to keep an eye out for, Bhatt said, because it can lead to abnormal heart rhythms.",
      "Cingolani, of Johns Hopkins, said he would like to see long-term studies on the new medication and also ones that could compare lorundrostat to an older medication that works by blocking the receptor for aldosterone."

      "All but a small group of U.S. Institute of Peace employees received formal termination notices Friday evening, effective immediately, individuals familiar told NBC News.",
      "This ends the employment of almost everyone at the USIP building on Constitution Avenue in Washington, D.C. The employees who remain active may include senior officials who are expected to help shutter offices overseas, as well as some human resources officials, all of whom are expected to be ultimately terminated.",
      "The move comes just weeks after U.S. District Judge Beryl Howell\u00a0chastised members of the Department of Government Efficiency, which is led by tech mogul Elon Musk, for how it forcefully entered the USIP building with armed law enforcement officers earlier this month.",
      "Howell\u2019s comments came as she denied representatives of USIP a temporary restraining order against the Trump administration after several USIP staffers sued to stop DOGE from dismantling the group and to reinstate leaders in the organization who were removed and replaced.",
      "In her denial of a temporary restraining order earlier this month, Howell noted that USIP is a \u201cvery complicated entity\u201d because it is not a federal agency but rather a nonprofit organization funded by Congress.",
      "\u201cI am very offended by how DOGE has operated at the institute and treated American citizens trying to do a job that they were statutorily tasked to do,\u201d Howell said. \u201cBut that concern about how this has gone down is not one that can sway me in the factors of a TRO.\u201d",
      "George M. Foote, outside general counsel to USIP, wrote in a statement Saturday night that the \"dismissal of U.S. Institute of Peace employees in the dark of night is unconscionable and deeply troubling. The Institute\u2019s employees are fiercely dedicated to their important work, and they don\u2019t deserve to be treated with such disrespect.\"",
      "Foote added: \"This action only adds urgency to the complaint that has been filed to halt and reverse the Administration\u2019s unlawful attempt to dismantle the Institute.\u00a0We will continue to press this matter in court, where we are confident we will prevail.\u201d",
      "The lawsuit also sought to reinstate USIP\u2019s former board members, whom President Donald Trump replaced with Secretary of State Marco Rubio, Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth and others ahead of DOGE\u2019s attempted takeover of the agency.",
      "Part of the government\u2019s argument against this lawsuit was that the plaintiffs did not have standing to sue, given that they were removed from USIP\u2019s board and from leadership positions in the organization and replaced.",
      "\u201cThe former acting president [of USIP], Mr. George E. Moose, no longer has any authority to [file a lawsuit]. Whether Moose\u2019s removal was proper, or not, is not at issue in this suit as Moose is not a party, and no plaintiff purports to assert claims based on supposed injuries to him,\u201d the government wrote in its argument against a temporary restraining order."

      "SALT LAKE CITY \u2014 Utah became the first state to prohibit flying LGBTQ+ pride flags at schools and all government buildings after the Republican governor announced he was allowing a ban on unsanctioned flag displays to become law without his signature.",
      "Gov. Spencer Cox, who made the announcement late Thursday night, said he continues to have serious concerns with the policy but chose not to reject it because his veto would likely be overridden by the Republican-controlled Legislature.",
      "Starting May 7, state or local government buildings will be fined $500 a day for flying any flag other than the United States flag, the Utah state flag, military flags or a short list of others approved by lawmakers. Political flags supporting a certain candidate or party, such as President Donald Trump\u2019s signature \u201cMake America Great Again\u201d flags, are not allowed.",
      "The new law could stoke conflict between the state and its largest city. City buildings in liberal Salt Lake City typically honor Pride Month each June by displaying flags that celebrate its large LGBTQ+ population. Local leaders have illuminated the Salt Lake City and County Building in rainbow lights to protest the flag ban each night since the Legislature sent it to Cox\u2019s desk.",
      "Andrew Wittenberg, a spokesperson for Salt Lake City Mayor Erin Mendenhall\u2019s office, said their attorneys are evaluating the law and the capital city does not yet have information on what it will do once the law takes effect.",
      "The bill\u2019s Republican sponsors, Rep. Trevor Lee and Sen. Dan McCay, said it\u2019s meant to encourage \u201cpolitical neutrality\u201d from teachers and other government employees. Opponents argued it aims to erase LGBTQ+ expression and take authority away from cities and towns that don\u2019t align politically with the Republican Legislature.",
      "In a letter to legislative leaders explaining his decision, Cox said he agreed with the \u201cunderlying intent\u201d of the bill to make classrooms politically neutral but thought it went too far in regulating local governments. He also noted that by focusing narrowly on flags, the law does not prevent other political displays such as posters or lighting.",
      "\u201cTo our LGBTQ community, I know that recent legislation has been difficult,\u201d Cox said. \u201cPolitics can be a bit of a blood sport at times and I know we\u2019ve had our disagreements. I want you to know that I love and appreciate you and I am grateful that you are part of our state. I know these words may ring hollow to many of you, but please know that I mean them sincerely.\u201d",
      "Cox\u2019s decision came hours after the Sundance Film Festival announced it was leaving its home of four decades in Park City, Utah, for Boulder, Colorado. The flag bill created eleventh-hour tensions as some residents worried it would push the nation\u2019s premier independent film festival out of state. Festival leaders said state politics ultimately did not influence their move from conservative Utah to liberal Colorado. They did, however, make \u201cethos and equity values\u201d one of their criteria in a nationwide search for a new home and referred to Boulder in their announcement as a \u201cwelcoming environment.\u201d",
      "Utah\u2019s flag law goes further than one signed last week in Idaho that only applies to schools. But Idaho Republicans are also advancing a separate bill to ban government buildings from displaying certain flags.",
      "Florida lawmakers have advanced a proposal to ban pride flags and others that represent political viewpoints in schools and public buildings after similar measures failed in the past two legislative sessions. Some federal agencies, including the Department of Veterans Affairs, also have limited which flags can fly at their facilities.",
      "Other flags permitted under the Utah law include Olympic and Paralympic flags, official college or university flags, tribal flags and historic versions of other approved flags that might be used for educational purposes."

      "The measure, which sparked hourslong hearings and protests attended by hundreds of demonstrators, was a priority of the GOP-supermajority Legislature, after dying amid partisan infighting last session. This year, it moved quickly. After being introduced in January, it cleared the Senate in February, cleared the Ohio House with changes 59-34 last week, and was given final approval on a 20-11 vote in the Senate on Wednesday.",
      "Besides banning DEI programs and rescinding certain collective bargaining and tenure protections for faculty, the new law also will make schools promise not to influence student views on \u201ccontroversial\u201d topics, require every Ohio college student to take a three-hour civics education course and impose dozens of other programmatic and administrative changes. Schools that violate its provisions will risk losing their state funding.",
      "The bill\u2019s sponsor, state Sen. Jerry Cirino, a Cleveland-area Republican, had said the bill aims to protect \u201cintellectual diversity,\u201d not dampen it. During Senate debate on the bill in February, Cirino called DEI a \u201cdebacle\u201d that \u201chas morphed into institutional discrimination\u201d against conservative perspectives.",
      "\u201cIt was a long, hard road but well worth the effort,\u201d Cirino said in a statement Friday. \u201cI believe this is monumentally significant legislation that will allow Ohio\u2019s public universities and community colleges to deal with looming enrollment challenges and usher in a renaissance of academic excellence.\u201d",
      "Republican President Donald Trump has made the same argument as he has taken aim at DEI programs at the federal level, to the relief and delight of many conservatives.",
      "A group of federal employees targeted for dismissal because of their involvement in such activities has filed a class-action complaint against the administration. And on Thursday, a federal judge temporarily blocked another of the president\u2019s DEI-related executive orders affecting federal contractors and grant recipients.",
      "ACLU of Ohio Policy Director Jocelyn Rosnick said the bill \u201csends a clear, harmful message to students that their unique backgrounds, experiences, and perspectives are not welcome in Ohio.\u201d",
      "\u201cFurther, the exceedingly vague and contradictory language regarding the banning of so-called \u2018controversial beliefs or policies\u2019 creates a slippery slope for faculty and administration,\u201d she said in a statement. \u201cThis could lead to faculty avoiding any such topics in classrooms for fear of retaliation.\u201d"

      "Lawrence explained that once he started acting in the early '80s, he was told, \u201cNo one can pronounce Mignogna. That\u2019s not a name people will say,\" so he decided to use Lawrence as his last name instead.",
      "However, the \"Blossom\" star said he realizes how much times have changed since then.",
      "\u201cToday, things like that are celebrated,\u201d he said. \u201cIn the \u201880s, it was like, \u2018We\u2019re going to need to water this down. There are silent Gs.\u2019\"",
      "After entering Hollywood as Joey Lawrence, Lawrence said it only \"made sense\u201d\u00a0for his brothers Matthew, 45, and Andrew, 37, to change their last names too once they started acting.",
      "One benefit that the trio got from their new names was privacy, Lawrence said.",
      "\u201cThere was an insulation factor,\u201d he explained. \u201cSome people might check in old school ways, but it would be very, very hard to find us. That was a great thing.\u201d",
      "But, after realizing there were disadvantages to having two last names, including issues traveling internationally and having to \"prove\" who you are, Lawrence and his brothers agree that it would have been \u201ceasier\u201d just to keep their last names.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s really a pain in the butt, honestly, like having two names. You have to prove you\u2019re both people,\u201d Andrew Lawrence said.",
      "Matthew Lawrence added, \u201cEven for a while there the government only recognized me as Matt Lawrence because I paid taxes from the time I was a toddler to 18 as Matt Lawrence.\u201d",
      "\u201cBut really my name is Matthew William Mignogna,\u201d he continued. \u201cSo when I grew up and used my real name on my passport, there was absolutely no correlation. I didn\u2019t exist.\u201d"

      "In the video, an elderly-appearing Grande is wheeled into a futuristic facility where she's allowed to view four stored memories for the last and final time. If that premise sounds a little like the 2004 film \"Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind,\" you're spot-on. She's playing Peaches again, a character she originally portrayed in last year's \"We Can't Be Friends (Wait for Your Love),\" only this is a much older version.",
      "The \"Spotless\" connection is a natural; \"Brighter Days\" is a companion piece of art connected to her \"Eternal Sunshine Deluxe: Brighter Days Ahead\" album, which came out in March. The short film is directed by Grande and Christian Breslauer (who also directed videos for \"We Can't Be Friends\" and \"The Boy Is Mine,\" which also released in 2024, as Rolling Stone reports).",
      "In the video, memories are released like clear lottery balls down a ramp.  Viewers then see everything from old family home movies (it's hard to determine how much, if any, of them are actually Grande's real-life home movies) to a modern day Grande singing \"Eternal Sunshine.\" She also gives young-Grande takes on recent songs \"Dandelion,\" \"Twilight Zone,\" \"Supernatural,\" and \"Hampstead,\" all of which tell different pieces of her history.",
      "The description in the YouTube video notes that it's been 70 years since Peaches was last seen (in her previous video), and she's returned to Brighter Days for her memory visit.",
      "\"As Peaches embarks on this immersive journey, we watch her confront and heal certain wounds (personal and professional alike) that have made her who she is today,\" the description reads.",
      "\"She reconnects with her younger self who had been patiently in the wings for over a decade, as she works her way through the challenges of fame (she is the daughter of the very famous Brighter Days Inc. founder/doctor), personal sensationalism (resulting in being torn apart by stray cats), and generational trauma,\" the description continues. \"In the end, with the help of her loved ones and art, she is able to come home to herself. She would do anything to experience it all again. However, there\u2019s one catch: once a memory is relived, it is erased forever.\"",
      "And stay tuned until after the fourth memory is destroyed in the short film for a delightful last comment.",
      "But why riff so hard on the Jim Carrey/Kate Winslet movie? As Grande told Apple Music in a 2024 interview, the mix of romance and memory was extremely powerful for her.",
      "\"I think the movie is so beloved because so many people can relate to knowing that something isn't right, but loving so much, and wanting to stay, and wanting to figure it out, and that cycle that can happen in the film,\" she said. \"I think that's why the film is so beloved. It's because so many people can relate to it, and I think it kind of fell into place that these songs had little tidbits of that theme. I just felt really inspired by it.\"",
      "Grande is on quite a roll, thanks in part not just to the \u201cEternal Sunshine\u201d release (and the \u201cDeluxe\u201d addition), but she was also nominated for an Academy Award in early 2025 for her work in \u201cWicked.\u201d"

      "And its author, Brigitte Knightley, had no idea \u2014 at first.",
      "Knightley started posting the eventual 199,000-word story in October 2021 under the username \"isthisselfcare.\" The final chapter was published in April 2022. After, she wrote a goodbye message to readers and signed out.",
      "A few months later, Knightley logged into her email linked to her account on Archive of Our Own, a fan fiction website.",
      "\"I had like thousands of emails,\" Knightley tells TODAY.com. \"I start looking through them, and there are literary agents writing me emails, and there are publishing houses writing me emails.\"",
      "She ended up signing with book agent Thao Le, who also represents Ali Hazelwood, another fan fiction to traditional publication success story. Knightley has been writing fan fiction for about 25 years, she says.",
      "\"I would be watching shows or media or something, and I'd be like, 'You know what? I don't think those two characters should have ended up together. And I think I could write something better, pairing them with someone else,'\" she says. \"It was this urge to sort of, maybe, 'fix' things, or explore things that the canon hadn't quite done for me.\"",
      "One example? The first \"Pirates of the Caribbean\" film. Knightley says it \"annoyed (her) to no end\" that heroine Elizabeth Swann ended up with Will Turner.",
      "\"She should have ended up with a pirate,\" Knightley says.",
      "For Knightley, the best romances have a bit of \"antagonism.\" So when she re-read the \"Harry Potter\" series over the winter of 2020, she saw the potential for the characters of Draco Malfoy, one of the main villains in the series, and Hermione Granger, Harry Potter's brave, know-it-all best friend, to have a \"quintessential enemies-to-lovers dynamic.\"",
      "\"Draco Malfoy and the Mortifying Ordeal of Being in Love\" was the first \"Harry Potter\" fan fiction she wrote. (Across fandoms, \"I think I've written about 2 million words of fan fic over the past 20 years,\" she notes.) The story strikes the tone of a romantic comedy and imagines Hermione as a valuable healer and Draco, her former nemesis from their time at Hogwarts, as an Auror (essentially a magical law enforcement official) assigned to protect her.",
      "When she finished the story, Knightley recalls feeling happy with it. But she was left with an \"itch,\" she says.",
      "\"That was an enemies-to-lovers story of two people who had a really rough history,\" she says. \"I wanted enemies to lovers that were like systemically enemies to lovers. I wanted them to hate each other just by virtue of what they were.\"",
      "The result is \"The Irresistible Urge to Fall in Love,\" which she describes not as an adaptation of her fan fiction but an original work that is \"Dramione-coded\" or has \"Dramione vibes.\"",
      "\u201cI wrote it because I came off a fan fic, and I was like, 'OK, I did that dynamic, but I'm looking for this other one.' And I didn\u2019t have, for once in my life, some sort of IP in mind,\u201d she says. \"So it really was written as an original work.\"",
      "\"The Irresistible Urge to Fall for Your Enemy\" is a slow burn romantic fantasy that follows an ailing assassin, Osric, who has to seek help from a healer named Aurienne, even though their respective orders \u2014\u00a0the Fyren and Haelan, respectively \u2014 are opposites in every way.",
      "The book, which comes out July 8, will kick off the \"Dearly Beloathed\" duology.",
      "The romance is a true slow burn \u2014\u00a0\"They think about killing each other like for the first 10 chapters,\" Knightley says \u2014\u00a0and is set in a version of 19th century England with a form of magic called seith.",
      "Fans of \"Draco Malfoy and the Mortifying Ordeal of Being in Love,\" never fear: Knightley's original fan fiction will stay up on Archive of Our Own.",
      "While having a markedly different plot, \"The Irresistible Urge to Fall For Your Enemy\" will hit all her signature \"beats,\" Knightley says.",
      "\"I always have these steps of like denial and yearning and will they/ won't they ... It's similar to all of my slow burns, not specifically 'Mortifying,'\" Knightley says.",
      "\"When I get to write a stupid idiot who's in denial about his feelings, I am so happy,\" she adds.",
      "Read an excerpt of \u2018The Irresistible Urge to Fall For Your Enemy\u2019",
      "In the following excerpt, Osric (a member of the Fyren Order of assassins) goes to meet Aurienne (a member of the Haelan Order of scholar-healers). She has \u2014 tersely \u2014 ordered him to join her at a clinic so she can assess his illness. He is furious to have been abruptly summoned, especially in daylight. She is aggravated to have to work with a morally bankrupt assassin. The\u00a0ensuing conversation goes as well as you\u2019d imagine... - Brigitte Knightley",
      "Osric, provoked, took the nearest waystone to the designated pub. First, he was at nobody\u2019s beck and call, least of all this priggish Haelan\u2019s. Second, it was broad daylight, and he hated operating in broad day- light. Third, between the name of the pub and the signs for a clinic for spotty bums that he was now following through this gods-forsaken little hamlet, he rather felt that she was taking the piss.",
      "The villagers puttering about gave Osric startled looks as he stalked through the hamlet\u2019s streets, his hood up, his greatcoat flaring behind him.",
      "What part of my condition mustn\u2019t be discovered hadn\u2019t this idiot understood?",
      "He found the final spotty-bum sign and knocked upon the clinic door.",
      "The idiot opened the door.",
      "Fairhrim\u2019s greeting consisted of a look. There was a lot in it; she looked at Osric as though he were a wart that had acquired sufficient sentience to knock on doors.",
      "\u201cAre you bloody serious?\u201d asked Osric.",
      "Fairhrim, taken aback by the wart\u2019s rudeness, straightened. \u201cExcuse me?\u201d",
      "\u201cSummoning me? In broad daylight? In a public place? I told you that my condition mustn\u2019t be discovered.\u201d",
      "\u201cIt hasn\u2019t been discovered,\u201d said Fairhrim. \u201cYou\u2019re hooded up like death personified. And anyone who did see you will think you\u2019re suffer- ing from folliculitis.\u201d",
      "Osric pointed at one of the overly detailed posters that had haunted his walk. \u201cYou had to choose arse acne?\u201d",
      "\u201cTo guarantee us privacy,\u201d said Fairhrim. She held the door open. \u201cGet in.\u201d",
      "Osric stepped into the tired little consultation room. The place was lit with new electric lights far too bright for his liking. There was an examination table against the wall. Miscellaneous medical parapherna- lia was scattered about, looking both curative and foreboding, rather like Fairhrim herself.",
      "Her travelling cloak was clasped shut with a silver wing. She re- moved it to reveal her stiff Haelan dress, high about the neck and impec- cably white, save for the sharp silver epaulettes.",
      "\u201cAlso,\u201d said Osric, removing his own cloak, \u201cI\u2019m not at your beck and call. Don\u2019t summon me like this again.\u201d",
      "Fairhrim grew rigid. She turned to him and spoke with a false sort of brightness. \u201cOh? And I\u2019m at yours, am I? You can impose meetings on me, in abandoned barns, at midnight, without offering me any kind of alternative, but meeting during perfectly normal hours under a per- fectly well-thought-out pretext in a perfectly suitable location presents difficulties, does it? I showed your schedule the same respect you showed mine; didn\u2019t you like it?\u201d",
      "She fixed him with a Look. Osric developed a new understanding of what gimlet-eyed meant.",
      "Osric decided not to die on this particular hill. \u201cPerhaps we can each make improvements to our scheduling habits when it comes to the other\u2019s calendar.\u201d",
      "\u201cA compromise?\u201d asked Fairhrim.",
      "\u201cYes,\u201d said Osric, assuming that this was a positive thing.",
      "It was not. Fairhrim sniffed in Osric\u2019s direction, as though manure from the barn still wafted from him. \u201cI\u2019ve compromised enough just being here today. But, nevertheless, we can compromise. Now, disrobe.\u201d",
      "\u201cI\u2014what?\u201d",
      "\u201cDisrobe,\u201d repeated Fairhrim. Then, slower: \u201cRemove your clothes.",
      "There are gowns in the cupboard. I\u2019ll be back in a minute.\u201d",
      "She left the room before Osric could make an argument. Nudity in the face of her ongoing animosity felt unwise. But refusal felt\u2014well, pathetic. She was only a Haelan and she was by herself.",
      "Was she by herself? What if she came back with a Warden when he was stark bollock naked? She reeked of hostility.",
      "He would keep his weapons close at hand.",
      "Osric began to undress. This was no small task. After much unclip- ping, unbelting, and unstrapping, he removed the following inventory from his person: twelve throwing knives, his blaecblade, two back- swords, one amputator, and, finally, a dozen syringes and vials contain- ing substances as nasty as they were illegal.",
      "These items he placed upon the examination table with care.",
      "He was less precious about his clothes: waistcoat, shirt, collar, cra- vat, trousers, underthings, and boots were all tossed towards a chair.",
      "Osric opened the cupboard to discover that the gowns were, judging by their colour and size, intended for little girls, rather than men who liked to cultivate an air of sinister elegance.",
      "He pulled a faded pink thing on, which, when placed over his head, left his dangly bits exposed.",
      "He decided to wrap the gown around his hips like some sort of kilt.",
      "Thus attired, he leaned against a cabinet, looking as suave as one could in a strip of puce-coloured linen, to await Fairhrim\u2019s return.",
      "He felt, once again, that Fairhrim was taking the piss. No one took the piss out of Osric Mordaunt with this level of frequency and noncha- lance. She was lucky that she was necessary to him at this moment; he would\u2019ve murdered her for the cheek otherwise.",
      "The Means to an End knocked, and her crisp voice asked, \u201cReady?\u201d \u201cYes,\u201d said Osric. Should the Haelan have brought company to at- tack him while he was naked, he had throwing knives threaded between his fingers.",
      "Fairhrim swept into the room. Her hard eyes passed over Osric and rested on his knife-bristling fists.",
      "\u201cReally?\u201d was her unimpressed comment. \u201cI can assure you that if I\u2019d planned any harm to you, it would\u2019ve happened already.\u201d",
      "Well. That was cocky.",
      "\u201cYou\u2019ve got a high opinion of yourself,\u201d said Osric.",
      "\u201cDeserved, I assure you,\u201d said Fairhrim. She jutted her chin towards his gown. \u201cThat is quite the ensemble.\u201d",
      "\u201cFetching, isn\u2019t it?\u201d",
      "\u201cDid you try the adult cupboard?\u201d asked Fairhrim. \u201cWhat adult cupboard?\u201d asked Osric.",
      "\u201cThe one you\u2019re sitting on.\u201d \u201cOh,\u201d said Osric.",
      "(He had not tried the adult cupboard.)",
      "Fairhrim advanced into the room with a critical air that made Osric feel like he was back in the barracks as a young Fyren, awaiting his warchief\u2019s inspection.",
      "\u201cWe\u2019re going to need the examination table, if you wouldn\u2019t mind moving this\u201d \u2014 Fairhrim made an impatient gesture towards Osric\u2019s weapons \u2014 \u201cmess of an arsenal.\u201d",
      "Osric moved his things under Fairhrim\u2019s watchful eye.",
      "\u201cIs there a single inch of you that isn\u2019t covered in scar tissue?\u201d she asked.",
      "Osric looked down at himself \u2014 at his chest, decorated by reminders of various blades; at his forearms, ridged by burns; at his shins, scat- tered with memories of a long-ago explosion.",
      "\u201cThere is,\u201d said Osric. \u201cA few inches, actually. Under the kilt.\u201d"

      "From her grimacing smile reaction to Kate's unexpected political leanings, even Bibb's haircut has had fans of the hit HBO show reeling.",
      "Bibb tells TODAY.com she first heard the vulgar name of the hairstyle from a friend of her co-star, Aimee Lou Wood, who plays Chelsea on Season 3 of \"The White Lotus.\"",
      "\"Aimee Lou is British. Aimee Lou is like my sister. So we're very close, so we talk a lot, and do voice memos to each other,\" Bibb says. \"I think it was maybe the first episode or something, and she sent, 'My friend wanted me to tell you that he's f------- loving you and your c----y little bob.\"",

      "Henry then elaborated on why he answered that way.",
      "\"Sometimes in the morning, you know, you might want to brush your teeth,\" he said.",

    "story": [
      "Kiana Moore is forging her own path as a filmmaker.",
      "After winning the 2022 best feature film Tribeca X Award for \u201cThe Beauty of Blackness,\u201d with co-director Tiffany Johnson, Moore set her sights on sitting in the director\u2019s chair solo for her next big project.",
      "Similar to her previous works, like \u201cA Woman\u2019s Place,\u201d a documentary short about the gender biases women face in the culinary industry, and \u201cInto the Mix,\u201d a podcast created to inspire the next generation of activists, Moore continues to focus on underrepresented groups in her new film, \u201cSensory Overload.\u201d",
      "In this project, Moore, who serves as the vice president of content production and head of Epic Stories at Vox Creative, hopes to shine a light on sensory sensitive and neurodivergent communities in an effort to educate the masses about them, while also debunking stigmas.",
      "For some, the doc will be a first look at the day-to-day life of someone in the neurodivergent and sensory sensitive (communities). It shows how people who are neurodivergent, a nonmedical term to describe someone whose brain works differently, and sensory sensitive, or someone who has a heightened sensitivity to sensory input, aren\u2019t that much different than those who are not.",
      "Someone who is neurodivergent may be seen as having different strengths and challenges in comparison to others, according to Cleveland Clinic. Those possible strengths can include \u201cbetter memory\u201d and an ability to \u201csolve complex mathematical calculations,\u201d while potential differences can include \u201cmedical disorders, learning disabilities and other conditions,\u201d per the clinic.",
      "Moore tells TODAY.com that regardless of how these communities process information, they should be regarded as capable and included versus being judged and marginalized.",
      "\u201cBoth communities have so much to contribute, and they just need us to be open to the way in which they can contribute,\u201d Moore says.",
      "Now, with her project available to watch on Hulu, Moore is sharing more about her story and why she\u2019s not putting a limit on the stories she wants to tell.",
      "Read on to learn more about Moore and the vision behind \u201cSensory Overload.\u201d",
      "The following Q&A has been condensed for clarity.",
      "A: When we first started working on this campaign over a year ago, we were still trying to figure out what we were going to create, so we started with a story hunt \u2014 which is a process that (we use) to find nonfiction stories that we want to tell. ... Once we decided on the stories that we wanted to focus on in a feature length documentary, my team and I worked on crafting those stories into one cohesive film.",
      "Because we were working so closely together \u2014 and because I was working so closely with the cast \u2014 I felt like I should direct this documentary because I was there from the beginning. I knew the characters, I knew what they wanted to say, and I was very adamant about making sure that we told the story the right way.",
      "As someone who is dyslexic \u2026 I had a connection with some of the characters, and I do have sensory sensitivities. Now, I also, from this documentary, realize that I have a lot of sensory-seeking traits. I only realized that after talking to these amazing people. I really felt connected to them. I felt protective of them. I wanted to make sure that their stories were told correctly and resonated with anyone who watched the film, and that is why I decided to direct.",
      "A: I do have experience with the neurodivergent community. My godson is neurodivergent, and he means the world to me. One of my nephews is also neurodivergent, and I have had other situations where I have worked with neurodivergent people. The neurodivergent community is common to me. It is like a second skin. I am used to being around them, being an accomplice, and an ally for what they may need or making sure that the spaces they are in are more inclusive.",
      "But I didn\u2019t have experience nor know the language of sensory sensitivity until this documentary. Now that I have been a part of this piece, know the language and how to engage, and know how to actually be supportive, I feel that much better of a person \u2014 a better human so that I can also be an ally. We all need someone in the room who will speak up for us, especially when we are not there, but to also speak for us when we are there but we feel voiceless.",
      "To that point, experts and industry leaders are critical voices in this conversation \u2014 those who can speak on behalf of individuals. That\u2019s why, in tandem with the film, the Sensodyne Sensory\u00a0Inclusion Initiative launched in partnership with American Dental Association and sensory accessibility nonprofit KultureCity.",
      "We all need someone in the room who will speak up for us, especially when we are not there, but to also speak for us when we are there but we feel voiceless.\u201d",
      "kiana moore",
      "A: I think the biggest misconception is that they are a hindrance, they are an annoyance, they take up space that they don\u2019t need to take up, and that we have to somehow tolerate them. That is not true at all.",
      "Both communities have so much to contribute, and they just need us to be open to the way in which they can contribute. All of us have special skills. Someone who is an amazing pianist needs a piano to play. If they do not have one, or if they are playing the bass or the violin, they would not be able to express their skill fully, even though they have the ability and willingness to be great. We need to realize that there is greatness in all people. If we give people the tools, society will get to see them flourish.",
      "Making a space sensory friendly does not impact society negatively at all. But more importantly, it now allows people with sensory sensitivities to also thrive.",
      "A: I will be selfish and hope to win an Oscar for the best documentary. In all seriousness, professionally, I am content and blessed with where my career is going, and I just hope that people see this and trust me and my team to create more amazing content. I hope this film achieves understanding and engagement with (these communities). I hope that people watch this film and realize that if they need to speak up, that if they feel a part of this, they have the right to speak up, ask questions, and make situations more accommodating and inclusive. And, if a person doesn\u2019t have sensory sensitivities and they see someone struggling, maybe they will have a little bit more empathy and understanding, and then maybe help make a situation more inclusive."

      "It's important to note that Smith was not required to return his Oscar after the incident, but was instead banned by the Academy from attending any event related to the organization for 10 years.",
      "Smith later resigned from the Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Science and issued a statement apologizing, saying in part, \u201cChange takes time and I am committed to doing the work to ensure that I never again allow violence to overtake reason.\u201d",
      "\u201cInt.

      "In Smith's \u201cYou Lookin\u2019 for Me?,\u201d the actor once again references his Oscars controversy, noting he \"won't get nominated\" -- though multiple outlets have reported that Smith is eligible to be nominated and win Oscars in the 10-year period, \"though he can\u2019t show up to accept them.\"",
      "\u201cTook a lot, I\u2019m back on top, y\u2019all gon\u2019 have to get acclimated / Won\u2019t stop, my s---\u2019s still hot even though I won\u2019t get nominated / Personal life with my wife, mind your business, it\u2019s complicated / All that matters is the fact that I\u2019m still getting compensated.\u201d",
      "\u201cBased on a True Story\" is Smith's first full-length solo music project in 20 years, but it's not the first time he addressed what happened at the Oscars.",
      "After the altercation, he issued an apology to Rock\u00a0in a lengthy statement he posted\u00a0on Instagram.",
      "\u201cI would like to publicly apologize to you, Chris.\u00a0I was out of line and I was wrong. I am embarrassed and my actions were not indicative of the man I want to be. There is no place for violence in a world of love and kindness,\u201d the statement read in part."

      "Season Eight, Episode 12, of the ABC drama picked up three weeks after Episode 10, when Eddie (Ryan Guzman) moved back home to El Paso, Texas, to reunite with Chris (Gavin McHugh), who left Los Angeles at the end of Season Seven.",
      "The episode, titled \"Disconnected,\" also saw dispatcher Maddie Han (Jennifer Love Hewitt) deal with the aftermath of her kidnapping.",

His house is proving to be a major fixer-upper, and he isn't able to join a local fire station in El Paso amid a hiring freeze. So, he trades in his tricked-out truck for a sedan with better gas mileage to become an Uber driver \u2014 a development he keeps from his parents and Chris.",

      "To remind her where her power is, really.",
      "I just thought it was interesting. By being attacked the way she was, having her throat cut, that does sort of temporarily take away her voice, but then it becomes, like a psychological version of that. I sort of like the metaphor that Maddie's voice \u2014 I mean, it\u2019s the thing that people hear over that phone, and it\u2019s a tether to hope or death. So that voice is really her superpower.",
      "So we had several different versions of how her voice came back, and pretty much all of them were predicated on her child. But we did have what I felt were, like, sort of convoluted ways that it happened.",
      "And then I think it may have been (writer) Molly Green\u2019s idea to have her just be out in a public place. And a thing that any parent can actually really relate to is you turn around for a split second and you look back and you have that moment of panic, because it\u2019s like, \"Wait, where\u2019d my kid go?\"",
      "So, when she really needed her voice, it came back. And it\u2019s really because of the things that Athena was saying to her in a previous scene. That she has to wrestle with her own fear on her job, but then she thinks about the people that need her, and she muscles through. And that\u2019s exactly what happens to Maddie in that moment.",
      "I think Eddie feels like a bit of an outsider in his life. So I think what it would have looked like is kind of what you're seeing, where Eddie is going over to his parents' house for family dinners. His mother in particular is sort of taking on the role of parent, and so she's almost treating Eddie and Christopher like they were both her sons \u2014 almost treating Eddie like he's Christopher's brother, as opposed to his father.",
      "But the first thing Eddie needs to do is kind of like lay down some roots and get his house ready so that Christopher can move in.",
      "But his whole story so far has been that he doesn\u2019t want to spook his kid. He\u2019s approaching this in \u2014 I\u2019m not even advocating that he\u2019s made the right choice here \u2014 but he\u2019s approaching this in a very circumspect way. And he just, he wants to make sure that it\u2019s Chris\u2019 choice to come back. I think his mother in particular is kind of leveraging that against him a little bit.",
      "I think he is learning Father Brian\u2019s lesson.",
      "But I think this instance is very different than what happened with him in LA. He was lying to everybody by omission. He\u2019s kind of doing that again.",
      "Eddie seems to have some patterns here. I think Eddie needs to work on that. Now that I think about it, he sort of lets people believe what they believe.",
      "It's a little bit different here because he was withholding something intentionally in the Kim storyline. Here, it's more that he didn't mean to give the wrong impression, but he's too afraid to correct that mistake.",
      "It means everything. The door is now open for Eddie. Now he just needs to walk through it.",
      "Well it's the very next episode, so I don't necessarily want to spoil it, but Eddie needs to dad up, and that is the story that we tell in the next episode.",
      "Eddie and his relationship with his parents vis-\u00e0-vis Christopher is very much the focus of Eddie's story in the next episode.",
      "The episode is called \"Invisible.\" And the characters feel invisible, and even Hen feels invisible, which is unusual for Hen. But there\u2019s just a really nice story of Hen doing what she does best, which is bonding on a human level with a patient, with a character who's feeling unseen, and she helps him to feel more seen, and it doesn\u2019t quite go as she expects.",
      "I don\u2019t think their dynamic really has changed. As I\u2019ve said repeatedly, I\u2019ve been writing these characters the same since Eddie\u2019s introduction, since the beginning of Season Two. And I think they were on good, solid ground when they parted at the end of Episode 10.",
      "What I would say is, there\u2019s a thing that happens in tonight's episode, where Buck has the opportunity to encourage Eddie to come back to LA. Eddie, in a weak moment, or in a vulnerable moment, I should say, when his job situation is not panning out the way he had hoped, suggests that maybe he should just come back and do his old job, because he\u2019s not living with his kid anyway, and he needs to provide for him. And it\u2019s Buck who says, \"You can\u2019t come back.\"",
      "So I think what you see, and it's subtle, is a little growth for Buck. Like this time, he didn\u2019t have to hem and haw, he didn\u2019t have to go adopt an animal. He just said the thing that Eddie needed to hear. And it was at a, you know, not a huge price for Buck, but he really was just thinking about the other person in this instance, and I think that's growth.",
      "It's always a trick, when you're in Season Eight of something, and you're continuously putting your characters in peril, that you do want to feel like there's fallout, that there are stakes, that the things that happen to them matter.",
      "The stakes are very high going forward for the rest of the season. And not just for one character.",
      "I mean I think it would be revisited should the need for the reading of a will arrive.",
      "But you know I'm quite sure Eddie doesn't share every move he makes with his parents. And so I would not assume that they know that at all.",
      "Family, faith and loyalty, I think for both of them."

In 2018, she became a coach on Season 14 of NBC\u2019s \u201cThe Voice.\u201d She remained in her spinning red chair until Season 21.

      "The 42-year-old said she likely won\u2019t return to \u201cThe Voice\u201d any time soon. Clarkson opened up about exiting the show in an interview with USA Today in 2023.",
      "\u201cFull disclosure, I put on a smile a lot of those times because I was struggling a lot in my personal life,\u201d she said at the time. \u201cI\u2019ve learned a lot about what I\u2019m capable of handling, and also what you should not handle. That was me saying \u2018bye\u2019 to \u2018The Voice\u2019 and having this big move. I love that family, but I was like, \u2018I\u2019m struggling. I can\u2019t smile anymore.

      "Ballal said Luski approached with two soldiers. He said Luski hit him on the head, knocked him to the ground and kept kicking and punching him in the head. At the same time, one soldier hit him on the legs with his gun butt, while the other pointed his weapon at him, he said.",
      "Lamia Ballal, the director\u2019s wife, said she was huddling inside with their children and heard him screaming, \u201cI\u2019m dying!\u201d",
      "Luski told the AP that he and other settlers had come to the village to help a fellow settler who said he was being attacked by Palestinian stone-throwers. He said dozens of masked Palestinians attacked his car with stones, including Ballal. \u201cHe broke my window, threw a stone at my chest,\u201d he said.",
      "He said when soldiers arrived, he led them to Ballal\u2019s house to identify him as one of the attackers but denied that he hit him or that settlers attacked any property in the village. Luski said he had footage of the night\u2019s events but when asked to show it to the AP, he responded with a string of expletives.",
      "On Tuesday, a small bloodstain could be seen outside Ballal\u2019s home, and the family car\u2019s windows were shattered. Neighbors pointed to a nearby water tank with a hole in the side that they said had been punched by the settlers.",
      "Under detention",
      "Lea Tsemel, the attorney representing Ballal and the two other Palestinians detained with him, said they were taken to an army base, where they only received minimal care for their injuries from the attack. She said they had no access to them for several hours after their arrest.",
      "Ballal said he had no idea where he was being held, could see nothing and was \u201cfreezing\u201d from the hours spent blindfolded under the air conditioner.",
      "The three were transferred to an Israeli police station at the West Bank settlement of Kiryat Arba and were released Tuesday afternoon.",
      "\u201cAll my body is pain,\u201d he told the AP immediately after his release as he walked, limping, toward a hospital in the nearby Palestinian city of Hebron.",
      "Doctors at the hospital said Ballal had bruises and scratches all over his body, abrasions under his eye and a cut on his chin but no internal injuries. The two other detained Palestinians also had minor injuries.",
      "Confrontations with settlers",
      "In a widely circulated video from August, Luski and several other masked settlers are seen arguing with Ballal. Luski shouts profanity at him and tries to provoke him into a fight.",
      "\u201cThis is my land, I was given it by God,\u201d Luski says. \u201cNext time it won\u2019t be nice.\u201d He taunts Ballal with the prospect of being sent to\u00a0Sde Teiman, a notorious military prison holding Palestinians detained from Gaza, where five soldiers have been charged with raping a detainee with a knife.",
      "\u201cRape for a higher cause,\u201d he says in Hebrew, then blows Ballal a kiss.",
      "The film \u201cNo Other Land,\u201d a\u00a0joint Israeli-Palestinian production, chronicles the situation in Masafer Yatta, which the Israeli military designated as a live-fire training zone in the 1980s and ordered the expulsion of the residents, mostly Arab Bedouin. Around 1,000 residents have largely remained in place, but soldiers regularly come in to demolish homes, tents, water tanks and olive orchards.",
      "Settlers have also set up outposts around the area and at times destroy Palestinian property. Palestinians and rights groups say Israeli forces usually\u00a0turn a blind eye\u00a0or intervene on behalf of the settlers.",
      "The film has drawn ire in Israel and abroad, as when Miami Beach proposed\u00a0ending the lease\u00a0of a movie theater that screened it.",
      "Basel Adra, another of the film\u2019s co-directors and a prominent Palestinian activist in the area, said there\u2019s been a massive upswing in attacks by settlers and Israeli forces since the Oscar win.",
      "\u201cWe\u2019re living in dark days here, in Gaza, and all of the West Bank,\u201d he said. \u201cNobody\u2019s stopping this.\u201d",
      "Israel captured the West Bank in the 1967 Mideast war, along with the Gaza Strip and east Jerusalem. The Palestinians want all three for their future state.",
      "Israel has built well over 100 settlements, home to over 500,000 settlers who have Israeli citizenship. Most of the international community considers the settlements illegal.",
      "The 3 million Palestinians in the West Bank live under seemingly open-ended Israeli military rule, with the Western-backed Palestinian Authority administering population centers.",
      "The war in Gaza has sparked a surge of violence in the West Bank, with the Israeli military carrying out widescale military operations that have killed hundreds of Palestinians and\u00a0displaced tens of thousands. There has been a rise in settler violence as well as Palestinian attacks on Israelis."

      "In the wide-ranging interview, Trump also discussed his commitment to annexing Greenland and reiterated that a military option was not off the table.",
      "Following a week of headlines about Signal, tariffs and Greenland, the president waved off concerns that his agenda is causing volatility on Wall Street or decreasing consumer confidence, pointing to polling that shows that the share of Americans who believe the country is on the right track is at record highs.",
      "\u201cWhat I see is right track, wrong track. And the right track was the first time in like 40 years where it was right track,\u201d the president said, at one point putting Alexander Stubb, the president of Finland, on the phone as well. The two men were golfing in Florida on Saturday.",
      "More from Trump\u2019s interview with NBC News:",
      "No concern if automakers raise their prices",
      "The president said he \u201ccouldn\u2019t care less\u201d if automakers raised prices after he announced he would impose 25% tariffs on all foreign-made automobiles.",
      "Asked what his recent message was to motor industry CEOs, and whether he had warned them against raising prices, Trump said, \u201cThe message is congratulations, if you make your car in the United States, you\u2019re going to make a lot of money. If you don\u2019t, you\u2019re going to have to probably come to the United States, because if you make your car in the United States, there is no tariff.\u201d",
      "When pressed if he told CEOs not to raise prices, as reported in the The Wall Street Journal, Trump added, \u201cNo, I never said that. I couldn\u2019t care less if they raise prices, because people are going to start buying American-made cars.\u201d",
      "Trump continued, \u201cI couldn\u2019t care less. I hope they raise their prices, because if they do, people are gonna buy American-made cars. We have plenty.\u201d",
      "Asked if he was concerned about car prices going up, Trump said, \u201cNo, I couldn\u2019t care less, because if the prices on foreign cars go up, they\u2019re going to buy American cars.\u201d",
      "After the interview, an aide to the president followed up with NBC News to say that Trump was referring specifically to foreign car prices.",
      "NBC News reported earlier this week that foreign auto parts would also be taxed at 25% even if the vehicles they go into are assembled domestically. Companies that import vehicles under the United States-Mexico-Canada Agreement (USMCA) will get special consideration until the government establishes a process for levying the 25% duties, according to the\u00a0 White House.",
      "Until that time, USMCA-compliant auto parts will remain tariff-free.",
      "The president also said the tariffs would be permanent.",
      "\u201cAbsolutely, they\u2019re permanent, sure. The world has been ripping off the United States for the last 40 years and more. And all we\u2019re doing is being fair, and frankly, I\u2019m being very generous,\u201d Trump said.",
      "Trump\u2019s tariff announcement on Wednesday came just weeks before his planned April 2 \u201cLiberation Day,\u201d when tariffs on a variety of consumer goods are set to take effect. They drew swift condemnation from international leaders like Japanese Prime Minister Shigeru Ishiba and Canadian Prime Minister Mark Carney.",
      "In remarks on Thursday, Carney told reporters the tariffs were \u201cunjustified\u201d and that \u201cthe old relationship we had with the United States based on deepening integration of our economies and tight security and military cooperation is over.\u201d",
      "Trump on Saturday maintained that he does not plan to further delay the imposition of the April 2 tariffs, and he would consider negotiating on that point \u201conly if people are willing to give us something of great value. Because countries have things of great value, otherwise, there\u2019s no room for negotiation.\u201d",
      "Signal incident",
      "Trump said he has no plans to fire anyone following news that national security adviser Michael Waltz added a journalist to a Signal app group chat with senior members of the Trump administration who were discussing plans to strike Houthi militants in Yemen earlier this month.",
      "\u201cI don\u2019t fire people because of fake news and because of witch hunts,\u201d Trump said, calling the story \u201cfake news\u201d throughout the interview.",
      "\u201cI do,\u201d the president said when asked whether he still has confidence in Waltz and Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth, who was also in the Signal chat and sent a detailed timeline of the planned strikes before they happened.",
      "\u201cI think it\u2019s just a witch hunt and the fake news, like you, talk about it all the time, but it\u2019s just a witch hunt, and it shouldn\u2019t be talked [about],\u201d Trump added. \u201cWe had a tremendously successful strike. We struck very hard and very lethal. And nobody wants to talk about that. All they want to talk about is nonsense. It\u2019s fake news.\u201d",
      "Trump\u2019s comments come as he has faced calls \u2014 including from his allies \u2014 to fire Waltz after The Atlantic\u2019s editor-in-chief Jeffrey Goldberg wrote on Monday that he had been added to a chat group on a private messaging app with senior administration officials.",
      "In the chat, the officials appeared to discuss their plans to strike Houthi rebels, which the Trump administration has since repeatedly claimed were not classified.",
      "\u201cI have no idea what Signal is. I don\u2019t care what Signal is,\u201d Trump said on Saturday. \u201cAll I can tell you is it\u2019s just a witch hunt, and it\u2019s the only thing the press wants to talk about, because you have nothing else to talk about. Because it\u2019s been the greatest 100-day presidency in the history of our country.\u201d",
      "Everything is on the table to obtain Greenland",
      "The president on Saturday also said he has \u201cabsolutely\u201d had real conversations about annexing Greenland, which is currently a semiautonomous Danish territory.",
      "\u201cWe\u2019ll get Greenland. Yeah, 100%,\u201d Trump said.",
      "He added that there\u2019s a \u201cgood possibility that we could do it without military force\u201d but that \u201cI don\u2019t take anything off the table.\u201d",
      "This comes one day after Vice President JD Vance visited Greenland with his wife, Usha, and spoke to service members at Pituffik Space Base, a U.S. Space Force base on the northwestern coast of Greenland.",
      "While there, Vance said, \u201cOur message to Denmark is very simple \u2014 you have not done a good job by the people of Greenland.\u201d",
      "Asked what message acquiring Greenland would send to Russia and the rest of the world, Trump said, \u201cI don\u2019t really think about that. I don\u2019t really care. Greenland\u2019s a very separate subject, very different. It\u2019s international peace. It\u2019s international security and strength.\u201d",
      "\u201cYou have ships sailing outside Greenland from Russia, from China and from many other places. And we\u2019re not going to allow things to happen that are going to be \u2014 that are going to hurt the world or the United States,\u201d he added.",

      "SCHOENEICHE, Germany \u2014 The U.S. government is on a global egg hunt, seeking exports from countries in Europe and elsewhere to ease a severe shortage that has caused egg prices at grocery stores to hit\u00a0record highs.",
      "Germany, Italy, Poland and Sweden are among the nations the U.S. Department of Agriculture approached to address the shortage brought on by a bird flu outbreak, according to European industry groups.",
      "But supplying Americans with eggs would be complicated for foreign producers \u2014 and not because of political tensions over the\u00a0myriad import tariffs\u00a0President Donald Trump has imposed or threatened to impose on his nation\u2019s top trading partners.",
      "Even if they were eager to share, European countries don\u2019t have many surplus eggs because of their own avian flu outbreaks and the growing domestic demand ahead of Easter.",
      "One of the biggest obstacles, however, is the approach the United States takes to preventing\u00a0salmonella contamination. U.S. food safety regulations require fresh eggs to be sanitized and refrigerated before they reach shoppers; in the European Union, safety standards call for Grade A eggs to be sold unwashed and without extended chilling.",
      "\u201cThese are two systems that could not be more different,\u201d said Hans-Peter Goldnick, the president of the German Egg Association.",
      "Feathers on eggs at the supermarket",
      "It is common in parts of Europe, for example, for consumers to buy eggs that still have feathers and chicken poop stuck to them.",
      "Farmer David Karlsch described the simple process that gets eggs from hens to customers of the family-owned Saballus poultry farm in Schoeneiche, a town just outside Germany\u2019s capital: The eggs are taken from nests, placed into cartons and sold on the premises or from a refrigerated vending machine just outside the property.",
      "\u201cThe demand at Easter time is of course very, very high, as many children naturally want to paint eggs,\u201d Karlsch said.",
      "Poland, a major egg exporter, fielded a U.S. query about the availability of eggs, according to Katarzyna Gawro\u0144ska, director of the National Chamber of Poultry and Feed Producers. The issue of washed vs. unwashed was a crucial factor as European officials considered such requests, she said.",
      "Eggs are not cleaned in most of the 27 EU nations because of concerns that removing the natural protective coating from eggshells makes them more\u00a0vulnerable to bacteria, Gawro\u0144ska said.",
      "Polish veterinary officials are trying to determine if the country and its farmers can meet U.S. requirements, such as whether the exporting nation has a comparable food safety inspection system or a significant bird flu outbreak.",
      "Powdered egg products",
      "Although European Union regulations state that table eggs \u201cshall not be washed or cleaned,\u201d member countries have some leeway if they authorized egg baths at packing plants decades ago.",
      "Danish Egg Association CEO J\u00f8rgen Nyberg Larsen said national customs are part of it; washed eggs are the norm in\u00a0Sweden, for example. But Sweden and Norway have informed the U.S. they don\u2019t have extra eggs to export, Larsen said.",
      "For now, any increased U.S. egg imports from Europe are more likely to arrive in powdered form or other products that can be shipped frozen or dried, Larsen said.",
      "That\u2019s the response Poland\u2019s trade association gave U.S. officials. If the U.S. certifies Poland as a source, the organization\u2019s members would have a limited number of shell eggs to sell but could supply \u201cvery large volumes of egg processing products,\u201d Gawro\u0144ska said.",
      "Processed eggs usually are pasteurized to prevent foodborne illnesses and then used in food manufacturing or by restaurants, hospitals and nursing homes, according to the U.S. Department of Agriculture.",
      "Baked goods, pasta and sauces like mayonnaise are some of the commercial products made with egg powder.",
      "Europe\u2019s own production problems",
      "U.S. officials also tried to sound out farmers in northern Italy\u2019s Veneto region for emergency egg supplies, according to Coldiretti, the main Italian agricultural lobbying organization.",
      "But Italy only produces enough eggs to cover the national demand so most of the region\u2019s producers said they could not help. Bird flu outbreaks since the start of last year also have taken a toll on the Italian poultry industry.",
      "Germany cannot contribute much either. Its domestic poultry industry generates about 73% of the eggs consumed in the country, \u201cand we ourselves essentially have to import eggs from Holland every day to keep everyone satisfied,\u201d the German Egg Association\u2019s Goldnick said.",
      "\u201cWe have around 45 million eggs that we can collect from the chicken coops every day, and in America, there\u2019s a shortage of around 50 million eggs a day. That shows how difficult it is,\u201d he said.",
      "An improving U.S. market and Easter demand",
      "Other countries the U.S. government contacted include Austria, Norway, Spain\u00a0and Denmark. The\u00a0U.S. Department of Agriculture\u00a0said it secured new egg commitments from South Korea and Turkey in recent months, although it did not specify the amount or type.",
      "Brazil, which traditionally exports less than 1% of its total egg production, increased its February shipments to the U.S. by 93% compared to a year earlier, according to the Brazilian Association of Animal Protein.",
      "The detection of Newcastle disease, a viral condition often fatal to chickens, in some parts of Brazil impedes the South American nation\u2019s ability to become a significant U.S. egg supplier, market insiders say.",
      "Imports of liquid, frozen and dried eggs may help free up some domestic shell eggs for consumers, but the U.S. made its appeal for foreign eggs amid a significant deficit; last month, the country produced 720 million fewer table eggs than in February 2024, a decline of nearly 10%.",
      "The U.S. also cut its own egg exports to boost supplies at home, the Agriculture Department said.",
      "While the informal trade talks continue, the U.S. market has shown signs of improvement. It\u2019s been nearly a month since a major bird flu outbreak impacted egg-laying hens, the department said. It reported the national wholesale price for large eggs dropped to $3.27 per dozen as of March 21, or less than half its peak of $8.15 per dozen on Feb. 21.",
      "U.S. consumers are just starting to see those falling wholesale prices translate to lower prices on grocery shelves, the department said. The big demand for eggs that usually accompanies Easter and Passover could cause prices to edge up again next month.",
      "Business is business",
      "Trump hasn\u2019t exactly walked on eggshells with the people of Europe since starting his second term. The president\u2019s repeated\u00a0threats to seize Greenland, a Danish territory, infuriated many in Denmark. His posture toward Ukraine and disparaging remarks from\u00a0top members\u00a0of his administration have alarmed America\u2019s European allies.",
      "The\u00a0European Union, which is the third-largest trade partner of the U.S., was not exempted from the tariffs Trump ordered on steel, aluminum and automobiles.\u00a0Bracing for more, it has prepared counter-tariffs on American products.",

      "\u201cThe right answer is we have to help where we can, Goldnick continued. \u201cIt doesn\u2019t concern the government. You wouldn\u2019t prop them up or anything, but it\u2019s just people\u2019s demand at Easter, for eggs, and that\u2019s just as important to satisfy in America as it is here.\u201d"

      "Muhammed Ihsanullah was overjoyed when he received a $3,000 scholarship to spend the summer working at a camp in Minnesota.",
      "But after several travelers from Western nations were detained or deported as part of the Trump administration's crackdown on illegal immigration, the 20-year-old British citizen from Leicester, England, is planning on carrying a burner phone when he comes to the U.S. in May. That\u2019s if he ends up going at all.",
      "\u201cI have a very, you know, stereotypical name as well,\u201d Ihsanullah told NBC News.",
      "He might swap out devices, he said, \u201cjust so that I have the added security of knowing that no one\u2019s going to go through my phone.\u201d",
      "Potential U.S. visitors such as Ihsanullah are expressing growing uncertainty about their travel plans amid the crackdown and warnings from U.S. embassies in more than a dozen countries, like the one in Sweden that said anyone entering the U.S. on a visa is a \u201cguest\u201d and if you lie about your intended behavior while in the country, \"You\u2019re out.\u201d",
      "Earlier this month, a Lebanese doctor working at Brown University's medical center was sent home despite having a valid U.S. visa after U.S. Customs and Border Protection agents searching her phone found photos and videos they said were \u201csympathetic\u201d to the former leader of the Hezbollah militant group, whose funeral she told agents she attended last month.",
      "Such searches pre-date the new Trump administration, and Customs and Border Protection says it conducts them to detect \u201cdigital contraband, terrorism-related content, and information relevant to visitor admissibility.\u201d",
      "\u201cClaims that CBP is searching more electronic media due to administration change are false,\u201d CBP Assistant Commissioner Hilton Beckham told NBC News in an emailed statement.",
      "\u201cAllegations that political beliefs trigger inspections or removals are baseless and irresponsible,\u201d he added.",
      "Such searches are not new to travelers from parts of the world who already face stringent visa requirements \u2014 Chinese students arriving in the U.S., for example, have complained in recent years of being increasingly subject to interrogation and detention on national security grounds.",
      "But many of the cases in recent weeks have involved travelers from countries such as France, Germany and Canada \u2014 longtime allies with which the U.S. shares intelligence, has frequent cultural exchanges and does hundreds of billions of dollars in trade. Several of those held have spoken out about being scrutinized and sometimes locked up for days at the border.",
      "Last week, France\u2019s interior minister said a French researcher had been turned away by U.S. border agents after they found messages on his phone criticizing the Trump administration. The CBP said searches of the researcher's electronic media devices \u2014 they have not been named by the French authorities \u2014 led to the \u201cdiscovery of proprietary information\u201d from a U.S. laboratory.",
      "CBP does not need a warrant to search the phones of any travelers arriving at the U.S. border, including airports, said Saira Hussain, a senior staff attorney at the Electronic Frontier Foundation, a nonprofit digital rights group based in San Francisco.",
      "\u201cThe U.S. government has taken the view that they have the ability to search your devices without a warrant and without suspicion under what\u2019s known as the border search exception to the Fourth Amendment,\u201d she said.",
      "Other travelers have found themselves unexpectedly detained.",
      "Jasmine Mooney, a Canadian woman who was reapplying for a U.S. work visa, was detained without explanation on March 3 at the Mexican border near San Diego and spent 12 days in detention before returning home. She wrote in The Guardian that she was  detained after she was questioned about the status of her visa, which had been granted following an initial rejection.",
      "\u201cThere is no communication, you don\u2019t have an officer to talk to,\u201d Mooney told MSNBC last week. \u201cYou can\u2019t contact your lawyers or your friends or your family.\u201d",
      "When Rebecca Burke, a backpacker from Britain, tried to enter from Canada in February, she spent nearly three weeks at a detention center.\u00a0In a statement to the BBC, the Northwest ICE Processing Center said Burke was repatriated after being detained \u201crelated to the violation of the terms and conditions of her admission.\u201d",
      "Burke's family said it believes her detention was due to a misunderstanding about her accommodation arrangements, which were free in exchange for helping hosts with household chores and which her father says authorities may have suspected constituted employment in violation of her visa.",
      "And U.S. citizen Lennon Tyler said she was chained to a bench by border agents last month when her German fianc\u00e9, Lucas Sielaff, was accused of violating the rules of his 90-day U.S. tourist permit while trying to enter from Mexico. Sielaff was detained for two weeks before returning to Germany, according to The Associated Press.",
      "Such incidents have prompted some governments to issue warnings for their citizens traveling to the U.S. The updated British travel advisory reads \u201cyou may be liable to arrest or detention if you break the rules.\u201d",
      "Those warnings have potential visitors to the U.S., like Pat Bastow, a Canadian citizen who plans to rent a car to visit Montana in July for a three-week holiday, seeking advice on how to protect themselves.",
      "\u201cA lot of travel agents are warning people not to go just in case Trump deports,\u201d Bastow, a retired cattle farmer, told NBC News.",
      "Hussain, the lawyer, said she is \u201cencouraging people to think about uploading some of their data to the cloud and downloading it once you\u2019re through screening.\u201d",
      "Turning phones off before arrival is also helpful, she said, as doing so disables facial recognition until a passcode is entered.",
      "Travelers\u2019 rights vary depending on their status \u2014 whether they are U.S. citizens, legal permanent residents or foreign visa holders \u2014 and their port of entry. Almost a quarter of the nearly 47,000 searches of electronic devices conducted at U.S. borders in the last financial year were of U.S. citizens, according to CBP data.",
      "Hussain advised legal permanent residents, or green card holders, \u201cwho may have a bit of a complicated situation\u201d to consult an attorney before traveling.",
      "Visa holders who refuse a search of their devices could see their visas revoked and be barred from entering the U.S., she added.",
      "Rules can vary across the country because the courts have largely avoided ruling on electronic device searches. Last year, a federal judge in New York barred CBP from warrantless searches of people\u2019s phones, but that applies only to John F. Kennedy International Airport.",
      "That lack of consistency, Hussain said, is \u201creally why we believe that the Supreme Court needs to weigh in on this issue.\u201d"

Tate then began to choke her, and she \u201cbegan crying and begging for him to stop. He would not,\u201d according to the complaint.",

The brothers have denied all allegations. The timing of the ban\u2019s lifting led to speculation that the State Department or the White House helped the brothers, who are supporters of President Donald Trump, but the administration declined to comment and McBride also declined to comment last month.",
      "Upon their arrival in the U.S., the brothers received a cold reception from officials in Florida.",

      "Tate is the focus of other ongoing lawsuits, including one in Britain filed by four women accusing him of rape and abuse, and a countersuit in the U.S. filed last month in Florida by a woman claiming the Tate brothers coerced her into sex work in Romania. The brothers had initially filed a defamation suit against her in 2023 claiming she and another woman gave false evidence to Romanian authorities, which had led to their prior arrests.",
      "The brothers have denied the allegations against them in those suits, and contend they are being targeted because they are outspoken.",
      "Stern said that while she remains scared for her safety, the encouragement she has received from family and friends prompted her to go public.",

    "summary": "Vice President JD Vance is set to land in Greenland to a chorus of anger and anxiety at White House plans to seize the Arctic territory by any means necessary.",
    "story": [
      "Vice President JD Vance sharply criticized Denmark and other European allies during his visit to Greenland on Friday, as the Trump administration continues to push U.S. ownership of the semi-autonomous territory.",
      "Speaking to servicemembers at Pituffik Space Base, a U.S. Space Force base on the northwestern coast of Greenland, Vance argued that Greenlanders would be better off being under the protection of the U.S. than under Denmark.",
      "\u201cOur message to Denmark is very simple \u2014 you have not done a good job by the people of Greenland,\" Vance said. \"You have under-invested in the people of Greenland and you have under-invested in the security architecture of this incredible, beautiful land mass.\"",
      "Days after President Donald Trump said that the U.S. \u201cwould\u00a0go as far as we have to\u201d to take ownership of territory, Vance made a pitch to the people of Greenland: \"I think that you\u2019d be a lot better coming under the United States security umbrella than you have been under Denmark's security umbrella.\"",
      "Asked if the Trump administration had plans to expand the U.S. military's presence in Greenland, Vance said there aren't, but said they do plan to invest more resources such as ice breakers and additional naval ships in the area. He argues it's part of an effort to put an end to ignoring encroachment from other countries, which he said the U.S. has done for the last 40 years.",
      "\"We can\u2019t just bury our head in the sand \u2014\u00a0or in Greenland, bury our head in the snow \u2014 and pretend that the Chinese are not interested in this very large land mass. We know that they are,\" he said.",
      "Vance was asked by reporters several times whether the U.S. would ever use military force to acquire Greenland and he said he doesn't think that will ever be necessary. The vice president said he envisions that Greenlanders will become independent from Denmark and then he said the U.S. will discuss their future with them.",
      "Vance is traveling with his wife, second lady Usha Vance, Energy Secretary Chris Wright and national security adviser Michael Waltz.",
      "After landing in Greenland on Air Force Two, the vice president and his wife were greeted by personnel at the Space Force base.",
      "\"It's cold as s--- here! Nobody told me!\" Vance said in a mess hall on the base as he sat down to eat with servicemembers. Weather websites showed single-digit subzero temperatures at the time.",
      "Vance said he's the first vice president to visit Greenland and remarked he had had a \"beautiful flight.\" The vice president said he and his team would speak to officials on base to understand how their work contributes to U.S. national security \u2014 which has been President Donald Trump's stated reasons for his interest in the U.S. taking control of the Danish territory.",
      "\"We\u2019re gonna get a briefing, of course, about, you know, what you guys do every day, and then we\u2019re gonna talk just about, as you\u2019ve heard, we have some interest in Greenland from the Trump administration,\" Vance said. He added that the administration and the president specifically were interested in \"Arctic security.\"",
      "Trump reiterated his desire to acquire Greenland while speaking to reporters in the Oval Office Friday. \"We need Greenland, very importantly, for international security. We have to have Greenland. It\u2019s not a question of, 'Do you think we can do without it?' We can\u2019t.\"",
      "Hours before Vance and his wife took off from Joint Base Andrews in Maryland, Russian President Vladimir Putin said Thursday night that he had no problem with Trump's proposed land grab of the world's largest island.",
      "Trump\u2019s desire to take Greenland has \u201clong historical roots,\u201d Putin said Thursday at Russia\u2019s Arctic Forum in Murmansk, the largest city north of the Arctic Circle. \u201cThis is an issue that concerns two specific nations and has nothing to do with us.\u201d",
      "Trump has for years stated his desire to take over the territory, two-thirds of which sits above the Arctic Circle, and whose melting ice hides a bonanza of rare-earth elements, oil and natural gas.",
      "Denmark fully controlled the island for 300 years until it became a semi-autonomous territory in 1953. Although Greenland gained home rule in 1979, Copenhagen still controls its foreign and defense policy and contributes just under $1 billion to its economy.",
      "It is a vast, sparse land \u2014 around the size of Alaska and California combined but with only 56,000 people.",
      "NBC News traveled there this week ahead of Vance's visit and locals said they felt betrayed by their giant North American neighbor.",
      "Patrick Abrahamsen, 45, a search-and-rescue hoist operator for Air Greenland, told NBC News that his opinion of his country\u2019s relationship with America has changed since Trump took office.",
      "\u201cThere\u2019s been said some stuff from the administration of Trump, and some of that hasn\u2019t been that polite, I would say,\u201d he said. \u201cThe way that they\u2019ve just invited themselves, for example, and the way that they\u2019ve spoken about Greenland has changed the sentiment up here about how Americans are portrayed and how we look at them.\u201d",
      "Abrahamsen added that he used to view the U.S.-Greenland relationship as \u201calways close,\u201d but said, \u201cNow, it\u2019s a different story.\u201d",
      "Anders Laursen, 41, owner of a local water taxi company, had a similar take.",
      "\u201cWe have always looked at America like the nice big brother to help you out and now it\u2019s like the big brother is bullying you,\u201d Laursen said.",
      "That anger saw the U.S. delegation's visit vastly downscaled, albeit with the addition of the vice president. Originally intended to encompass a visit to the capital, Nuuk, and with cultural elements such as a dog-sled race, it will now only last one day and be confined to U.S. Pituffik Space Base, which is hundreds of miles from the capital \u2014 and likely any dissenting locals.",
      "One person not raising objections is Putin.",

      "The earthquake occurred around 1:30 p.m. local time (2:30 a.m. ET) at a depth of 6 miles near Mandalay, the second-largest city in Myanmar, according to the U.S. Geological Survey. It was followed 11 minutes later by a 6.7-magnitude aftershock, which the USGS initially reported as a 6.4-magnitude.",

      "In neighboring Thailand, at least 10 people were confirmed to have been killed, with at least 100 more missing, according to city officials. The death toll is expected to rise there, as well, but the damage seemed less widespread."

      "It also said police have been reportedly involved in summary executions of suspected gang members, their families, \u201cor individuals who, when intercepted, were unable to provide identification or offer a sufficient explanation for their presence in the area.\u201d",

    "story": [
      "JERUSALEM \u2014 European far-right leaders were in Jerusalem on Thursday for a conference organized by the Israeli government aimed at combating antisemitism, which was shunned by mainstream Jewish leaders because of the divisive guest list.",
      "The event illustrates a growing alliance between Israel \u2014 a country founded on the ashes of the Holocaust \u2014 and a European far-right that some critics say has not shed its links to\u00a0antisemitism\u00a0and Naziism during World War II.",
      "Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, who leads an ultranationalist government, has cultivated close ties in recent years with far-right populist leaders in countries like Hungary, Brazil and Argentina. Many of these leaders, including Netanyahu, have been greatly influenced by the policies and demeanor of U.S. President Donald Trump.",
      "In a speech to the conference, Netanyahu commended Trump for his \u201cdecisive actions against antisemitism\u201d and blamed U.S. campus protests against Israel\u2019s war in Gaza on \u201ca systemic alliance between ultra-progressive left and radical Islam.\u201d",
      "\u201cAntisemitism is a disease carried by barbarians\u201d in \u201call civilized societies,\u201d said Netanyahu.",
      "Thursday\u2019s conference illuminated the increasingly strained relationship between Israel and its traditional allies in the West, which have grown uneasy with Israeli politics and the direction of the country\u2019s devastating\u00a0war in Gaza. Israel broke the ceasefire with Hamas and resumed the war earlier this month, and Netanyahu is wanted by the International Criminal Court for alleged crimes against humanity in Gaza.",
      "Jewish communities around the world have reported increases in antisemitic violence since the start of the war.",
      "Also attending the event was Bosnian Serb President\u00a0Milorad Dodik, even after a Bosnian court requested an international\u00a0arrest warrant\u00a0for him for his\u00a0separatist policies.",
      "During the conference, Dodik spoke out defiantly against the warrant.",
      "\u201cThe Muslims from Sarajevo they want to punish me because I came here to Israel supporting Israel,\u201d Dodik told The Associated Press through a translator. \u201cThey are misusing the judiciary and the prosecutor office because they are in charge for that.\u201d",
      "Most speakers at the conference railed against antisemitism on the political left and in Muslim societies, with only brief mention of antisemitism on the right. Panels of speakers were set to focus on \u201cHow Progressivism Fell Captive to Antisemitism\u201d and \u201cHow Radical Islam Fuels Antisemitism in the West.\u201d",
      "Jordan Bardella, president of the far-right French National Rally party, gave a keynote address in which he blamed rising antisemitism in Europe on migration and Islamism.",
      "\u201cIslamism is the totalitarianism of the 21st century. It threatens to destroy everything that is not like it,\u201d he said.",
      "David Friedman, the U.S. ambassador to Israel during Trump\u2019s first term, also attended. Asked by the moderator about Trump\u2019s plan to\u00a0remove Palestinians\u00a0from Gaza, Friedman said: \u201cI love it! I love it. And I think it\u2019s doable.\u201d",
      "Other far-right Europeans are attending from the Netherlands, Spain, Sweden and Hungary.",
      "The European far-right\u2019s anti-immigrant platform has focused heavily on immigration from Muslim countries, finding common ground in what Israel describes as a shared battle against Islamic extremism. Critics say this alliance often veers into Islamophobia.",
      "Many mainstream Jewish leaders dropped out of the event after initially agreeing to attend, including Jonathan Greenblatt, chief executive of the Anti-Defamation League, a leading U.S. nonprofit that battles antisemitism.",
      "French philosopher Bernard-Henri Levy, German antisemitism czar Felix Klein and German politician Volker Beck also canceled their participation, while Israel\u2019s president, Isaac Herzog, also pulled out of the conference in favor of hosting a separate meeting of Jewish leaders who had originally come to the country for the conference, his office said."

    "story": [
      "SEOUL, South Korea \u2014 Rain and cooler temperatures helped South Korean fire crews as they battled the country\u2019s worst-ever wildfires on Friday, as the governor of the hardest-hit region called for overhauling the response to the climate crisis that he says worsened the disaster.",
      "The wildfires, which have killed 28 people and razed vast swaths of land in the southeast in the last week, were 85% contained as of Friday morning, Korea Forest Service chief Lim Sang-seop told a televised briefing. He said authorities would launch \u201call-out efforts\u201d to extinguish the remaining blazes by bringing more helicopters and firefighters to the areas.",
      "The raging inferno has also destroyed thousands of houses, factories, vehicles and other structures, while mountains and hills were stripped of anything but a carpet of smoldering ashes.",
      "\u201cHazes have been diminished because of the rain last night, so that\u2019s favorable for securing visibility. Also temperatures are now lower than the last few days, so things are very favorable to put out the wildfires,\u201d Lim said.",
      "Firefighters \u2014 many in their 60s, a reflection of one of the world\u2019s fastest-aging populations \u2014 navigated forests in yellow helmets and red protective suits, spraying suppressants at flames that flickered near their feet. Helicopters dropped buckets of water over hills that glowed red in the night.",
      "Residents hunkered down in temporary shelters in places like schools and gyms, but the fire crept dangerously close to some of them too. A video shared by one evacuee shows blazes approaching a school soccer field under a sky choked with smoke.",
      "\u201cI just kept crying this morning,\u201d said 79-year-old Seo Jae Tak, an evacuee at a gym in Andong city, on Thursday. \u201cWhen I went back yesterday, the entire mountain had turned to ashes. It\u2019s just unbelievable, I can\u2019t even put it into words. All I can do is cry.\u201d",
      "Authorities were mobilizing about 9,000 people, 125 helicopters and hundreds of other vehicles to battle the wildfires, the government\u2019s disaster response center said.",
      "The wildfires have burned 118,265 acres of land, forced more than 30,000 people to flee their homes and injured 37 others since last Friday. Officials said Friday that 8,000 residents remained at temporary shelters. The fires have been driven by strong winds and dry weather.",
      "While it is difficult to link any one event to climate change, officials and experts say that it is making wildfires more likely and more severe. Scientists have already warned that the warming atmosphere around the world is driving ever more extreme weather events, including wildfires, flooding, droughts, hurricanes and heat waves that are killing people and causing billions of dollars in damage every year.",
      "\u201cWe must completely overhaul our wildfire response strategy in the face of extreme climate conditions,\u201d Lee Cheol-woo, governor of North Gyeongsang Province, said at a news conference.",
      "Lee noted that the past week has shown how wildfires, fueled by dry and windy conditions, can quickly overwhelm the country\u2019s resources. He said he would request that the government establish better evacuation guidelines, adopt more powerful firefighting tools including aircraft equipped with water cannons, and adopt other approaches to improve firefighting efforts during nighttime hours.",
      "\u201cWe don\u2019t have the equipment for firefighting at night,\u201d Lee said. \u201cIn the night, firefighting is done solely with manual efforts, but with the increased density of our forests compared to the past, it\u2019s difficult to manage with just that.\u201d",
      "On Thursday, Lee Han-kyung, deputy head of the disaster response center, told a meeting that the wildfires showed \u201cthe reality of climate crisis that we have yet experienced,\u201d according to the Yonhap news agency.",
      "The people killed were mostly in their 60s or older. They include a pilot whose helicopter crashed during efforts to contain a fire Wednesday and four firefighters and other workers who died earlier after being trapped by fast-moving flames. Officials say older people found it difficult to evacuate quickly but have not provided details of the civilian dead.",
      "In Uiseong, about 20 of the 30 structures at the Gounsa temple complex, which is said to have been originally built in the 7th century, have burned. Among them were two state-designated \u201ctreasures\u201d: a pavilion overlooking a stream that dates to 1668, and a Joseon dynasty structure built in 1904 to mark the longevity of a king."
