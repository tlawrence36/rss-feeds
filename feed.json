    "published": "Sun, 24 Aug 2025 20:12:21 -0400",
    "summary": "Jerry Adler's acting credits include \"The Sopranos\" and \"The Good Wife.\" He also had 53 Broadway productions to his name, all behind the scenes.",
    "story": [
      "Jerry Adler, who spent decades behind the scenes of storied Broadway productions before pivoting to acting in his 60s, has died at 96.",
      "Adler died Saturday, according to a brief family announcement confirmed by the Riverside Memorial Chapel in New York. Adler \"passed peacefully in his sleep,\" Paradigm Talent Agency's Sarah Shulman said on behalf of his family. No immediate cause was given.",
      "Among Adler's acting credits are \"The Sopranos,\" on which he played Tony Soprano adviser Hesh Rabkin across all six seasons, and \"The Good Wife,\" where he played law partner Howard Lyman. But before Adler had ever stepped in front of a film or television camera, he had 53 Broadway productions to his name \u2014 all behind the scenes, serving as a stage manager, producer or director.",
      "He hailed from an entertainment family with deep roots in Jewish and Yiddish theater, as he told the Jewish Ledger in 2014. His father, Philip Adler, was a general manager for the famed Group Theatre and Broadway productions, and his cousin Stella Adler was a legendary acting teacher.",
      "\"I'm a creature of nepotism,\" Adler told TheaterMania in 2015. \"I got my first job when I was at Syracuse University and my father, the general manager of Gentlemen Prefer Blondes, called me (because) there was an opening for an assistant stage manager. I skipped school.\"",
      "After a long theater career, which included the original production of \"My Fair Lady\" and working with the likes of Marlene Dietrich, Julie Andrews and Richard Burton, among many others, Adler left Broadway during its 1980s slump. He moved to California, where he worked on television productions like the soap opera \"Santa Barbara.\"",
      "\"I was really getting into the twilight of a mediocre career,\" he told The New York Times in 1992.",
      "But the retirement he was contemplating was staved off when Donna Isaacson, the casting director for \"The Public Eye\" and a longtime friend of one of Adler's daughters, had a hunch about how to cast a hard-to-fill role, as The New York Times reported then. Adler had been on the other side of auditions, and, curious to experience how actors felt, agreed to try out. Director Howard Franklin, who auditioned dozens of actors for the role of a newspaper columnist in the Joe Pesci-starring film, had \"chills\" when Adler read for the part, the newspaper reported.",
      "So began an acting career that had him working consistently in front of the camera for more than 30 years. An early role on the David Chase-written \"Northern Exposure\" paved the way for his time on a future Chase project, \"The Sopranos.\"",
      "\"When David was going to do the pilot for 'The Sopranos' he called and asked me if I would do a cameo of Hesh. It was just supposed to be a one-shot,\" he told Forward in 2015. \"But when they picked up the show they liked the character, and I would come on every fourth week.\"",
      "Films included Woody Allen's \"Manhattan Murder Mystery,\" but Adler was perhaps best known for his television work. Those credits included stints on \"Rescue Me,\" \"Mad About You,\" \"Transparent\" and guest spots on shows ranging from \"The West Wing\" to \"Broad City.\"",
      "He even returned to Broadway, this time onstage, in Elaine May's \"Taller Than a Dwarf\" in 2000. In 2015, he appeared in Larry David's writing and acting stage debut, \"Fish in the Dark.\"",
      "\"I do it because I really enjoy it. I think retirement is a road to nowhere,\" Adler told Forward, on the subject of the play. \"I wouldn't know what to do if I were retired. I guess if nobody calls anymore, that's when I'll be retired. Meanwhile this is great.\"",
      "Adler published a memoir, \"Too Funny for Words: Backstage Tales from Broadway, Television and the Movies,\" last year. \"I'm ready to go at a moment's notice,\" he told CT Insider then, when asked if he'd take more acting roles. In recent years, he and his wife, Joan Laxman, relocated from Connecticut back to his hometown of New York. Survivors include his four daughters, Shulman said.",
      "For Adler, who once thought he was \"too goofy-looking\" to act, seeing himself on screen was odd, at least initially. And in multiple interviews with various outlets, he expressed how strange it was to be recognized by the public after spending so many years working behind the scenes. There was at least one advantage to being preserved on film, though, as he told The New York Times back in 1992.",
      "\"I'm immortal,\" he said.",

      "\"You're not gonna ask me to do it now. He's not the prince; he's the King,\" laughed Ahmed in an interview with CBS News. \"Taking a step back, I think that on some level, I was always acting. \u2026 From a young age, I was code switching. So I think that was something that was kind of confusing at times as a kid. But you look back and I realize it forced me to develop these muscles.\"",
      "Ahmed loves to flex his acting muscles, which he in part developed at the Royal Central School of Speech and Drama in London. But his road to success wasn't always smooth.",
      "\"Worst audition in my life\"",
      "His audition for Danny Boyle's 2008 film \"Slumdog Millionaire\" is one that often comes to mind. He auditioned for the lead as well as the role of the volatile older brother.",
      "\"That was probably the worst audition in my life,\" he recalled.",
      "\"I can't remember exactly what happened in the audition. But I remember it ended with me \u2026 holding Danny Boyle up against the wall. And I'd ripped his shirt open. And a couple of the buttons popped off. And he goes, 'All right, thanks a lot, Riz. Thanks for coming in. Appreciate that.' I didn't get the role for some reason,\" Ahmed added, jokingly.",
      "His breakout came in 2014 in the film \"Nightcrawler.\" Three years later, he earned an Emmy playing the suspect in the HBO crime drama \"The Night Of.\"",
      "In 2021 he scored his first Oscar nomination playing a drummer who loses hearing in \"Sound of Metal.\" And a year later, Ahmed, who is also a rapper, won an Academy Award for \"The Long Goodbye,\" a short film based on his own album.",
      "Cafe meet cute",
      "While he was preparing for his role as Ruben Stone in \"Sound of Metal,\" he met his wife, New York Times bestselling novelist Fatima Farheen Mirza, in a Brooklyn cafe.",
      "\"I was writing a script. I was actually working on the thing that I'm editing now,\" Ahmed said. \"She sat down opposite and started emptying her whole bag out because she'd lost her charger. You know, I just spotted an opening. 'Can I help you?'\"",
      "The couple got married in 2020 and they're now parents \u2014 a rewarding role Ahmed says has changed him as an artist.",
      "\"You know, at this point, anything that I do \u2013 as an artist \u2013 is facilitated by the support of my wife. So, it's definitely kind of made me realize the extent to which the people closest to you are actually the co-authors of your work,\" said Ahmed, adding that being a father has brought him more gratitude and humility.",
      "While Ahmed was working on his upcoming Amazon comedy \"Quarter Life,\" the script he was writing in that cafe, his wife helped out in the writer's room.",
      "\"She brought such insight and emotion and, you know, just brilliant ideas to the table,\" Ahmed said. \"My wife asking me to advise on her novels - maybe not as good an idea.\"",

      "\"The thing about 'Relay' that excites me is it's similar to the kind of classic films that I loved to watch,\" he added. \"You know, stuff like 'Michael Clayton,' 'The Conversation.' These thrillers that keep you on the edge of your seat.\"",

    "story": [
      "A man on trial for organizing the ambush killing of rapper Young Dolph\u00a0at a Memphis bakery in 2021 has been found not guilty.",
      "A Memphis jury deliberated about three hours before finding Hernandez Govan, 45, not guilty of first-degree murder and conspiracy to commit first-degree murder. He rejected an offer from the state last month to settle with a guilty plea, CBS News affiliate WREG\u00a0reported.",
      "On Thursday, Govan hugged his lawyer and thanked Shelby County Judge Jennifer Mitchell after she told him he was free to go.",
      "Govan was not accused of shooting Young Dolph, but prosecutors claimed he directed the two people who did. The jury was not convinced, however, despite a man's testimony that Govan hired him to \"do the hits\" and was going to take $10,000 as his cut.",
      "Govan's lawyer questioned the quality of the police investigation and the validity of cellphone communications between Govan and the men who shot Dolph, arguing that nothing in the communications directly incriminated Govan or tied him to the killings.",
      "Young Dolph, whose legal name is Adolph Thornton Jr., was a rapper, independent label owner and producer who grew up in Memphis and was admired in the city for his charitable works.",
      "On the day of the 2021 ambush, the 36-year-old was in his hometown to hand out Thanksgiving turkeys to families when his visit to his favorite cookie shop turned into an attack that shocked the entertainment world.",
      "Authorities said two men exited a white Mercedes-Benz and began shooting at the rapper at the bakery. He died after being shot about 20 times, according to a medical examiner's report.",
      "Four years earlier, Young Dolph suffered critical injuries\u00a0in a 2017 attack, when three men approached and shot him over \"beef,\" according to the Los Angeles Police Department. Earlier that same year, he had been involved in a separate shooting where at least 100 bullets were fired at his SUV.",
      "Testifying against Govan was Cornelius Smith Jr., who has admitted to being one of the two shooters who ambushed Young Dolph. Smith previously was the main witness against Justin Johnson, who was convicted of first-degree murder in 2024 after Smith named him as the second shooter.",
      "Smith faces charges for murder and conspiracy to commit murder for his alleged role in Young Dolph's death. He has pleaded not guilty to the charges and does not currently have a trial date set. Johnson was originally sentenced to life in prison with the possibility of parole following his 2024 conviction, plus an additional 35 years for two additional convictions from his trial.",
      "Memphis prosecutors have portrayed Young Dolph's killing as part of an effort by Anthony \"Big Jook\" Mims to get revenge on Young Dolph for diss tracks aimed at Big Jook and the record label he helped run for his brother, rapper Yo Gotti. Smith has testified that Big Jook put out a $100,000 hit on Young Dolph as well as smaller bounties on all the artists at Young Dolph's record label, Paper Route Empire.",
      "At Johnson's earlier trial, a prosecutor told jurors Cocaine Muzik Group (now known as Collective Music Group), a rival record label founded by Yo Gotti, wanted Young Dolph to work for them, but he turned them down.",
      "Big Jook was shot and killed outside a restaurant in January 2024.",
      "Smith testified Monday that \"I didn't know anything about Paper Route having no hits,\" before Govan told him about them. He said Govan hired him to \"do the hits,\" including giving Smith guns for the killing, and was going to take $10,000 as his cut. Govan was also the person who told him and Johnson that Young Dolph would be in Memphis for the Thanksgiving turkey giveaway, so \"that's our opportunity,\" Smith said.",
      "Prosecutors introduced as evidence dozens of cellphone communications between Johnson, Smith, Govan and Big Jook ahead of the shooting.",
      "Meanwhile, Govan's defense attorney, Manny Arora, tried to paint Smith as an unreliable witness who would say anything to try to get a lighter sentence.",
      "Arora pointed to previous testimony where Smith recalled a chance encounter with Big Jook. At the time, Smith implied that Big Jook was the person who hired him. After Smith was arrested, his attorney called Big Jook's attorney and received somewhere between $38,000 and $50,000 in cash. Smith said on Monday that he did not know who had supplied the money.",
      "Smith also testified that he previously heard that Govan might be working with the FBI. Arora asked why Smith would take a job from Govan if that were the case. Smith said Govan was \"innocent until proven guilty.\"",
      "Govan did not testify in his defense.",
      "Smith is charged with murder and conspiracy to commit murder but has pleaded not guilty and does not yet have a trial date.",
      "Johnson was sentenced last September to life in prison with the possibility of parole. He was later sentenced for two other convictions from the trial: conspiracy to commit murder and being a felon in possession of a gun.",

      "Drugs known as\u00a0GLP-1 receptor agonists\u00a0mimic a hormone in the body known as glucagon-like peptide 1, which helps signal fullness to the brain and regulate blood sugar. Ozempic is typically used for diabetes while Saxenda, Wegovy and Zepbound are approved for weight loss.",

    "story": [
      "Mississippi health officials have declared a public health emergency after releasing data showing the state's infant mortality rate\u00a0has risen to its highest level in more than a decade.",
      "In Mississippi, 9.7 infants died for every 1,000 live births in 2024, nearly double the most recent national average of 5.6 deaths per 1,000, according to the state Department of Health. Since 2014, more than 3,500 Mississippi infants have died before their first birthday.",
      "The decision to declare a public health emergency places Mississippi's struggle within\u00a0a wider national story. Here's what to know.",
      "Infant mortality rate a nationwide concern",
      "Even in cities with strong healthcare systems, such as Boston, Black infants continue to die at far higher rates than their White peers.",
      "In Boston, the city's most recent report showed Black infants dying at more than twice the rate of the overall population and triple the rate of White infants, despite the city's overall infant mortality rate falling below the national average. Public health experts say both examples underscore the limits of focusing only on individual behavior or clinical care when structural inequities are key drivers of infant deaths.",
      "\"Every single infant loss represents a family devastated, a community impacted, and a future cut short,\" said State Health Officer Dr. Dan Edney, who announced the Mississippi declaration. \"We cannot and will not accept these numbers as our reality.\"",
      "What is causing higher infant mortality rate?",
      "The leading causes of infant death in Mississippi include congenital malformations, premature birth, low birthweight, and Sudden Infant Death Syndrome.",
      "Disparities remain stark \u2014 Black infants in Mississippi are more than twice as likely as White infants to die before their first birthday, and recent state data show those racial gaps have widened.",
      "Despite growing concerns, declaring a public health emergency for infant mortality is unusual.",
      "\"This is a novel and necessary step,\" said Dr. Michael Warren, Chief Medical and Health Officer at March of Dimes. \"It elevates infant mortality to the level of urgent crisis response, which it truly is.\"",
      "Why a public health emergency was declared",
      "State officials said the declaration allows them to move more quickly to address gaps in care.",
      "Their plan includes expanding prenatal services in counties without obstetric providers, creating an obstetric system of care to regionalize services and improve emergency transfers, and strengthening home visiting and community health worker programs.",
      "\"Improving maternal health is the best way to reduce infant mortality,\" Dr. Edney said.",
      "Dr. Morgan McDonald, National Director for Population Health at New York-based nonprofit Milbank Memorial Fund, said the declaration \"should draw our attention to a problem that is tragic and preventable.\"",
      "She added: \"We applaud Dr. Edney and his public health team for raising the alarm in a way that honors the families who have suffered this tragedy and also focuses attention on concrete solutions.\"",
      "Experts caution, however, that individual and clinical interventions alone cannot solve the problem.",
      "\"Healthy babies come from healthy moms,\" said Dr. Rebekah Gee, former Louisiana health secretary and now CEO of Nest Health, a New Orleans-based company which provides in-home whole-family care, with a focus on those covered by Medicaid. \"If women can't get continuous healthcare before, during, and after pregnancy, it is no surprise their babies are dying at higher rates.\"",
      "Dr. Stephen Patrick, a neonatologist and professor at Emory University, added that treating infant deaths as a series of isolated medical cases misses the broader reality. \"So much of what we see in neonatal intensive care units reflects challenges that moms face long before delivery \u2014 poverty, access to healthcare, housing, even transportation,\" Patrick said.",
      "Health care programs and infant health",
      "Federal funding cuts are also complicating the state's response to the crisis.",
      "The Pregnancy Risk Assessment Monitoring System (PRAMS), a Centers for Disease Control and Prevention program that collects state-specific data on maternal and infant health, has been targeted for elimination. CDC staffers who carried out the survey established nearly 40 years ago to improve maternal and infant health outcomes were fired in June.",
      "Mississippi relied on PRAMS to track maternal behaviors before, during, and after pregnancy, and to monitor infant outcomes. Many of CDC's Safe Motherhood initiatives are also in jeopardy of losing funding, which would affect maternal mortality surveillance, infant sleep safety programs, and hospital-based collaboratives designed to standardize care.",
      "\"Without robust data, we are flying blind,\" Patrick said.",
      "Analysts also warn that such cuts could limit the state's ability to detect trends such as unsafe sleep practices or gaps in postpartum care.",
      "\"It's willful ignorance to cut vital maternal and child health programs when we have public health crises of both maternal mortality and infant mortality in this country,\" said a former CDC Division of Reproductive Health staffer who lost their job in a recent reduction in force. \"For many people, it's downright dangerous to be pregnant in the U.S. in the 21st century. And that is shameful.\"",
      "Polling suggests most Americans support maintaining these programs. According to the Emory-Rollins National Child Policy Poll, 65% of Americans say PRAMS is important for improving outcomes for mothers and infants, while fewer than one in ten believe it is not needed.",
      "Similarly, only 16% supported ending federal funding for the long-running \"Safe to Sleep\" campaign, which educated parents about reducing risks of sleep-related infant deaths.",
      "How changes to Medicaid will impact Mississippi",
      "Medicaid\u00a0plays an outsized role in Mississippi, financing almost 6 in 10 of births in the state, compared to about 4 in 10 nationally, according a\u00a0KFF Health News analysis of government data.",
      "In 2023, the state extended postpartum\u00a0Medicaid coverage\u00a0from two months to a full year. But Mississippi has\u00a0not expanded Medicaid under the Affordable Care Act, leaving many low-income women uninsured before or between pregnancies.",
      "Meanwhile, Congressional proposals could reshape Medicaid coverage, including the reconciliation bill already passed by Congress which would require many enrollees in the government health care program to prove they are either working, volunteering or in school to receive coverage.",
      "Dr. McDonald noted that since Mississippi is not a Medicaid expansion state, it would not be subject to most of the work requirement and frequent redetermination provisions of President Trump's so-called \"Big Beautiful Bill.\"",
      "KFF analysts estimate that bill's funding caps and work requirements could raise Mississippi's uninsured rate by 1 to 2%, potentially leaving 20,000 to 40,000 more residents without coverage.",
      "Public health experts say such policies could destabilize rural hospitals that rely heavily on Medicaid reimbursement, in turn limiting access to prenatal and delivery services in regions already described as \"OB deserts.\"",
      "Other states that expanded Medicaid under the Affordable Care Act have seen measurable improvements in infant health.",
      "Arkansas, for example, reported a 29% reduction in Black infant mortality in the five years following expansion. In Louisiana, which expanded Medicaid in 2016, researchers documented increases in early prenatal care and decreases in premature births. Colorado also saw declines in infant mortality, particularly in rural areas, as more women gained access to continuous coverage before, during, and after pregnancy.",
      "Nationally, one analysis found a 50% greater reduction in infant mortality in expansion states compared to those that did not expand Medicaid, with the steepest gains among Black infants. Today, 40 states and the District of Columbia have expanded Medicaid, while Mississippi remains one of 10 holdouts.",
      "The U.S. has long treated infant mortality as a measure of societal health. More than a century ago, sociologist W.E.B. Du Bois argued that high rates of infant deaths among Black families reflected inequities in living conditions rather than innate differences.",
      "Mississippi's emergency declaration and Boston's persistent disparities suggest those inequities remain deeply entrenched. State officials said the declaration is intended to galvanize coordinated action across hospitals, state agencies, and community groups.",

    "summary": "President Trump said Monday he has fired Lisa Cook from the Federal Reserve's Board of Governors \u2014 a dramatic move after months of public attacks against the central bank.",
    "story": [
      "President Trump said Monday he has fired Lisa Cook from the Federal Reserve's Board of Governors \u2014 a dramatic move after months of public attacks against the central bank.",
      "The president announced Cook's removal from the Fed board in a letter posted to Truth Social that accused Cook of making false statements on mortgage documents, actions he claimed were \"gross negligence\" and \"potentially criminal.\" Mr. Trump had previously urged Cook to resign, leading the economist to say she had \"no intention of being bullied to step down from my position because of some questions raised in a tweet.\"",
      "The move is an early test of Mr. Trump's power to terminate members of the Federal Reserve. Under federal law, Fed board members serve for 14-year terms and can only be fired by the president \"for cause.\" Cook has served on the Fed since being appointed to complete another member's unexpired term in 2022, and her current term would run until 2038",
      "Mr. Trump wrote in a letter to Cook: \"I have determined that there is sufficient cause to remove you from your position.\"",
      "In a statement Cook's attorney provided to the New York Times late Monday, she said, \"I will not resign.\"",
      "The statement said that there is no cause under the law for Mr. Trump to fire her. Attorney Abbe David Lowell said they \"will take whatever actions\" needed to prevent Cook's firing, the New York Times reported.",
      "CBS News has reached out to the Fed for comment.",
      "What are President Trump's allegations against Lisa Cook?",
      "The allegations against Cook were leveled earlier this month by Federal Housing Finance Agency Director Bill Pulte, who has positioned himself as an ally of Mr. Trump's. Pulte sent a letter to Attorney General Pam Bondi accusing Cook of taking out mortgages for homes in Michigan and Georgia in 2021, and telling banks in both cases that she planned to use the homes as her primary residences \u2014 in what Pulte alleged was a fraudulent attempt to gain more favorable lending terms.",
      "Last week, Mr. Trump posted on Truth Social: \"Cook must resign, now!!!\"",
      "Cook said in a statement released through the Fed: \"I do intend to take any questions about my financial history seriously as a member of the Federal Reserve and so I am gathering the accurate information to answer any legitimate questions and provide the facts.\"",
      "Pulte has also made mortgage fraud allegations against California Sen. Adam Schiff and New York Attorney General Letitia James, two Democratic officials and Trump foes who denied the accusations. Notably, James's office sued Mr. Trump and his company for loan fraud before his return to the White House, securing an almost $400 million civil court judgment that was tossed out by a New York state appellate court last week.",
      "Why is President Trump angry at the Fed?",
      "Cook's firing came after Mr. Trump spent months attacking the Federal Reserve and its chair, Jerome Powell, over the central bank's handling of interest rates.",
      "Cook, Powell and 10 other Fed officials sit on a committee that controls the nation's monetary policy and sets target interest rates, with a dual mandate of keeping inflation low and employment levels high. This work is typically done independently, with little to no input from political leaders.",
      "The Fed hiked interest rates to decades-long highs in 2022 and 2023 in a bid to quell inflation. After some cuts last year, the central bank has chosen to leave rates at relatively high levels so far this year, fearing that inflation could come roaring back or that Mr. Trump's tariff strategy could cause consumer prices to jump. The trade-off is that higher interest rates can lead to slower economic growth, and they make it more expensive for American consumers and businesses to borrow.",
      "Mr. Trump has lashed out over this strategy, nicknaming Powell \"Too Late.\" The president has\u00a0floated the idea\u00a0of firing Powell, in some cases accusing him of mismanaging a project to renovate the Fed's headquarters.",
      "Powell hinted last week that interest rate cuts could be on the horizon, as the Fed tries to prevent inflation from spiking without triggering higher unemployment. During a speech in Jackson Hole, he said the Fed will \"proceed carefully,\" but recent shifts \"may warrant adjusting our policy stance.\"",
      "Even without firings, the president could reshape the Fed board as positions open up. If the Senate confirms Mr. Trump's replacements for Cook and another Biden nominee who\u00a0stepped down early, four of the Fed's seven governors will be Trump appointees \u2014 making up most of the Fed's board of governors and one-third of the 12-member interest rate-setting Federal Open Market Committee.",
      "Currently, just two Fed board members are Trump picks, both from his first term: Powell and board member Christopher Waller.",
      "Mr. Trump is widely expected not to appoint Powell to another four-year term as Fed chair when his current one ends in May 2026, though he hasn't announced a successor yet. Meanwhile, Mr. Trump\u00a0has nominated\u00a0his economic adviser Stephen Miran to serve on the Fed board until January 2026, replacing Adriana Kugler, the Biden appointee who left the board earlier this month. It's unclear who he will pick to replace Cook.",
      "Cook was confirmed in 2022 by the Senate when then-Vice President Kamala Harris broke the 50-50 party line tie, making Cook the first Black woman to serve on the Federal Reserve Board of Governors. She started her term in May 2022 and it runs 14 years.",
      "She has voted in sync with Powell to hold interest rates steady so far this year.",
      "Reaction to Mr. Trump's move so far has been along party lines. For instance, in\u00a0a post on X, Republican Sen. Rick Scott of Florida said it was \"doing the right thing to hold people accountable\" while Democratic Sen. Elizabeth Warren of Massachusetts\u00a0issued a statement\u00a0saying this represented an \"authoritarian power grab that blatantly violates the Federal Reserve Act.\"",

    "story": [
      "Elon Musk on Monday targeted Apple and OpenAI in an antitrust lawsuit alleging that the iPhone maker and the ChatGPT maker are teaming up to thwart competition in artificial intelligence.",
      "The 61-page complaint filed in Texas federal court follows through on a threat that Musk made two weeks ago when he accused Apple of unfairly favoring OpenAI and ChatGPT in the iPhone's app store rankings for top AI apps.",
      "Musk's post insinuated that Apple had rigged the system against ChatGPT competitors such as the Grok chatbot made by his own xAI. Now, he is detailing a litany of grievances in the lawsuit \u2014 filed by xAI and another of his corporate entities, X Corp. \u2014 in an attempt to win monetary damages and a court order prohibiting the alleged illegal tactics.",
      "The double-barreled legal attack weaves together several recently unfolding narratives to recast a year-old partnership between Apple and OpenAI as a veiled conspiracy to stifle competition during a technological shift that could prove as revolutionary as the 2007 release of the iPhone.",
      "\"This is a tale of two monopolists joining forces to ensure their continued dominance in a world rapidly driven by the most powerful technology humanity has ever created: artificial intelligence,\" the lawsuit asserts.",
      "The complaint portrays Apple as a company that views AI as an \"existential threat\" to its future success, prompting it to collude with OpenAI in an attempt to protect the iPhone franchise that has long been its biggest moneymaker.",
      "Some of the allegations accusing Apple of trying to shield the iPhone from do-everything \"super apps,\" such as the one Musk has long been trying to create with X, echo an antitrust lawsuit filed against Apple last year by the U.S. Department of Justice.",
      "The complaint casts OpenAI as a threat to humanity bent on putting profits before public safety as it tries to build on its phenomenal growth since the late 2022 release of ChatGPT. The depiction mirrors one already being drawn in another federal lawsuit that Musk filed last year, alleging OpenAI had betrayed its founding mission to serve as a nonprofit research lab for the public good.",
      "OpenAI has countered with a lawsuit against Musk accusing him of harassment \u2014 an allegation that the company cited in its response to Monday's antitrust lawsuit. \"This latest filing is consistent with Mr. Musk's ongoing pattern of harassment,\" OpenAI said in a statement.",
      "Apple didn't immediately respond to a request for comment.",
      "The crux of the lawsuit revolves around Apple's decision to use ChatGPT as an AI-powered \"answer engine\" on the iPhone when the built-in technology on its device couldn't satisfy user needs. The partnership announced last year was part of Apple's late entry into the AI race that was supposed to be powered mostly by its own on-device technology, but the company still hasn't been able to deliver on all its promises.",
      "Apple's own AI shortcomings may be helping drive more usage of ChatGPT on the iPhone, providing OpenAI with invaluable data that's unavailable to Grok and other would-be competitors because it's currently an exclusive partnership.",
      "The alliance has provided Apple with an incentive to improperly elevate ChatGPT in the AI rankings of the iPhone's app store, the lawsuit alleges. Other AI apps from DeekSeek and Perplexity have periodically reached the top spot in the Apple app store's AI rankings in at least some parts of the world since Apple announced its deal with ChatGPT.",
      "The lawsuit doesn't mention the potential threat that ChatGPT could also pose to Apple and the iPhone's future popularity. As part of its expansion efforts, OpenAI recruited former Apple designer Jony Ive to oversee a project aimed at building an AI-powered device that many analysts believe could eventually mount a challenge to the iPhone.",

    "story": [
      "In a sign of homesellers' frustration with how long it's taking to sell their properties,\u00a0more owners are opting to pull their homes off the market rather than lower the asking price.",
      "That's according to a recent\u00a0report from Realtor.com finding that so-called delistings, or homes taken off the market without having been sold, were up 38% in June since the start of 2025 and 48% from a year ago.",
      "\"Fewer and fewer sellers are deciding to enter the market, and increasingly more are deciding to jump out,\" Jake Krimmel, senior economist at Realtor.com told CBS MoneyWatch.",
      "Signs of deadlock",
      "One indicator that more sellers are exiting the housing market is the ratio between the number of delistings and listings. For every 100 new homes listed nationally in June, 21 homes were taken off the market, the report found. That's up from 13 delisted homes per 100 new listings in May.",
      "A steady rise in delistings could push buyers and sellers further apart, creating a deadlock in the housing market, according to Krimmel.",
      "\"The thing that's going to prevent buyers and sellers from getting closer together is if all the sellers who maybe could or should be lowering their prices to meet the demand where it is are instead taking their homes off the market altogether,\" he said. \"So it's kind of like keeping us in this holding pattern.\"",
      "The trend comes as the supply of homes for sale begins to grow in certain U.S. regions, causing prices in those areas to drop. The number of homes for sale in July surged nearly 25% from a year ago, a post-pandemic high. according to Realtor.com.",
      "Despite the rise in housing inventory, home sales around the U.S. remain relatively stagnant, with steep prices and high mortgage rates continuing to deter many would-be homebuyers, experts told CBS MoneyWatch. Realtor.com data shows that pending home sales, or listings under contract, in July fell 3% in compared with the same period last year.",
      "No hurry to sell",
      "When homeowners are eager to sell a property, they typically lower the price in order to offload it quicker. However, those who are not up against the same type of time constraints may be willing to wait it out longer \u2014 especially if they're benefiting from a favorable mortgage rate.",
      "\"Maybe you're locked into payments that are relatively affordable for you,\" Krimmel said. \"You would prefer to sell, but not at a price that you're not comfortable with.\"",
      "Another factor is playing into the delisting trend, experts said \u2014 the surge in housing prices during the COVID-19 pandemic, when the housing market was red hot. As newly remote workers flocked to areas like Austin, Texas, home prices rose at\u00a0record levels, giving sellers a chance to cash in.",
      "While the market has since cooled substantially, sellers' pricing expectations have been slower to catch up.",
      "\"Maybe we've gotten a bit spoiled by very high home prices over the last many years, but we are seeing some softness in the market right now,\" Nancy Vanden Houten, lead U.S. economist at Oxford Economics, told CBS MoneyWatch.",
      "That may not be true in all markets, however. Miami is one of the places where sellers have been least willing to budge on price. According to Realtor.com's analysis, 59 homes were delisted for every 100 new homes listed in the southern Florida city \u2014 the highest ratio among the cities Realtor.com tracked. Meanwhile, less than 18% of listed homes in Miami came with a price reduction in July, according to Realtor.com.",
      "\"If sellers are choosing to take properties off the market rather than lower prices, it may signal renewed confidence in Miami's future, and a growing belief that this is a market worth holding for the long haul,\" Ana Bozovic, a Miami-based real estate agent and founder of Analytics Miami, told Realtor.com.",

      "It's unusual for a company's share price to plunge dramatically due to a logo redesign, although marketing missteps can cause investors to question a company' strategy. Cracker Barrel's overhaul has been overseen by CEO Julie Felss Masino, who last year described the chain as \"not as relevant as we once were,\" and announced plans to update its down-home menu.",
      "In a statement to CBS News, Cracker Barrel said that the man portrayed in the logo, known as \"Uncle Herschel,\" will remain \"front and center in our restaurants and on our menu.\"",
      "\"Our values haven't changed, and the heart and soul of Cracker Barrel haven't changed,\" the company said.",
      "In an updated statement released Monday, the company said the criticism has \"shown us that we could've done a better job sharing who we are and who we'll always be.\" Cracker Barrel added that it continues to serve \"generous portions of the food you crave at fair prices.\"",
      "The new logo, which will appear on menus and marketing materials, \"is now rooted even more closely to the iconic barrel shape and wordmark that started it all,\" the company said in an Aug. 18 press release.",
      "Conservative commentators took issue with the rebrand, with right-wing podcaster Matt Walsh calling it \"more generic\" on social media. Marketing experts also criticized the company's overhaul. Many of the criticisms took on a political tone, with some social media commenters describing the new design as \"woke.\"",
      "Brand strategist Kelly O'Keefe, a founding partner of consultancy Brand Federation, said the redesign simplifies an \"overly complex logo.\"",
      "\"In a normal marketing environment, this would not even be noticed, but these are not normal times,\" O'Keefe said in an email. \"Politically inert marketing moves are being labeled as political for opportunistic reasons.\"",
      "Another marketing expert pointed out that the redesign risks turning off long-time fans of the chain, with Bolt Health founder Kevin Dahlstrom, who has served as a chief marketing officer at several companies in the financial industry, describing Cracker Barrel's rebrand as a \"fiasco.\"",
      "\"The holy grail of marketing is to create a brand that customers give a damn about \u2014 and feel some ownership of. It's exceedingly rare and when you have that \u2014 as Cracker Barrel did \u2014 you NEVER EVER abandon it, you only double down on it,\" Dahlstrom wrote on social media.",
      "Cracker Barrel was founded in 1969 and today operates nearly 660 corporate-owned locations across the U.S.",
      "Cracker Barrel's growth, which soared in the 1990s as the chain expanded, has slowed in recent years. For 2024, the company reported revenue of roughly $3.5 billion, up 0.8% from $3.4 billion the previous year, while net income fell to $40.9 million, down from $99 million in 2023.",
      "For its most recent quarter, the company reported revenue of $821.1 million, up slightly from $817.1 million, according to a regulatory filing.",
      "Cracker Barrel shares have risen 7% this year to $55.42 as Friday morning, but the stock has fallen sharply since 2018, when it topped $180.",

    "published": "Mon, 25 Aug 2025 14:49:24 -0400",
    "summary": "Cracker Barrel badly misread its own customer base \u2014 and our culturally sensitive times \u2014 in trying to spruce up its image, experts say.",
    "story": [
      "When Cracker Barrel unveiled its new logo last week as part of an ongoing brand refresh, it wouldn't have expected the marketing move to spark a public furor and cause the restaurant's chain value to sink by nearly $100 million.",
      "Yet the episode highlights the perils of tinkering with a company's brand. Cracker Barrel acknowledged in a statement on Monday that \"we could've done a better job sharing who we are and who we'll always be.\"",
      "Brands as stories",
      "Marketing experts are more blunt about Cracker Barrel's misfire.",
      "\"From a branding perspective, it's basically a flop,\" said David E. Johnson, CEO of branding agency Strategic Vision PR Group, of Cracker Barrel's logo redesign. \"What they did wrong is they went against their brand story, which was the old logo, that reflected the southern, whimsical atmosphere in the stores.\"",
      "In Johnson's view, Cracker Barrel's mistake was that it replaced a logo with genuine symbolic currency for a \"very generic looking logo that doesn't tell a story.\" Other branding experts say the hubbub is the result of a business severing its design from its roots \u2014 a cardinal sin for a company like Cracker Barrel whose folksy image is meant to evoke \"homestyle country cooking.\"",
      "More specifically, Cracker Barrel's new logo retains the rustic color palette of the original design, while removing the image of an older gentleman sitting in a wicker chair leaning against a barrel.",
      "The first Cracker Barrel restaurant was launched in Lebanon, Tennessee, in 1969 by Dan Evins while working for his family's gasoline business. The idea was to recreate the kind of homey restaurants he'd enjoyed as a child, according to the company's\u00a0website. The man in Cracker Barrel's original logo is said to be Evins' uncle, Herschel, who until now has been central to much of the restaurant's branding and merchandise.",
      "The move to remove both Herschel and the namesake barrel from the logo irked some Cracker Barrel loyalists because the original image represented what franchise consultant and branding expert Nick Yeonakis called a \"throwback to a simpler time that was about home cooking.\"",
      "\"So, people have this image in their mind of a Cracker Barrel that is constant and stable, and that's why when they rebranded, backlash happened,\" he said.",
      "Still, marketing experts agree that Cracker Barrel, which operates nearly 660 corporate-owned locations across the U.S., was due for an image revamp. The company's growth, which soared in the 1990s, has slowed in recent years. In 2024, the company reported revenue of roughly $3.5 billion, up less than 1% from $3.4 billion the previous year, while net income fell to $40.9 million, down sharply from $99 million in 2023.",
      "In 2024, concerns over its competitiveness and stagnant growth prompted the company, led by new CEO and former Taco Bell executive Julie Felss Masino, to announce changes to its restaurants, menu and pricing.",
      "The chain had become less relevant in part because it had leaned too heavily on the \"timeless nature of our concept,\" Masino said in a May 2024 conference call with Wall Street analysts. \"The goal, simply put, was to freshen things in such a way as to be noticeable and attractive but still feel like Cracker Barrel,\" she said.",
      "Today, Cracker Barrel maintains that its restaurants will retain their old-timey vibe, including using Uncle Herschel in its marketing.",
      "\"We love seeing how much you care about our 'old-timer.' We love him too. Uncle Herschel will still be on our menu... on our road signs and featured in our country store. He's not going anywhere \u2014 he's family,\" the company said in its statement on Monday.",
      "Sign of the times",
      "Customer anger over Cracker Barrel's new logo also reflects the culturally and politically charged environment companies face today. For example, when Bud Light partnered with transgender influencer Dylan Mulvaney in 2023, some customers called for a boycott of the beer brand, badly denting the beer brand's sales.",
      "In one social media post that typified some of the criticism of Cracker Barrel, one account called \"Woke War Room\" called for Masino to resign. \"Cracker Barrel's new logo isn't an accident \u2014 it's CEO Julie Felss Masino's project. She scrapped a beloved American aesthetic and replaced it with sterile, soulless branding,\" the post\u00a0reads.",
      "Such critiques illustrate the fine line companies are often forced to tread, Carreen Winters, president of reputation at MikeWorldWide, told CBS MoneyWatch.",
      "\"It's very hard to be a brand for everybody today because we are so polarized, and people look at things through a political lens even if there is no political intent,\" she said. \"When you are a legacy brand, it's really important to understand who your core is, and to not do anything to alienate them while cultivating your future or next generation customer.\"",
      "Other experts are skeptical Cracker Barrel's redesign was politically motivated.",
      "\"I really doubt the Cracker Barrel executives sat down and said, 'We'll go through this enormously expensive undertaking to change all of our signage and everything on social media in order to change something because we feel we want to be 'woke,'\" Thomas Murphy, a business professor and branding expert at Clark University, told CBS MoneyWatch.",
      "Rather, Cracker Barrel missed the mark by failing to fully take into account people's emotional investment in its brand, Winters said.",
      "\"If you are a legacy brand and you're modernizing, you have to make sure you've appropriately honored that legacy because at the end of the day, your stakeholders own your brand \u2014 you don't,\" she said. \"Not understanding the customer and the rest of stakeholders and what they care about really matters, and that seems to be what went awry here.\"",

    "published": "Mon, 25 Aug 2025 08:26:00 -0400",
    "summary": "Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell cited risks to the labor market in opening the door to cutting interest rates. Here's what job-seekers should know.",
    "story": [
      "When Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell on Friday opened the door to\u00a0cutting interest rates\u00a0for the first time in nearly a year, he noted the tremors beginning to shake a main pillar of the U.S. economy: the labor market.",
      "Concerns about the pace of job growth were heightened earlier this month after government data showed a sharp slowdown in hiring in July, along with much weaker payroll gains in May and June than previously thought. The disappointing numbers were alarming enough for President Trump to question their accuracy and to fire the head of the agency tasked with compiling the data.",
      "Yet labor experts tell CBS News they weren't surprised by the downturn, and caution that more pain could be in store for job seekers. Data released since the Aug. 1 job numbers show companies are delaying hiring as they adjust course to account for headwinds, including\u00a0fresh U.S. tariffs\u00a0and the advent of artificial intelligence, they say.",
      "\"There's a real cooling in the labor market,\" Andy Challenger, senior vice president of executive outplacement firm Challenger, Gray & Christmas, told CBS MoneyWatch. \"We're also having lots of individual conversations with companies that are letting us know to expect future layoffs.\"",
      "He added, \"So for me, there is more reason to be pessimistic about the labor market than optimistic we'll see some major bounce back.\"",
      "Here are three charts that could point to a serious downturn in the U.S. job market.",
      "Fewer workers are getting hired",
      "Overall, U.S. employers in 2025 have added fewer jobs on a monthly basis compared with the pace of gains in recent years, when companies sought to expand as the economy roared back from the pandemic. In 2024, employers hired an average of 168,000 workers each month, but that has slowed to an average of 35,000 over the past three months, Powell said on Friday.",
      "The risk is that the labor market could weaken from here, which could lead to \"sharply higher layoffs and rising unemployment,\" Powell said.",
      "The slowdown could spur the Fed to cut its benchmark interest rate, policymakers' main tool for energizing the economy and job growth, at its meeting next month for the first time since December 2024. Lowering rates could bolster the labor market because it would make it cheaper for consumers to borrow, driving spending, for businesses to invest, including by adding workers.",
      "More long-term job seekers",
      "Another troubling sign is a recent surge in long-term job seekers, or people who have been searching for a job for more than 27 weeks. In July, about 1.8 million Americans had been looking for work for more than 27 weeks, a jump of about 64% from three years earlier and 20% from a year ago.",
      "It may not get easier to find work anytime soon, given signs from employers that they intend to continue to cut jobs, Challenger said.",
      "\"Don't take the summer off\" from looking for new work, he advised job-hunters. \"It's hard to imagine a scenario where the labor market will be better in three to six months.\"",
      "A jump in unemployed young workers",
      "At the same time, young workers are also having more trouble finding their first jobs, which has been blamed on everything from slowing economic activity this year to employers adopting artificial intelligence in place of entry-level workers.",
      "To be sure, the nation's unemployment rate remains low, at 4.2%. Yet that statistic is backward-looking, reflecting the labor market's strength in previous months \u2014 it says little about economic conditions moving forward.",
      "Meanwhile, for new college graduates the current job market amounts to \"a perfect storm,\" said career coach Tracey Newell.",
      "\"Companies are limiting new entry-level roles, and AI is replacing many traditional 'starter' jobs,\" she added, noting that it isn't unusual for employers these days to receive hundreds of job applications for a single position.",

    "story": [
      "Oslo\u00a0\u2014The world's first commercial service offering carbon storage off Norway's coast has carried out its inaugural CO2 injection into the North Sea seabed, the Northern Lights consortium operating the site said Monday.",
      "The project by Northern Lights, which is led by oil giants Equinor, Shell and TotalEnergies, involves transporting and burying CO2 captured at smokestacks across Europe. The aim is to prevent the emissions from being released into the atmosphere, and thereby help halt climate change.",
      "\"We now injected and stored the very first CO2 safely in the reservoir,\" Northern Lights' managing director Tim Heijn said in a statement. \"Our ships, facilities and wells are now in operation.\"",
      "In concrete terms, after the CO2 is captured, it is liquified and transported by ship to the Oygarden terminal near Bergen on Norway's western coast.",
      "It is then transferred into large tanks before being injected through a 68-mile pipeline into the seabed, at a depth of around 1.6 miles, for permanent storage.",
      "Carbon capture and storage (CCS) technology has been listed as a climate tool by the United Nations' Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) and the International Energy Agency (IEA), especially for reducing the CO2 footprint of industries such as cement and steel that are difficult to decarbonize.",
      "The first CO2 injection into the Northern Lights geological reservoir was from Germany's Heidelberg Materials cement plant in Brevik in southeastern Norway.",
      "But CCS technology is complex, controversial and costly.",
      "Without financial assistance, it is currently more profitable for industries to purchase \"pollution permits\" on the European carbon market than to pay for capturing, transporting and storing their CO2.",
      "Northern Lights has so far signed just three commercial contracts in Europe. One is with a Yara ammonia plant in the Netherlands, another with two of Orsted's biofuel plants in Denmark, and the third with a Stockholm Exergi thermal power plant in Sweden.",
      "Largely financed by the Norwegian state, Northern Lights has an annual CO2 storage capacity of 1.7 million tons, which is expected to increase to 5.5 million tons by the end of the decade.",
      "While efforts such as Northern Lights are focused on capturing carbon directly from the most highly-polluting sources \u2014 industrial smoke stacks \u2014 there have also been efforts launched to capture the gas from the ambient air, an even more controversial methodology.",
      "Mark Jacobson, a Stanford University professor of environmental engineering, told CBS News earlier this year that he was dubious of the motivations for and the efficacy of both kinds of carbon capture, and he said bluntly that \"direct air capture is not a real solution. We do not have time to waste with this useless technology.\"",
      "Jacobson thinks direct air capture, in particular, is a boondoggle, and more effort should be focused on switching to clean energy sources.",
      "Currently, the U.S. gets about 60% of its electricity from fossil fuels.",
      "\"You have to think about who's proposing this technology,\" Jacobson said. \"Who stands to benefit from carbon capture and direct air capture? It's the fossil-fuel companies.\"",
      "\"They're just saying, 'Well, we're extracting as much CO2 as we're emitting. Therefore, we should be allowed to keep polluting, keep mining,\" Jacobson told CBS News, adding that his stance has not made him popular among many in the energy sector.",

      "\"Starbucks' attitude is that there's always someone else who can do the job,\" she said in running through her complaints about life at the java giant.",
      "If that isn't necessarily the consensus among Starbucks workers, interviews with nine current and former baristas at the company make clear it's not an isolated opinion, either. Even those who say they like their job paint a picture of a business that underpays front-line workers, enforces work rules arbitrarily, and too often fails to strike a balance between corporate goals and employee needs.",
      "Of course, such complaints are nothing new in retail, where low pay and erratic schedules are the norm. But by its own account, Starbucks is no ordinary company and is ostensibly a far cry from the fast-food outlets now facing a nationwide uprising by employees tired of working for peanuts.",

      "That image suffered a serious blow last month after The New York Times vividly chronicled a Starbucks worker struggling with the company's scheduling practices. The story, which centered on a 22-year-old barista and single mother, amounted to a public relations nightmare for Starbucks. Perhaps not coincidentally, within days of the story's publication top executives were promising reform.",
      "In a memo to employees earlier this month, for instance, Chief Operating Officer Troy Alstead vowed to \"transform the U.S. partner experience,\" referring to Starbucks' more than 130,000 baristas.  Inviting worker feedback, he said Starbucks will examine its approach to employee pay, revisit its dress code, make it easier for people to ask for time off, and consider other changes aimed at helping baristas balance work and their personal lives.",
      "Among other changes, the company said it would end the practice of \"clopening,\" when an employee responsible for closing a store late at night is also assigned to open it early in the morning.",
      "\"We recognize that we can do more for our partners who wear the apron every day,\" he wrote.",
      "Although Starbucks workers welcome this pledge to respect the apron, they fear the company is more intent on dousing the PR flames than on genuinely improving employees' experience. After the retailer last month sent an email to workers outlining possible solutions to the kind of scheduling problems and related issues detailed by the Times, a group of baristas gave the proposal a C- and posted online a marked-up version of the memo listing their own demands (see image above).",
      "\"We hope you're ready for a commitment to give us schedules that don't mess with taking care of kids, going to school or holding onto that second job we need because Sbux wages don't make ends meet,\" wrote the baristas, who are working with a union-backed labor group, the Center for Popular Democracy.",

      "Despite the recent media focus on Starbucks, the company's labor practices are generally no worse than those of many large retailers. In some ways they're better, with the company offering health care to part-time, as well as full-time, workers; unusually generous 401(k) matching contributions; annual stock grants to employees; and tuition reimbursement.",
      "Starbucks highlights such benefits as an example of its commitment to employees. \"Sharing success with one another has been core to the company's heritage for more than 40 years,\" Alstead said in the September memo.",
      "Meanwhile, some baristas say they enjoy their work and feel valued by Starbucks. \"It's a decent place to work, and my manager and co-workers are great,\" said one employee who asked not to be identified.",
      "But other current and former workers claim Starbucks has changed in recent years, saying that  corporate leaders' intense focus on slashing costs has short-circuited its professed commitment to workers. Mostly, they say Starbucks doesn't listen to employees and even punishes those who identify problems.",
      "\"The biggest problem is that baristas don't have a voice,\" said Sarah  Madden, a former Starbucks barista who left the company this spring  after two years with the coffee vendor. \"They can't speak to issues that  they know exist. Workers know how to fix them, but when [they] speak up  there are serious repercussions -- your hours get cut, you're  transferred to another store or isolated from other people.\"",
      "Employees interviewed for this article said one result of Starbucks' cost-containment push is that stores are frequently understaffed, hurting customer service and forcing managers to scramble to find staff. That problem is common across the big-box stores that dominate the retail sector, experts said.",
      "\"On the one hand, retailers overhire, but they're also understaffed, so  everybody's running around and then there aren't enough people on the  floor,\" said Susan Lambert, a professor at the University of Chicago and  an expert in work-life issues. \"Companies are effectively loading all  the risk onto workers so that they're not the ones incurring the risks  inherent in business.\"",
      "Starbucks denies that its stores are short-staffed. \"We're proud of the level of service we provide in our stores,\" said Zack Hutson, a spokesman for the company. \"We know that the connection our partners have with customers is the foundation of the Starbucks experience. It wouldn't be in our best interest. We want our customers to have the appropriate service level when they come to our stores.\"",
      "To be sure, Starbucks is hardly the only U.S. corporate giant to keep a gimlet eye on its bottom line -- among Fortune 500 companies that approach to management is the rule, not the exception, and CEOs across the land defend it as an inviolable fiduciary duty to shareholders.",
      "But baristas say Starbucks' focus on profits and cost-cutting has increasingly led its leadership to tune workers out. Locke, who has worked for the company since 2006 and who earns roughly $16,000 a year, said she yearned for the Starbucks of old.",
      "\"When I started they had a training program and taught you how to be a coffee expert. There was more of a culture of supporting each other as co-workers. Store managers were sympathetic. I really enjoyed it.\"",
      "Asked why she stays at Starbucks, Locke said her employment options are limited because she lacks a college education and because her only professional experience is in retail.",
      "Living wage?",
      "According to workers, the best thing Starbucks can do for its apron-wearers is to raise their pay and offer full-time hours instead of the 20 to 30 hours that most employees work.",
      "Samantha Cole, a barista in Omaha, Neb., said she struggles to get by on her supervisor's salary of $11.25 an hour. Such pay may be better than what she would earn working for other retailers, but the 30-year-old mother of two say it's still not a living wage.",
      "\"I'm definitely not making enough money,\" said Cole, who has been with the company for six years. \"A lot of us are right there with what fast-food workers are making.\"",
      "Such frustrations are also evident in comments on the Facebook page Starbucks uses to communicate with employees and where it is asking baristas for input regarding the company's labor practices. Wrote one employee: \"I've worked for the company for 7 years in January, and I don't make enough to support myself on one job so I work 2 jobs, 6 days a week.... I've seen a lot of amazing partners leave because they don't make enough.\"",
      "Starbucks declined to disclose compensation data, citing competitive reasons and saying that pay varies widely according to workers' experience and where in the U.S. stores are located. It didn't respond to emails requesting clarification regarding other aspects of its labor policies.",
      "It's worth noting that low pay isn't unique to Starbucks -- in retail it is the norm. As of 2012 (the latest year for which data is available), the median hourly income for retail salespeople is $10.29 per hour, or $21,410 a year, according to the Bureau of Labor Statistics.  Hourly pay for full-time retail workers range from a high of $14.42 to $9.61 for lower-paid people, according to Demos, a liberal-leaning think tank in New York. Part-timers typically make much less, with the average cashier earning $18,500 a year.",
      "\"Until [Starbucks] gives a living wage to every employee, they can't claim to be a good employer,\" Locke said, who added that it has been roughly two years since her last pay raise.",
      "\"Race to the bottom\"",
      "Another priority for baristas: stable, regular schedules. Like most large retailers, Starbucks uses scheduling software to try to match the number of workers it has in a store at any given time to the amount of business it gets. Workers also may be scheduled according to the sales they generate or their facility in promoting certain products. The technology also can enable other savings, such as limiting overtime.",
      "For employees, however, that approach -- known as \"just-in-time\" or \"on-call\" scheduling -- often results in lower income and chaotic hours.",
      "Stephanie Luce, a professor of labor studies at City University of New York's Murphy Institute, characterizes the widespread adoption of scheduling and so-called workforce optimization technologies as a \"new race to the bottom.\"",
      "\"Companies that have already reduced operating costs by making deals with irresponsible subcontractors and using the cheapest available materials are now cutting corners in the form of the 'just-in- time scheduling' of their workforce,\" she and her co-authors wrote in a recent report. \"These 'lean' manufacturing practices take advantage of sophisticated software and an increasingly desperate workforce to cut labor costs to the bone.\"",
      "By the same token, tighter control of worker schedules helps Starbucks contain payroll costs. But it also means employees who had expected to work a certain number of hours every week can see their schedules dramatically cut back and fluctuate wildly. The result? Smaller paychecks and a disturbance to family life.",
      "\"It makes it very hard for parents to participate in an intimate family routine and structure it in such a way that experts agree is good for children,\" Lambert said.",
      "Irregular schedules also make it hard for workers who do need extra income to work a second job, schedule appointments and plan other aspects of their lives.",
      "Baristas said Starbucks posts their schedule only days in advance and that they are often subject to change. Following the Times story, Starbucks said it would post schedules at least one week in advance. That's not enough time, several workers said, asking the company to provide at least two or three weeks notice, as retailers ranging from Walmart (WMT) and H&M to Victoria's Secret (LB) do.",
      "Meanwhile, despite Starbucks' promise to end clopening, the practice continues, some workers said, although the company insists that this is only in cases when people request such shifts.",
      "\"Partners should never be required to work opening and closing shifts. That policy is clear,\" Starbucks' Hutson said, adding that the company is studying ways to give workers more input in their schedules. \"If there are cases where that's not happening, we want to know about that.\"",
      "Given the scrutiny on Starbucks, the company can count on baristas to do just that.",

      "President Trump said that Intel has agreed to give the U.S. government a 10% stake in its business.",
      "Speaking with reporters on Friday, Mr. Trump said the deal came out of a meeting last week with Intel CEO Lip-Bu Tan \u2014 which came days after the president called for Tan to resign over his past ties to China.",
      "\"I said, I think it would be good having the United States as your partner,\" Mr. Trump said. \"He agreed, and they've agreed to do it.\"",
      "In a social media post Friday afternoon, Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick indicated that the deal had been finalized, but did not elaborate.",
      "\"The United States of America now owns 10% of Intel, one of our great American technology companies,\" Lutnick wrote. \"This historic agreement strengthens U.S. leadership in semiconductors, which will both grow our economy and help secure America's technological edge.\"",
      "Lutnick also thanked Tan \"for striking a deal that's fair to Intel and fair to the American People.\"",
      "The struggling Silicon Valley chipmaker has a market cap of just over $100 billion. The agreement comes just after Japanese technology giant SoftBank Group disclosed Monday that it is accumulating its 2% stake in Intel.",
      "The Trump administration has been in talks to secure a 10% stake in Intel in exchange for converting government grants that were pledged to Intel under former President Joe Biden. With a 10% stake, the U.S. government would become one of Intel's largest shareholders and blur the traditional lines separating the public sector and private sector in a country that remains the world's largest economy.",
      "Intel confirmed the deal in a news release Friday evening which stated that the U.S. government would \"make an $8.9 billion investment in Intel common stock, reflecting the confidence the Administration has in Intel to advance key national priorities and the critically important role the company plays in expanding the domestic semiconductor industry.\"",
      "Intel said the government's equity stake would be \"funded by the remaining $5.7 billion in grants previously awarded, but not yet paid, to Intel under the U.S. CHIPS and Science Act and $3.2 billion awarded to the company as part of the Secure Enclave program.\"",
      "Intel said that under the terms of the deal, the government agreed to purchase 433.3 million primary shares of Intel stock, valued at $20.47 per share, or the equivalent of a 9.9% stake in the company.",
      "In a\u00a0Truth Social post early Friday evening, Mr. Trump wrote that it was his \"Great Honor to report that the United States of America now fully owns and controls 10% of INTEL.\"",
      "Trump added that the U.S. \"paid nothing for these Shares, and the Shares are now valued at approximately $11 Billion Dollars.\"",
      "Why did Trump want this deal?",
      "In his second term, Mr. Trump has been leveraging his power to reprogram the operations of major computer chip companies. The administration is requiring Nvidia and Advanced Micro Devices, two companies whose chips are helping to power the craze around artificial intelligence, to pay a 15% commission on their sales of chips in China in exchange for export licenses.",
      "Mr. Trump's interest in Intel is also being driven by his desire to boost chip production in the U.S., which has been a focal point of the trade war that he has been waging throughout the world. By lessening the country's dependence on chips manufactured overseas, the president believes the U.S. will be better positioned to maintain its technological lead on China in the race to create artificial intelligence.",
      "Earlier this month, the president called on Tan to resign less than five months after the Santa Clara, California, company had hired him. The demand was triggered by reports raising national security concerns about Tan's past investments in Chinese tech companies while he was a venture capitalist.",
      "But Mr. Trump backed off after Tan professed his allegiance to the U.S.\u00a0in a public letter\u00a0to Intel employees and went to the White House to meet with the president, who applauded the Intel CEO for having an \"amazing story.\"",
      "After enjoying decades of growth while its processors powered the personal computer boom, the company fell into a slump after missing the shift to the mobile computing era unleashed by the iPhone's 2007 debut.",
      "Intel has fallen even farther behind in recent years during an artificial intelligence craze that has been a boon for Nvidia and AMD. The company lost nearly $19 billion last year and another $3.7 billion in the first six months of this year, prompting Tan to undertake a cost-cutting spree. By the end of this year, Tan expects Intel to have about 75,000 workers, a 25% reduction from the end of last year.",
      "Has the U.S. government done something like this before?",
      "Although rare, it's not unprecedented for the U.S. government to become a significant shareholder in a prominent company. One of the most notable instances occurred during the Great Recession in 2008 when the government injected nearly $50 billion into General Motors in return for a roughly 60% stake in the automaker at a time it was on the verge of bankruptcy. The government ended up with a roughly $10 billion loss after it sold its stock in GM.",
      "Lutnick told CNBC during a Tuesday interview that the government has no intention of meddling in Intel's business, and will have its hands tied by holding non-voting shares in the company. But some analysts wonder if the Trump administration's financial ties to Intel might prod more companies looking to curry favor with the president to increase their orders for the company's chips.",

Anything we can do about it?\" The post had several dozen replies and most of the commenters said their home utility bills had also risen dramatically.",
      "On the campaign trail a year ago, President Trump vowed, \"Under my administration, we will be slashing energy and electricity prices by half within 12 months \u2014 at a maximum, 18 months,\" but this year has seen energy prices rising in several states. Residents and governors in five East Coast states are blaming electric supplier, PJM Interconnection. The company is the largest grid operator in the U.S., serving 13 states and 65 million customers.",

      "PSE&G attributed the price hike to \"an increase in energy demand combined with the need for new power generation,\" which it said \"has driven higher supply prices.\" As a utility, PSE&G pointed out that it doesn't earn a profit on the electric supply, so \"these costs are passed through directly to customers.\"",
      "PJM says it is experiencing a rapid increase in energy demand, driven by the power requirements of artificial intelligence, data centers, electrification and a resurgence in U.S. manufacturing. In its latest forecast, PJM forecast a growth in energy demand of 5% over the next 10 years.",

      "But in an op-ed in NJ Spotlight News, the company blamed a shortfall of energy on \"state and federal decarbonization policies and some economic pressures\" for closing fossil fuel-based power plants in New Jersey.

      "About 44% of adults surveyed by Lightspeed Commerce, a provider of point-of-sale technology for hospitality businesses, said they're ordering from the kids' menus at restaurants. Kids' meals are traditionally less expensive than those on adult menus because portion sizes are usually smaller.",

      "If you look up at the sky in Texas and see what could be a flying burrito, you may not be imagining things: Chipotle on Thursday launched an autonomous aerial delivery service for digital orders in the Dallas area.",
      "Through a partnership with Zipline, a drone delivery and logistics provider, Chipotle is introducing Zipotle, new delivery service for its customers. With Zipotle, small aircrafts called Zips can deliver digital orders directly to customers' homes in just a few minutes, Chipotle said\u00a0in an announcement on Thursday.",
      "Initially, just \"a small number\" of customers will be able to experience Zipotle, according to Chipotle, which said that it would expand the service in the coming weeks.",
      "The burrito chain is touting Zipotle as a superior delivery service that helps customers get their food faster, so that it stays fresh. Everything on Chipotle's menu is available for drone delivery in the Dallas area, the company added. Orders for Zipotle delivery need to be placed through the Zipline app, available through the Apple and Android app stores.",
      "Here's how it works",
      "Once a customer places an order, a Chipotle worker then packs it and places it at a Zipping Point where a Zip drone picks up the order and delivers it to the customer. When the autonomous aircraft arrives at a customer's home, it hovers about 300 feet in the air while lowering and \"gently\" placing the order on the ground, the company states.",
      "Chipotle said the first location to offer Zipotle delivery is at 3109 Lakeview Pkwy, in Rowlett, a suburb in the eastern part of Dallas.",

    "link": "https://www.cbsnews.com/news/us-tariffs-trump-inflation-prices/",
    "published": "Thu, 21 Aug 2025 08:56:00 -0400",
    "summary": "For months, economists warned that the Trump administration's sweeping tariffs would sharply boost consumer prices. Here's why it hasn't happened.",
    "story": [
      "Despite a barrage of new tariffs imposed by the Trump administration this year on dozens of U.S. trade partners, the prices of goods and services across the U.S. have defied many economists' expectations and remained relatively stable.",
      "Economists caution that just because tariffs have yet to trigger a renewed bout of inflation, there is no guarantee that prices won't surge later this year. They note that recent data shows a modest rise in the cost of items including clothing, home furnishings and appliances.",
      "Tariffs \u2014 meaning the rate importers must pay at the border for imported goods \u2014 also take a long time to seep into the economy. That's because companies often try to hold off on passing along higher costs to customers to avoid losing market share to rivals.",
      "Yet experts acknowledge that tariffs have yet to unleash the kind of severe inflationary pressures that could cause prices to spike. For their part, White House officials have consistently maintained that foreign exporters \u2014 not American consumers \u2014 will bear the brunt of added tariff costs.",
      "\"Despite the doom-and-gloom predictions of inflation and recession, it's been months since Liberation Day, and inflation is trending towards an annualized rate not seen since President Trump's first term, while a recent [Council of Economic Advisers] analysis found that prices of imported goods are actually declining,\" White House spokesman Kush Desai said in a statement to CBS MoneyWatch, alluding to the baseline and other tariffs President Trump originally announced on April 2.",
      "Here are four reasons economists say explain why inflation isn't jumping despite the highest U.S. tariffs in decades.",
      "Tariffs aren't as high as many people expected",
      "Despite President Trump's many threats to jack up levies on imports, the actual average tariff rate being charged on U.S. imports is not as high as what has been announced, data shows.",
      "The average tariff rate on U.S. imports in June was 9% \u2014 well below the 15% that many economists were forecasting earlier this year following Mr. Trump's\u00a0slew of tariff announcements, according to investment advisory firm Capital Economics.",
      "\"It's not so much that the reaction to tariffs has been low, it's that the effective tariff rate increase has been relatively limited up until June,\" Mark Cus, an economist at Barclays, told CBS MoneyWatch.",
      "Actual U.S. tariffs remain lower than earlier estimates in part because countries facing steeper levies are sending fewer goods to the U.S., according to Barclays and Capital Economics. By contrast, countries with below average tariff rates are shipping more goods to the U.S.",
      "The upshot: Average tariff rates on imports are lower than many economists were projecting earlier this year.",
      "Additionally, many goods imported into the U.S. have been exempted from steeper tariffs. Of the roughly $258 billion worth of imports that hit the U.S. retail market in June, only 48% were subject to tariffs, Barclays data shows. For example, pharmaceuticals, some electronics and many imports from Canada and Mexico are exempt from any new tariffs.",
      "\"While dutiable goods face elevated tariff rates, a substantial portion of U.S. imports remains duty-free,\" Barclays analysts said in a recent report. \"This is a major contributor to the low effective tariff rate.\"",
      "Companies stocked up before higher tariffs kicked in",
      "U.S. retailers built up their inventories earlier this year in expectation that the Trump administration would hike tariffs on imported products and parts. Many retailers are still selling those non-tariffed products, allowing them to delay price hikes, experts said.",
      "For example, \"There was a big jump in imports of goods from Canada that would later be tariffed before the tariffs kicked in, and perhaps imports of those goods in May and June were relatively low, and that shows up as a smaller amount of dutiable goods,\" Barclays' Cus told CBS MoneyWatch.",
      "Eventually, experts warn, retailers will exhaust those lower-cost goods imported earlier in the year, which could lead to higher prices down the road.",
      "Retailers are swallowing the costs \u2014 for now",
      "For now, many retailers are eating the additional tariff costs.",
      "Businesses \"have been willing to absorb the initial hit via lower margins, although we suspect that was mostly a temporary development as those firms waited for more clarity on where tariff rates would settle,\" analysts with investment adviser Capital Economics said in a recent report.",
      "\"We doubt that is a sustainable outcome over the longer term, however. As the uncertainty over tariff levels eases over the next couple of weeks, giving retailers more clarity on rates over the next year or two, we would expect more firms to raise prices,\" they said.",
      "Tariffs tend to boost inflation gradually",
      "Tariffs typically take many months to seep into company supply chains and show up in the prices consumers pay at the store.",
      "The full impact of tariffs plays out not immediately but over an extended period of time, peaking roughly a year after they take effect, a June Federal Reserve Bank of Dallas\u00a0report\u00a0noted. That means any U.S. tariffs imposed this year would be unlikely to have much of an impact on inflation until later this year and into 2026.",
      "\"Up to now there has been only limited passthrough from tariffs into final consumer prices, but we still expect the impact to gradually mount in the second half of this year,\" Capital Economics analysts said in a report.",
      "A final possibility is that the fears that the Trump administration's turn toward protectionist trade policies would trigger another severe bout of inflation are overblown. The White House has maintained that such a shift will protect jobs and make the U.S. more competitive globally.",
      "\"The Administration has consistently maintained that the cost of tariffs will be paid by foreign exporters who rely on access to the American economy, the world's best and biggest consumer market,\" the White House's Desai said in a statement.",

      "At the same time, scientists are flagging the outsized environmental impact of AI, which is not yet fully understood even as data centers require enormous amounts of electricity.",
      "\"In order to improve the energy efficiency of AI, a clear and comprehensive understanding of AI's environmental footprint is important. To date, comprehensive data on the energy and environmental impact of AI inference has been limited,\" Ben Gomes, Google's senior vice president of learning and sustainability, said in a blog post Thursday.",
      "Aside from their electricity needs, AI data centers also require \"a great deal of water ... \u00a0to cool the hardware used for training, deploying, and fine-tuning generative AI models, which can strain municipal water supplies and disrupt local ecosystems,\" research from MIT\u00a0shows. \"The increasing number of generative AI applications has also spurred demand for high-performance computing hardware, adding indirect environmental impacts from its manufacture and transport.\"",
      "Some new data centers require energy between 100 and 1000 megawatts, roughly equivalent to powering 80,000 to 800,000 homes, according to an April GAO report. For now, however, there are\u00a0no regulations that require corporations to disclose how much energy or water their AI tools consume.",

      "What's the environmental impact of Gemini AI?",
      "Google's new paper on the environmental impact of its own AI tools aims to set a standard for measuring the energy and water consumption as well as carbon emissions of various AI models, the company said.",
      "A typical Gemini text query uses 0.24 watt-hours (Wh) of energy, emits 0.03 grams of carbon dioxide equivalent (gCO2e), and consumes 0.26 milliliters \u2014 or about five drops \u2014 of water.",
      "By comparison, the average ChatGPT query uses 0.34 Wh and about one fifteenth of a teaspoon of water, Sam Altman, CEO of ChatGPT-maker OpenAI, has written.",
      "Google also outlined the progress it has made in reducing the environmental impact of its Gemini platform. Over a recent 12-month period, the energy consumption and carbon footprint of the median Gemini text prompt decreased by factors of 33x and 44x, respectively, it said.",

    "story": [
      "President Trump said Monday he has fired Lisa Cook from the Federal Reserve's Board of Governors \u2014 a dramatic move after months of public attacks against the central bank.",
      "The president announced Cook's removal from the Fed board in a letter posted to Truth Social that accused Cook of making false statements on mortgage documents, actions he claimed were \"gross negligence\" and \"potentially criminal.\" Mr. Trump had previously urged Cook to resign, leading the economist to say she had \"no intention of being bullied to step down from my position because of some questions raised in a tweet.\"",
      "The move is an early test of Mr. Trump's power to terminate members of the Federal Reserve. Under federal law, Fed board members serve for 14-year terms and can only be fired by the president \"for cause.\" Cook has served on the Fed since being appointed to complete another member's unexpired term in 2022, and her current term would run until 2038",
      "Mr. Trump wrote in a letter to Cook: \"I have determined that there is sufficient cause to remove you from your position.\"",
      "In a statement Cook's attorney provided to the New York Times late Monday, she said, \"I will not resign.\"",
      "The statement said that there is no cause under the law for Mr. Trump to fire her. Attorney Abbe David Lowell said they \"will take whatever actions\" needed to prevent Cook's firing, the New York Times reported.",
      "CBS News has reached out to the Fed for comment.",
      "What are President Trump's allegations against Lisa Cook?",
      "The allegations against Cook were leveled earlier this month by Federal Housing Finance Agency Director Bill Pulte, who has positioned himself as an ally of Mr. Trump's. Pulte sent a letter to Attorney General Pam Bondi accusing Cook of taking out mortgages for homes in Michigan and Georgia in 2021, and telling banks in both cases that she planned to use the homes as her primary residences \u2014 in what Pulte alleged was a fraudulent attempt to gain more favorable lending terms.",
      "Last week, Mr. Trump posted on Truth Social: \"Cook must resign, now!!!\"",
      "Cook said in a statement released through the Fed: \"I do intend to take any questions about my financial history seriously as a member of the Federal Reserve and so I am gathering the accurate information to answer any legitimate questions and provide the facts.\"",
      "Pulte has also made mortgage fraud allegations against California Sen. Adam Schiff and New York Attorney General Letitia James, two Democratic officials and Trump foes who denied the accusations. Notably, James's office sued Mr. Trump and his company for loan fraud before his return to the White House, securing an almost $400 million civil court judgment that was tossed out by a New York state appellate court last week.",
      "Why is President Trump angry at the Fed?",
      "Cook's firing came after Mr. Trump spent months attacking the Federal Reserve and its chair, Jerome Powell, over the central bank's handling of interest rates.",
      "Cook, Powell and 10 other Fed officials sit on a committee that controls the nation's monetary policy and sets target interest rates, with a dual mandate of keeping inflation low and employment levels high. This work is typically done independently, with little to no input from political leaders.",
      "The Fed hiked interest rates to decades-long highs in 2022 and 2023 in a bid to quell inflation. After some cuts last year, the central bank has chosen to leave rates at relatively high levels so far this year, fearing that inflation could come roaring back or that Mr. Trump's tariff strategy could cause consumer prices to jump. The trade-off is that higher interest rates can lead to slower economic growth, and they make it more expensive for American consumers and businesses to borrow.",
      "Mr. Trump has lashed out over this strategy, nicknaming Powell \"Too Late.\" The president has\u00a0floated the idea\u00a0of firing Powell, in some cases accusing him of mismanaging a project to renovate the Fed's headquarters.",
      "Powell hinted last week that interest rate cuts could be on the horizon, as the Fed tries to prevent inflation from spiking without triggering higher unemployment. During a speech in Jackson Hole, he said the Fed will \"proceed carefully,\" but recent shifts \"may warrant adjusting our policy stance.\"",
      "Even without firings, the president could reshape the Fed board as positions open up. If the Senate confirms Mr. Trump's replacements for Cook and another Biden nominee who\u00a0stepped down early, four of the Fed's seven governors will be Trump appointees \u2014 making up most of the Fed's board of governors and one-third of the 12-member interest rate-setting Federal Open Market Committee.",
      "Currently, just two Fed board members are Trump picks, both from his first term: Powell and board member Christopher Waller.",
      "Mr. Trump is widely expected not to appoint Powell to another four-year term as Fed chair when his current one ends in May 2026, though he hasn't announced a successor yet. Meanwhile, Mr. Trump\u00a0has nominated\u00a0his economic adviser Stephen Miran to serve on the Fed board until January 2026, replacing Adriana Kugler, the Biden appointee who left the board earlier this month. It's unclear who he will pick to replace Cook.",
      "Cook was confirmed in 2022 by the Senate when then-Vice President Kamala Harris broke the 50-50 party line tie, making Cook the first Black woman to serve on the Federal Reserve Board of Governors. She started her term in May 2022 and it runs 14 years.",
      "She has voted in sync with Powell to hold interest rates steady so far this year.",
      "Reaction to Mr. Trump's move so far has been along party lines. For instance, in\u00a0a post on X, Republican Sen. Rick Scott of Florida said it was \"doing the right thing to hold people accountable\" while Democratic Sen. Elizabeth Warren of Massachusetts\u00a0issued a statement\u00a0saying this represented an \"authoritarian power grab that blatantly violates the Federal Reserve Act.\"",

It also challenges the legality of redrawing maps mid-decade.

    "summary": "A group of current and former FEMA officials is blasting the Trump administration for its sweeping changes to the disaster relief agency, days before the anniversary of Hurricane Katrina.",
    "story": [
      "A group of current and former Federal Emergency Management Agency officials warned Congress on Monday that the Trump administration's sweeping changes to the disaster relief agency could reverse decades of reforms made after Hurricane Katrina.",
      "The open letter was released as the U.S. this week marks 20 years since Katrina's 2005 landfall \u2014 sparking one of the worst natural disasters in U.S. history, with more than 1,800 deaths and over $200 billion in damage in today's dollars.",
      "The letter argues the Trump administration \u2014 which has sought to dramatically shrink FEMA and floated scrapping the agency altogether \u2014 had made decisions that \"hinder the swift execution of our mission.\" It states that a change in course is necessary to \"prevent not only another national catastrophe like Hurricane Katrina, but the effective dissolution of FEMA itself and the abandonment of the American people such an event would represent.\"",
      "Released by the advocacy group Stand Up for Science, the \"Katrina Declaration\" says it has 181 signatories. Only 35 people signed their names to the letter, with the rest opting for anonymity due to \"the culture of fear and suppression cultivated by this administration.\"",
      "It's addressed to several congressional committees and the FEMA Review Council, which was formed by President Trump earlier this year.",
      "The declaration alleges that Mr. Trump's picks to lead FEMA \"lack proper qualifications,\" and decries the Trump administration for cutting FEMA's staff.",
      "\"Since January 2025, FEMA has been under the leadership of individuals lacking legal qualifications, Senate approval, and the demonstrated background required of a FEMA Administrator,\" the open letter reads.",
      "It also castigates FEMA for terminating grants meant to help state and local governments prepare their infrastructures to withstand natural disasters and extreme weather. Two-thirds of the counties that have received those grants voted for Mr. Trump over former Vice President Kamala Harris, a CBS News investigation found earlier this year. A federal judge blocked cuts to the Building Resilient Infrastructure and Communities, or BRIC, program earlier this month.",
      "In response to the letter, FEMA acting press secretary Daniel Llargues said the Department of Homeland Security is \"committed to ensuring FEMA delivers for the American people.\" He said the agency has been \"bogged down by red tape, inefficiency, and outdated processes,\" and defended the Trump administration's handling of natural disasters so far this year.",
      "\"The Trump Administration has made accountability and reform a priority so that taxpayer dollars actually reach the people and communities they are meant to help,\" Llargues said. \"It is not surprising that some of the same bureaucrats who presided over decades of inefficiency are now objecting to reform. Change is always hard.\u00a0 It is especially for those invested in the status quo. But our obligation is to survivors, not to protecting broken systems.\"",
      "FEMA has faced months of upheaval since Mr. Trump's return to office.",
      "Days after his inauguration, the president floated either \"getting rid of FEMA\" or \"fundamentally reforming and overhauling\" the agency, casting it as overly bureaucratic and arguing that state and local governments should take on a larger role in managing natural disasters. In June, Mr. Trump said he's looking to \"wean\" states off of FEMA.",
      "The White House has proposed cutting FEMA's budget for non-disaster grants by $646 million in the next fiscal year. The Trump administration is asking Congress to approve a $36.2 billion budget for FEMA, up from $33.1 billion in the fiscal year 2025 budget.",
      "So far this year, FEMA has lost about one-third of its staff through a combination of firings and buyouts, and the administration has overhauled the contract renewal system for more than two-thirds of FEMA's workforce, CBS News has previously reported.",
      "The agency has had two acting leaders since Mr. Trump returned to office. Christopher Hamilton led the agency until May, when he was fired after saying he didn't support eliminating FEMA. His successor, David Richardson, introduced himself to staff by warning them during an all-hands meeting, \"don't get in my way,\" and suggesting he will \"run right over\" people he believes are subverting the president's agenda, CBS News has reported.",
      "The leadership change came weeks before the June 1 start of the Atlantic hurricane season. One review from May found the agency was \"not ready\" for hurricane season.",

    "story": [
      "Washington \u2014\u00a0Kilmar Abrego Garcia is being processed for deportation to Uganda, the Department of Homeland Security said, after he was taken into custody Monday by Immigration and Customs Enforcement, days after his release from criminal custody.",
      "Abrego Garcia, a native of El Salvador, was mistakenly deported to his home country in March and held in a notorious Salvadoran prison for months before being returned to the U.S. in June where he was jailed on federal human smuggling charges. A judge ruled that he should be released from detention ahead of a trial set for January.",
      "Abrego Garcia was freed from pretrial detention last Friday. CBS News reported on Saturday that his attorneys were then sent a court-required notice of his potential\u00a0deportation to Uganda. He arrived at the ICE facility on Monday morning to check in, speaking in Spanish to supporters who had gathered in a show of support outside of the facility.",
      "\"There was no need for them to take him into ICE detention. He was already on electronic monitoring from the U.S. Marshals Service and basically on house arrest,\" his attorney Simon Sandoval-Moshenberg said. \"The only reason that they've chosen to take him into detention is to punish him. To punish him for exercising his constitutional rights.\"",
      "Sandoval-Moshenberg filed a new lawsuit on Abrego Garcia's behalf on Monday challenging his confinement and deportation to any country \"unless and until he had a fair trial in an immigration court.\"",
      "The U.S. district court in Maryland soon issued an order preventing the government from immediately removing Abrego Garcia from the U.S. or altering his legal status, meaning his deportation is on hold for now. The court has issued the standing order in all cases involving migrant detainees challenging the legality of their detentions in recent months, a move the Justice Department is challenging as unlawful.",
      "Judge Paula Xinis, who is assigned to the case, held a hearing on Abrego Garcia's new suit on Monday. She issued an oral order preventing the Trump administration from moving Abrego Garcia from the ICE facility in Virginia where he is now being held.",
      "The Department of Homeland Security claims Abrego Garcia is a member of the MS-13 gang, which his family denies.",
      "Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem said\u00a0in a statement that ICE had arrested Abrego Garcia and was \"processing him for deportation.\" DHS said he is \"being processed for removal to Uganda.\" The U.S. reached an agreement with Uganda to accept some deportees last week.",
      "\"President Trump is not going to allow this illegal alien, who is an MS-13 gang member, human trafficker, serial domestic abuser, and child predator to terrorize American citizens any longer,\" Noem said.",
      "In a legal filing over the weekend, Abrego Garcia's lawyers said he was offered a plea deal that included deportation to Costa Rica. His legal team said they then received a notice of his possible deportation to Uganda. Sandoval-Moshenberg clarified Monday that Abrego Garcia had stated that he was willing to accept refugee status in Costa Rica.",
      "\"The fact that they're holding Costa Rica as a carrot and using Uganda as a stick to try to coerce him to plead guilty to a crime is such clear evidence that they're weaponizing the immigration system in a manner that is completely unconstitutional,\" Sandoval-Moshenberg said Monday.",
      "Sen. Chris Van Hollen, a Maryland Democrat who traveled to El Salvador to advocate for the return of Abrego Garcia earlier this year, met with him Sunday. Van Hollen said in a statement that he was glad to \"welcome him back to Maryland after what has been a long and torturous nightmare.\"",
      "\"The federal courts and public outcry forced the Administration to bring \u00c1brego Garc\u00eda back to Maryland, but Trump's cronies continue to lie about the facts in his case and they are engaged in a malicious abuse of power as they threaten to deport him to Uganda \u2014 to block his chance to defend himself against the new charges they brought,\" Van Hollen said. \"As I told Kilmar and his wife Jennifer, we will stay in this fight for justice and due process because if his rights are denied, the rights of everyone else are put at risk.\"",
      "An immigration judge ruled in 2019 that Abrego Garcia may not be deported to El Salvador because he feared persecution by local gangs in the Central American country.",
      "Maryland Gov. Wes Moore advocated for due process for Abrego Garcia on Sunday, saying on \"Face the Nation with Margaret Brennan\" that \"I just simply want a court and a judge to decide what is going to be the future fate of this case and all cases like this, and not simply the president of the United States or the secretary of homeland security who is trying to be judge, juror, prosecutor and executioner inside this case.\"",

      "The subpoena issued by Rep. James Comer of Kentucky demands the co-executors of Epstein's estate turn over to the House committee more than a dozen categories of documents and communications, including material from 1990 through August 2019 that references all presidents and vice presidents, videos taken from Epstein's properties and listings in his contact and address books.",
      "Lawmakers are also seeking entries contained within a leather-bound book put together by Epstein's longtime associate, Ghislaine Maxwell, for his 50th birthday, the 2008 non-prosecution agreement reached with the U.S. Attorney's Office in the Southern District of Florida and Epstein's will.",
      "The Wall Street Journal reported last month that President Trump had allegedly signed a \"bawdy\" letter to Epstein in the early 2000s to mark his 50th birthday that said, in part, \"may every day be another wonderful secret.\" The Journal reported that the leather-bound book was compiled by Maxwell and included submissions from dozens of associates, including billionaire Leslie Wexner attorney Alan Dershowitz and Mr. Trump.",
      "The president called the letter reported by the Journal \"fake\" and filed a defamation lawsuit against the newspaper, its parent company and media mogul Rupert Murdoch over the story, seeking at least $20 billion in damages.",
      "In a letter to the co-executors of Epstein's estate, Comer wrote that \"it is our understanding that the estate is ready and willing to provide these documents to the Committee pursuant to a subpoena.\" He set a Sept. 8 deadline for the documents to be turned over to House investigators.",
      "\"Recent reporting indicates the estate of Mr. Epstein has access to documents relevant to the Committee's investigation, including the alleged 'birthday book' prepared for Mr. Epstein by Ms. Maxwell,\" he wrote. \"The attached subpoena is meant to bolster the amount of information available to the Committee so that it may conduct its work. It is imperative that Congress conduct oversight of the federal government's enforcement of sex trafficking laws generally and specifically its handling of the investigation and prosecution of Mr. Epstein and Ms. Maxwell.\"",
      "In addition to issuing the subpoena, Comer announced that Alex Acosta, who was serving as the U.S. attorney for the Southern District of Florida when Epstein was investigated, will voluntarily answer questions from the committee on Sept. 19.",
      "Acosta was the top federal prosecutor in South Florida when federal authorities investigated Epstein in the 2000s and entered into a non-prosecution agreement that allowed him to avoid federal prosecution and plead guilty to state prostitution charges. Acosta went on to serve as secretary of labor during Mr. Trump's first term, but resigned in 2019 amid questions about his handling of the Epstein case.",
      "As part of its investigation into the federal probe into Epstein, the House Oversight Committee issued subpoenas for depositions earlier this month to former attorneys general and FBI directors across four presidential administrations, as well as to former President Bill Clinton and former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton.",
      "Comer said the committee would accept formal written declarations from three former attorneys general, Alberto Gonzales, Eric Holder and Jeff Sessions. Acosta was not among the officials from whom the Oversight Committee initially sought testimony.",
      "The panel also issued a subpoena to Attorney General Pam Bondi for documents related to the Justice Department's investigation into Epstein and Maxwell, who was convicted in 2021 for her role in helping him recruit, groom and abuse underage girls. She is serving a 20-year prison sentence, but has appealed her conviction to the Supreme Court.",
      "The Justice Department sent the first tranche of files related to Epstein to Congress last week, and the Oversight Committee plans to make the records public, though victims' identification and child sexual abuse material will be redacted, a spokesperson said.",
      "The renewed focus on Epstein's case and the government's handling of it was sparked by a Justice Department memo issued in July that said there was no \"client list\" or evidence that Epstein blackmailed prominent figures. The Trump administration said it would not disclose any additional information about Epstein, which led to a backlash from some of the president's allies.",
      "In response, the Justice Department asked federal judges in New York to unseal grand jury transcripts from Epstein and Maxwell's cases. U.S. District Judge Richard Berman denied last week the request to make the material from Epstein's proceedings public, finding that the government is the \"logical party to make comprehensive disclosure to the public of the Epstein File.\"",
      "Separately, the administration released transcripts of Deputy Attorney General Todd Blanche's two-day interview with Maxwell that was conducted in Tallahassee last month.",

      "\"The people in this country don't want to see our American flag burned and spit on,\" the president said.",
      "Trump's executive order on flag burning",
      "Titled \"Prosecuting Burning of the American Flag,\" Mr. Trump's executive order does not direct the attorney general to prosecute those who burn flags for the act itself. Rather, it says the Justice Department should bring cases \"against acts of American Flag desecration that violate applicable, content-neutral laws, while causing harm unrelated to expression, consistent with the First Amendment.\" Examples of those laws include \"violent crimes; hate crimes, illegal discrimination against American citizens, or other violations of Americans' civil rights; and crimes against property and the peace.\"",
      "The directive acknowledges a 36-year-old Supreme Court decision that found flag burning is protected speech but adds that \"American flag desecration conducted in a manner that is likely to incite imminent lawless action or that is an action amounting to 'fighting words'\" may not be entitled to the same protection under the First Amendment.",
      "The order directs the secretary of state, attorney general and secretary of homeland security to take action against foreign nationals who have engaged in \"American flag-desecration activity,\" including by revoking their visas or residence permits, or seeking their removal from the U.S.",
      "The attorney general, Mr. Trump's executive order states, \"shall vigorously prosecute those who violate our laws in ways that involve desecrating the American Flag, and may pursue litigation to clarify the scope of the First Amendment exceptions in this area.\"",
      "Bob Corn-Revere, chief counsel at the Foundation for Individual Rights and Expression, said in response to Mr. Trump's executive order that the president does not have the power to change the First Amendment.",
      "\"Flag burning as a form of political protest is protected by the First Amendment. That's nothing new. While people can be prosecuted for burning anything in a place they aren't allowed to set fires, the government can't prosecute protected expressive activity \u2014 even if many Americans, including the president, find it 'uniquely offensive and provocative,'\" he said in a statement. \"You don't have to like flag burning. You can condemn it, debate it, or hoist your own flag even higher. The beauty of free speech is that you get to express your opinions, even if others don't like what you have to say.\"",
      "Is flag burning protected by the First Amendment?",
      "The president's directive appears aimed at re-opening the question in the courts of whether flag burning is constitutionally protected speech. While Mr. Trump believes that it should be illegal to burn the American flag and sought to unilaterally target those who engage in this conduct, the Supreme Court ruled in 1989 that the act is expressive conduct covered by the First Amendment.",
      "The 5-4 decision in the landmark case Texas v. Johnson arose from Gregory Lee Johnson's conviction under a Texas law that prohibited desecration of a venerated object. Johnson had burned an American flag outside of Dallas City Hall in protest of then-President Ronald Reagan's policies in 1984. He was sentenced to one year in prison and fined $2,000.",
      "But the Supreme Court ruled that Johnson's conviction for flag desecration was inconsistent with the First Amendment, since his flag burning constituted protected expressive conduct. Among the members of the five-justice majority were Justices Antonin Scalia and Anthony Kennedy, who often served as the swing vote after Justice Sandra Day O'Connor retired.",
      "During a 2012 interview with CNN, Scalia, a conservative stalwart, defended the high court's decision on flag burning and reiterated that the act is a form of expression.",
      "\"If I were king, I would not allow people to go around burning the American flag,\" he said. \"However, we have a First Amendment, which says that the right of free speech shall not be abridged \u2014 and it is addressed in particular to speech critical of the government. That was the main kind of speech that tyrants would seek to suppress.\"",
      "Scalia told CNN that \"burning a flag is a symbol that expresses an idea \u2014 I hate the government, the government is unjust, whatever.\"",
      "Referencing the 1989 ruling, Mr. Trump told reporters in the Oval Office on Monday that the case was decided by a \"very sad court.\"",
      "One year after that decision, the Supreme Court ruled in the case United States v. Eichman that a federal law criminalizing flag burning was unconstitutional.",
      "Congress had passed that law, known as the Flag Protection Act, in 1989 in response to the high court's ruling in Texas v. Johnson. The law made it a crime to knowingly mutilate, deface, physically defile, burn or trample upon the American flag, and violators faced a fine or up to one year in prison.",
      "But in another 5-4 decision, again with Scalia and Kennedy in the majority, the Supreme Court ruled that prosecutions of protesters who burned flags in violation of the Flag Protection Act were inconsistent with the First Amendment.",
      "\"Punishing desecration of the flag dilutes the very freedom that makes this emblem so revered, and worth revering,\" Justice William Brennan wrote for the majority.",

      "The Defense Department didn't offer any other details about the new development or why it was needed.",
      "The step is an escalation in Mr. Trump's intervention into policing in the nation's capital and comes as nearly 2,000 National Guard members are stationed in the city, with the arrival last week of hundreds from several Republican-led states.",
      "Last week, the Pentagon and Army said troops would not carry weapons. The new guidance is that they would carry their service-issued weapons.",

Guard to crack down on\u00a0what he has called\u00a0an \"epidemic of crime.\" Federal agents have also patrolled the city, and the president has asserted control over the local Metropolitan Police Department.",
      "It was unclear if the guard's role in the federal intervention could be changing. The troops have not taken part in law enforcement and largely have been protecting landmarks, including the National Mall and Union Station, and helping with crowd control.",
      "Some troops have fed squirrels. One Guard member helped a woman carry her belongings down the stairs in a train station. Others have been seen taking photos with passersby, standing around chatting and drinking coffee. There have been no reports of them facing threats that would require weapons.",
      "On Thursday, Mr. Trump visited a U.S. Park Police facility in southeast D.C., and handed out hamburgers and pizza as he thanked federal law enforcement.

    "published": "Mon, 25 Aug 2025 05:00:00 -0400",
    "summary": "Trump officials sowed fear and confusion among CDC scientists, slowing their response to the measles outbreak in West Texas.",
    "story": [
      "As measles surged in Texas early this year, the Trump administration's actions sowed fear and confusion among CDC scientists that kept them from performing the agency's most critical function \u2014 emergency response \u2014 when it mattered most, an investigation from KFF Health News shows.",
      "The outbreak soon became the worst the United States has endured in over three decades.",
      "In the month after Donald Trump took office, his administration interfered with Centers for Disease Control and Prevention communications, stalled the agency's reports, censored its data, and abruptly laid off staff. In the chaos, CDC experts felt restrained from talking openly with local public health workers, according to interviews with seven CDC officials with direct knowledge of events, as well as local health department emails obtained by KFF Health News through public records requests.",
      "\"CDC hasn't reached out to us locally,\" Katherine Wells, the public health director in Lubbock, Texas, wrote in a Feb. 5 email exchange with a colleague two weeks after children with measles were hospitalized in Lubbock. \"My staff feels like we are out here all alone,\" she added.",
      "A child would die before CDC scientists contacted Wells.",
      "\"All of us at CDC train for this moment, a massive outbreak,\" one CDC researcher told KFF Health News, which agreed not to name CDC officials who fear retaliation for speaking with the press. \"All this training and then we weren't allowed to do anything.\"",
      "Delays have catastrophic consequences when measles spreads in undervaccinated communities, like many in West Texas. If a person with measles is in the same room with 10 unvaccinated people, nine will be infected, researchers estimate. If those nine go about their lives in public spaces, numbers multiply exponentially.",
      "The outbreak that unfolded in West Texas illustrates the danger the country faces as vaccination rates drop, misinformation flourishes, public health budgets are cut, and science agencies are subject to political manipulation.",
      "While the Trump administration stifled CDC communications, health secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. fueled doubt in vaccines and exaggerated the ability of vitamins to ward off disease. Suffering followed: The Texas outbreak spread to New Mexico, Oklahoma, Kansas, Colorado, and Mexico's Chihuahua state \u2014 at minimum. Together these linked outbreaks have sickened more than 4,500 people, killed at least 16, and levied exorbitant costs on hospitals, health departments, and those paying medical bills.",
      "\"This is absolutely outrageous,\" said Jennifer Nuzzo, director of the Pandemic Center at Brown University. \"When you're battling contagious diseases, time is everything.\"",
      "\"The CDC is 'stressed' currently\"",
      "Wells was anxious the moment she learned that two unvaccinated children hospitalized in late January had the measles. Hospitals are legally required to report measles cases to health departments and the CDC, but Wells worried many children weren't getting tested.",
      "\"I think this may be very large,\" she wrote in a Feb. 3 email to the Texas Department of State Health Services. Wells relayed in another email what she'd learned from conversations with people in the community: \"According to one of the women I spoke with 55 children were absent from one school on 1/24. The women reported that there were sick children with measles symptoms as early as November.\"",
      "In that email and others, Wells asked state health officials to put her in touch with CDC experts who could answer complicated questions on testing, how to care for infants exposed to measles, and more. What transpired was a plodding game of telephone.",
      "One email asked whether clinics could decontaminate rooms where people with measles had just been if the clinics were too small to follow the CDC's recommendation to keep those rooms empty for two hours.",
      "\"Would it be possible to arrange a consultation with the CDC?\" Wells wrote on Feb. 5.",
      "\"It never hurts to ask the CDC,\" said Scott Milton, a medical officer at the Texas health department. About 25 minutes later, he told Wells that an information specialist at the CDC had echoed the guidelines advising two hours.",
      "\"I asked him to escalate this question to someone more qualified,\" Milton wrote. \"Of course, we know the CDC is 'stressed' currently.\"",
      "Local officials resorted to advice from doctors and researchers outside the government, including those at the Immunization Partnership, a Texas nonprofit.",
      "\"The CDC had gone dark,\" said Terri Burke, executive director of the partnership. \"We had anticipated a measles outbreak, but we didn't expect the federal government to be in collapse when it hit.\"",
      "Technically, the Trump administration's freeze on federal communications had ended Feb. 1. However, CDC scientists told KFF Health News that they could not speak freely for weeks after.",
      "\"There was a lot of confusion and nonanswers over what communications were allowed,\" one CDC scientist said.",
      "Georges Benjamin, executive director of the American Public Health Association, said the situation was not unique to measles. \"Like most public health organizations, we weren't able to get ahold of our program people in February,\" he said. Information trickled out through the CDC's communications office, but CDC scientists gave no press briefings and went dark on their closest partners across the country. \"The CDC was gagged,\" he said.",
      "Through private conversations, Benjamin said he learned that CDC experts were being diverted to remove information from websites to comply with executive orders. And they were afraid to resume communication without a green light from their directors or the Department of Health and Human Services as they watched the Trump administration lay off CDC staffers in droves.",
      "\"It's not that the CDC was delinquent,\" Benjamin said. \"It's that they had their hands tied behind their backs.\"",
      "To work on the ground, the CDC needs an invitation from the state. But Anne Schuchat, a former CDC deputy director, said that during her 33 years with the agency, federal health officials didn't need special permission to talk freely with local health departments during outbreaks. \"We would always offer a conversation and ask if there's anything we could do,\" she said.",
      "Lara Anton, a press officer at the Texas health department, said the state never prevented the CDC from calling county officials. To learn more about the state's correspondences with the CDC, KFF Health News filed a public records request to the Texas health department. The department refused to release the records. Anton called the records \"confidential under the Texas Health and Safety Code.\"",
      "Anton said the state sent vaccines, testing supplies, and staff to assist West Texas in the early weeks of February. That's corroborated in emails from the South Plains Public Health District, which oversees Gaines County, the area hit hardest by measles.",
      "\"Texas will try to handle what it needs to before it goes to the CDC,\" Zach Holbrooks, the health district's executive director, told KFF Health News.",
      "Responding to an outbreak in an undervaccinated community, however, requires enormous effort. To keep numbers from exploding, public health workers ideally would notify all people exposed to an infected person and ask them to get vaccinated immediately if they weren't already. If they declined, officials would try to persuade them to avoid public spaces for three weeks so that they wouldn't spread measles to others.",
      "Holbrooks said this was nearly impossible. Cases were concentrated in close-knit Mennonite communities where people relied on home remedies before seeking medical care. He said many people didn't want to be tested, didn't want to name their contacts, and didn't want to talk with the health department. \"It doesn't matter what resources I have if people won't avail themselves of it,\" Holbrooks said.",
      "Historically, Mennonites faced persecution in other countries, making them leery of interacting with authorities, Holbrooks said. A backlash against COVID-19 restrictions deepened that mistrust.",
      "Another reason Mennonites may seek to avoid authorities is that some live in the U.S. illegally, having immigrated to Texas from Canada, Mexico, and Bolivia in waves over the past 50 years. Locals guess the population of Seminole, the main city in Gaines County, is far larger than the U.S. Census count.",
      "\"I have no idea how many cases we might have missed, since I don't know how many people are in the community,\" Holbrooks said. \"There's a lot of people in the shadows out here.\"",
      "Public health experts say the situation in Gaines County sounds tough but familiar. Measles tends to take hold in undervaccinated communities, and therefore public health workers must overcome mistrust, misinformation, language barriers, and more.",
      "About 450 people \u2014 including local health officials, CDC scientists, nurses, and volunteers \u2014 helped control a measles outbreak sparked in an Eastern European immigrant community in Clark County, Washington, in 2018.",
      "Alan Melnick, Clark County's public health director, said his team spoke with hundreds of unvaccinated people who were exposed. \"We were calling them basically every day to see how they were doing and ask them not to go out in public,\" he said.",
      "Melnick spoke with CDC scientists from the start, and the intensity of the response was buoyed by emergency declarations by the county and the state. Within a couple of months, the outbreak was largely contained. No one died, and only two people were hospitalized.",
      "In New York, hundreds of people in the city's health department responded to a larger measles outbreak in 2018 and 2019 concentrated among Orthodox Jewish communities. The work included meeting with dozens of rabbis and distributing booklets to nearly 30,000 households to combat vaccine misinformation.",
      "The effort cost more than $7 million, but Jane Zucker, New York City's assistant health commissioner at the time, said it yielded immense savings. The average medical bill for measles hospitalizations is roughly $18,500, according to data from prior outbreaks. Then there's the cost of diverting hospital resources, of children missing school, of parents staying home from work to care for sick kids, and the lasting toll of some measles infections, including deafness or worse.",
      "\"I don't think there's a price tag to put on a child's death that would otherwise be prevented,\" Zucker said.",
      "Local health departments in West Texas were understaffed from the start. About 18 people work at the South Plains health department, which oversees four vast rural counties. About 50 staff the department in Lubbock, where patients were hospitalized and health workers struggled to figure out who was exposed. In mid-February, Wells emailed a colleague: \"I'm so overwhelmed.\"",
      "A death ignites a response",
      "On Feb. 26, Texas announced that a 6-year-old child had died of measles. Wells heard from CDC scientists for the first time the following day. Also that day, the CDC issued a brief notice on the outbreak. The notice recommended vaccines, but it worried public health specialists because it also promoted vitamin A as a treatment under medical supervision.",
      "In emails, Texas health officials privately discussed how the CDC's notice might exacerbate a problem: Doctors were treating children with measles for toxic levels of vitamin A, suggesting that parents were delaying medical care and administering the supplements at home. A local Lubbock news outlet reported on a large drugstore where vitamin A supplements and cod liver oil, which contains high levels of vitamin A, were \"flying off the shelf.\"",
      "Too much vitamin A can cause liver damage, blindness, and dire abnormalities during fetal development.",
      "Milton worried that parents were listening to misinformation from anti-vaccine groups \u2014 including one founded by Kennedy \u2014 that diminished the need for vaccination by inaccurately claiming that vitamin A staved off the disease's worst outcomes.",
      "\"How many people will choose Vitamin A and not a vaccine because it appears to them there are two options?\" Milton asked in an email.",
      "Scientists at the CDC privately fretted, too. \"HHS pressed us to insert vitamin A into all of our communications with clinicians and health officials,\" one CDC scientist told KFF Health News, referring to the agency's notices and alerts. \"If pregnant women took too much vitamin A during the outbreak, their babies could be profoundly disabled. We haven't seen those babies born yet.\"",
      "Another CDC official said they've had to \"walk a fine line\" between protecting the public based on scientific evidence and aligning with HHS.",
      "While CDC scientists held their tongues, Kennedy exaggerated the power of nutrition and vitamin A while furthering mistrust in vaccines. \"We're providing vitamin A,\" Kennedy said in an interview on Fox News. \"There are many studies, some showing 87% effectiveness,\" he claimed, \"against serious disease and death.\"",
      "The studies Kennedy referenced were conducted in low-income countries where children are malnourished. Evidence suggests that vitamin A supplementation is seldom useful against measles in the United States, because deficiency is exceedingly rare.",
      "Kennedy deflected criticism from those who call him anti-vaccine, saying that any parent in Texas who wants a measles vaccine can get one. He followed this with numerous inaccurate statements. \"There are adverse events from the vaccine. It does cause deaths every year,\" he said. \"It causes all the illnesses that measles itself causes, encephalitis and blindness, et cetera.\" There is no evidence that measles vaccines \"cause deaths every year.\" Scores of studies show that the vaccine doesn't cause encephalitis, that most potential side effects resolve quickly on their own, and serious adverse reactions are far rarer than measles complications.",
      "In another interview, Kennedy said, \"The MMR vaccine contains a lot of aborted fetus debris.\" The measles, mumps, and rubella, or MMR, vaccine does not contain an iota of fetal cells.",
      "HHS spokesperson Andrew Nixon and spokespeople at the CDC did not respond to queries from KFF Health News.",
      "\"Staff are exhausted\"",
      "Despite national attention after the country's first measles death in a decade, West Texas was overwhelmed. In late February and March, hospital administrators and health officials exchanged emails about how to lobby for resources.",
      "\"Local hospitals are at capacity,\" wrote Jeffrey Hill, a senior vice president at the University Medical Center Health System in Lubbock. \"The state reports emergency funds that typically cover a response like the measles outbreak are not available from the federal government right now,\" he added.",
      "\"I am writing to express our urgent need for additional staff and funding,\" Ronald Cook, medical director for Lubbock, said in an email, drafted with other Lubbock health authorities, to the deputy city manager. \"Our Capacity is Stretched Thin: The health department has been operating seven days a week since February 2nd. Staff are exhausted.\"",
      "The city of Lubbock fronted money to help the local health department hire temporary staff. The state did not provide money, but it asked the CDC to send epidemiologists. Some came to Texas in early March. Then Texas requested federal funds.",
      "None arrived, even as the outbreak approached 500 cases. It spread to Mexico when an unvaccinated Mennonite child visited relatives in Seminole and returned home with an infection. This would fuel the largest outbreak Mexico has seen in decades, with at least 3,700 cases and 13 deaths in the state of Chihuahua.",
      "Then another child in West Texas died of measles.",
      "In a rare moment of openness, CDC scientist David Sugarman mentioned the outbreak at a vaccine advisory meeting in late April. \"There are quite a number of resource requests coming in, in particular from Texas,\" Sugarman said. \"We are scraping to find the resources and personnel needed to provide support to Texas and other jurisdictions.\"",
      "Federal funds arrived in Texas on May 21, said Anton, the state health department spokesperson. By then, the crisis was fading. The outbreak seemed to have burned until every unvaccinated person in Seminole was infected, said Richard Eby, a doctor at Permian Regional Medical Center who treated some measles patients. Hundreds, if not thousands, of cases have probably gone undetected, he said. \"A lot of people presumed their kids had measles,\" he said, \"and didn't see the need to confirm it.\"",
      "On Aug. 18, health officials declared the West Texas outbreak over, but the consequences of the catastrophe will be lasting.",
      "The outbreaks it sparked across the U.S. and Mexico are still spreading.",
      "More are inevitable, Nuzzo said. A growing number of parents are deciding not to vaccinate their kids, alarmed by unfounded rumors about the shots. Misinformation is flourishing, especially after Kennedy fired vaccine experts who advise the CDC and replaced them with doctors and researchers lacking expertise in vaccines and infectious disease, including some who have expressed anti-vaccine views. One of his recent appointees, Robert Malone, blamed the deaths of children with measles on \"medical mismanagement,\" without evidence.",
      "At the same time, states are downsizing programs for emergency response, disease surveillance, and immunization after the Trump administration clawed back more than $11 billion in public health funds earlier this year.",
      "Amid Lubbock's toughest months, Wells sent an email to the department's exhausted staff. \"The future is uncertain, and I know this is an unsettling time for many of us,\" she wrote. \"Every day we show up and do our jobs is an act of resilience.\"",

      "Lt. Gen. Jeffrey Kruse has been ousted as Defense Intelligence Agency director, a senior defense official confirmed Friday.",
      "\"Lt Gen Kruse will no longer serve as DIA Director,\" the official said in a brief statement.",
      "The agency's deputy director, Christine Bordine, will assume the role of acting DIA director, a spokesperson said.",
      "Intelligence committee leaders in Congress were informed about the DIA chief's firing, according to a source familiar with the notification, but were given no reason for it.",
      "\"All senior military leaders serve at the pleasure of President Trump and Secretary [Pete] Hegseth,\" chief Pentagon spokesman Sean Parnell told CBS News on Sunday.",
      "Democratic Sen. Mark Warner of Virginia, who is the vice chair of the Senate Select Intelligence Committee, said in a statement: \"The firing of yet another senior national security official underscores the Trump administration's dangerous habit of treating intelligence as a loyalty test rather than a safeguard for our country.\"",
      "The DIA was the department responsible for the preliminary assessment of the military strikes against Iran's nuclear facilities. The assessment said that the\u00a0strikes\u00a0had set back Tehran's nuclear program by a matter of months, three sources familiar with its contents told CBS News shortly after the airstrikes.",
      "The DIA's findings also indicated some of Iran's enriched uranium stockpile had been moved before the strikes, according to one of the sources.",
      "That assessment prompted a backlash from the Trump administration, since President Trump had\u00a0said\u00a0in an address to the nation following the strikes that \"Iran's nuclear enrichment facilities have been completely and totally obliterated.\" He said the U.S. strikes had set back the Iranian nuclear program \"basically decades.\"",
      "DIA employees seem to have been caught completely off guard by Kruse's firing. One DIA employee told CBS News of speaking to another colleague about it, who replied with an expletive.",
      "Another said, \"If he is being fired, the workplace at large will lose even more faith in the administration. There's already widespread \u2014 and openly voiced in town halls \u2014 concern of their work being politicized.\"",
      "Two other military officials have been removed from their posts, CBS News confirmed on Friday. Rear Adm. Milton Sands, who served as commander of Navy Special Warfare Command, and Vice Adm. Nancy Lacore, who was the chief of the Navy Reserve, will no longer serve in those roles, according to a Navy official.",
      "Neither Gen. Dan Caine, chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, nor U.S. Special Operations Commanding Gen. Bryan Fenton were consulted on the decision to fire Lacore or Sands, sources familiar with the matter told CBS News on Saturday.",
      "Maj. Gen. J. Patrick Work, commanding general of the 82nd Airborne Division, was also recently pulled from a future role as deputy commander of U.S. Central Command, as well, sources familiar told CBS News.",

      "MARGARET BRENNAN: I'm Margaret Brennan in Washington.",
      "And this week on Face the Nation: The Trump administration builds up the federal presence in the nation's capital to crack down on crime, and the president vows to use similar tactics in other U.S. cities. The number of National Guard troops sent to protect Washington continues to grow, as President Trump praises his own plan to clean up the city.",
      "(Begin VT)",
      "DONALD TRUMP (President of the United States): D.C. was a hellhole, and now it's safe. The numbers were horrible. It was a crime-infested rathole. And they do have a lot of rats. We're getting rid of them too.",
      "(End VT)",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: But as Mr. Trump dismissed district leaders' claim of a 30-year low in violent crime, he's vowing a similar surge in Chicago, New York, and other cities. What could that mean for public safety in your community?",
      "We will check in with Maryland Democratic Governor Wes Moore and New York Republican Congressman Mike Lawler.",
      "Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell hints at an interest rate cut, and the stock market soars. But he also cautions that the U.S. economy is facing challenging times.",
      "(Begin VT)",
      "JEROME POWELL (Federal Reserve Chairman): There is significant uncertainty about where all of these policies will eventually settle and what their lasting effects on the economy will be.",
      "(End VT)",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: We will get a reality check on Powell's speech on the state of the economy from economist Mohamed El-Erian.",
      "Plus: A U.N.-backed group confirms residents of Gaza City are facing catastrophic conditions of famine and warn that it will soon expand to other areas within the Gaza Strip. New Hampshire Democratic Senator Jeanne Shaheen is visiting the region and will join us. We will also talk with UNICEF Executive Director Catherine Russell.",
      "It's all just ahead on Face the Nation.",
      "Good morning, and welcome to Face the Nation.",
      "It's quiet here in Washington as we come on the air this morning, but the debate is heating up over President Trump's calling up of nearly 2,300 National Guardsmen, along with federal agents from ICE, the ATF, the Drug Enforcement Agency, the FBI and others, to patrol the streets of the city alongside D.C. police forces.",
      "And we're seeing yet another instance of Trump's expanding of the federal government's reach, this time when it comes to control of police in local communities. Will we see pictures like these in other U.S. cities in the future?",
      "Well, one of the places President Trump has mentioned as needing help fighting crime is nearby Baltimore.",
      "And joining us right now is Maryland's Democratic governor, Wes Moore.",
      "Thank you for being here.",
      "GOVERNOR WES MOORE (D-Maryland): Thank you so much for having me.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: So, there \u2013 here in D.C., there are Guardsmen from six different states on the street.",
      "The mission is \u2013 quote \u2013 \"beautification duty and support.\" The defense secretary has author \u2013 authorized them to carry M4 and M17 rifles, but, to date, we have not been able to locate anyone armed within the National Guard on the streets of D.C.",
      "Why, though, are you so opposed to this deployment?",
      "GOVERNOR WES MOORE: Well, there's \u2013 there's plenty of reasons.",
      "You know, one, it is not sustainable. You cannot continue this type of pace of operations, particularly when you're \u2013 when it's costing over a million dollars a day in order to do this. The second, it's not scalable. You're not going to be able to do this in every single major American city, particularly when many of the cities that have the highest crime rates are the places that have actually deployed their National Guards to Washington, D.C.",
      "So who's going to \u2013 who's going to go do the work in their cities? The third, it's unconstitutional. It's a direct violation of the 10th Amendment. And for a party that talks about state rights, it's amazing how they're having such a big-government approach in the way they're conducting public safety.",
      "The fourth reason is because it's deeply disrespectful to the members of the National Guard. As someone who actually deployed overseas and served my country in combat, to ask these men and women to do a job that they're not trained for is just deeply disrespectful.",
      "And so when we're thinking about all of these lasting factors, when we're thinking about the fact that it serves as a distraction from the fact that the president's disastrous economic policies are making everything more expensive for everyday Americans, is making life harder for everyday Americans, there is a multitude of reasons that I am against this.",
      "And I will not authorize the Maryland National Guard to be utilized for this.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Well, the National Guard does say that these troops will be trained and deputized by federal Marshals. So this is going to be distinct from the military rules of engagement.",
      "GOVERNOR WES MOORE: But it is counter to every bit of training that we received.",
      "When \u2013 when I joined the military, we joined with a clear intention to fight and win our nation's wars. The members of our National Guard are trained up to be able to address things like emergency situations, situations where you need \u2013 where you need a surge of supports for \u2013 for traumas and disasters\u2026",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Yes.",
      "GOVERNOR WES MOORE: \u2026 that are happening within individual jurisdictions. That is not this. And this is a direct deflection that the president is authorizing.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: We know the president watches the program, and he likely saw the guest listing, because he's tweeting about you \u2013 or TRUTHing, I guess.",
      "GOVERNOR WES MOORE: Right.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: He says: \"The Governor Wes Moore of Maryland has asked in a nasty and provocative tone that I walk the streets of Maryland with him.\" And he's talking about \"crime-ridden Baltimore.\" It's quite lengthy, but he goes after your record on crime.",
      "He says it's a bad one. He says, if you need help, he will send in the troops, which is being done in nearby D.C. I mean, when we saw a few weeks ago the deployment on the streets of Los Angeles, the governor of California tried to go to the courts, and he was unable to stop it.",
      "Is the reality here is you can't stop the president from sending troops to Baltimore if he wants to?",
      "GOVERNOR WES MOORE: The year before I became the governor, in 2022, Baltimore was averaging almost a homicide a day. And I came in and I said, I refuse to be a governor who just offers thoughts and prayers to this situation.",
      "So we said we're actually going to work in partnership with Mayor Scott, work in partnership with local elected officials, work in partnership with local \u2013 with local law enforcement. We made the largest investments in local law enforcement in our state's history, over $50 million going to Baltimore City alone.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: That came from federal money.",
      "GOVERNOR WES MOORE: That \u2013 well, no, that came from both federal and state money. And, also, Maryland became one of the only states that actually helps to fund the U.S. attorney out of balance sheet, taking many of those gun crimes and actually turning them into federal charges.",
      "And the results have been \u2013 have been incredibly encouraging, where Maryland's had amongst the fastest drops in violent crime of anywhere in the United States in the past 2.5 years.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Yes.",
      "GOVERNOR WES MOORE: The homicide rate in Maryland is down over 20 percent since I have been the governor. And the last time the homicide rate was this low in Baltimore City, I was not born yet.",
      "And so the reason that I have asked the president to come and join us is because he seems to enjoy living in this blissful ignorance, this \u2013 these tropes, in these 1980s scare tac \u2013 scare tactics.",
      "And, you know, just last week I was in Baltimore, and I was with a group called We Our Us, who is a violence intervention group. And they say, we're all we got, we're all we need. And that's exactly how people in this community feel, because, while the president is spending his time from the Oval Office making jabs and attacks at us, there are people actually on the ground doing the work who know what supports would actually work to continue to bring down crime,.",
      "But it's falling on deaf ears of the president of the United States.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: You're talking about the positive trend line. The president's pointing to the FBI statistics, which shows Baltimore has the fifth most instances of violent crime on a per capita basis, fourth highest murder rate.",
      "To your point, the city of Memphis is also on that list, and the governor of Tennessee sent those National Guard troops here to this city, not to the streets of Memphis. But\u2026",
      "GOVERNOR WES MOORE: Correct.",
      "And we know we have work to do.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Yes.",
      "GOVERNOR WES MOORE: We know \u2013 like, if one person does not feel safe in their neighborhood, that's one too many. But we also know what tactics actually work and what tactics is just theatrics.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: But your \u2013 the mayor in Baltimore did just say he wants federal help. He doesn't want National Guard troops, per se, though. He says he wants agents from FBI, DEA and ATF.",
      "Do you need more federal help in policing, if your mayor thinks you do?",
      "GOVERNOR WES MOORE: Oh, absolutely. And we need the president to stop cutting funding, because, if you look at the president's budget, it actually cuts funding towards violence intervention groups. It cuts funding towards the bureaus of the FBI and the ATF that are supporting local jurisdictions like Baltimore, that it doesn't do anything about things like ghost guns and these extended Glock clips that allow these Glocks to essentially turn into automatic weapons.",
      "Those are actually real, tangible things\u2026",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Yes.",
      "GOVERNOR WES MOORE: \u2026 that the president of the United States could do and where you could put capital to actually make our communities safer.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: So you are a Democrat who is \u2013 President Trump says so as well \u2013 possibly a presidential candidate. He talked about you the other day.",
      "GOVERNOR WES MOORE: Yes.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: He's spending a lot of time talking about you.",
      "GOVERNOR WES MOORE: I have been on his mind a lot.",
      "(CROSSTALK)",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: You're spending time talking about crime. Is this something that, as a Democrat, you think the Democratic Party needs to be more vocal and muscular about when running for office? Because I hear you doing that. It's a very big change from 2020, when the, you know, idea was defund the police.",
      "GOVERNOR WES MOORE: Absolutely.",
      "And, yes, the president spending all of his time talking about me. I'm spending my time talking about the people I serve. And, yes, I believe that we have to be able to address the issue of crime. I came up in and I have existed in neighborhoods and communities that have been chronically neglected.",
      "And I remember one of the first things that happened in our first months in, I had to visit Shock Trauma inside of Baltimore because Baltimore had one of the largest mass shootings in its history. And I visited a young man, a teenager, who was just finished surgery and had one of his testicles shot off, and was talking about, how was he ever going to become a father?",
      "And I said, at that point, I refuse to continue doing this and not putting the proper resources in place, and not being able to put a real focus on making our communities safer. And that's why it is so frustrating when we're hearing from the president of the United States something that is just purely performative, without actually focusing on these communities and these neighborhoods, who believe that progress is possible and who are willing to put in the work.",
      "And we're just simply asking for Washington to be able to acknowledge it and support it.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: He says you're not presidential timber at all.",
      "I imagine you disagree with that assessment?",
      "GOVERNOR WES MOORE: No, I have been very clear. I'm not running for president.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Right now.",
      "GOVERNOR WES MOORE: But it's interesting that \u2013 but it's interesting. The president seems to be more concerned about my future than he is about the future of the American people.",
      "And that's why I'm asking him to keep his focus. Focus on the things that actually matter right now, which is the fact that his economic policies are driving up prices on everything from electronics, to the clothes that we wear, to the food that we eat. Talk about the fact that he has immigration policies that are knocking out tens of thousands of jobs in the state of Maryland.",
      "Talk about the fact that you are about to kick veterans and seniors off of health care. Don't worry about my future. Worry about theirs.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: I want to ask you. You brought up immigration.",
      "One of the residents of your state, Kilmar Abrego Garcia, was just released from pretrial detention on Friday. But the Trump administration has instructed him to report to ICE within 72 hours for deportation to Uganda. He's originally from El Salvador. He was mistakenly deported to that prison in El Salvador and then returned to the U.S.",
      "This is federal policy. This is not state policy. But I do wonder, is there anything that you are doing to help his family stay united?",
      "GOVERNOR WES MOORE: Yes, and the \u2013 what we know is that, you know, and all we're asking for is that the Constitution be followed on this.",
      "The Constitution is very clear about how we deal with these types of issues. And when we look at what's happened in this situation, it's the president manipulating the fact that we have a very broken immigration system inside this country. But instead of actually doing the work that it requires to fix it, actually working in Congress to come up with a comprehensive immigration bill, the president is using to just \u2013 working to exploit the brokenness.",
      "And I am very clear that there is no higher priority for me than public safety, that\u2026",
      "(CROSSTALK)",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: You want him to face a day in court, in other words, rather than\u2026",
      "GOVERNOR WES MOORE: Absolutely. I want due process.",
      "I just simply want a court and a judge to decide, what is going to be the future fate of this case and all cases like this, and not simply the president of the United States or the secretary of homeland security, who is \u2013 who is trying to be judge, juror, prosecutor, and executioner inside this case.",
      "I believe in the Constitution, and I believe that that's what we should follow for this case.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: I want to ask you about something your party is tinkering with here, redistricting, or gerrymandering, as some people know it.",
      "You've said you don't like talking about it, but all options are on the table when it comes to your state. There's only one \u2013 one seat here that is actually Republican, and it's a seat held by Representative Andy Harris. Are you considering trying to redraw lines in Maryland?",
      "GOVERNOR WES MOORE: Yes, I mean, when I say all options are on the table, all options are on the table.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Are you actively looking at it now?",
      "GOVERNOR WES MOORE: Yes, because. And I think \u2013 and I think we have to.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: You are?",
      "GOVERNOR WES MOORE: Yes, and I think \u2013 and I think we have to, because I think what's happened is, this is what people hate about politics in the first place, the fact that the president of the United States, very similar to what he did in Georgia, where he called up a series of voter registrants and said, I need you to find me more votes, we're watching the same thing now, where he's calling up legislatures around the country and saying, I need you to find me more congressional districts.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: He's doing it. That may be different.",
      "But Democrats redistrict. You know this.,",
      "GOVERNOR WES MOORE: Yes.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: But Gavin Newsom is doing it right now. A few years ago in New York, we saw this. This can backfire. Do you really want to go down this road?",
      "GOVERNOR WES MOORE: I want to make sure that we have fair lines and fair seats, where we don't have situations where \u2013 where politicians are choosing voters, but that voters actually have a chance to choose their elected officials. We need to be able to have fair maps.",
      "And we also need to make sure that if the president of the United States is putting his finger on the scale to try to manipulate elections because he knows that his policies cannot win in a ballot box, then it behooves each and every one of us to be able to keep all options on the table to ensure that the voters' voices can actually be heard, and we can have maps\u2026",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: And you don't think that one district where they represent \u2013 they have a Republican representative, that they are actively being represented in Maryland?",
      "GOVERNOR WES MOORE: I think, if you look at maps across the country, less than 10 percent of congressional seats are actually competitive by nature, less than 10 percent.",
      "And so if you look at the average win margin in our state and so many states, the average win margin is upwards of 20 to 30 percent.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Yes.",
      "GOVERNOR WES MOORE: So that means we already have so many gerrymandered areas that we have to be able to add a measure of fairness in the way that it's applied. And so, yes, all options need to be on the table in the state of Maryland.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: And you're looking at it, you said.",
      "GOVERNOR WES MOORE: Yes, we are.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Governor, thank you for your time this morning.",
      "GOVERNOR WES MOORE: Thank you so much.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Face the Nation will be back in a minute. Stay with us.",
      "(ANNOUNCEMENTS)",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: And we're back now with the top Democrat on the Foreign Relations Committee, New Hampshire Senator Jeanne Shaheen. She joins us from Amman, Jordan.",
      "Good morning, Senator.",
      "I know we have got a bit of a delay here, so I will launch right in.",
      "SENATOR JEANNE SHAHEEN (D-New Hampshire): Good morning, or afternoon here.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Yes, exactly.",
      "You do sit on the Armed Services Committee as well. Here in Washington, there was a sudden round of firings we learned of on Friday. There was Lieutenant General Jeffrey Kruse, the head of the Defense Intelligence Agency. He was dismissed. The Pentagon did not explain why.",
      "In addition, the Navy reserve chief, Vice Admiral Nancy Lacore, was fired. The Navy SEAL who oversees Naval Special Warfare Command, Rear Admiral Milton Sands, was dismissed.",
      "Has Congress been informed as to why these leaders are being fired by Secretary Hegseth?",
      "SENATOR JEANNE SHAHEEN: I'm not aware that Congress has been informed about any of these firings.",
      "And they come on the heels of firings earlier this year of the chairman of the Joint Chiefs, the head of naval operations, Admiral Franchetti, and a series of other military leaders. And it's unfortunate, because one of the things \u2013 one of the strengths of America's military are the professional military leaders who have come up through the ranks who have the training, the expertise to be able to do the jobs.",
      "And what we don't want is political people in those jobs who are not going to give honest assessments of the military situation wherever we happen to be. So, it's very troubling.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: I believe our feed there just froze. And we're going to try to get that back up if we can. The senator is joining us from Amman, Jordan.",
      "So I'm going to take a break while we reestablish that connection.",
      "SENATOR JEANNE SHAHEEN: The feed just froze.",
      "(ANNOUNCEMENTS)",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: And we're back now with Senator Jeanne Shaheen, who joins us remote from Amman, Jordan.",
      "We lost you there, but we're so glad you're back with us now, Senator.",
      "Let me ask you about why you are in the Middle East right now. We heard on Friday this internationally recognized body backed by the U.N., the IPC \u2013 it tracks hunger. And they confirmed, technically confirmed, there is a manmade famine under way in Gaza. This is a very rare designation. Only four other times has one been designated.",
      "The country you are in, Jordan, called it a shameful failure of humanity, that Israel is starving Palestinians with impunity, called it a war crime. Would you say that that three-month blockade by Israel of Gaza is a war crime?",
      "SENATOR JEANNE SHAHEEN: I think it is a shameful black mark on humanity that the world has allowed this to happen and that Israel is allowing this to happen.",
      "One of the \u2013 we had a very good meeting today with King Abdullah of Jordan, and one of the places that we visited is the Jordan humanitarian assistance program that is trying to get aid into Gaza. This is a \u2013 funded trucks and warehouses and food that the United States has contributed to as part of this administration.",
      "They are trying to get in 150 trucks a day into Israel. And Israel has prevented those trucks from going in, in a way that would provide the nutrition that Gazans need to prevent starvation. It is unacceptable.",
      "Prime Minister Netanyahu is the point at which obstruction is happening. He needs to look at what he is doing and change his position.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: The Israeli prime minister's office on Friday had a very harsh statement about the famine designation. They called it \u2013 quote \u2013 \"a modern blood libel spreading like wildfire through prejudice.\"",
      "That suggests this is about anti-Jewish hate, rather than starvation. How do you make sense of the Israeli defense?",
      "SENATOR JEANNE SHAHEEN: I don't think that's a good defense. The fact is, this is not about antisemitism, which I abhor. And the United States' position is against antisemitism, and we need to do everything we can to prevent it.",
      "But the reality is, we have people dying because they are systematically being starved to death because Israel is refusing to allow in the humanitarian aid that people need to keep alive. Not only that. They are getting ready to do another \u2013 or they have already started planning another major incursion into Gaza in ways that are going to kill more people.",
      "So this is not acceptable. The world needs to speak out. I think it's very important that we allow that humanitarian aid in to the people who are starving.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: I understand your criticism right now.",
      "I want to ask you a little bit, though, about standing U.S. policy, because this has been a problem even during the Biden administration. In fact, former Deputy National Security Adviser for President Biden Joe \u2013 Jon Finer just wrote a piece in \"The Atlantic.\"",
      "And he said that, while he stands by the decision to embrace Israel after October 7, he believes: \"We did far too little far too late to limit the truly catastrophic civilian harm that Israel's response inflicted.\"",
      "Do you agree with him? And do you wish that you spoke out more forcefully sooner?",
      "SENATOR JEANNE SHAHEEN: I don't think this is a partisan position.",
      "With me on this journey to Jordan is Congressman Joe Wilson from South Carolina. He agreed with me that we need to make sure those humanitarian aid trucks get into Israel. We need to do everything possible to ensure that Prime Minister Netanyahu is stopping the roadblocks that are preventing the humanitarian aid from getting in.",
      "I think \u2013 it's something that I hope that both Democrats and Republicans can embrace.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Yes.",
      "But do you agree with this self-criticism by this key Democrat? Do you think Democrats should have said more sooner?",
      "SENATOR JEANNE SHAHEEN: We should be doing more, and we should have done more, absolutely.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Yes.",
      "I want to also ask you\u2026",
      "SENATOR JEANNE SHAHEEN: I think everybody should\u2026",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Go ahead.",
      "SENATOR JEANNE SHAHEEN: \u2026 have said more sooner, not just Democrats, but Republicans.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Why are you now?",
      "SENATOR JEANNE SHAHEEN: We had the opportunity to be here today to meet with those Jordanians who are working very hard to try and get humanitarian aid into Gaza, who are being stymied in that effort by bureaucratic obstacles that make no sense, when it takes hours to scan a truck, which could be done in two to three, and it diverts the aid, when it's costing hundreds of dollars per truck.",
      "And they turn those trucks away, and when they come back the next day, it costs another hundreds of dollars more for the same truck when they find an excuse for why it gets stopped at the border. That's not a legitimate effort to get humanitarian aid into the people of Gaza, who are starving.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Yes.",
      "SENATOR JEANNE SHAHEEN: And that can be changed.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Yes.",
      "SENATOR JEANNE SHAHEEN: All it takes is Prime Minister Netanyahu saying, we're going to allow that aid in.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Senator Jeanne Shaheen joining us from Amman, Jordan.",
      "A bit of a delay there.",
      "We will be right back.",
      "(ANNOUNCEMENTS)",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: We will be right back with a lot more Face the Nation. Congressman Mike Lawler is standing by.",
      "So, stay with us.",
      "(ANNOUNCEMENTS)",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Welcome back to FACE THE NATION.",
      "We go now to Republican Congressman Mike Lawler of New York.",
      "Good to have you here, Congressman.",
      "There's a lot to get to with you, but I want to pick up on something we were discussing with the governor of Maryland. And that was this redistricting, gerrymandering that is happening. The president encouraged Texas Republicans to do it. Now California Democrats are trying to get districts redrawn as well.",
      "Why do you so strongly oppose this?",
      "REPRESENTATIVE MIKE LAWLER (R-NY): I think gerrymandering is fundamentally wrong and it is at the heart of why Congress has been broken for so many years. If you look three decades ago, there were over 100 competitive districts. Last November, only 35 seats were decided by five points or less. And mine wasn't even one of them. Despite the fact that Kamala Harris won my seat. I won by six and a half points.",
      "So, when you look at the map across the country, the fact is, roughly 400 members are not in competitive districts, they're focused primarily on primaries and not general elections, and, therefore, they're not focused on appealing to a much broader swath of the electorate. And I think that, obviously, reflects itself when you're actually trying to negotiate legislation and beyond.",
      "But when you look at the redistricting situation, obviously both parties do not have clean hands here.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Yes.",
      "REPRESENTATIVE MIKE LAWLER: Democrats in New York did mid-decade redistricting last year. In 2024, at the behest of Hakeem Jeffries, who wanted to pick up seats in New York to become speaker \u2013",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Right.",
      "REPRESENTATIVE MIKE LAWLER: They gerrymandered the maps after stacking the court and getting a favorable ruling ordering a mid-decade redistricting. Despite the fact that they gerrymandered maps in 2022 and those were thrown out because it violated the state constitution.",
      "So, now, New York is going for a third bite at the apple, according to Governor Hochul, who has made it clear since the moment she took office in 2021 that she would use redistricting to help Democrats win the House.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Yes.",
      "REPRESENTATIVE MIKE LAWLER: So, this is what you're dealing with, red states and blue states, trying to get electoral advantage right now.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: I guess what's different now is the president's direct involvement in this, which is why it's interesting you have legislation to try to oppose some of this. Do you really think you can get that done if the president of the United States doesn't want it done?",
      "REPRESENTATIVE MIKE LAWLER: Look, obviously it's going to be a fight. But this is something that I fundamentally believe we need to reform. We need to ban gerrymandering nationwide. We need to ban mid-decade redistricting. I want to include term limits as part of those reforms because I fundamentally believe when you have members of Congress, like Chuck Schumer, who's been in elected office since 1974, never held a job outside of elected office, it's time to go. You need term limits. You need overall reform.",
      "So, I'm going to fight tooth and nail to get this done. Obviously, you know, there's going to be strong headwinds from both parties because, frankly, I don't think both parties are interested in reforming the way Congress functions.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: No, they want the majority, period.",
      "On the question, though, that we have been \u2013 also been discussing with the governor, that is crime. The president of the United States has mentioned New York as another city he wants to look at to deploy National Guard troops. Do you think that's the best use of federal taxpayer dollars and are you comfortable with that happening in your state?",
      "REPRESENTATIVE MIKE LAWLER: Well, crime has been a major problem in New York for years. And Kathy Hochul and Albany and New York City Democrats have failed miserably to tackle this crime crisis.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Yes, but do you want National Guard troops?",
      "REPRESENTATIVE MIKE LAWLER: By the way, Kathy Hochul has mobilized \u2013 Kathy Hochul has mobilized National Guard troops to go into the subway system because of the crime in the subway system. So, that has been done, obviously, for the purpose of surging resources and trying to prevent crime.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Yes.",
      "REPRESENTATIVE MIKE LAWLER: When you look at the fact that in New York City, for instance, 80 percent of gun crimes do not result in a conviction or prosecution. That 80 percent of these individuals are released back out on to the street despite using guns in the commission of a crime. You look at Washington, D.C., 1.7 percent of gun crime convictions result in jail time.",
      "So, when Democrats talk about gun violence, how come they don't want to actually prosecute and enforce the law against criminals who are using guns in the commission of a crime? This is a fundamental problem and it's why the homicide rate \u2013",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Well \u2013 no, but that's a local \u2013 that's a local issue that would need to get changed.",
      "REPRESENTATIVE MIKE LAWLER: No, but this \u2013",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: But in terms of the question on the troops, you'd rather troops than \u2013",
      "REPRESENTATIVE MIKE LAWLER: But \u2013 but \u2013 but, Margaret, this is why the homicide rate is so high.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: FBI agents or ATF agents or DEAL agents? You don't want federal agents who are trained law enforcement officers in New York City, you would rather National Guardsmen who have to be trained to police?",
      "REPRESENTATIVE MIKE LAWLER: I want \u2013 I want all of the above. No. No, no, don't \u2013 don't put words in my mouth. I'd rather all of the above. The FBI, the DEA, ATF. I've met with ATF just a few weeks ago in my office on this very issue of really cracking down on gun crimes and prosecuting criminals who use guns in the commission of a crime.",
      "I was proud last year to lead the passage of the Undetectable Firearms Act, a common sense, bipartisan piece of gun safety legislation, enacted into law in the 1980s. We extended it seven years to make sure that no gun is manufactured or sold with less than 3.7 ounces of metal.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Yes.",
      "REPRESENTATIVE MIKE LAWLER: I led that effort. And the reason I did is because we do not want guns on the street being used in the commission of a crime.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Yes.",
      "REPRESENTATIVE MIKE LAWLER: And yet, as I pointed out, you look at Washington, D.C., only 1.7 percent of gun crime convictions result in jail time.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Yes.",
      "REPRESENTATIVE MIKE LAWLER: This is why you've seen the homicide rate double in less than a decade. It's outrageous. And it's exactly why the president is cracking down on crime in major cities.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: OK.",
      "REPRESENTATIVE MIKE LAWLER: And as we saw in California, he is legally authorized to do so.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: I want to ask you about something in New York state that \u2013 that matters. A good amount of money from that chips bill went to New York.",
      "On Friday, the White House announced there's going to be a change to how the government deals with that money that's meant to make America independent of Asian computer chip manufacturing and bring it all back on shore. The president wants to buy a 10 percent stake in Intel. That company says it's going to now basically have U.S. taxpayers as a \u2013 as a shareholder, own 10 percent.",
      "As a conservative, do you think that the government should have ownership stakes in private companies?",
      "REPRESENTATIVE MIKE LAWLER: Generally speaking, no. I think when you look at prior history, when we've had, for instance, the bank bailouts \u2013",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: OK.",
      "REPRESENTATIVE MIKE LAWLER: When we've had the auto bailouts, you know, in the \u2013",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Yes.",
      "REPRESENTATIVE MIKE LAWLER: In the aftermath of the collapse of the market in '08, the American taxpayer really didn't get a return on that.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Right.",
      "REPRESENTATIVE MIKE LAWLER: I think what the president is seemingly trying to do is get a return on these tens of billions of dollars \u2013",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Yes.",
      "REPRESENTATIVE MIKE LAWLER: That are being invested by U.S. taxpayers, by U.S. taxpayers into companies like Intel \u2013",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: OK.",
      "REPRESENTATIVE MIKE LAWLER: To manufacture chips.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Yes.",
      "REPRESENTATIVE MIKE LAWLER: And so rather than just give the money away, get a return on that investment.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: We're going to \u2013",
      "REPRESENTATIVE MIKE LAWLER: Obviously, this is a national security issue. We want to be in control of the manufacturing of semiconductors.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Congressman \u2013",
      "REPRESENTATIVE MIKE LAWLER: That is critical for our foreign policy.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Congressman, I'm sorry to cut you off. I'm being told I have to go to a commercial break.",

      "Good morning to you.",
      "MOHAMED EL-ERIAN (President, Queens College, Cambridge University and Chief Economic Adviser, Allianz): Good morning, Margaret.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: So, we saw the \u2013 the Federal Reserve chair signal on Friday that the Fed is going to, as expected, begin lowering rates very soon. But he's also cited slowing economic growth and a cooling job market. So, why then did the financial markets rally?",
      "MOHAMED EL-ERIAN: Because he finally pivoted to the risk that matters most for the U.S. economy right now. By construct, the Fed has to deliver two things, maximum employment and price stability. And the Fed is looking at slightly higher inflation and a weakening labor market. And what Powell finally did, and many of us feel he should have done this earlier, is he said the risk to the employment side is higher than the risk to the inflation side and, therefore, an interest rate cut is warranted. As you know, many of us felt he should have cut last month.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Well, the Fed chair said, \"significantly higher tariffs are remaking the entire global trade system.\" \"Tighter immigration policy has slowed labor growth.\" And there are big tax and regulation changes you can't quite, you know, quantify at this point. But it's a lot of uncertainty.",
      "Since economists have to build off of models and data, how do you predict where we're going if basically he's saying, throw out your models?",
      "MOHAMED EL-ERIAN: So, one of the problems is he hasn't looked forward enough. He's been very data dependent. And, therefore, he has tended to be late.",
      "Look, there is something promising in our future. And that is productivity enhancement that comes from exciting innovation in A.I., in life sciences, in robotics and other areas. We just have to manage a challenging few months in the period ahead. And if that challenge is mishandled, we will not be able to get the opportunities that we have that offset a lot of structural headwinds. And that includes high debt and high deficits.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: I want to ask you about something we were discussing with Congressman Lawler just before you. And that is this unusual decision for the U.S. government to take a stake in chipmaker Intel. That company has been struggling of late and its CEO was criticized by the president of the United States. He was criticized by the chair of the Senate Intelligence Committee, Tom Cotton. President Trump mentioned all of that on Friday, and he said this.",
      "(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)",
      "DONALD TRUMP, (President Of The United States): He walked in wanting to keep his job and he ended up giving up $10 billion for the United States. So, we picked up $10 billion. And we do a lot of deals like that.",
      "(END VIDEO CLIP)",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: The president said the CEO wanted to keep his job, so he offered a 10 percent stake in his company. Is this signaling a new era for U.S. policy? I mean, central planning of the economy?",
      "MOHAMED EL-ERIAN: I don't think so. Margaret, look, as the congressman said, it's good to send the message that companies will not get something for nothing. And that is what they've gotten used to since 2008, all the bailouts. And what the U.S. is saying now is we \u2013",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Which were paid back.",
      "MOHAMED EL-ERIAN: Which were paid back. But at the time, the government took enormous risk in many, many areas.",
      "The most important distinction, if I may here, is between ownership and control. Yes, the government can own 10 percent, but it must not control how this company manages its affairs. Because once we go down that road, that is a really dangerous road, and that will (ph) eat way at what makes America really special, which is a dynamic entrepreneurial economy.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: And I believe the commerce secretary said there won't be control, but that is something to watch for.",
      "I want to also ask you about political pressure, not just on the Federal Reserve chair, which you've nodded to, but the president is also now threatening to fire Federal Reserve Governor Lisa Cook. They're accusing her, without publicly disclosed evidence, of mortgage fraud, and urging an investigation. In fact, the Justice Department wrote a letter to Chair Powell encouraging her to be removed.",
      "Are you concerned that this is starting to be a pattern here of political interference with the Federal Reserve?",
      "MOHAMED EL-ERIAN: So, these allegations are unproven. And it's important to stress that.",
      "Having just said that, this is the fifth time in the last five years that there has been allegations against a Fed official. And already four of them have had to resign. So, what I'm concerned about is that there seems to have been a culture that has developed at the Fed that have resulted in these four resignations.",
      "But I am very worried about preserving Fed independence. An independence central bank is critical to the well-being of the economy. And there's lots of reasons for that. So, you know, one has to distinguish between the two, I can't speak to the unproven allegations, but I do think it's really important to defend the central bank independence.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Well, as I understand it, the governor has said she wants to, you know, share information and is \u2013 is denying wrongdoing here.",
      "But just the fact that it is the president directing the attention towards her, doesn't this suggest that even if Jerome Powell steps aside as head of the Federal Reserve, that this isn't going to stop, this big spotlight on the central bank that is so powerful and that the fear you have of political interference may not go away?",
      "MOHAMED EL-ERIAN: Yes, and I \u2013 my fear, and my concern, is that the longer Chair Powell is in his position, and it runs out in May, the longer he's in his position until then, the more this acts as a magnet for attacking, not only deeper attacks from the president, but much broader from the political system. And that's one thing that quite a few people are worried about.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Mohamed El-Erian, thank you so much for sharing your insight today. We'll leave it there.",
      "We'll be back in a moment.",
      "(ANNOUNCEMENTS)",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: We return now to Gaza and that stunning declaration Friday by a monitoring group that Gaza City is experiencing manmade famine and that those conditions will expand soon.",
      "UNICEF Executive Director Catherine Russell joins us now. We want to warn our viewers, there will be some upsetting images in this segment.",
      "Executive Director Russell, thank you for joining us.",
      "We've spoken so many times over the past few years about the catastrophic starvation. Now you have this technical designation, so rare to see a famine here. They project it's going to spread. Can you explain, in real world terms, what does this mean for the children who live there?",
      "CATHERINE RUSSELL (Executive Director, UNICEF): Well, thank you, Margaret.",
      "Let \u2013 let me say this. You know, it's \u2013 it's been now almost two years since October 7th. And since then, Israeli children have been killed and taken hostage and now we're seeing Palestinian children finally facing what we've been yelling and screaming about for \u2013 for months and months and months, which is the terrible famine.",
      "You know, we've estimated, at this point, that about 18,000 children in Gaza have already died. And those are children who have died from a whole range of issues. But when you think about that, that's about 28 children a day. That's almost a classroom of children every single day who have died since the beginning of this conflict. We have been saying, beware, right? This \u2013 this famine is just right around the corner and it's \u2013 it's almost like you're screaming into an abyss, you know, it's so \u2013 it's shocking that it's happened because, as you said, it happens so rarely, but it's not surprising.",
      "And what it means really is that children have been spending months and months without sufficient food. And we see just a horrible situation where children are on the verge of starvation and ultimately dying from starvation. And I think, you know, for your viewers who haven't seen this, and hopefully many of them have not, it is a haunting image, children literally waste away. And you see it in rooms where, you know, suddenly they're \u2013 they're \u2013 they're all quiet. Children are so quiet because they have no energy even to cry. And to see that happen and \u2013 especially in a place where food is not very far away, right? There's no reason for this. This did not happen because there were cyclones or, you know, droughts. This happened because we could not get enough aid into these children.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: And as you know, the Israeli government entity that oversees the Palestinian territories, it's called COGAT, says there is no famine. They say the U.N. data is flawed. The prime minister's office says these are fabrications and due to prejudice.",
      "Can you explain how you know what you know? We are showing images that we know journalists have shot. Journalists who live inside Gaza. Because journalists are not allowed into Gaza to report. How do you know what you're saying is fact?",
      "CATHERINE RUSSELL: Well, let me say two things about that. One is, the IPC, which is the organization that makes this determination, is an independent organization. They're technical people. They're not political people. And they monitor this as they go and they look at issues like, what are the levels of food deprivation, what's the acute malnutrition level, how many starvation-laden deaths. So, it's a very technical assessment. And I think we've seen in other places that this is very accurate.",
      "I would also say, to me, it's \u2013 it's kind of obscene that we are having these conversations arguing about whether the methodology works or not. We know children are dying, all right. I \u2013 I \u2013 I am tired of a discussion about, well, are we giving the right information or not?",
      "First of all, let the international press in. Let them make determinations. I mean we've talked about this, Margaret, of you coming. You should see it yourself. Everyone should be able to get in there. Absence of that, we're going to have to rely on the \u2013 the data that we have, the people who were there. And I can tell you from the UNICEF perspective, our people are tortured by this. I mean I have spoken to our staff and they are seeing children who are incredibly deprived. Many thousands of children who have had amputations and are \u2013 you know, I mean just one terrible thing after another for children. And to suggest that there's anything funny going on here is really, in my mind, just almost making the situation worse, right? Just stop the discussions, stop the arguing and address the problem. Get food in there. Take care of these children. Make sure that they have the wherewithal to survive and have a decent future.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: And \u2013 and the Israeli government controls who gets in and who gets out.",
      "On the question, though, of making sure that the food you do get in gets to the right people, the former U.S. ambassador to Israel, Jack Lieu, and another Mideast envoy, have said the U.N. agencies may not like it, but if the Israeli-backed Gaza Humanitarian Foundation is the only thing really allowed to operate, then maybe there needs to be some compromise. Why \u2013 why not? The United States government is putting $30 million to work there. Why not work with them?",
      "CATHERINE RUSSELL: You know, look, I \u2013 the \u2013 the methodology of the Gaza Humanitarian Foundation is not something that is consistent with the way humanitarians work. That's a simple answer. And honestly, you know, if you think about it, U.N. had 400 places where we \u2013 we would distribute aid. The Gaza Humanitarian Foundation had four, OK. And you have seen on television, you have seen this video of these almost apocalyptic situations where people are streaming towards these places, trying to get food. People are getting shot. It's a \u2013 it's a terrible situation. And it doesn't work. It's not working that well.",
      "Now, look, I don't \u2013 I don't much care if the Gaza Humanitarian Foundation does some distribution. Just let us our \u2013 let us do our work too. Let us in. We know how to do this distribution. And when I say \"we,\" it's not just UNICEF, it's the U.N., it's the other international NGOs. We do it all around the world. We've done it for decades. We know how to do it. We know how to do it in a way that gets to the people who need it. And I \u2013 you know, do both. I'm fine with that. But at least make sure the humanitarians can get in there and distribute the aid fairly and make sure that these children are not dying unnecessarily. Nobody wants that. President Trump has said that. Nobody wants to see that.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Yes. He did indeed.",
      "I want to ask you as well about Sudan, where there was a massive humanitarian crisis. If the United States is not leading efforts to get aid in there, is anyone else stepping up?",
      "CATHERINE RUSSELL: You know, look, the United States has the ability to be such a force for good. And we need them to step up and do more.",
      "Sudan, as you say, it's the largest displacement crisis in the world. Millions of children are on the move. They are not in school. We now have a horrible outbreak of cholera, which is very destructive and kills children within hours if they can't get aid. I mean it is absolutely horrific. And the United States can be such a force for making positive contributions. And I think, you know, other countries are trying, but the U.S. really can make a much bigger difference if they try to \u2013 to do this work and do it as quickly as possible.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: And in Sudan, what is the generational impact here when you don't get \u2013",
      "CATHERINE RUSSELL: It's horrible.",

    "summary": "Maryland Gov. Wes Moore said President Trump's rhetoric on crime is \"purely performative\" as the president offered to send troops to Baltimore amid a broader push to crack down on crime.",
    "story": [
      "Washington \u2014 Maryland Gov. Wes Moore said Sunday that President Trump's rhetoric on crime is \"purely performative\" as the president has offered to send troops to Baltimore amid a push to crack down on crime that began in the nation's capital in recent weeks and could extend to other major cities.",
      "\"While the President is spending his time from the Oval Office making jabs and attacks at us, there are people actually on the ground doing the work who know what supports would actually work to continue to bring down crime. But it's falling on deaf ears of the president of the United States,\" Moore said on \"Face the Nation with Margaret Brennan.\"",
      "Mr. Trump moved to federalize the District of Columbia's Metropolitan Police Department earlier this month and deployed the National Guard to the district to assist law enforcement, despite data showing crime has declined in the city in recent years.",
      "Upon announcing the moves, the president outlined that the effort \"will go further,\" saying the administration is \"starting very strongly with D.C.\" and suggesting it could then move to other cities, though the president has unique authority over the D.C. National Guard because the district is controlled by the federal government. He referenced crime rates in Chicago, Los Angeles, New York City, Baltimore and Oakland.",
      "Last week, Moore, a Democrat, sent a letter to Mr. Trump inviting him to attend a public safety walk in Maryland, while touting the state's investments in local law enforcement and other efforts to address crime under his administration. In 2025, Baltimore has seen a 22% decrease in homicides from last year, according to the Baltimore Police Department.",
      "The governor said Sunday that \"the reason that I asked the president to come and join us is because he seems to enjoy living in this blissful ignorance, these tropes and these 1980s scare tactics.\"",
      "\"We know we have work to do,\" Moore said. \"If one person does not feel safe in their neighborhood, that's one too many. But we also know what tactics actually work, and what tactics is just theatrics.\"",
      "Moore's appearance on \"Face the Nation\" came shortly after Mr. Trump took aim at the governor on Truth Social Sunday morning, responding to the mayor's request by saying, \"As President, I would much prefer that he clean up this Crime disaster before I go there for a 'walk.'\"",
      "Although Mr. Trump dismissed Moore's suggestion, he said last week that he would be joining federal authorities in D.C. \"on patrol.\" He instead visited a U.S. Park Police facility in Southeast D.C.",
      "\"Wes Moore's record on Crime is a very bad one, unless he fudges his figures on crime like many of the other 'Blue States' are doing,\" the president added. \"But if Wes Moore needs help, like Gavin Newscum did in L.A., I will send in the 'troops,' which is being done in nearby DC, and quickly clean up the Crime.\"",
      "The push in D.C. followed the president's move to deploy the National Guard in Los Angeles in June amid heated protests over immigration raids, prompting a lawsuit from the California governor, who did not approve of the use of his state's Guard forces and called it an illegal \"power grab.\" Mr. Trump and Newsom's sparring has escalated as Newsom's public profile as a potential 2028 candidate has grown.",
      "Moore said Sunday that the operation in D.C. is \"not scalable,\" saying \"you're not going to be able to do this in every single major American city.\" He also argued that the crackdown on crime in the district is \"not sustainable,\" \"deeply disrespectful\" to the National Guard, and \"unconstitutional.\"",
      "\"There is a multitude of reasons that I am against this, and I will not authorize the Maryland National Guard to be utilized for this,\" Moore added.",
      "The Maryland governor acknowledged that crime must be addressed, while recalling the aftermath of a mass shooting in Baltimore early in his tenure as governor.",
      "\"I said at that point, 'I refuse to continue doing this and not putting the proper resources in place, and not being able to put a real focus on making our communities safer,'\" Moore said. \"And that's why it is so frustrating when we're hearing from the president of the United States something that is just purely performative, without actually focusing on these communities and these neighborhoods who believe that progress is possible.\"",

      "The following is the transcript of an interview with Rep. Mike Lawler, Republican of New York, that aired on \"Face the Nation with Margaret Brennan\" on Aug. 24, 2025.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Welcome back to Face The Nation. We go now to Republican Congressman Mike Lawler of New York. Good to have you here, Congressman, there's a lot to get to with you, but I want to pick up on something we were discussing with the governor of Maryland, and that was this redistricting, gerrymandering that is happening. The President encouraged Texas Republicans to do it. Now, California Democrats are trying to get districts redrawn as well. Why do you so strongly oppose this?",
      "REP. MIKE LAWLER: I think gerrymandering is fundamentally wrong, and it is at the heart of why Congress has been broken for so many years. If you look three decades ago, there were over 100 competitive districts. Last November, only 35 seats were decided by five points or less, and mine wasn't even one of them, despite the fact that Kamala Harris won my seat, I won by six and a half points. So when you look at the map across the country, the fact is roughly 400 members are not in competitive districts. They're focused primarily on primaries and not general elections, and therefore they're not focused on appealing to a much broader swath of the electorate. And I think that obviously reflects itself when you're actually trying to negotiate legislation and beyond. But when you look at the redistricting situation, obviously both parties do not have clean hands here. Democrats in New York did mid-decade redistricting last year in 2024 at the behest of Hakeem Jeffries, who wanted to pick up seats in New York to become Speaker. They gerrymandered the maps after stacking the court and getting a favorable ruling ordering a mid-decade redistricting, despite the fact that they gerrymandered maps in 2022 and those were thrown out because it violated the state constitution. So now New York is going for a third bite at the apple, according to Governor Hochul, who has made it clear since the moment she took office in 2021 that she would use redistricting to help Democrats win the house. So this is what you're dealing with, red states and blue states trying to get electoral advantage right now.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: I guess what's different now is the President's direct involvement in this, which is why it's interesting you have legislation to try to oppose some of this. Do you really think you can get that done if the President of United States doesn't want it done?",
      "REP. LAWLER: Look, obviously, it's going to be a fight, but this is something that I fundamentally believe we need to reform. We need to ban gerrymandering nationwide. We need to ban mid decade redistricting. I want to include term limits as part of those reforms, because I fundamentally believe when you have members of Congress like Chuck Schumer, who's been in elected office since 1974 never held a job outside of elected office. It's time to go. You need term limits. You need overall reform. So I'm going to fight tooth and nail to get this done. Obviously, you know there's going to be strong headwinds from both parties, because frankly, I don't think both parties are interested in reforming the way Congress functions.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: No, they want the majority. Period. On the question, though, that we have been- also been discussing with the governor, that is crime. The President of the United States has mentioned New York is another city he wants to look at to deploy National Guard troops. Do you think that's the best use of federal taxpayer dollars, and are you comfortable with that happening in your state?",
      "REP. LAWLER: Crime has been a major problem in New York for years, and Kathy Hochul and Albany and New York City Democrats have failed miserably to tackle this crime.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN:-- Do you want National Guard troops?-- ,",
      "REP. LAWLER: -- By the way, Kathy Hochul has mobilized- Kathy Hochul has mobilized National Guard's troops to go into the subway system because of the crime in the subway system. So that has been done, obviously, for the purpose of surging resources and trying to prevent crime. When you look at the fact that in New York City, for instance, 80% of gun crimes do not result in a conviction or prosecution, that 80% of these individuals are released back out onto the street despite using guns in the commission of a crime. You look at Washington DC, 1.7% of gun crime convictions result in jail time. So when Democrats talk about gun violence, how come they don't want to actually prosecute and enforce the law against criminals who are using guns in the commission of a crime?",
      "[START CROSSTALK]",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: -- No, but that's a local--",
      "REP. LAWLER: -- This is a fundamental problem and it's why the homicide rate--",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN:-- that's a local issue that would need to get changed. But in terms of the question on the troops--",
      "REP. LAWLER: -- No but- it's- no- but Margaret, this why the homicide rate is so high--",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: -- You'd rather troops than FBI agents or ATF agents or DEA agents. You don't want federal agents who are trained law enforcement officers in New York City. You would rather National Guardsmen --",
      "REP. LAWLER: -- I want- I want all of the above.--",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: -- who have trained to be trained to police?",
      "[END CROSSTALK]",
      "REP. LAWLER: No. No, no, don't put words in my mouth. I'd rather all of the above, the FBI, the DEA, ATF. I've met with ATF just a few weeks ago in my office on this very issue of really cracking down on gun crimes and prosecuting criminals who use guns in the commission of a crime. I was proud last year to lead the passage of the Undetectable Firearms Act, a common sense, bipartisan piece of gun safety legislation enacted into law in the 1980s. We extended it seven years to make sure that no gun is manufactured or sold with less than 3.7 ounces of metal. I led that effort, and the reason I did is because we do not want guns on the street being used in the commission of a crime, and yet, as I pointed out, you look at Washington D.C., only 1.7% of gun crime convictions result in jail time. This is why you've seen the homicide rate double in less than a decade. It's outrageous, and it's exactly why the President is cracking down on crime in major cities, and as we saw in California, he is legally authorized to do so.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: I want to ask you about something in New York State that matters. A good amount of money from that CHIPs bill went to New York. On Friday, the White House announced there's going to be a change to how the government deals with that money that's meant to make America independent of Asian computer chip manufacturing and bring it all back on shore, the President wants to buy a 10% stake in Intel. That company says it's going to now basically have US taxpayers as a shareholder, own 10%. As a conservative, do you think that the government should have ownership stakes in private companies?",
      "REP. LAWLER: Generally speaking, no, I think when you look at prior history, when we've had, for instance, the bank bailouts, when we've had the auto bailouts, you know, in the- in the aftermath of the collapse of the market and '08 the American taxpayer really didn't get a return on that. I think what the President is seemingly trying to do is get a return on these tens of billions of dollars that are being invested by U.S. taxpayers, by U.S. taxpayers into companies like Intel to manufacture chips. And so rather than just give the money away, get a return on that investment. Obviously, this is a national security issue. We want to be in control of the manufacturing of semiconductors and that's critical for our foreign policy.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Congressman, I'm sorry to cut you off. I'm being told I have to go to a commercial break, so I'm going to leave it there. We'll be right back."

      "The following is the transcript of an interview with Sen. Jeanne Shaheen, Democrat of New Hampshire, that aired on \"Face the Nation with Margaret Brennan\" on Aug. 24, 2025.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: And we're back now with the top Democrat on the Foreign Relations Committee, New Hampshire Senator Jeanne Shaheen. She joins us from Amman, Jordan. Good morning, Senator. I know we've got a bit of a delay here, so I'll launch right in.",
      "SEN. JEANNE SHAHEEN: Good morning, or, afternoon here.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Yeah, exactly. You do sit on the Armed Services Committee as well. Here in Washington, there was a sudden round of firings we learned of on Friday. There was Lieutenant General Jeffrey Kruse, the head of the Defense Intelligence Agency. He was dismissed, the Pentagon did not explain why. In addition, the Navy Reserve chief, Vice Admiral Nancy Lacore, was fired. The Navy SEAL who oversees Naval Special Warfare Command, Rear Admiral Milton Sands, was dismissed. Has Congress been informed as to why these leaders are being fired by Secretary Hegseth?",
      "SEN. SHAHEEN: I'm not aware that Congress has been informed about any of these firings, and they come on the heels of firings earlier this year, of the Chairman of the Joint Chiefs, the head of Naval Operations, Admiral Franchetti, and a series of other military leaders. And it's unfortunate, because one of the things, one of the strengths of America's military, are the professional military leaders who have come up through the ranks, who have the training, the expertise, to be able to do the jobs. And what we don't want is political people in those jobs, who are not going to give honest assessments of the military situation wherever we happen to be. So it's very troubling.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: I believe our feed there just froze, and we're going to try to get that back up, if we can. The Senator is joining us from Amman, Jordan. So I'm going to take a break while we reestablish that connection.",
      "SEN. SHAHEEN: The feed just froze.",
      "(ANNOUNCEMENTS)",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: And we're back now with Senator Jeanne Shaheen, who joins us remote from Amman, Jordan. We- we lost you there, but we're so glad you're back with us now, Senator. Let me ask you about why you are in the Middle East right now. We heard on Friday, this internationally recognized body, backed by the UN, the IPC. It tracks hunger. And they confirmed, technically confirmed, there is a man-made famine underway in Gaza. This is a very rare designation, only four other times has one been designated. The country you are in, Jordan, called it a \"shameful failure of humanity\" that Israel is starving Palestinians with impunity, called it a war crime. Would you say that that three month blockade by Israel of Gaza is a war crime?",
      "SEN. SHAHEEN: I think is- it is a shameful black mark on humanity that the world has allowed this to happen and that Israel is allowing this to happen. One of the- we had a very good meeting today with King Abdullah of Jordan, and one of the places that we visited is the Jordan humanitarian assistance program that is trying to get aid into Gaza. This is an- it funded trucks and warehouses and food that the United States has contributed to as part of this administration. They are trying to get in 150 trucks a day into Israel. And Israel has prevented those trucks from going in in a way that would provide the nutrition that Gazans need to prevent starvation. It is unacceptable. Prime Minister Netanyahu is the point at which obstruction is happening. He needs to look at what he's doing and change his position.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: The Israeli Prime Minister's Office on Friday had a very harsh statement about the famine designation. They called it, quote, \"a modern blood libel, spreading like wildfire through prejudice.\" That suggests this is about anti-Jewish hate rather than starvation. How do you make sense of the Israeli defense?",
      "SEN. SHAHEEN: I don't think that's a good defense. The fact is, this is not about antisemitism, which I abhor, and the United States' position is against antisemitism, and we need to do everything we can to prevent it. But the reality is, we have people dying because they are systematically being starved to death, because Israel is refusing to allow in the humanitarian aid that people need to keep alive. Not only that, they're getting ready to do another- or, they've already started, planning another major incursion into Gaza in ways that are going to kill more people. So this is not acceptable. The world needs to speak out. I think it's very important that we allow that humanitarian aid in, to the people who are starving.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: I- I understand your criticism right now. I want to ask you a little bit though about standing U.S. policy, because this has been a problem even during the Biden administration. In fact, former deputy national security adviser for President Biden Joe- Jon Finer, just wrote a piece in the Atlantic, and he said that while he stands by the decision to embrace Israel after October 7, he believes \"we did far too little, far too late to limit the truly catastrophic civilian harm that Israel's response inflicted.\" Do you agree with him, and do you wish that you spoke out more forcefully sooner?",
      "SEN. SHAHEEN: I don't think this is a partisan position. With me on this journey to Jordan is Congressman Joe Wilson from South Carolina. He agreed with me that we need to make sure those humanitarian aid trucks get into Israel. We need to do everything possible to ensure that Prime Minister Netanyahu is stopping the roadblocks that are preventing the humanitarian aid from getting in. I think it's something that, I hope, that both Democrats and Republicans can embrace.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: But- but do you agree with this self criticism by this key Democrat? Do you think Democrats should have said more sooner--",
      "(BEGIN CROSSTALK)",
      "SEN. SHAHEEN: We should be doing more and we should have done more. Absolutely.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Yeah. I want to also ask you--",
      "SEN. SHAHEEN: I think everybody--",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Go ahead.",
      "SEN. SHAHEEN: --should have said more sooner, not just Democrats, but Republicans.",
      "(END CROSSTALK)",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Why are you now?",
      "SEN. SHAHEEN: We had the opportunity to be here today to meet with those Jordanians who are working very hard to try and get humanitarian aid into Gaza, who are being stymied in that effort by bureaucratic obstacles that make no sense. When it takes hours to scan a truck, which could be done in two to three, and it diverts the aid when it's costing hundreds of dollars per truck, and they turn those trucks away, and when they come back the next day, it costs another hundreds of dollars more for the same truck, when they find an excuse for why it gets stopped at the border. That's- that's not a legitimate effort to get humanitarian aid in to the people of Gaza who are starving. And that can be changed. All it takes is Prime Minister Netanyahu saying, we're going to allow that aid in.",

      "A federal judge on Friday blocked the Trump administration from cutting off federal funding to dozens of \"sanctuary\" cities and counties \u2014 covering several of the largest cities in the U.S.",
      "The judge had previously ruled in April that it was unconstitutional for President Trump to freeze funding for local governments that limit their cooperation with Immigration and Customs Enforcement \u2014 commonly known as sanctuary cities. That ruling applied to more than a dozen cities and counties that had sued the Trump administration for threatening to cut off funding, including San Francisco, Sacramento, Minneapolis and Seattle.",
      "On Friday, San Francisco-based U.S. District Judge William Orrick extended his order to dozens of other places that joined the lawsuit. Those include the second- and third-largest cities in the U.S. \u2014 Los Angeles and Chicago \u2014 as well as Boston, Baltimore, Denver and Albuquerque.",
      "White House spokeswoman Abigail Jackson said in a statement: \"The government \u2014 at all levels \u2014 has the duty to protect American citizens from harm. Sanctuary cities interfere with federal immigration enforcement at the expense of the safety and security of American citizens. We look forward to ultimate vindication on the issue.\"",

      "Within hours of returning to office in January, Mr. Trump ordered\u00a0his administration to ensure sanctuary jurisdictions \"do not receive access to Federal funds.\" Weeks later, the president ordered that federal funding shouldn't \"facilitate the subsidization or promotion of illegal immigration,\" and Attorney General Pam Bondi said the Justice Department will not offer grants to sanctuary cities. The administration argues sanctuary cities are interfering with federal law enforcement and making it harder for ICE to arrest undocumented immigrants, including violent criminals.",
      "The cities and counties that are suing the administration call those policies an \"abuse of power\" and allege they violate the Tenth Amendment, which says any powers that aren't given to the federal government should be reserved to the states. They argue that local governments are entitled to choose not to assist ICE, often casting sanctuary policies as a way of building trust between police and local residents whose immigration status may make them wary of reporting crimes.",

      "The Trump administration has been in talks to secure a 10% stake in Intel in exchange for converting government grants that were pledged to Intel under former President Joe Biden. With a 10% stake, the U.S. government would become one of Intel's largest shareholders and blur the traditional lines separating the public sector and private sector in a country that remains the world's largest economy.",

      "Intel said the government's equity stake would be \"funded by the remaining $5.7 billion in grants previously awarded, but not yet paid, to Intel under the U.S. CHIPS and Science Act and $3.2 billion awarded to the company as part of the Secure Enclave program.\"",

      "Why did Trump want this deal?",
      "In his second term, Mr. Trump has been leveraging his power to reprogram the operations of major computer chip companies. The administration is requiring Nvidia and Advanced Micro Devices, two companies whose chips are helping to power the craze around artificial intelligence, to pay a 15% commission on their sales of chips in China in exchange for export licenses.",
      "Mr. Trump's interest in Intel is also being driven by his desire to boost chip production in the U.S., which has been a focal point of the trade war that he has been waging throughout the world. By lessening the country's dependence on chips manufactured overseas, the president believes the U.S. will be better positioned to maintain its technological lead on China in the race to create artificial intelligence.",
      "Earlier this month, the president called on Tan to resign less than five months after the Santa Clara, California, company had hired him. The demand was triggered by reports raising national security concerns about Tan's past investments in Chinese tech companies while he was a venture capitalist.",
      "But Mr. Trump backed off after Tan professed his allegiance to the U.S.\u00a0in a public letter\u00a0to Intel employees and went to the White House to meet with the president, who applauded the Intel CEO for having an \"amazing story.\"",
      "After enjoying decades of growth while its processors powered the personal computer boom, the company fell into a slump after missing the shift to the mobile computing era unleashed by the iPhone's 2007 debut.",
      "Intel has fallen even farther behind in recent years during an artificial intelligence craze that has been a boon for Nvidia and AMD. The company lost nearly $19 billion last year and another $3.7 billion in the first six months of this year, prompting Tan to undertake a cost-cutting spree. By the end of this year, Tan expects Intel to have about 75,000 workers, a 25% reduction from the end of last year.",
      "Has the U.S. government done something like this before?",
      "Although rare, it's not unprecedented for the U.S. government to become a significant shareholder in a prominent company. One of the most notable instances occurred during the Great Recession in 2008 when the government injected nearly $50 billion into General Motors in return for a roughly 60% stake in the automaker at a time it was on the verge of bankruptcy. The government ended up with a roughly $10 billion loss after it sold its stock in GM.",
      "Lutnick told CNBC during a Tuesday interview that the government has no intention of meddling in Intel's business, and will have its hands tied by holding non-voting shares in the company.

Anything we can do about it?\" The post had several dozen replies and most of the commenters said their home utility bills had also risen dramatically.",
      "On the campaign trail a year ago, President Trump vowed, \"Under my administration, we will be slashing energy and electricity prices by half within 12 months \u2014 at a maximum, 18 months,\" but this year has seen energy prices rising in several states. Residents and governors in five East Coast states are blaming electric supplier, PJM Interconnection. The company is the largest grid operator in the U.S., serving 13 states and 65 million customers.",
      "In New Jersey, energy prices increased on June 1, causing a 17-20% jump in residential customers'utility bills. The utility company PSE&G told its New Jersey customers they should expect to see a higher monthly bill of about $183 for the average customer, an increase of $27.",
      "PSE&G attributed the price hike to \"an increase in energy demand combined with the need for new power generation,\" which it said \"has driven higher supply prices.\" As a utility, PSE&G pointed out that it doesn't earn a profit on the electric supply, so \"these costs are passed through directly to customers.\"",
      "PJM says it is experiencing a rapid increase in energy demand, driven by the power requirements of artificial intelligence, data centers, electrification and a resurgence in U.S. manufacturing. In its latest forecast, PJM forecast a growth in energy demand of 5% over the next 10 years.",
      "\"We don't have enough newer, more reliable energy sources,\" said Alex Ambrose, a policy analyst at New Jersey Policy Perspective, a nonpartisan think tank.",
      "Ambrose says that renewable sources like wind, solar, and battery are the cheapest and fastest forms of energy to bring online and faults PJM for its reluctance to bring clean energy into the grid: \"PJM is also keeping older coal gas plants running, even if they are uneconomical and more expensive.\"",
      "But in an op-ed in NJ Spotlight News, the company blamed a shortfall of energy on \"state and federal decarbonization policies and some economic pressures\" for closing fossil fuel-based power plants in New Jersey. PJM also said it has a queue of 63 gigawatts of projects \u2014 enough to power more than 47 million homes \u2014 waiting to be connected by 2026, and an \"overwhelming majority\" of those projects are renewables.",
      "Rising utility bills likely an issue in New Jersey governor's race",
      "Energy Secretary Chris Wright is starting to worry that high energy prices could hurt Republicans at the ballot box. In a recent interview with Politico, he blamed Democratic policies for \"pushing prices up right now,\" but conceded the political reality that Republicans may suffer in the next elections.",
      "\"Who's going to get blamed for it? We're going to get blamed because we're in office,\" he said.",
      "New Jersey is poised to be among the first to test the issue in the governor's race this November.",
      "\"Affordability is the number one issue in this race, and rising energy prices are also at the top of everyone's mind,\" Ambrose told CBS News.",
      "Mikie Sherrill, the Democratic nominee for governor, in July released a statement accusing PJM of \"mismanagement\" of the grid: \"PJM has refused to plug clean, cheap power like solar into the grid, while giving preference to coal and oil.\"",
      "And earlier this month, her opponent, Republican nominee Jack Ciattarelli, wrote in a post on X about \"Rebecca in Highland Park,\" whose electric bill he said had tripled, \"to more than $1000.\"",
      "\"Why? Because Trenton Democrats, with the approval of my opponent Mikie Sherrill, shut down six electricity generation plants around the state, stopped burning natural gas, and didn't expand our nuclear capabilities in South Jersey,\" Ciattarelli said.",
      "\"We can look at how folks are going to vote in this upcoming election, as a reflection on how they're feeling about the country at large,\" says Ambrose, \"This affordability problem is not going away.\"",
      "A Fairleigh Dickinson University poll earlier this month found that 26% of voters blame the utility companies for price hikes, 19% blame Democratic Gov. Phil Murphy, and 10% say that energy producers are at fault. Murphy is not running for reelection due to term limits.",
      "\"Utility bills directly impact elections,\" says Rob Gramlich, president of Grid Strategies, a D.C.-based energy consultancy firm. Gramlich pointed to the most infamous example of this, the California recall election in 2003, prompted in large part by the state's energy crisis. It cost Democrat Gray Davis the governorship and handed it to Republican Arnold Schwarzenegger.",
      "Gramlich indicated he expects energy prices to remain high for the foreseeable future, predicting that \"two years from now, we're going to see a lot more policy discussion about it.\"",

    "published": "Mon, 25 Aug 2025 07:49:43 -0400",
    "summary": "The first commercial carbon storage facility has been inaugurated off Norway's coast, but is storing CO2 deep under the seabed really the answer?",
    "story": [
      "Oslo\u00a0\u2014The world's first commercial service offering carbon storage off Norway's coast has carried out its inaugural CO2 injection into the North Sea seabed, the Northern Lights consortium operating the site said Monday.",
      "The project by Northern Lights, which is led by oil giants Equinor, Shell and TotalEnergies, involves transporting and burying CO2 captured at smokestacks across Europe. The aim is to prevent the emissions from being released into the atmosphere, and thereby help halt climate change.",
      "\"We now injected and stored the very first CO2 safely in the reservoir,\" Northern Lights' managing director Tim Heijn said in a statement. \"Our ships, facilities and wells are now in operation.\"",
      "In concrete terms, after the CO2 is captured, it is liquified and transported by ship to the Oygarden terminal near Bergen on Norway's western coast.",
      "It is then transferred into large tanks before being injected through a 68-mile pipeline into the seabed, at a depth of around 1.6 miles, for permanent storage.",
      "Carbon capture and storage (CCS) technology has been listed as a climate tool by the United Nations' Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) and the International Energy Agency (IEA), especially for reducing the CO2 footprint of industries such as cement and steel that are difficult to decarbonize.",
      "The first CO2 injection into the Northern Lights geological reservoir was from Germany's Heidelberg Materials cement plant in Brevik in southeastern Norway.",
      "But CCS technology is complex, controversial and costly.",
      "Without financial assistance, it is currently more profitable for industries to purchase \"pollution permits\" on the European carbon market than to pay for capturing, transporting and storing their CO2.",
      "Northern Lights has so far signed just three commercial contracts in Europe. One is with a Yara ammonia plant in the Netherlands, another with two of Orsted's biofuel plants in Denmark, and the third with a Stockholm Exergi thermal power plant in Sweden.",
      "Largely financed by the Norwegian state, Northern Lights has an annual CO2 storage capacity of 1.7 million tons, which is expected to increase to 5.5 million tons by the end of the decade.",
      "While efforts such as Northern Lights are focused on capturing carbon directly from the most highly-polluting sources \u2014 industrial smoke stacks \u2014 there have also been efforts launched to capture the gas from the ambient air, an even more controversial methodology.",
      "Mark Jacobson, a Stanford University professor of environmental engineering, told CBS News earlier this year that he was dubious of the motivations for and the efficacy of both kinds of carbon capture, and he said bluntly that \"direct air capture is not a real solution. We do not have time to waste with this useless technology.\"",
      "Jacobson thinks direct air capture, in particular, is a boondoggle, and more effort should be focused on switching to clean energy sources.",
      "Currently, the U.S. gets about 60% of its electricity from fossil fuels.",
      "\"You have to think about who's proposing this technology,\" Jacobson said. \"Who stands to benefit from carbon capture and direct air capture? It's the fossil-fuel companies.\"",
      "\"They're just saying, 'Well, we're extracting as much CO2 as we're emitting. Therefore, we should be allowed to keep polluting, keep mining,\" Jacobson told CBS News, adding that his stance has not made him popular among many in the energy sector.",
      "\"Oh, yeah, diesel people hate me, gasoline people hate me, ethanol people hate me, nuclear people hate me, coal people hate me. They do, because I'm telling the truth,\" he said. \"We don't need any of these technologies.\"",

      "Tucked away in the foothills of the Blue Ridge Mountains, more than 20 species at risk of extinction, including Mongolia's Przewalski's\u00a0horse, which disappeared from the wild at the end of the 1960s, live on the institute's\u00a0grounds. There are red pandas, maned wolves, and clouded leopards, to name a few more.",
      "The institute studies a species' reproduction, ecology, genetics, migration, and conservation sustainability, with the ultimate goals of saving wildlife from extinction and training future conservationalists. In certain cases, the scientists are responsible for breeding and reintroducing them to their habitats.",
      "But those who work to conserve these species and remove them from the endangered species list are still concerned with the rate at which species are vanishing.",
      "\"We're seeing species disappearing at 10, 100, to 1000 times the normal background rate,\" SCBI conservation biologist Melissa Songer\u00a0told CBS News.",
      "The International Union for Conservation of Nature warned in early 2025 that 28%, or more than 47,000, of the world's assessed species are at risk of extinction. That number includes more than just animal species, showing crucial insect, plant and tree species are also threatened.",
      "\"So we think, okay, well, we're losing the species here and there, you know, there's a lot of other species,\" Songer says, \"but the thing is, that when we lose one species, it has cascading effects.\"",
      "A great example of this effect is with the black-footed ferret, which originally inhabited the North American Great Plains but has been endangered since 1967. While the species remains on the endangered list, its population has grown since preservation efforts began at the Institute.",
      "\"Every animal in the ecosystem is important for that ecosystem,\" says Adrienne Crosier, a cheetah biologist at SCBI, \"they all have a really important role to play.\"",
      "When it comes to the black-footed ferret, Crosier says they are \"a mix of predator and prey for other larger carnivores,\" meaning that other animals are left without a food source in the ferret's absence.",
      "\"Anytime you take a species completely out of the ecosystem, you cause an imbalance in that ecosystem,\" Crosier says.",
      "Crosier's team is currently caring for approximately 60 ferret kits, which will be released into the Colorado wild in the Fall.",

    "story": [
      "For the second time in a row, SpaceX was forced to call off an attempt to launch its giant Super Heavy-Starship rocket on the program's 10th test flight, a milestone mission to demonstrate fixes and upgrades in the wake of three catastrophic failures earlier this year.",
      "A launch attempt Sunday at SpaceX's sprawling Starbase facility on the Texas Gulf Coast was called off because of an oxygen leak in a ground system. Monday's scrub came with less than a minute to go because of an electrically charged anvil cloud near the launch pad that did not move out of the area in time.",
      "The company says it will try for the third time Tuesday night. The hour-long launch window begins at 7:30 p.m. ET.",
      "Whenever it takes off, a successful flight would clear the way for a faster launch cadence as SpaceX gears up to test autonomous Starship-to-Starship propellant transfers next year, a requirement for a NASA moon landing as early as 2027 and for eventual flights to Mars.",
      "But the company will have to launch 10 to 20 Super Heavy-tankers to refuel a moon-bound Starship lander being built for NASA's Artemis program. Many observers doubt the system will be perfected in time for a 2027 landing and possibly not before the Chinese mount their own moon mission at the end of the decade.",
      "Speaking before the Monday launch attempt, SpaceX founder Elon Musk agreed that \"there are thousands of engineering challenges that remain for both the ship and the booster.\" He put a special emphasis on perfecting orbital refueling.",
      "\"No one has ever demonstrated [cryogenic] propellant transfer in orbit,\" he said. \"This will be propellant transfer at very large scale. But with full reusability and propellant transfer, those are the key technologies needed for building a city on Mars. And I'm confident the SpaceX team will achieve these goals.\"",
      "In the near term, SpaceX's goal is to get the Super Heavy-Starship flying again after multiple back-to-back failures.",
      "The goals of the flight are to test the Super Heavy first stage under a variety of stressful flight conditions, deliberately shutting engines down during descent to splashdown in the Gulf to make sure it can handle real failures during an actual mission.",
      "Given the nature of the tests, SpaceX ruled out a dramatic return to the launch pad for a mid-air capture by giant mechanical arms on the support gantry.",
      "As for the Starship, the flight plan calls for sending the upper stage halfway around the world on a suborbital trajectory to a controlled reentry and splashdown in the Indian Ocean.",
      "Along the way, a variety of tests are planned, including the deployment of eight Starlink simulator satellites and an in-space restart of a methane-fueled Raptor engine. Modified heat shield tiles are in place to determine their ability to withstand extreme reentry temperatures.",
      "Multiple upgrades are also in place to minimize the chances of propellant leaks, fires and engine shutdowns like those that led to the loss of the last three Starships launched, none of which were able to complete their mission.",
      "Secretary of Transportation Sean Duffy, NASA's acting administrator, is optimistic SpaceX will work the bugs out in time for the agency's planned moon landing mission.",
      "\"If you look at the company as a whole and past performance, they often times are behind, and then all of a sudden, they make these massive leaps forward,\" he said in an interview with CBS News. \"I would be hard-pressed to say they're not going to meet the goals and the timelines.\"",
      "\"Their leadership has said we feel very confident that we are going to be ready for the mission. And so I'll take them at their word,\" he said.",
      "CBS News interviewed multiple current and former NASA and contractor managers and engineers in recent weeks who unanimously agreed a moon landing in 2027 could not be safely carried out with the current architecture. And not one of them said they believed NASA could get there before the Chinese without a drastic change of course.",
      "\"I think the folks you've talked to are accurate. We are not going to go ahead and get a crewed Starship to the moon by 2030, under any circumstances,\" a senior engineer who worked on the Artemis program said. \"That doesn't mean they'll never get there. That doesn't mean the architecture couldn't work. But it's just too big of a technical leap to accomplish in the short time that we've got.\"",
      "But as Duffy pointed out, SpaceX has chalked up a remarkable record with its partially reusable Falcon family of rockets, launching them at an unmatched pace that allows the company to rapidly implement and test upgrades and fixes.",
      "As of Friday, SpaceX has launched 518 Falcon 9s and 11 triple-core Falcon Heavy rockets with just two in-flight failures. The company has successfully recovered first-stage boosters 490 times.",
      "Given its record, many fans give SpaceX the benefit of the doubt when it comes to the Super Heavy-Starship. But the giant rocket dwarfs the Falcon 9, and the requirements for a successful moon landing are well beyond those faced in a typical satellite launcher.",
      "\"My concerns have to do with how complicated the mission architecture is, how many flights there are to send a single lander to the moon,\" said Douglas Cooke, a retired 38-year NASA veteran who now does consulting work for Boeing and other aerospace concerns.",
      "\"Getting into the high numbers,\" he added, \"reduces the probability of success.\"",

We'll do our very best for all the science that's now aboard. Also, we very much appreciate the resupply.\"",
      "Along with delivering fresh food, crew supplies, experiments and station hardware, the Dragon also brought an add-on thruster kit in its open trunk section that will be used to help boost the space station's altitude to offset the ongoing effects of passage through the extreme upper atmosphere.",

      "After three catastrophic in-flight failures in a row, SpaceX readied a huge Super Heavy-Starship rocket for launch Sunday evening from the Texas Gulf Coast to put a variety of upgrades to the test and to deliberately stress the vehicle to learn more about its capabilities.",
      "Test flight No. 10 was expected to get underway at 7:30 p.m. ET from SpaceX's Starbase flight and manufacturing facility and the team was in the process of pumping liquid oxygen and methane fuel into the 40-story-tall rocket when the company announced a scrub.",
      "\"Standing down from today's tenth flight of Starship to allow time to troubleshoot an issue with ground systems,\" the company said on X. SpaceX later announced that another hour-long launch window would open at 7:30 p.m. EDT Monday.",
      "The flight plan had called for the 30-foot wide, 230-foot tall Super Heavy booster, generating more than 16 million pounds of thrust, to propel the Starship out of the dense lower atmosphere before it would fall away, flip around and head back toward the coast.",
      "During three of the nine previous test flights, the booster flew itself all the way back to its launch pad where giant mechanical arms on the service gantry plucked the descending rocket out of midair. This time around, because of the planned tests, the Super Heavy was expected to descend to splashdown in the Gulf, but it never took off.",
      "SpaceX previously said the primary objectives for the booster test was focused on its landing burn. One of the three center engines used for the final phase of landing was going to be \"intentionally disabled to gather data on the ability for a backup engine from the middle ring to complete a landing burn,\" the company said on its website.",
      "The booster was then going to use two engines toward the end of the descent and hover briefly before dropping to the Gulf.",
      "The 160-foot-tall Starship, meanwhile, powered by six Raptor engines of its own, would have headed for a suborbital trajectory carrying it halfway around the world before a belly-first reentry, a flip back to vertical and a rocket-powered descent to splashdown in the Indian Ocean.",
      "Along with deploying eight Starlink simulator satellites, the Starship's flight computer had planned to attempt a variety of other tests, including an in-space engine restart, to verify the performance of numerous upgrades implemented in the wake of the most recent test flight failures.",
      "Working the bugs out of the giant launcher is critical to SpaceX and founder Elon Musk, who designed the ultra-heavy-lift rocket to launch thousands of next-generation Starlinks and other satellites in Earth's orbit and to one day carry settlers and equipment to Mars.",
      "The rocket also is critical to NASA, which is paying SpaceX more than $3 billion to develop a modified version of the Starship upper stage to carry Artemis astronauts to the surface of the moon in 2027.",
      "But that flight will require 10 to 20 Super Heavy-Starship flights just to refuel the \"Human Landing System,\" or HLS, lander before it can head to the moon. Transferring thousands of gallons of super-cold liquid nitrogen and oxygen in space has never been attempted.",
      "And it is still not known how SpaceX plans to control propellant temperatures to minimize the amount that will naturally warm up and turn into a gas, which must be vented overboard. SpaceX has provided no details. Musk promised pre-launch update Sunday on the company's plans going forward, but the talk was also canceled with no explanation.",
      "Given the number of flights that must be successfully executed to demonstrate the reliability NASA will expect, the 2027 target date for the Artemis 3 moon landing is considered unrealistic, if not impossible to meet, by many aerospace observers.",
      "China plans to launch its own astronauts on the moon by 2030. It is unclear at this point whether NASA and SpaceX will get back to the moon using the Starship lander before the Chinese plant their own flag on the lunar surface.",
      "Given the sheer size and power of the Super Heavy-Starship \u2014 it has more than twice the thrust of NASA's current Space Launch System, or SLS, moon rocket \u2014 technical problems during development were not unexpected.",
      "But given the short time between now and NASA's first planned Artemis moon landing, the problems have clearly set the program back and cast doubt on the overall mission architecture, especially the requirement for 10 to 20 problem-free flights in short order just to fuel the lander for its flight to the moon.",
      "The first three test flights of the Super Heavy booster and Starship upper stage in 2023 and 2024 ended in catastrophic failures with both stages destroyed, either while still attached to each other or after separation.",
      "The fourth flight in June 2024 was generally successful with the Super Heavy flying itself back to a controlled splashdown in the Gulf while the Starship followed the planned sub-orbital trajectory to splashdown in the Indian Ocean. The ship's fins were damaged by reentry heating, but otherwise worked as required.",
      "The fifth flight in October 2024 was highlighted by a successful Super Heavy return to the launch pad gantry where giant mechanical arms snagged the rocket in mid air. The Starship, meanwhile, managed a second controlled splashdown in the Indian Ocean although it again suffered fin damage during reentry.",
      "During the sixth integrated flight test in November 2024, the Super Heavy attempted another return to the launch site but it was diverted to a Gulf splashdown because of launch damage to critical sensors in the pad's capture mechanism. The Starship again flew itself to a controlled Indian Ocean splashdown with minimal flap damage.",
      "But the next three flights, in January, March and May of this year, ended with catastrophic failures. Two Super Heavy boosters successfully returned to the launch site, but the most recent broke up over the Gulf while testing a high angle-of-attack entry.",
      "All three Starships were destroyed after catastrophic malfunctions, including two propellant leaks, an on-board fire and multiple engine failures.",
      "In addition to the flight record, another Starship was destroyed on the ground when a high-pressure nitrogen tank exploded during an engine test firing at the Starbase launch site.",

    "story": [
      "SpaceX early Sunday launched its 33rd resupply mission to the International Space Station, sending up a Dragon capsule loaded with 2.5 tons of equipment and supplies along with an add-on thruster kit to help maintain the lab's altitude.",
      "Perched atop a workhorse Falcon 9 rocket, commercial resupply mission 33 got underway with a sky-lighting launch from the Cape Canaveral Space Force Station at 2:45 a.m. ET, climbing away on a northeasterly trajectory lined up with the space station's orbit.",
      "Nine minutes and 45 seconds later, moments after the discarded first-stage booster safely landed on an offshore droneship, the Dragon was released from the rocket's second stage, kicking off a 29-hour rendezvous with the orbiting laboratory complex.",
      "If all goes well, the cargo ship will move in for docking at the station's forward port at 7:30 a.m. Monday. On board: more than 2,400 pounds of crew supplies, nearly 1,000 pounds of science gear, 1,300 pounds of space station hardware, computer equipment and spacewalk gear.",
      "The food includes the usual variety of fresh, asked-for items for the crew, including coffee, tea and more than 1,500 tortillas.",
      "\"We fly tortillas because ... other breads and things like that have too many crumbs and things of that nature (that float away in weightlessness), so you can't actually maintain it in orbit,\" said Bill Spetch, ISS operations and integration manager. \"Tortillas are a great substitute for that.\"",
      "On a more significant note, Heidi Parris, associate program scientist for the space station, noted that NASA will mark 25 years of continuous human presence aboard the lab in November.",
      "During that quarter century, she said, \"we've hosted more than 280 residents, we've enabled more than 4,000 different ... scientific experiments and technology demonstrations (representing) the work of over 5,000 researchers from over 110 countries around the world.\"",
      "The CRS-33 mission will bring 50 research projects to the lab, including a new study of the effects of microgravity on bone loss, a 3D metal printer to assess the capability for manufacturing spare parts and tools on demand in space, and an experiment to study the effectiveness of 3D \"bioprinting.\"",
      "\"This investigation ... is looking to create a 3D-printed implantable medical device that can support nerve regrowth after injury by bridging the gap to reconnect severed nerves while also simultaneously delivering drugs that can support nerve regeneration,\" Parris said.",
      "Of special interest to NASA is the performance of an add-on propulsion system consisting of two SpaceX Draco engines, six propellant tanks and a supply of helium to pressurize the system. The hardware is mounted in the Dragon's open-to-space aft trunk section.",
      "\"The space station's altitude slowly decays over time due to the thin amount of atmosphere still at our altitude,\" Spetch said. \"To counteract that drag, we must occasionally raise the altitude of the ISS.\"",
      "The Russians handle the majority of those re-boost operations, delivering the needed propellants and periodically firing thrusters aboard Progress cargo ships and the station itself.",
      "\"With the addition of the boost trunk on this mission, Dragon will also provide this ability to maintain the station's altitude,\" Spetch said. \"The boost kit will help sustain the orbiting lab's altitude starting in September with a series of burns planned periodically throughout the fall of 2025.\"",
      "The CRS-33 Dragon will remain docked to the station until December. During that time, the boost kit will provide the one and a half Progress missions.",
      "Sarah Walker, director of Dragon mission management at SpaceX, said the boost kit will provide about a quarter of the propulsion needed in one year to maintain the station's 260-mile-high altitude. The first \"burn,\" expected to last about 20 minutes, is planned for Sept. 3.",

    "summary": "During its secretive mission, the X-37B will test new laser communications gear and a \"quantum\" navigation sensor.",
    "story": [
      "A SpaceX Falcon 9 rocket blasted off late Thursday, propelling a reusable X-37B Space Force rocket plane into space on a classified long-duration mission. It was the eighth such flight since the program's debut in 2010 and the first since a 434-day mission ended last March.",
      "Lighting up the overnight sky for miles around, the Falcon 9 roared away from historic pad 39A at the Kennedy Space Center at 11:50 p.m. EDT, arcing onto a northeasterly trajectory atop 1.7 million pounds of thrust from the booster's nine first-stage engines.",
      "After the spacecraft climbed out of the lower atmosphere, the engines shut down, the first stage fell away, flipped around and re-ignited three engines to reverse course and head back to Florida. Heralded by an attention-getting sonic boom, the booster landed at the nearby Cape Canaveral Space Force Station to wrap up its sixth flight.",
      "It was SpaceX's 66th booster landing in Florida and the company's 490th successful recovery overall.",
      "As usual with classified Space Force missions, SpaceX ended its launch commentary with the first stage landing and offered no information about the Falcon 9's second stage climb to orbit, when the Boeing-built X-37B was to be released to fly on its own, or any details about its orbit.",
      "The seven previous X-37B missions -- three by the orbiter launched Thursday and four by a twin sister ship -- all carried out long-duration missions ranging from 224 days to nearly 909 days. It's not known how long the X-37B launched Thursday will remain in orbit.",
      "While the flights are generally classified, Space Force and Boeing officials publicly discussed two of the payloads on board.",
      "One  will test high-speed, tightly-targeted laser communications between the  X-37B and small data relay satellites making up a growing  \"proliferated\" space-based communications system.",
      "The tests \"will mark an important step in the U.S. Space Force's  ability to leverage proliferated space networks as part of a diversified  and redundant space architecture,\" said Gen. Chance Saltzman, director of space operations for the U.S. Space Force.",
      "\"In so doing, it will strengthen the resilience, reliability, adaptability and data transport speeds of our satellite communications architecture.\"",
      "The other publicly disclosed payload is a sophisticated quantum navigation sensor designed to determine a spacecraft's precise position in space by \"detecting rotation and acceleration of atoms without reliance on satellite networks like traditional GPS,\" the Space Force said in an on-line description.",
      "\"Whether navigating beyond Earth-based orbits in cislunar space or operating in GPS-denied environments, quantum inertial sensing allows for robust navigation capabilities when GPS navigation is not possible,\" said Space Delta 9 commander Col. Ramsey Horn.",
      "\"Ultimately, this technology contributes significantly to our thrust within the Fifth Space Operations Squadron and across the Space Force guaranteeing movement and maneuverability even in GPS-denied environments.\"",
      "Clad in black heat shield tiles and white insulation blankets, the unpiloted X-37B resembles a mini space shuttle with stubby delta wings and two tail fins extending from either side of the rear of the fuselage. It can be launched atop SpaceX Falcon 9 and Falcon Heavy rockets or United Launch Alliance's Atlas 5 and Vulcan boosters.",
      "Two virtually identical X-37B Orbital Test Vehicles, or OTVs, are operated by the Pentagon's Rapid Capabilities Office for the U.S. Space Force. The vehicles are designed to serve as test beds for avionics and advanced sensors, to evaluate reusable spacecraft components and to provide a platform for experiments that can be returned to Earth for analysis.",
      "Powered by solar cells and batteries, the orbiters feature a small payload bay similar to a space shuttle's that can accommodate a variety of sensors and experiment packages.",
      "The compact spacecraft are designed to end their missions with runway landings at Vandenberg Space Force Base in California or the Kennedy Space Center in Florida using 3-mile-long runways originally built for the space shuttle.",
      "The most recent flight of an X-37B began with a\u00a0launch atop a SpaceX Falcon Heavy rocket on Dec. 29, 2023. It ended last March 7, with touchdown at the Kennedy Space Center after 434 days and six hours in space. Going into Thursday's mission, the two X-37Bs had logged a combined 11-and-a-half years in space across seven flights.",

    "story": [
      "Editor's note: This article contains descriptions and an image of hate speech found on the Roblox servers and might be triggering to some readers.",
      "In Roblox, one of the world's largest online gaming platforms, users join to play, create, and be themselves in a virtual world \u2014 but some might be there for a more insidious purpose: to expose youth to hate speech.",
      "Players of \"Spray Paint!\" \u2014 a popular game on Roblox, with over a billion visits, in which players skate and create graffiti art in a virtual skatepark setting \u2014 can bypass moderation by spray painting hate messages across walls, ramps and other virtual game settings, a CBS News investigation found.",
      "CBS News documented dozens of swastikas and at least a dozen instances of hate speech targeting minority groups across Spray Paint! servers, which host multiplayer games. There are millions of games on Roblox where players can join servers to play with friends and strangers.",
      "What's happening in \"Spray Paint!\" is not uncommon \u2014 nor surprising. Roblox currently has at least 18 active lawsuits pending nationwide due to inappropriate content found on its games, attorney Matthew Dolman, whose firm is representing individuals in cases against Roblox, told CBS News.",
      "Roblox said in an emailed statement to CBS News that its 24/7 moderation system closely monitors the platform, and that the company takes \"swift action against any content or users found to be in violation.\"",
      "However, hate speech still appears in Roblox games, like Spray Paint, CBS News found. \"Within three minutes of getting in there for the first time, I also saw a swastika,\" said Rachel Franz, the early childhood advocacy program director at the nonprofit Fairplay, which advocates for children's online safety.",
      "Hate can run rampant across various Roblox games. A group called Active Shooter Studios recreates school shootings at Columbine, Uvalde and Parkland and consistently evades efforts to take down recreations, the Anti-Defamation League found in an April report. A lawsuit filed this month alleges that Roblox hosted hundreds of Sean \"Diddy\" Combs-themed games, as well as more than 900 user accounts registered across Roblox with variations of convicted sex offender Jeffrey Epstein's name.",
      "\"Roblox is fully aware that these experiences pervade its app, and it allows them to continue to exist unchecked despite the ability to control or eliminate them,\" the lawsuit alleges, and said the effects on children can be devastating.",
      "Last week, Louisiana Attorney General Liz Murrill filed a child protection lawsuit against the platform.",
      "\"Roblox is overrun with harmful content and child predators because it prioritizes user growth, revenue, and profits over child safety,\" Murrill, a Republican, alleged in a press release. \"Every parent should be aware of the clear and present danger posed to their children by Roblox so they can prevent the unthinkable from ever happening in their own home.\"",
      "In a statement to CBS News, Roblox said, \"We share Attorney General Murrill's urgency to help keep kids safe because safety has always been our priority,\" adding that it looks forward to working with Murrill to help keep children safe.",
      "\"We share the critically important goal of keeping kids safe online and any assertion otherwise is categorically untrue,\" Roblox's statement said. \"We hold ourselves to the highest standard and work constantly to remove violative content and bad actors.\"",
      "What children are encountering",
      "Predators can troll Roblox, experts say, and other similar gaming platforms, to recruit young players for extremist groups or possibly sexual exploitation.",
      "Children and teens make up more than half of Roblox players, and about 40% of players are under the age of 13, according to a 2024 U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission filing. Roblox attracts an average of 97.8 million daily active users.",
      "\"If you are a predator, it's very clear that there are opportunities to access vulnerable folks on these platforms,\" Franz said.",
      "When children play the Spray Paint! game, they might see slurs targeting Black and Jewish people and phrases like \"KKK\" and \"Jew\" etched in graffiti on virtual brick walls. In one server, there were over 14 instances of this speech, CBS News found, as well as a reference to the \"Third Reich.\"",
      "The phrase \"I can't breathe,\" the words uttered by George Floyd, who died in 2020 in police custody by an officer later convicted of murder, was written across a virtual brick wall in one server. Some servers had graphic sexual drawings, and in another, there was an instance of suicidal language, CBS News found.",
      "Roblox's chat feature, available in some games, has a filtering system that prevents inappropriate content, like discriminatory speech, from being visible, but in Spray Paint! players can bypass filtering mechanisms by scrawling text via the game's paint feature as opposed to writing in the chat, where content is filtered.",
      "Users must enter their birthday when creating a Roblox account, but the platform doesn't require authentication, meaning adults can pose as children and children can pose as older than they actually are. Kids can converse with other players via the voice chat feature \u2014 which has a minimum age requirement of 13 \u2014but also doesn't require age verification.",
      "Roblox says the company has implemented what it calls a \"trusted flagger program,\" where trusted partners can report \"terrorist content\" in an effort to crack down on hate messages.",
      "Roblox also says on its website that content uploaded to be incorporated into games is evaluated in a multi-step review process to screen for child sexual abuse material and other inappropriate content. If it is identified as fodder for possible child sexual abuse, Roblox says it is automatically reported to the National Center for Missing and Exploited Children, a nonprofit organization focusing on finding missing children and reducing child exploitation.",
      "Roblox has developed an artificial intelligence system that the company says helped submit about 1,200 reports of potential attempts at child exploitation to NCMEC \u2014 and last year, Roblox submitted 24,522 reports to NCMEC overall.",
      "Roblox says it has a human review team continuously evaluating flagged games and encourages users to report concerning activity. Spray Paint! players have the option to play in \"safe mode,\" which allows them to only view art created by other players who are on their \"friends\" list in the app.",
      "A Roblox spokesperson told CBS News in an emailed statement that \"while no system is perfect,\" the company has implemented safeguards including \"restrictions on sharing personal information, links, and user-to-user image sharing, as well as content maturity [l]abels and parental controls.\"",
      "\"We share with our community the critically important goal of keeping everyone safe online and ensuring users have positive experiences on Roblox that align with our strict Community Standards,\" the statement said, adding, \"We continuously innovate to deter bad actors and have launched over 50 safety features since last year.\"",
      "Despite efforts to curb extremism and the targeting of young players, experts and CBS News found that protections remain easy to override.",
      "\"There's a larger question of how you regulate and moderate something that is supposed to encourage creativity and freedom of expression, but actually ends up introducing some really unsafe and truly harmful and disgusting practices,\" Franz said.",
      "A double-edged sword",
      "Allegations in several cases suggest Roblox has also been used to exploit teens and children. A Florida teenager was arrested\u00a0in April for allegedly targeting children on Roblox, where he would demand child sexual abuse material over text messages or the messaging platform Discord. In Texas, a lawsuit filed in April alleges a 13-year-old girl was groomed and sexually exploited on Roblox and later, Discord. Roblox has recently been hit by a spate of lawsuits with similar claims. Dolman said his firm currently has seven cases and is investigating 400 more. Another firm filed a lawsuit earlier this month against Roblox and Discord representing over 400 people.",
      "A man in California was arrested\u00a0in April on kidnapping and sexual misconduct charges in connection with a 10-year-old he is believed to have met through Roblox. Last year, a woman in Florida was arrested for allegedly using Roblox to instruct a 10-year-old to kill an infant by dropping the 2-month-old on a tile floor. The infant was seriously injured.",
      "When asked for a response to the lawsuits, Roblox said in an email that the company is \"deeply troubled\" by any incident that endangers its users, noting that safety is a top priority.",
      "\"Roblox is committed to empowering parents and caregivers to help ensure a safe online experience for their children.\"",
      "Florida Attorney General James Uthmeier announced in April that he issued a subpoena to Roblox.",
      "\"There are concerning reports that this gaming platform, which is popular among children, is exposing them to harmful content and bad actors,\" he said in a press release. \"We are issuing a subpoena to Roblox to uncover how this platform is marketing to children and to see what policies they are implementing\u2014if any\u2014to avoid interactions with predators.\"",
      "Open-world games like Spray Paint!, where users can roam a virtual space in relative anonymity, can be a double-edged sword. Doris Chang, a psychologist and associate professor at New York University's Silver School of Social Work, says that these spaces can be affirming for queer youth.",
      "\"They can be whoever they want. Gender fluidity is really common,\" Chang said, adding it can also put those groups at risk for exposure to hate speech and predatory individuals.",
      "\"You're just interacting with people that you wouldn't normally interact with. It's completely wide open,\" Chang said.",
      "Chang said when children play a game like Spray Paint! without parental supervision, they may have to navigate problematic scenarios that might be confusing or upsetting.",
      "\"It brings up the larger question about how much parents know about what their kids are getting exposed to online,\" she said. \"Broadly speaking, Roblox is just one corner of the internet that our kids are navigating.\"",

    "summary": "Tommy Fello struggled to regain function after a stroke affected the left side of his body. A new technology is making a difference.",
    "story": [
      "Restaurateur Tommy Fello was driving from his Ohio establishment to his house on Christmas Eve when he started veering off the road. Fello, then 71, had been awake since 4 a.m. local time preparing a holiday buffet for his family. He chalked the disturbance up to a flat tire. Driving slowly and relying on the vehicle's autocorrect feature, he was able to complete his journey home safely.",
      "But when Fello stepped out of the truck, he couldn't get his balance.",
      "\"I finally realized it wasn't the truck that was veering. It was me that was veering,\" Fello said. He went indoors and talked to his wife and daughter, who said he looked unwell. About five minutes later, they called 911. Paramedics took him to an area hospital, where he lost all movement in his left arm and leg.",
      "\"They were literally just like appendages on me. I could not feel them and could not do anything,\" Fello said.",
      "A clot-busting drug reversed the stroke, but the numbness on the left side of his body, including his face, remained. He struggled to swallow, eat or drink. Physical and occupational therapy produced only minor improvements.",
      "Dr. Sharon Covey, Fello's occupational therapist and the founder of the Center for Stroke and Hand Recovery, Inc., told CBS News that his arm was essentially stuck in a bent position with his fingers curled when he met her in January 2024. The position and tension in the limb caused Fello constant pain. Working in his restaurant was out of the question.",
      "\"It was very scary. You take for granted so many of the things you do, and even the common, simplest things become like a chore,\" Fello said. \"We mark all these small victories ... Being able to lift up your arm or pick up a cup is a gigantic accomplishment. Those little accomplishments are gigantic to a stroke victim. They encouraged me to keep going on. But there was always a thought in the back of my mind: 'Is this as good as it's going to get?'\"",
      "A \"first-of-its-kind technology\"",
      "One day, another recovering stroke patient suggested Fello look into an implant called the Vivistim System. The FDA-approved implant, developed by the medical device company MicroTransponder Inc., uses vagus nerve stimulation during rehabilitation to improve hand and arm function for stroke victims. The vagus nerves are the body's longest cranial nerve, with one on each side of the body, according to the Cleveland Clinic. They regulate the body's involuntary functions.",
      "The Vivistim Therapy system involves a physical or occupational therapist sending wireless signals to the device. That signal delivers a brief, gentle pulse to the vagus nerve while the stroke patient performs rehabilitative tasks. The stroke patient also does at-home exercises.",
      "Dr. Erez Nossek, a neurosurgeon and director of the cranial bypass program at NYU Langone, told CBS News that the vagus nerve stimulation can enhance the brain's ability to rewire itself, known as neuroplasticity. That increased neuroplasticity can result in \"greater and faster improvements in motor function for stroke survivors,\" Nossek said in emailed remarks.",
      "\"There is no other FDA-approved technology proven to boost neuroplasticity for stroke survivors, creating new connections in the brain, which is theirs to keep, even after the device is no longer in use,\" Nossek said. \"This is (a) first-of-its-kind technology that is redefining what is possible for this patient population.\"",
      "A 108-person trial\u00a0published in The Lancet in 2021\u00a0found that the device generated two to three times greater improvement in hand and arm function for stroke survivors when compared with just rehab. Stroke patients who have limited hand and arm function six months or more after their stroke and are considered to have \"moderate to severe deficits\" qualify for the device, the company\u00a0said in a fact sheet.",
      "Implant aids in recovery",
      "Fello turned to the Cleveland Clinic, where he met cerebrovascular neurosurgeon Dr. Mark Bain. He studies stroke recovery, especially in the cases of patients like Fello, whose rehab progress has plateaued months after the stroke. Bain determined that Fello was a candidate for the Vivistim System. Fello became the first Cleveland Clinic patient to receive the implant on April 29, 2025.",
      "\"It didn't really scare me to try and do it. I was anxious to see how it worked,\" Fello said.",
      "The device was placed during an hour-long procedure. The vagus nerve sits just below the carotid artery, so Bain and his surgical team made a small incision to place the leads of the implant and hid the scar in a fold of Fello's neck. The key-fob sized implant was placed under Fello's clavicle. Bain said the procedure itself is low-risk, with \"less than 1% chance of any complications.\" Two weeks after the surgery, the device was turned on and Fello returned to his rehabilitative work with Covey.",
      "Covey said Fello has made huge progress since the device was implanted four months ago. She said he has no pain or tension in the limb, and is beginning to practice using his left arm to carry items. The task is difficult, she said, but isn't \"something he could have done before.\" Fello, now 72, said he's been thrilled by the progress he's made in a short time.",
      "\"I'm very, very happy to do it, very proud to do it, and I'm glad I did it,\" he said.",
      "\"The sky's the limit\"",
      "About 800,000 people in the United States experience an ischemic stroke each year, Bain said. Vivistim and other new technologies may offer hope to the patients like Fello who struggle to recover with just rehabilitation, Bain said.",
      "\"I think over the next probably five to 10 years, what you're going to see is an explosion of procedures, devices and things in rehab that will help people, once they've had strokes, to get their lives back,\" Bain said. \"In the future, I think the sky's the limit for what we can expect for stroke recovery.\"",
      "At the time of his conversation with CBS News, Bain had given seven other stroke patients a Vivistim implant. Covey said at her practice, there are eight patients with the implant receiving the paired therapy course. MicroTransponder Inc. declined to say how many patients have received the implant, but shared a map that shows dozens of surgeons and rehabilitation therapists that provide the therapy.",
      "\"I think this is the newest, most effective strategy for people getting their affected limbs back,\" Covey said. \"This is the first real technique that has been available, at least in the last 20 years, for stroke rehab. The theories that we use as practitioners to increase somebody's use of their affected arm are 50 to 75 years old. So this is a new technology that's really going to turn the stroke recovery world upside down.\"",

      "If you look up at the sky in Texas and see what could be a flying burrito, you may not be imagining things: Chipotle on Thursday launched an autonomous aerial delivery service for digital orders in the Dallas area.",
      "Through a partnership with Zipline, a drone delivery and logistics provider, Chipotle is introducing Zipotle, new delivery service for its customers. With Zipotle, small aircrafts called Zips can deliver digital orders directly to customers' homes in just a few minutes, Chipotle said\u00a0in an announcement on Thursday.",
      "Initially, just \"a small number\" of customers will be able to experience Zipotle, according to Chipotle, which said that it would expand the service in the coming weeks.",
      "The burrito chain is touting Zipotle as a superior delivery service that helps customers get their food faster, so that it stays fresh. Everything on Chipotle's menu is available for drone delivery in the Dallas area, the company added. Orders for Zipotle delivery need to be placed through the Zipline app, available through the Apple and Android app stores.",
      "Here's how it works",
      "Once a customer places an order, a Chipotle worker then packs it and places it at a Zipping Point where a Zip drone picks up the order and delivers it to the customer. When the autonomous aircraft arrives at a customer's home, it hovers about 300 feet in the air while lowering and \"gently\" placing the order on the ground, the company states.",
      "Chipotle said the first location to offer Zipotle delivery is at 3109 Lakeview Pkwy, in Rowlett, a suburb in the eastern part of Dallas.",
      "\"Zipotle is a quick and convenient source of delivery that lets guests enjoy our real food from places that are traditionally challenging to serve, including backyards and public parks,\" Curt Garner, president and chief strategy and technology officer at Chipotle said in the announcement.",
      "\"With Zipline, you tap a button, and minutes later food magically appears \u2014 hot, fresh, and ultra-fast,\" Zipline CEO and co-founder Rinaudo Cliffton said in the same announcement. \"What once felt like science fiction is soon going to become totally normal,\" he added.",
      "For now, each autonomous aircraft can carry orders of up to 5.5 pounds in weight. That will increase eventually to 8 pounds, Chipotle said.",
      "Last year, Chipotle was criticized by some customers who alleged certain restaurants were\u00a0skimping on portions. The company initially denied the claims, before then CEO Brian Niccol\u00a0acknowledged that about 10%\u00a0of Chipotle's 3,500 locations had indeed been underserving customers.",

    "summary": "SpaceX hopes to pick up the pace with Super Heavy-Starship test flights amid concern the rocket may not be ready in time for a planned 2027 moon landing.",
    "story": [
      "For the second time in a row, SpaceX was forced to call off an attempt to launch its giant Super Heavy-Starship rocket on the program's 10th test flight, a milestone mission to demonstrate fixes and upgrades in the wake of three catastrophic failures earlier this year.",
      "A launch attempt Sunday at SpaceX's sprawling Starbase facility on the Texas Gulf Coast was called off because of an oxygen leak in a ground system. Monday's scrub came with less than a minute to go because of an electrically charged anvil cloud near the launch pad that did not move out of the area in time.",
      "The company says it will try for the third time Tuesday night. The hour-long launch window begins at 7:30 p.m. ET.",
      "Whenever it takes off, a successful flight would clear the way for a faster launch cadence as SpaceX gears up to test autonomous Starship-to-Starship propellant transfers next year, a requirement for a NASA moon landing as early as 2027 and for eventual flights to Mars.",
      "But the company will have to launch 10 to 20 Super Heavy-tankers to refuel a moon-bound Starship lander being built for NASA's Artemis program. Many observers doubt the system will be perfected in time for a 2027 landing and possibly not before the Chinese mount their own moon mission at the end of the decade.",
      "Speaking before the Monday launch attempt, SpaceX founder Elon Musk agreed that \"there are thousands of engineering challenges that remain for both the ship and the booster.\" He put a special emphasis on perfecting orbital refueling.",
      "\"No one has ever demonstrated [cryogenic] propellant transfer in orbit,\" he said. \"This will be propellant transfer at very large scale. But with full reusability and propellant transfer, those are the key technologies needed for building a city on Mars. And I'm confident the SpaceX team will achieve these goals.\"",
      "In the near term, SpaceX's goal is to get the Super Heavy-Starship flying again after multiple back-to-back failures.",
      "The goals of the flight are to test the Super Heavy first stage under a variety of stressful flight conditions, deliberately shutting engines down during descent to splashdown in the Gulf to make sure it can handle real failures during an actual mission.",
      "Given the nature of the tests, SpaceX ruled out a dramatic return to the launch pad for a mid-air capture by giant mechanical arms on the support gantry.",
      "As for the Starship, the flight plan calls for sending the upper stage halfway around the world on a suborbital trajectory to a controlled reentry and splashdown in the Indian Ocean.",
      "Along the way, a variety of tests are planned, including the deployment of eight Starlink simulator satellites and an in-space restart of a methane-fueled Raptor engine. Modified heat shield tiles are in place to determine their ability to withstand extreme reentry temperatures.",
      "Multiple upgrades are also in place to minimize the chances of propellant leaks, fires and engine shutdowns like those that led to the loss of the last three Starships launched, none of which were able to complete their mission.",
      "Secretary of Transportation Sean Duffy, NASA's acting administrator, is optimistic SpaceX will work the bugs out in time for the agency's planned moon landing mission.",
      "\"If you look at the company as a whole and past performance, they often times are behind, and then all of a sudden, they make these massive leaps forward,\" he said in an interview with CBS News. \"I would be hard-pressed to say they're not going to meet the goals and the timelines.\"",
      "\"Their leadership has said we feel very confident that we are going to be ready for the mission. And so I'll take them at their word,\" he said.",
      "CBS News interviewed multiple current and former NASA and contractor managers and engineers in recent weeks who unanimously agreed a moon landing in 2027 could not be safely carried out with the current architecture. And not one of them said they believed NASA could get there before the Chinese without a drastic change of course.",
      "\"I think the folks you've talked to are accurate. We are not going to go ahead and get a crewed Starship to the moon by 2030, under any circumstances,\" a senior engineer who worked on the Artemis program said. \"That doesn't mean they'll never get there. That doesn't mean the architecture couldn't work. But it's just too big of a technical leap to accomplish in the short time that we've got.\"",
      "But as Duffy pointed out, SpaceX has chalked up a remarkable record with its partially reusable Falcon family of rockets, launching them at an unmatched pace that allows the company to rapidly implement and test upgrades and fixes.",
      "As of Friday, SpaceX has launched 518 Falcon 9s and 11 triple-core Falcon Heavy rockets with just two in-flight failures. The company has successfully recovered first-stage boosters 490 times.",
      "Given its record, many fans give SpaceX the benefit of the doubt when it comes to the Super Heavy-Starship. But the giant rocket dwarfs the Falcon 9, and the requirements for a successful moon landing are well beyond those faced in a typical satellite launcher.",
      "\"My concerns have to do with how complicated the mission architecture is, how many flights there are to send a single lander to the moon,\" said Douglas Cooke, a retired 38-year NASA veteran who now does consulting work for Boeing and other aerospace concerns.",
      "\"Getting into the high numbers,\" he added, \"reduces the probability of success.\"",

      "Hurricane Katrina was a terrifying experience for more than a million people affected across the Gulf Coast region. Nearly 1,400 people died, most of them in New Orleans \u2014 and 20 years later, some communities are still struggling to recover.",
      "The National Hurricane Center says the costliest hurricane in U.S. history \u2014 more than $201 billion based on the 2024 Consumer Price Index adjusted cost \u2014 caused widespread flood damage across Louisiana, Mississippi, and Alabama.",
      "On Dauphin Island, Alabama, the barrier island town's west end beach was severed during Katrina. A 1.5 mile-wide gap was left behind. More than 300 homes were destroyed on the island, and for many of those homes, the land on which they stood was permanently washed away.",
      "Since Hurricane Katrina made landfall on Aug. 29, 2005, Dauphin Island has been shrinking and moving even more from additional storms and sea level rise. The island is now facing a dire existential crisis.",
      "Mayor Jeff Collier never imagined storms, big or small, would batter the island so hard. Some residents are still paying property taxes on lots that are now under Gulf waters \u2014 vacationers frequently swimming over top of them.",
      "\"This area here is where most of those underwater lots are,\" Collier said as he took a CBS News crew on a tour of Dauphin Island. \"There are probably 50 lots in this stretch of the island.\"",

      "Over the last 20 years, the town has rebuilt some of its white sand beaches. Last year, on the island's east end, the town was able to use Deepwater Horizon Oil Spill settlement money on a beach erosion project to push Gulf waters back about 350 to 400 feet, according to the mayor.",
      "But on a barrier island like Dauphin, constant maintenance is critical. Jillian Fairbanks visits the island frequently and has seen the erosion first-hand over time.",

      "\"It's more calm, laid back, peaceful,\" Fairbanks said. \"I'll come here as long as it's here.\"",
      "It will take millions of dollars from several grant sources to preserve what's left, and Collier says that's the biggest challenge.",
      "Dauphin Island is planning to use more oil spill settlement money to help pay for another beach restoration project for the island's west end, which will cost $60 million. The mayor is still pursuing additional funding sources to make the project possible.",
      "He's also utilizing help from an Environmental Protection Agency grant to upgrade the town's stormwater runoff systems to help mitigate street flooding during storms, even low-grade ones. As of April, Collier says the town had already spent more than $420,000 on the $1.2 million project.",
      "Because these projects need continuous upkeep and oversight, Collier sought help from a special FEMA program. He said a grant for a $250,000 project would help the town hire an engineering and design firm to create a specialized disaster mitigation plan.",

      "\"We selected over 1,900 projects. FEMA selected over 1,900 projects worth nearly $5 billion,\" Hiebert said. \"This included\u00a0$150 million over three grants to improve three canal basins in South Florida\u00a0that are plagued by flooding.\"",
      "He added the BRIC program was also funding a massive flooding mitigation project in Washington state.",
      "\"The North Shore Levy \u2014 $80 million in federal funding to a community that has suffered significant economic disruption in recent years,\" he said. \"It was going to protect 3,100 homes and businesses, removing them from the FEMA-designated floodplain and reducing risk in that community.\"",
      "Hiebert said it also helped some other western communities with wildfire mitigation efforts and was first established with bipartisan support.",
      "\"It was established during the first Trump administration, after the passage of the Disaster Recovery Reform Act, and it helped solve several long-standing challenges with local governments,\" Hiebert said.",
      "Against Hiebert's wishes, the Trump administration's\u00a0FEMA canceled the program in April, calling it \"wasteful and ineffective.\" In another announcement, the agency said BRIC resulted in a \"lack of concrete results.\"",
      "Hiebert said he supports any administration's ability to \"evolve and adapt\" and he doesn't see changes to FEMA as a bad thing, but he believes the cancellation of such projects is \"devastating\" to the places that need them.",
      "\"If the administration wants to change FEMA, or change the BRIC program to something different that looks a little different, that's the prerogative. That's good,\" he said. \"These communities that were expecting these funds, that were counting on these funds for these real large-scale infrastructure projects, what hurts me the most is to know that some of them, or many of them, may not get built, and that these risks ... don't have another place to turn to address these risks.\"",
      "Hiebert said he quit his position in June, two months after the program was scrapped.\u00a0A group of 20 states last month sued the Trump administration, seeking to block what they say was an illegal termination of BRIC.",
      "In response to the lawsuit, a FEMA spokesperson told CBS News that resiliency is a priority for the Department of Homeland Security, which oversees FEMA. \"But over the last four years the Biden Administration used the BRIC program as a piggy bank for its green new deal agenda,\" the spokesperson said.",
      "FEMA data shows the cut impacted nearly 700 projects at a cost of $3.6 billion.\u00a0A CBS News investigation\u00a0found that the recent BRIC funding cuts have disproportionately affected counties that supported Mr. Trump in the 2024 election. The elimination of the BRIC program also especially deprives vulnerable communities across the Southeast, the CBS News data analysis found.",
      "Earlier this month, a federal judge temporarily blocked the BRIC funding reallocation, arguing the transfer could lead to \"irreparable harm\" to flood-prone areas. Meanwhile, Collier says he has not heard any word from the federal government about next steps.",
      "\"We're kind of in a limbo situation right now waiting to see what comes out of that,\" Collier said.",
      "CBS News reached out to FEMA for a comment, but has not received a response.",
      "Collier said if it comes down to it, he will pursue paying for the hazard mitigation plan out of pocket.",
      "\"Of course, it's nicer when you have grant funds to work with, but at the same time, this is such a critically important thing that we need ... If we can't get the funding elsewhere, you know, we just have to just deal with it ourselves,\" Collier said. \"So, one way or the other, we're going to get our plan in place.\"",
      "Time is something Dauphin Island cannot afford. Even without a major hurricane, the beach is expected to continue washing away.",
      "Asked what keeps him up at night, Collier said, \"just the fact that we know additional hurricanes will eventually hit this area ... knowing that there's a clock ticking, that we only have a certain length of time in order to make differences and changes on the island before the next one hits.\"",

      "The search is taking place near Rock Island Campground outside of Leavenworth, Washington, where the bodies of the girls and Decker's truck were found on June 2. Chelan County Sheriff Michael Morrison described the search area as \"rugged and heavily forested terrain.\"",
      "\"The areas being searched are extremely challenging with steep hillsides, dense brush, minimal cell service, and unpredictable conditions,\" he said in a statement.",
      "The search for Decker so far has not produced conclusive evidence to indicate if he is alive or dead, the sheriff said.",

He has been wanted since he failed to return them to their mother on time after a planned visitation, prompting her to call police.",
      "The FBI's search is expected to last through Tuesday, the sheriff said. It will include nearly 100 personnel, including special agents, intelligence analysts and experts from the FBI's Critical Incident Response Group, he said.",
      "\"These resources demonstrate the seriousness with which every agency is approaching this case,\" Morrison said.",
      "\"You can't be too thorough in a search like this,\" Peter Orth, the FBI's supervisory senior resident agent in Yakima,\u00a0told CBS affiliate KIRO-TV. \"It is such incredibly dense vegetation that anybody who walks down one of these trails could walk 10 meters off the trail and no one would ever know they're there.\"",

      "\"When NWS fly larvae (maggots) burrow into the flesh of a living animal, they cause serious, often deadly damage to the animal,\" the\u00a0USDA\u00a0says. \"NWS can infest livestock, pets, wildlife, occasionally birds, and in rare cases, people.\"",

      "\"These eggs hatch into dangerous parasitic larvae, and the maggots burrow or screw into flesh with sharp mouth hooks,\" the parks department says. \"Wounds can become larger, and an infestation can often cause serious, deadly damage or death to the infected animal.\"",
      "It is usually found in South America and the Caribbean. Those at higher risk of suffering from the condition include people living in rural areas in places where NWS is endemic, and where livestock are raised, as well as people with open sores or wounds, and vulnerable populations, the CDC says.",

      "Washington \u2014\u00a0Kilmar Abrego Garcia is being processed for deportation to Uganda, the Department of Homeland Security said, after he was taken into custody Monday by Immigration and Customs Enforcement, days after his release from criminal custody.",
      "Abrego Garcia, a native of El Salvador, was mistakenly deported to his home country in March and held in a notorious Salvadoran prison for months before being returned to the U.S. in June where he was jailed on federal human smuggling charges. A judge ruled that he should be released from detention ahead of a trial set for January.",
      "Abrego Garcia was freed from pretrial detention last Friday. CBS News reported on Saturday that his attorneys were then sent a court-required notice of his potential\u00a0deportation to Uganda. He arrived at the ICE facility on Monday morning to check in, speaking in Spanish to supporters who had gathered in a show of support outside of the facility.",
      "\"There was no need for them to take him into ICE detention. He was already on electronic monitoring from the U.S. Marshals Service and basically on house arrest,\" his attorney Simon Sandoval-Moshenberg said. \"The only reason that they've chosen to take him into detention is to punish him. To punish him for exercising his constitutional rights.\"",
      "Sandoval-Moshenberg filed a new lawsuit on Abrego Garcia's behalf on Monday challenging his confinement and deportation to any country \"unless and until he had a fair trial in an immigration court.\"",
      "The U.S. district court in Maryland soon issued an order preventing the government from immediately removing Abrego Garcia from the U.S. or altering his legal status, meaning his deportation is on hold for now. The court has issued the standing order in all cases involving migrant detainees challenging the legality of their detentions in recent months, a move the Justice Department is challenging as unlawful.",
      "Judge Paula Xinis, who is assigned to the case, held a hearing on Abrego Garcia's new suit on Monday. She issued an oral order preventing the Trump administration from moving Abrego Garcia from the ICE facility in Virginia where he is now being held.",
      "The Department of Homeland Security claims Abrego Garcia is a member of the MS-13 gang, which his family denies.",
      "Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem said\u00a0in a statement that ICE had arrested Abrego Garcia and was \"processing him for deportation.\" DHS said he is \"being processed for removal to Uganda.\" The U.S. reached an agreement with Uganda to accept some deportees last week.",
      "\"President Trump is not going to allow this illegal alien, who is an MS-13 gang member, human trafficker, serial domestic abuser, and child predator to terrorize American citizens any longer,\" Noem said.",
      "In a legal filing over the weekend, Abrego Garcia's lawyers said he was offered a plea deal that included deportation to Costa Rica. His legal team said they then received a notice of his possible deportation to Uganda. Sandoval-Moshenberg clarified Monday that Abrego Garcia had stated that he was willing to accept refugee status in Costa Rica.",
      "\"The fact that they're holding Costa Rica as a carrot and using Uganda as a stick to try to coerce him to plead guilty to a crime is such clear evidence that they're weaponizing the immigration system in a manner that is completely unconstitutional,\" Sandoval-Moshenberg said Monday.",
      "Sen. Chris Van Hollen, a Maryland Democrat who traveled to El Salvador to advocate for the return of Abrego Garcia earlier this year, met with him Sunday. Van Hollen said in a statement that he was glad to \"welcome him back to Maryland after what has been a long and torturous nightmare.\"",
      "\"The federal courts and public outcry forced the Administration to bring \u00c1brego Garc\u00eda back to Maryland, but Trump's cronies continue to lie about the facts in his case and they are engaged in a malicious abuse of power as they threaten to deport him to Uganda \u2014 to block his chance to defend himself against the new charges they brought,\" Van Hollen said. \"As I told Kilmar and his wife Jennifer, we will stay in this fight for justice and due process because if his rights are denied, the rights of everyone else are put at risk.\"",
      "An immigration judge ruled in 2019 that Abrego Garcia may not be deported to El Salvador because he feared persecution by local gangs in the Central American country.",
      "Maryland Gov. Wes Moore advocated for due process for Abrego Garcia on Sunday, saying on \"Face the Nation with Margaret Brennan\" that \"I just simply want a court and a judge to decide what is going to be the future fate of this case and all cases like this, and not simply the president of the United States or the secretary of homeland security who is trying to be judge, juror, prosecutor and executioner inside this case.\"",

      "Elon Musk on Monday targeted Apple and OpenAI in an antitrust lawsuit alleging that the iPhone maker and the ChatGPT maker are teaming up to thwart competition in artificial intelligence.",
      "The 61-page complaint filed in Texas federal court follows through on a threat that Musk made two weeks ago when he accused Apple of unfairly favoring OpenAI and ChatGPT in the iPhone's app store rankings for top AI apps.",
      "Musk's post insinuated that Apple had rigged the system against ChatGPT competitors such as the Grok chatbot made by his own xAI. Now, he is detailing a litany of grievances in the lawsuit \u2014 filed by xAI and another of his corporate entities, X Corp. \u2014 in an attempt to win monetary damages and a court order prohibiting the alleged illegal tactics.",
      "The double-barreled legal attack weaves together several recently unfolding narratives to recast a year-old partnership between Apple and OpenAI as a veiled conspiracy to stifle competition during a technological shift that could prove as revolutionary as the 2007 release of the iPhone.",
      "\"This is a tale of two monopolists joining forces to ensure their continued dominance in a world rapidly driven by the most powerful technology humanity has ever created: artificial intelligence,\" the lawsuit asserts.",
      "The complaint portrays Apple as a company that views AI as an \"existential threat\" to its future success, prompting it to collude with OpenAI in an attempt to protect the iPhone franchise that has long been its biggest moneymaker.",
      "Some of the allegations accusing Apple of trying to shield the iPhone from do-everything \"super apps,\" such as the one Musk has long been trying to create with X, echo an antitrust lawsuit filed against Apple last year by the U.S. Department of Justice.",
      "The complaint casts OpenAI as a threat to humanity bent on putting profits before public safety as it tries to build on its phenomenal growth since the late 2022 release of ChatGPT. The depiction mirrors one already being drawn in another federal lawsuit that Musk filed last year, alleging OpenAI had betrayed its founding mission to serve as a nonprofit research lab for the public good.",
      "OpenAI has countered with a lawsuit against Musk accusing him of harassment \u2014 an allegation that the company cited in its response to Monday's antitrust lawsuit. \"This latest filing is consistent with Mr. Musk's ongoing pattern of harassment,\" OpenAI said in a statement.",
      "Apple didn't immediately respond to a request for comment.",
      "The crux of the lawsuit revolves around Apple's decision to use ChatGPT as an AI-powered \"answer engine\" on the iPhone when the built-in technology on its device couldn't satisfy user needs. The partnership announced last year was part of Apple's late entry into the AI race that was supposed to be powered mostly by its own on-device technology, but the company still hasn't been able to deliver on all its promises.",
      "Apple's own AI shortcomings may be helping drive more usage of ChatGPT on the iPhone, providing OpenAI with invaluable data that's unavailable to Grok and other would-be competitors because it's currently an exclusive partnership.",
      "The alliance has provided Apple with an incentive to improperly elevate ChatGPT in the AI rankings of the iPhone's app store, the lawsuit alleges. Other AI apps from DeekSeek and Perplexity have periodically reached the top spot in the Apple app store's AI rankings in at least some parts of the world since Apple announced its deal with ChatGPT.",
      "The lawsuit doesn't mention the potential threat that ChatGPT could also pose to Apple and the iPhone's future popularity. As part of its expansion efforts, OpenAI recruited former Apple designer Jony Ive to oversee a project aimed at building an AI-powered device that many analysts believe could eventually mount a challenge to the iPhone.",

    "story": [
      "In a sign of homesellers' frustration with how long it's taking to sell their properties,\u00a0more owners are opting to pull their homes off the market rather than lower the asking price.",
      "That's according to a recent\u00a0report from Realtor.com finding that so-called delistings, or homes taken off the market without having been sold, were up 38% in June since the start of 2025 and 48% from a year ago.",
      "\"Fewer and fewer sellers are deciding to enter the market, and increasingly more are deciding to jump out,\" Jake Krimmel, senior economist at Realtor.com told CBS MoneyWatch.",
      "Signs of deadlock",
      "One indicator that more sellers are exiting the housing market is the ratio between the number of delistings and listings. For every 100 new homes listed nationally in June, 21 homes were taken off the market, the report found. That's up from 13 delisted homes per 100 new listings in May.",
      "A steady rise in delistings could push buyers and sellers further apart, creating a deadlock in the housing market, according to Krimmel.",
      "\"The thing that's going to prevent buyers and sellers from getting closer together is if all the sellers who maybe could or should be lowering their prices to meet the demand where it is are instead taking their homes off the market altogether,\" he said. \"So it's kind of like keeping us in this holding pattern.\"",
      "The trend comes as the supply of homes for sale begins to grow in certain U.S. regions, causing prices in those areas to drop. The number of homes for sale in July surged nearly 25% from a year ago, a post-pandemic high. according to Realtor.com.",
      "Despite the rise in housing inventory, home sales around the U.S. remain relatively stagnant, with steep prices and high mortgage rates continuing to deter many would-be homebuyers, experts told CBS MoneyWatch. Realtor.com data shows that pending home sales, or listings under contract, in July fell 3% in compared with the same period last year.",
      "No hurry to sell",
      "When homeowners are eager to sell a property, they typically lower the price in order to offload it quicker. However, those who are not up against the same type of time constraints may be willing to wait it out longer \u2014 especially if they're benefiting from a favorable mortgage rate.",
      "\"Maybe you're locked into payments that are relatively affordable for you,\" Krimmel said. \"You would prefer to sell, but not at a price that you're not comfortable with.\"",
      "Another factor is playing into the delisting trend, experts said \u2014 the surge in housing prices during the COVID-19 pandemic, when the housing market was red hot. As newly remote workers flocked to areas like Austin, Texas, home prices rose at\u00a0record levels, giving sellers a chance to cash in.",
      "While the market has since cooled substantially, sellers' pricing expectations have been slower to catch up.",
      "\"Maybe we've gotten a bit spoiled by very high home prices over the last many years, but we are seeing some softness in the market right now,\" Nancy Vanden Houten, lead U.S. economist at Oxford Economics, told CBS MoneyWatch.",
      "That may not be true in all markets, however. Miami is one of the places where sellers have been least willing to budge on price. According to Realtor.com's analysis, 59 homes were delisted for every 100 new homes listed in the southern Florida city \u2014 the highest ratio among the cities Realtor.com tracked. Meanwhile, less than 18% of listed homes in Miami came with a price reduction in July, according to Realtor.com.",
      "\"If sellers are choosing to take properties off the market rather than lower prices, it may signal renewed confidence in Miami's future, and a growing belief that this is a market worth holding for the long haul,\" Ana Bozovic, a Miami-based real estate agent and founder of Analytics Miami, told Realtor.com.",

      "The Seattle coffee chain officially unveiled its new fall menu on Monday, which includes its Pumpkin Spice Latte and other autumn-inspired treats.",
      "The arrival date for Starbucks' fall menu has inched earlier over the years, now landing in August instead of mid-September, closer to the actual start of autumn. At the center of the coffee giant's fall offerings is its Pumpkin Spice Latte, which came onto the scene over 20 years ago. According to a company spokesperson, the PSL, which consists of espresso, steamed milk cinnamon, nutmeg, pumpkin, whipped cream and pumpkin pie spice, is the most popular seasonal beverage of all time. Starbucks has sold hundreds of millions of the autumnal concoction since the beverage was introduced in 2003.",
      "\"Obviously, I'm excited for the fall program,\" Starbucks CEO Brian Niccol said during the coffee chain's July 29 earnings call. \"I, like many customers, love the Pumpkin Spice Latte.\"",
      "The coffee giant is also banking on sales from newcomers like Pecan Cold Foam, after\u00a0launching\u00a0a similar menu item last year. Cold Foam has become one of Starbucks' most popular add-ons with a 23% year-over-year growth, according to a company spokesperson. In June, the company announced it was piloting a\u00a0new banana-flavored protein variety.",
      "The fall menu, which includes a blend of old and new items, is likely to provide a boost to the coffee chain which has been suffering from weakening sales and in-store traffic. Starbucks sales in the U.S. declined 2% in the third quarter ended June 29, compared with the same period last year, according to the company's July earnings report.",
      "Speaking to analysts last month, Niccol said, \"There's going to be a lot of customers that come into our business\" for the Pumpkin Spice Latte.",

      "Ex-Mexican cartel leader Ismael \"El Mayo\" Zambada Garcia on Monday pleaded guilty to federal charges related to his role as a co-founder of the Sinaloa Cartel, including drug trafficking, gun offenses and money laundering.",
      "Zambada pleaded guilty to one count of racketeering conspiracy and one count of running a continuing criminal enterprise, the Justice Department said. He had originally pleaded not guilty, but last week federal prosecutors wrote in a court filing that he intended to change his plea.",
      "The Associated Press reported that in brief remarks in a court hearing Monday, Zambada apologized for his actions.",
      "\"I recognize the great harm illegal drugs have done to the people in the United States and Mexico,\" he said through a Spanish-language interpreter, the AP reported. \"I apologize for all of it, and I take responsibility for my actions.\"",
      "In indictments against Zambada in both New York and Texas, federal prosecutors alleged that Zambada and other Sinaloa cartel leaders were responsible for massive quantities of heroin, cocaine and fentanyl and other illegal drugs being distributed into the U.S.",
      "He is expected to be sentenced to prison on Jan. 13, the AP reported.",
      "\"El Mayo will spend the rest of his life behind bars. He will die in a US federal prison where he belongs,\" Attorney General Pam Bondi said Monday. \"His guilty plea brings us one step closer to achieving our goal of elimination of the drug cartels and the transnational criminal organizations throughout this world that are flooding our country with drugs, human traffickers and homicides. Under President Trump's leadership, the Department of Justice is on the front lines of this fight.\"",
      "Zambada, 77, ran the Sinaloa cartel alongside Joaquin Guzman Lopez, known as \"El Chapo,\" until both men were arrested. Zambada was arrested in July of 2024 at an airfield in El Paso, Texas.",
      "In addition to drug smuggling charges, Zambada is alleged to have employed thousands of people in Central and South America, plus Mexico and the United States, to ensure the Sinaloa drug product made it to America. Prosecutors also alleged that Zambada also employed hit men to kidnap or kill anyone who threatened the cartel's operations, which brought billions of dollars into the cartel.",

    "published": "Mon, 25 Aug 2025 15:31:54 -0400",
    "summary": "President Trump signed an executive order that seeks to go after people who burn the American flag.",
    "story": [
      "Washington \u2014 \u00a0President Trump signed an executive order Monday that seeks to punish people who burn the American flag, accusing those who do so of displaying hostility and contempt toward the United States.",
      "Mr. Trump has for years threatened to crack down on flag burning. In 2016, he wrote on social media that anyone who burns the American flag should lose their citizenship or face jail time. During a 2024 speech before the National Guard Association of the United States, then-candidate Trump said he would work to pass a law imposing criminal penalties on those who burn the American flag.",
      "In remarks from the Oval Office on Monday, Mr. Trump alleged that burning the American flag \"incites riots\" and said those who are prosecuted and convicted as a result of his directive would face one year in prison.",
      "\"The people in this country don't want to see our American flag burned and spit on,\" the president said.",
      "Trump's executive order on flag burning",
      "Titled \"Prosecuting Burning of the American Flag,\" Mr. Trump's executive order does not direct the attorney general to prosecute those who burn flags for the act itself. Rather, it says the Justice Department should bring cases \"against acts of American Flag desecration that violate applicable, content-neutral laws, while causing harm unrelated to expression, consistent with the First Amendment.\" Examples of those laws include \"violent crimes; hate crimes, illegal discrimination against American citizens, or other violations of Americans' civil rights; and crimes against property and the peace.\"",
      "The directive acknowledges a 36-year-old Supreme Court decision that found flag burning is protected speech but adds that \"American flag desecration conducted in a manner that is likely to incite imminent lawless action or that is an action amounting to 'fighting words'\" may not be entitled to the same protection under the First Amendment.",
      "The order directs the secretary of state, attorney general and secretary of homeland security to take action against foreign nationals who have engaged in \"American flag-desecration activity,\" including by revoking their visas or residence permits, or seeking their removal from the U.S.",
      "The attorney general, Mr. Trump's executive order states, \"shall vigorously prosecute those who violate our laws in ways that involve desecrating the American Flag, and may pursue litigation to clarify the scope of the First Amendment exceptions in this area.\"",
      "Bob Corn-Revere, chief counsel at the Foundation for Individual Rights and Expression, said in response to Mr. Trump's executive order that the president does not have the power to change the First Amendment.",
      "\"Flag burning as a form of political protest is protected by the First Amendment. That's nothing new. While people can be prosecuted for burning anything in a place they aren't allowed to set fires, the government can't prosecute protected expressive activity \u2014 even if many Americans, including the president, find it 'uniquely offensive and provocative,'\" he said in a statement. \"You don't have to like flag burning. You can condemn it, debate it, or hoist your own flag even higher. The beauty of free speech is that you get to express your opinions, even if others don't like what you have to say.\"",
      "Is flag burning protected by the First Amendment?",
      "The president's directive appears aimed at re-opening the question in the courts of whether flag burning is constitutionally protected speech. While Mr. Trump believes that it should be illegal to burn the American flag and sought to unilaterally target those who engage in this conduct, the Supreme Court ruled in 1989 that the act is expressive conduct covered by the First Amendment.",
      "The 5-4 decision in the landmark case Texas v. Johnson arose from Gregory Lee Johnson's conviction under a Texas law that prohibited desecration of a venerated object. Johnson had burned an American flag outside of Dallas City Hall in protest of then-President Ronald Reagan's policies in 1984. He was sentenced to one year in prison and fined $2,000.",
      "But the Supreme Court ruled that Johnson's conviction for flag desecration was inconsistent with the First Amendment, since his flag burning constituted protected expressive conduct. Among the members of the five-justice majority were Justices Antonin Scalia and Anthony Kennedy, who often served as the swing vote after Justice Sandra Day O'Connor retired.",
      "During a 2012 interview with CNN, Scalia, a conservative stalwart, defended the high court's decision on flag burning and reiterated that the act is a form of expression.",
      "\"If I were king, I would not allow people to go around burning the American flag,\" he said. \"However, we have a First Amendment, which says that the right of free speech shall not be abridged \u2014 and it is addressed in particular to speech critical of the government. That was the main kind of speech that tyrants would seek to suppress.\"",
      "Scalia told CNN that \"burning a flag is a symbol that expresses an idea \u2014 I hate the government, the government is unjust, whatever.\"",
      "Referencing the 1989 ruling, Mr. Trump told reporters in the Oval Office on Monday that the case was decided by a \"very sad court.\"",
      "One year after that decision, the Supreme Court ruled in the case United States v. Eichman that a federal law criminalizing flag burning was unconstitutional.",
      "Congress had passed that law, known as the Flag Protection Act, in 1989 in response to the high court's ruling in Texas v. Johnson. The law made it a crime to knowingly mutilate, deface, physically defile, burn or trample upon the American flag, and violators faced a fine or up to one year in prison.",
      "But in another 5-4 decision, again with Scalia and Kennedy in the majority, the Supreme Court ruled that prosecutions of protesters who burned flags in violation of the Flag Protection Act were inconsistent with the First Amendment.",
      "\"Punishing desecration of the flag dilutes the very freedom that makes this emblem so revered, and worth revering,\" Justice William Brennan wrote for the majority.",

    "summary": "Trump officials sowed fear and confusion among CDC scientists, slowing their response to the measles outbreak in West Texas.",
    "story": [
      "As measles surged in Texas early this year, the Trump administration's actions sowed fear and confusion among CDC scientists that kept them from performing the agency's most critical function \u2014 emergency response \u2014 when it mattered most, an investigation from KFF Health News shows.",
      "The outbreak soon became the worst the United States has endured in over three decades.",
      "In the month after Donald Trump took office, his administration interfered with Centers for Disease Control and Prevention communications, stalled the agency's reports, censored its data, and abruptly laid off staff. In the chaos, CDC experts felt restrained from talking openly with local public health workers, according to interviews with seven CDC officials with direct knowledge of events, as well as local health department emails obtained by KFF Health News through public records requests.",
      "\"CDC hasn't reached out to us locally,\" Katherine Wells, the public health director in Lubbock, Texas, wrote in a Feb. 5 email exchange with a colleague two weeks after children with measles were hospitalized in Lubbock. \"My staff feels like we are out here all alone,\" she added.",
      "A child would die before CDC scientists contacted Wells.",
      "\"All of us at CDC train for this moment, a massive outbreak,\" one CDC researcher told KFF Health News, which agreed not to name CDC officials who fear retaliation for speaking with the press. \"All this training and then we weren't allowed to do anything.\"",
      "Delays have catastrophic consequences when measles spreads in undervaccinated communities, like many in West Texas. If a person with measles is in the same room with 10 unvaccinated people, nine will be infected, researchers estimate. If those nine go about their lives in public spaces, numbers multiply exponentially.",
      "The outbreak that unfolded in West Texas illustrates the danger the country faces as vaccination rates drop, misinformation flourishes, public health budgets are cut, and science agencies are subject to political manipulation.",
      "While the Trump administration stifled CDC communications, health secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. fueled doubt in vaccines and exaggerated the ability of vitamins to ward off disease. Suffering followed: The Texas outbreak spread to New Mexico, Oklahoma, Kansas, Colorado, and Mexico's Chihuahua state \u2014 at minimum. Together these linked outbreaks have sickened more than 4,500 people, killed at least 16, and levied exorbitant costs on hospitals, health departments, and those paying medical bills.",
      "\"This is absolutely outrageous,\" said Jennifer Nuzzo, director of the Pandemic Center at Brown University. \"When you're battling contagious diseases, time is everything.\"",
      "\"The CDC is 'stressed' currently\"",
      "Wells was anxious the moment she learned that two unvaccinated children hospitalized in late January had the measles. Hospitals are legally required to report measles cases to health departments and the CDC, but Wells worried many children weren't getting tested.",
      "\"I think this may be very large,\" she wrote in a Feb. 3 email to the Texas Department of State Health Services. Wells relayed in another email what she'd learned from conversations with people in the community: \"According to one of the women I spoke with 55 children were absent from one school on 1/24. The women reported that there were sick children with measles symptoms as early as November.\"",
      "In that email and others, Wells asked state health officials to put her in touch with CDC experts who could answer complicated questions on testing, how to care for infants exposed to measles, and more. What transpired was a plodding game of telephone.",
      "One email asked whether clinics could decontaminate rooms where people with measles had just been if the clinics were too small to follow the CDC's recommendation to keep those rooms empty for two hours.",
      "\"Would it be possible to arrange a consultation with the CDC?\" Wells wrote on Feb. 5.",
      "\"It never hurts to ask the CDC,\" said Scott Milton, a medical officer at the Texas health department. About 25 minutes later, he told Wells that an information specialist at the CDC had echoed the guidelines advising two hours.",
      "\"I asked him to escalate this question to someone more qualified,\" Milton wrote. \"Of course, we know the CDC is 'stressed' currently.\"",
      "Local officials resorted to advice from doctors and researchers outside the government, including those at the Immunization Partnership, a Texas nonprofit.",
      "\"The CDC had gone dark,\" said Terri Burke, executive director of the partnership. \"We had anticipated a measles outbreak, but we didn't expect the federal government to be in collapse when it hit.\"",
      "Technically, the Trump administration's freeze on federal communications had ended Feb. 1. However, CDC scientists told KFF Health News that they could not speak freely for weeks after.",
      "\"There was a lot of confusion and nonanswers over what communications were allowed,\" one CDC scientist said.",
      "Georges Benjamin, executive director of the American Public Health Association, said the situation was not unique to measles. \"Like most public health organizations, we weren't able to get ahold of our program people in February,\" he said. Information trickled out through the CDC's communications office, but CDC scientists gave no press briefings and went dark on their closest partners across the country. \"The CDC was gagged,\" he said.",
      "Through private conversations, Benjamin said he learned that CDC experts were being diverted to remove information from websites to comply with executive orders. And they were afraid to resume communication without a green light from their directors or the Department of Health and Human Services as they watched the Trump administration lay off CDC staffers in droves.",
      "\"It's not that the CDC was delinquent,\" Benjamin said. \"It's that they had their hands tied behind their backs.\"",
      "To work on the ground, the CDC needs an invitation from the state. But Anne Schuchat, a former CDC deputy director, said that during her 33 years with the agency, federal health officials didn't need special permission to talk freely with local health departments during outbreaks. \"We would always offer a conversation and ask if there's anything we could do,\" she said.",
      "Lara Anton, a press officer at the Texas health department, said the state never prevented the CDC from calling county officials. To learn more about the state's correspondences with the CDC, KFF Health News filed a public records request to the Texas health department. The department refused to release the records. Anton called the records \"confidential under the Texas Health and Safety Code.\"",
      "Anton said the state sent vaccines, testing supplies, and staff to assist West Texas in the early weeks of February. That's corroborated in emails from the South Plains Public Health District, which oversees Gaines County, the area hit hardest by measles.",
      "\"Texas will try to handle what it needs to before it goes to the CDC,\" Zach Holbrooks, the health district's executive director, told KFF Health News.",
      "Responding to an outbreak in an undervaccinated community, however, requires enormous effort. To keep numbers from exploding, public health workers ideally would notify all people exposed to an infected person and ask them to get vaccinated immediately if they weren't already. If they declined, officials would try to persuade them to avoid public spaces for three weeks so that they wouldn't spread measles to others.",
      "Holbrooks said this was nearly impossible. Cases were concentrated in close-knit Mennonite communities where people relied on home remedies before seeking medical care. He said many people didn't want to be tested, didn't want to name their contacts, and didn't want to talk with the health department. \"It doesn't matter what resources I have if people won't avail themselves of it,\" Holbrooks said.",
      "Historically, Mennonites faced persecution in other countries, making them leery of interacting with authorities, Holbrooks said. A backlash against COVID-19 restrictions deepened that mistrust.",
      "Another reason Mennonites may seek to avoid authorities is that some live in the U.S. illegally, having immigrated to Texas from Canada, Mexico, and Bolivia in waves over the past 50 years. Locals guess the population of Seminole, the main city in Gaines County, is far larger than the U.S. Census count.",
      "\"I have no idea how many cases we might have missed, since I don't know how many people are in the community,\" Holbrooks said. \"There's a lot of people in the shadows out here.\"",
      "Public health experts say the situation in Gaines County sounds tough but familiar. Measles tends to take hold in undervaccinated communities, and therefore public health workers must overcome mistrust, misinformation, language barriers, and more.",
      "About 450 people \u2014 including local health officials, CDC scientists, nurses, and volunteers \u2014 helped control a measles outbreak sparked in an Eastern European immigrant community in Clark County, Washington, in 2018.",
      "Alan Melnick, Clark County's public health director, said his team spoke with hundreds of unvaccinated people who were exposed. \"We were calling them basically every day to see how they were doing and ask them not to go out in public,\" he said.",
      "Melnick spoke with CDC scientists from the start, and the intensity of the response was buoyed by emergency declarations by the county and the state. Within a couple of months, the outbreak was largely contained. No one died, and only two people were hospitalized.",
      "In New York, hundreds of people in the city's health department responded to a larger measles outbreak in 2018 and 2019 concentrated among Orthodox Jewish communities. The work included meeting with dozens of rabbis and distributing booklets to nearly 30,000 households to combat vaccine misinformation.",
      "The effort cost more than $7 million, but Jane Zucker, New York City's assistant health commissioner at the time, said it yielded immense savings. The average medical bill for measles hospitalizations is roughly $18,500, according to data from prior outbreaks. Then there's the cost of diverting hospital resources, of children missing school, of parents staying home from work to care for sick kids, and the lasting toll of some measles infections, including deafness or worse.",
      "\"I don't think there's a price tag to put on a child's death that would otherwise be prevented,\" Zucker said.",
      "Local health departments in West Texas were understaffed from the start. About 18 people work at the South Plains health department, which oversees four vast rural counties. About 50 staff the department in Lubbock, where patients were hospitalized and health workers struggled to figure out who was exposed. In mid-February, Wells emailed a colleague: \"I'm so overwhelmed.\"",
      "A death ignites a response",
      "On Feb. 26, Texas announced that a 6-year-old child had died of measles. Wells heard from CDC scientists for the first time the following day. Also that day, the CDC issued a brief notice on the outbreak. The notice recommended vaccines, but it worried public health specialists because it also promoted vitamin A as a treatment under medical supervision.",
      "In emails, Texas health officials privately discussed how the CDC's notice might exacerbate a problem: Doctors were treating children with measles for toxic levels of vitamin A, suggesting that parents were delaying medical care and administering the supplements at home. A local Lubbock news outlet reported on a large drugstore where vitamin A supplements and cod liver oil, which contains high levels of vitamin A, were \"flying off the shelf.\"",
      "Too much vitamin A can cause liver damage, blindness, and dire abnormalities during fetal development.",
      "Milton worried that parents were listening to misinformation from anti-vaccine groups \u2014 including one founded by Kennedy \u2014 that diminished the need for vaccination by inaccurately claiming that vitamin A staved off the disease's worst outcomes.",
      "\"How many people will choose Vitamin A and not a vaccine because it appears to them there are two options?\" Milton asked in an email.",
      "Scientists at the CDC privately fretted, too. \"HHS pressed us to insert vitamin A into all of our communications with clinicians and health officials,\" one CDC scientist told KFF Health News, referring to the agency's notices and alerts. \"If pregnant women took too much vitamin A during the outbreak, their babies could be profoundly disabled. We haven't seen those babies born yet.\"",
      "Another CDC official said they've had to \"walk a fine line\" between protecting the public based on scientific evidence and aligning with HHS.",
      "While CDC scientists held their tongues, Kennedy exaggerated the power of nutrition and vitamin A while furthering mistrust in vaccines. \"We're providing vitamin A,\" Kennedy said in an interview on Fox News. \"There are many studies, some showing 87% effectiveness,\" he claimed, \"against serious disease and death.\"",
      "The studies Kennedy referenced were conducted in low-income countries where children are malnourished. Evidence suggests that vitamin A supplementation is seldom useful against measles in the United States, because deficiency is exceedingly rare.",
      "Kennedy deflected criticism from those who call him anti-vaccine, saying that any parent in Texas who wants a measles vaccine can get one. He followed this with numerous inaccurate statements. \"There are adverse events from the vaccine. It does cause deaths every year,\" he said. \"It causes all the illnesses that measles itself causes, encephalitis and blindness, et cetera.\" There is no evidence that measles vaccines \"cause deaths every year.\" Scores of studies show that the vaccine doesn't cause encephalitis, that most potential side effects resolve quickly on their own, and serious adverse reactions are far rarer than measles complications.",
      "In another interview, Kennedy said, \"The MMR vaccine contains a lot of aborted fetus debris.\" The measles, mumps, and rubella, or MMR, vaccine does not contain an iota of fetal cells.",
      "HHS spokesperson Andrew Nixon and spokespeople at the CDC did not respond to queries from KFF Health News.",
      "\"Staff are exhausted\"",
      "Despite national attention after the country's first measles death in a decade, West Texas was overwhelmed. In late February and March, hospital administrators and health officials exchanged emails about how to lobby for resources.",
      "\"Local hospitals are at capacity,\" wrote Jeffrey Hill, a senior vice president at the University Medical Center Health System in Lubbock. \"The state reports emergency funds that typically cover a response like the measles outbreak are not available from the federal government right now,\" he added.",
      "\"I am writing to express our urgent need for additional staff and funding,\" Ronald Cook, medical director for Lubbock, said in an email, drafted with other Lubbock health authorities, to the deputy city manager. \"Our Capacity is Stretched Thin: The health department has been operating seven days a week since February 2nd. Staff are exhausted.\"",
      "The city of Lubbock fronted money to help the local health department hire temporary staff. The state did not provide money, but it asked the CDC to send epidemiologists. Some came to Texas in early March. Then Texas requested federal funds.",
      "None arrived, even as the outbreak approached 500 cases. It spread to Mexico when an unvaccinated Mennonite child visited relatives in Seminole and returned home with an infection. This would fuel the largest outbreak Mexico has seen in decades, with at least 3,700 cases and 13 deaths in the state of Chihuahua.",
      "Then another child in West Texas died of measles.",
      "In a rare moment of openness, CDC scientist David Sugarman mentioned the outbreak at a vaccine advisory meeting in late April. \"There are quite a number of resource requests coming in, in particular from Texas,\" Sugarman said. \"We are scraping to find the resources and personnel needed to provide support to Texas and other jurisdictions.\"",
      "Federal funds arrived in Texas on May 21, said Anton, the state health department spokesperson. By then, the crisis was fading. The outbreak seemed to have burned until every unvaccinated person in Seminole was infected, said Richard Eby, a doctor at Permian Regional Medical Center who treated some measles patients. Hundreds, if not thousands, of cases have probably gone undetected, he said. \"A lot of people presumed their kids had measles,\" he said, \"and didn't see the need to confirm it.\"",
      "On Aug. 18, health officials declared the West Texas outbreak over, but the consequences of the catastrophe will be lasting.",
      "The outbreaks it sparked across the U.S. and Mexico are still spreading.",
      "More are inevitable, Nuzzo said. A growing number of parents are deciding not to vaccinate their kids, alarmed by unfounded rumors about the shots. Misinformation is flourishing, especially after Kennedy fired vaccine experts who advise the CDC and replaced them with doctors and researchers lacking expertise in vaccines and infectious disease, including some who have expressed anti-vaccine views. One of his recent appointees, Robert Malone, blamed the deaths of children with measles on \"medical mismanagement,\" without evidence.",
      "At the same time, states are downsizing programs for emergency response, disease surveillance, and immunization after the Trump administration clawed back more than $11 billion in public health funds earlier this year.",
      "Amid Lubbock's toughest months, Wells sent an email to the department's exhausted staff. \"The future is uncertain, and I know this is an unsettling time for many of us,\" she wrote. \"Every day we show up and do our jobs is an act of resilience.\"",

    "story": [
      "A federal judge on Friday blocked the Trump administration from cutting off federal funding to dozens of \"sanctuary\" cities and counties \u2014 covering several of the largest cities in the U.S.",
      "The judge had previously ruled in April that it was unconstitutional for President Trump to freeze funding for local governments that limit their cooperation with Immigration and Customs Enforcement \u2014 commonly known as sanctuary cities. That ruling applied to more than a dozen cities and counties that had sued the Trump administration for threatening to cut off funding, including San Francisco, Sacramento, Minneapolis and Seattle.",
      "On Friday, San Francisco-based U.S. District Judge William Orrick extended his order to dozens of other places that joined the lawsuit. Those include the second- and third-largest cities in the U.S. \u2014 Los Angeles and Chicago \u2014 as well as Boston, Baltimore, Denver and Albuquerque.",
      "White House spokeswoman Abigail Jackson said in a statement: \"The government \u2014 at all levels \u2014 has the duty to protect American citizens from harm. Sanctuary cities interfere with federal immigration enforcement at the expense of the safety and security of American citizens. We look forward to ultimate vindication on the issue.\"",
      "As Mr. Trump seeks to dramatically boost arrests and deportations of undocumented immigrants, top administration officials have pushed local governments to assist \u2014 and they've sought to punish so-called sanctuary jurisdictions with laws on the books that prevent police from helping ICE.",
      "Within hours of returning to office in January, Mr. Trump ordered\u00a0his administration to ensure sanctuary jurisdictions \"do not receive access to Federal funds.\" Weeks later, the president ordered that federal funding shouldn't \"facilitate the subsidization or promotion of illegal immigration,\" and Attorney General Pam Bondi said the Justice Department will not offer grants to sanctuary cities. The administration argues sanctuary cities are interfering with federal law enforcement and making it harder for ICE to arrest undocumented immigrants, including violent criminals.",
      "The cities and counties that are suing the administration call those policies an \"abuse of power\" and allege they violate the Tenth Amendment, which says any powers that aren't given to the federal government should be reserved to the states. They argue that local governments are entitled to choose not to assist ICE, often casting sanctuary policies as a way of building trust between police and local residents whose immigration status may make them wary of reporting crimes.",
      "\"In flagrant disregard of the law, President Trump seeks once again to punish those who disagree with him, coerce local authorities, and commandeer them into carrying out his agenda,\" the cities' lawsuit says.",
      "The Trump administration's moves against sanctuary cities have generated a flurry of lawsuits, including one suit filed earlier this week by 20 states over the Justice Department's decision to tie crime victim grants to immigration enforcement.",
      "The Justice Department has also vowed to sue dozens of alleged sanctuary jurisdictions, including both cities and states. The administration sued New York City and the state of Illinois over their sanctuary policies earlier this year, though the Illinois suit was tossed out by a judge last month.",

    "story": [
      "Deir al-Balah, Gaza Strip\u00a0\u2014 \u00a0Israel struck one of the main hospitals in the Gaza Strip with a missile Monday and then fired another as journalists and rescue workers rushed to the scene, killing at least 20 people and wounding scores more, local health workers in Hamas-run\u00a0Gaza\u00a0said. At least five journalists were among those killed, health officials and their employers said.",
      "It was among the deadliest of several Israeli strikes that have hit both hospitals and journalists over the course of the 22-month war sparked by Hamas' Oct. 7, 2023, attack, and the attack came as Israel plans to widen its offensive to heavily populated areas.",
      "The first strike hit a top floor of a building at Nasser Hospital in the southern city of Khan Younis. Minutes later, as journalists and rescuers in orange vests rushed up an external staircase, a second missile hit, said Dr. Ahmed al-Farra, head of Nasser's pediatrics department.",
      "Nasser Hospital, the largest in southern Gaza, has withstood raids and bombardment throughout 22 months of war, with officials citing critical shortages of supplies and staff.",
      "Asked about the strike and journalists being among the victims, the Israel Defense Forces issued a statement saying it had carried out an attack and adding that it would \"conduct an initial inquiry as soon as possible,\" adding that it regretted \"any harm to uninvolved individuals and does not target journalists as such.\"",
      "In a statement, Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu's office said that Israel \"deeply regrets the tragic mishap\" that occurred at the hospital in Gaza.",
      "\"Israel values the work of journalists, medical staff, and all civilians,\" the statement said. \"The military authorities are conducting a thorough investigation. Our war is with Hamas terrorists. Our just goals are defeating Hamas and bringing our hostages home.\"",
      "A hospital official initially told CBS News that four journalists were killed in the Monday morning double-tap strike at the hospital. The official identified the four as Hossam al-Masri, who worked for the Reuters news agency, Mohammed Salama, who worked for Al Jazeera, and freelance journalists Maryam Abu Daqqa  and Moaz Abu Taha.",
      "The Associated Press' news director for the Middle East, Jon Gambrell, said in a social media post that Abu Daqqa had \"freelanced for the AP since the Gaza war began.\"",
      "Reuters confirmed that al-Masri had worked for the international news agency. It said photographer Hatem Khaled, who also worked as a contractor for the agency, was wounded.",
      "Middle East Eye, a U.K.-based media outlet, later said one of its freelancers, Ahmad Abu Aziz, was also killed.",
      "At least one other journalist was wounded in the strike, a hospital official said, identifying the man as Haithem Omar, who also works for Reuters.",
      "President Trump told reporters on Monday that he was not aware of the strike on the hospital and he was not happy about it when he learned the news.",
      "\"When did this happen?\" Mr. Trump asked a reporter in the White House. \"I didn't know that. Well, I'm not happy about it. I don't want to see it. At the same time, we have to end that whole nightmare.\"",
      "Israel has come under mounting pressure over the number of journalists being killed in its military operations in Gaza \u2014 including in targeted strikes against individuals whom Israeli officials claim were Hamas operatives.",
      "Israeli strikes and raids on hospitals are not uncommon. Multiple hospitals have been struck or raided across the Gaza Strip, with Israel claiming its attacks had targeted militants operating inside the medical facilities, without providing evidence.",
      "In a statement issued Monday, the Foreign Press Association, which represents journalists working in Israel and the Palestinian territories, said it was \"outraged and in shock\" over the latest killings of media workers.",
      "\"This is among the deadliest Israeli attacks on journalists working for international media since the Gaza war began,\" the organization said, confirming the identities of the four people killed. \"These strikes hit the exterior staircase of the hospital where journalists frequently stationed themselves with their cameras. The strikes came with no warning.\"",
      "The organization demanded an immediate explanation from the IDF and from Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu's office for the strike, adding: \"This has gone on far too long. Too many journalists in Gaza have been killed by Israel without justification. Israel continues to block international journalists from independent access to Gaza. This must be a watershed moment. We appeal to international leaders: do everything you can to protect our colleagues. We cannot do it ourselves.\"",
      "The international Committee to Protect Journalists also condemned the Israeli strike. In a statement, the group called on the international community \"to hold Israel accountable for its continued unlawful attacks on the press.\"",
      "\"Israel's broadcasted killing of journalists in #Gaza continues while the world watches and fails to act firmly on the most horrific attacks the press has ever faced in recent history,\" CPJ Regional Director Sara Qudah said in the group's post. \"These murders must end now. The perpetrators must no longer be allowed to act with impunity.\"",
      "On August 11, Israel's military targeted and killed five Al Jazeera journalists in Gaza, including correspondent Anas al-Sharif. The Israel Defense Forces said it had intelligence and documents from Gaza to prove al-Sharif was the head of a Hamas terrorist cell, and the IDF shared\u00a0undated\u00a0photos\u00a0of Al-Sharif with Yahya Sinwar, the top Hamas leader in Gaza, who was\u00a0killed last October.",
      "CBS News could not verify the authenticity of the photos. Al Jazeera and al-Sharif had\u00a0previously dismissed\u00a0Israel's claims as baseless, The Associated Press reported. Just three weeks ago, al-Sharif had appealed to the Committee to Protect Journalists over fears he might be assassinated.",
      "A June strike on Nasser Hospital killed three people and wounded 10, according to the health ministry. At the time, Israel's military said it had targeted Hamas militants operating from a command and control center inside the hospital.",
      "The Hamas-run health ministry said Sunday that at least 62,686 Palestinians have been killed since Israel launched its war in Gaza in retaliation for the Hamas-led Oct. 7, 2023 terrorist attack that killed some 1,200 Israelis and saw 251 others taken as hostages.",
      "The ministry does not distinguish in its figures between fighters and civilians, but it says around half of those killed have been women and children.

    "summary": "The first commercial carbon storage facility has been inaugurated off Norway's coast, but is storing CO2 deep under the seabed really the answer?",
    "story": [
      "Oslo\u00a0\u2014The world's first commercial service offering carbon storage off Norway's coast has carried out its inaugural CO2 injection into the North Sea seabed, the Northern Lights consortium operating the site said Monday.",
      "The project by Northern Lights, which is led by oil giants Equinor, Shell and TotalEnergies, involves transporting and burying CO2 captured at smokestacks across Europe. The aim is to prevent the emissions from being released into the atmosphere, and thereby help halt climate change.",
      "\"We now injected and stored the very first CO2 safely in the reservoir,\" Northern Lights' managing director Tim Heijn said in a statement. \"Our ships, facilities and wells are now in operation.\"",
      "In concrete terms, after the CO2 is captured, it is liquified and transported by ship to the Oygarden terminal near Bergen on Norway's western coast.",
      "It is then transferred into large tanks before being injected through a 68-mile pipeline into the seabed, at a depth of around 1.6 miles, for permanent storage.",
      "Carbon capture and storage (CCS) technology has been listed as a climate tool by the United Nations' Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) and the International Energy Agency (IEA), especially for reducing the CO2 footprint of industries such as cement and steel that are difficult to decarbonize.",
      "The first CO2 injection into the Northern Lights geological reservoir was from Germany's Heidelberg Materials cement plant in Brevik in southeastern Norway.",
      "But CCS technology is complex, controversial and costly.",
      "Without financial assistance, it is currently more profitable for industries to purchase \"pollution permits\" on the European carbon market than to pay for capturing, transporting and storing their CO2.",
      "Northern Lights has so far signed just three commercial contracts in Europe. One is with a Yara ammonia plant in the Netherlands, another with two of Orsted's biofuel plants in Denmark, and the third with a Stockholm Exergi thermal power plant in Sweden.",
      "Largely financed by the Norwegian state, Northern Lights has an annual CO2 storage capacity of 1.7 million tons, which is expected to increase to 5.5 million tons by the end of the decade.",
      "While efforts such as Northern Lights are focused on capturing carbon directly from the most highly-polluting sources \u2014 industrial smoke stacks \u2014 there have also been efforts launched to capture the gas from the ambient air, an even more controversial methodology.",
      "Mark Jacobson, a Stanford University professor of environmental engineering, told CBS News earlier this year that he was dubious of the motivations for and the efficacy of both kinds of carbon capture, and he said bluntly that \"direct air capture is not a real solution. We do not have time to waste with this useless technology.\"",
      "Jacobson thinks direct air capture, in particular, is a boondoggle, and more effort should be focused on switching to clean energy sources.",
      "Currently, the U.S. gets about 60% of its electricity from fossil fuels.",
      "\"You have to think about who's proposing this technology,\" Jacobson said. \"Who stands to benefit from carbon capture and direct air capture? It's the fossil-fuel companies.\"",
      "\"They're just saying, 'Well, we're extracting as much CO2 as we're emitting. Therefore, we should be allowed to keep polluting, keep mining,\" Jacobson told CBS News, adding that his stance has not made him popular among many in the energy sector.",
      "\"Oh, yeah, diesel people hate me, gasoline people hate me, ethanol people hate me, nuclear people hate me, coal people hate me. They do, because I'm telling the truth,\" he said. \"We don't need any of these technologies.\"",

      "The deaths add to the growing toll of Palestinians killed while seeking food, as parts of the Gaza Strip plunge into famine and Israel's military ramps up activity in northern Gaza ahead of a planned offensive to seize its largest city.",
      "A U.N.-backed initiative on Friday declared a famine in Gaza City and warned that it is likely to spread without a ceasefire or an end to restrictions on humanitarian aid. Israel has disputed the assessment, saying \"there is no famine in Gaza.\"",
      "\"We have been saying, 'beware,'\" UNICEF executive director Catherine Russell said Sunday on \"Face the Nation with Margaret Brennan.\" \"And it's, it's almost like you're screaming into an abyss.\"",
      "Russell added that the famine is \"shocking,\" \"but it's not surprising.\"",
      "\"There's no reason for this,\" Russell said. \"This did not happen because there were cyclones or, you know, droughts. This happened because we could not get enough aid into these children.\"",
      "Sen. Jeanne Shaheen, a New Hampshire Democrat who also appeared Sunday on \"Face the Nation,\" said the Israel blockade in Gaza is \"a shameful black mark on humanity that the world has allowed this to happen, and that Israel is allowing this to happen.\"",
      "Shaheen, speaking from Jordan, said she visited a humanitarian assistance program that is trying to get aid into Gaza, outlining that Israel has prevented their trucks from getting in to provide aid.",
      "\"Prime Minister Netanyahu is the point at which obstruction is happening,\" Shaheen said. \"He needs to look at what he is doing and change his position.\"",
      "Al-Awda Hospital and two eyewitnesses told The Associated Press that the four Palestinians were killed when troops opened fire on a crowd heading to a site run by the Israeli-backed American contractor Gaza Humanitarian Foundation, or GHF, in the Netzarim corridor area. It occurred hundreds of meters (yards) away from the site, the eyewitnesses said.",
      "\"The gunfire was indiscriminate,\" Mohamed Abed, a father of two from the Bureij refugee camp, said, adding that while many fled some people fell to the ground after being shot.",
      "Abed and Aymed Sayyad, another aid seeker among the crowd, said troops opened fire when a group near the front of the crowd pushed forward toward a distribution site before its scheduled opening.",
      "Sayyad said he and others helped two people who were wounded by gunshots, one in his shoulder and in his leg.",
      "The Israeli military and GHF did not immediately respond to requests for comment. Since the GHF first began operating nearly three months ago, the U.N. says hundreds of Palestinians have been shot and killed by Israel Defense Forces and foreign military contractors at or near its aid sites.",
      "Malnutrition-related deaths",
      "The four deaths are the latest in areas where U.N. convoys have been overwhelmed by looters and desperate crowds, and where people have been shot and killed while heading to sites run by the GHF.",
      "More than 2,000 Palestinians have been killed and more than 13,500 wounded while seeking aid at distribution points or along convoy routes used by the United Nations and other aid groups, according to Gaza's Hamas-run Health Ministry.",
      "The ministry said on Sunday that at least 62,686 Palestinians have been killed in the war, including missing people now confirmed dead by a special ministry judicial committee.",
      "It said the number of malnutrition-related deaths rose by eight to 289 on Sunday. The deaths include a child, bringing the death toll among children to 115 since the war between Israel and Hamas began in 2023.",
      "The health ministry does not say how many of those killed have been fighters or civilians but says around half have been women and children. It is part of the Hamas-run government and staffed by medical professionals. The U.N. and independent experts consider it the most reliable source on war casualties. Israel disputes its figures but has not provided its own.",
      "The Integrated Food Security Phase Classification \u2014 the world's leading authority on food crises \u2014 said Friday that famine is happening in Gaza City, home to hundreds of thousands of Palestinians, and could spread south to Deir al-Balah and Khan Younis by the end of next month.",
      "Aid groups have long warned that the war and months of Israeli restrictions on food and medical supplies entering Gaza are causing starvation. Israel has denied the existence of widespread hunger in Gaza, calling reports of starvation \"lies\" promoted by Hamas.",
      "\"Non-stop explosions\"",
      "In Jabaliya, the densely populated refugee camp just north of Gaza City, residents said they endured heavy explosions overnight. Days after Israel's military announced it was intensifying its operations in the area and mobilizing tens of thousands of reservists to take the city, they said they were living in constant fear.",
      "In the part of Gaza City where he and his family have sheltered since being displaced from a neighborhood on the city's southern edge, Ossama Matter said he had seen houses reduced to rubble and neighborhoods razed beyond recognition.",
      "\"They want it like Rafah,\" he said, referring to a town in southern Gaza destroyed earlier in the war. \"There have been non-stop explosions and strikes in the past days.\"",
      "While fleeing westward from Jabaliya, schoolteacher Salim Dhaher said he saw weaponized robots planting explosives as troops advanced from the opposite direction. As they set the stage for Israel's push to seize the city, Dhaher said he feared it was part of a larger effort to forcibly remove Palestinians from the north.",
      "The aim is clear, he said: \"To destroy everything above the ground, and force the transfer.\"",
      "There has been little sign of the hundreds of thousands of Palestinians evacuating south ahead of Israel's invasion of Gaza City, which Israel says is still a Hamas stronghold. Many are exhausted by repeated displacements and unconvinced that any area\u2014 including so-called humanitarian zones \u2014 offers safety.",
      "The military operation could begin within days in a region that threatens the lives of hundreds of thousands of civilians, who are sheltering above an area Israel has invaded multiple times but still believes harbors a network of militant tunnels underground.",
      "Hamas-led militants abducted 251 people and killed around 1,200 people, mostly civilians, in the Oct. 7, 2023, attack that triggered the war. Most of the hostages have been released in ceasefires or other deals but 50 remain inside Gaza, around 20 of them believed by Israel to be alive."

    "story": [
      "The following is the transcript of an interview with Rep. Mike Lawler, Republican of New York, that aired on \"Face the Nation with Margaret Brennan\" on Aug. 24, 2025.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Welcome back to Face The Nation. We go now to Republican Congressman Mike Lawler of New York. Good to have you here, Congressman, there's a lot to get to with you, but I want to pick up on something we were discussing with the governor of Maryland, and that was this redistricting, gerrymandering that is happening. The President encouraged Texas Republicans to do it. Now, California Democrats are trying to get districts redrawn as well. Why do you so strongly oppose this?",
      "REP. MIKE LAWLER: I think gerrymandering is fundamentally wrong, and it is at the heart of why Congress has been broken for so many years. If you look three decades ago, there were over 100 competitive districts. Last November, only 35 seats were decided by five points or less, and mine wasn't even one of them, despite the fact that Kamala Harris won my seat, I won by six and a half points. So when you look at the map across the country, the fact is roughly 400 members are not in competitive districts. They're focused primarily on primaries and not general elections, and therefore they're not focused on appealing to a much broader swath of the electorate. And I think that obviously reflects itself when you're actually trying to negotiate legislation and beyond. But when you look at the redistricting situation, obviously both parties do not have clean hands here. Democrats in New York did mid-decade redistricting last year in 2024 at the behest of Hakeem Jeffries, who wanted to pick up seats in New York to become Speaker. They gerrymandered the maps after stacking the court and getting a favorable ruling ordering a mid-decade redistricting, despite the fact that they gerrymandered maps in 2022 and those were thrown out because it violated the state constitution. So now New York is going for a third bite at the apple, according to Governor Hochul, who has made it clear since the moment she took office in 2021 that she would use redistricting to help Democrats win the house. So this is what you're dealing with, red states and blue states trying to get electoral advantage right now.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: I guess what's different now is the President's direct involvement in this, which is why it's interesting you have legislation to try to oppose some of this. Do you really think you can get that done if the President of United States doesn't want it done?",
      "REP. LAWLER: Look, obviously, it's going to be a fight, but this is something that I fundamentally believe we need to reform. We need to ban gerrymandering nationwide. We need to ban mid decade redistricting. I want to include term limits as part of those reforms, because I fundamentally believe when you have members of Congress like Chuck Schumer, who's been in elected office since 1974 never held a job outside of elected office. It's time to go. You need term limits. You need overall reform. So I'm going to fight tooth and nail to get this done. Obviously, you know there's going to be strong headwinds from both parties, because frankly, I don't think both parties are interested in reforming the way Congress functions.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: No, they want the majority. Period. On the question, though, that we have been- also been discussing with the governor, that is crime. The President of the United States has mentioned New York is another city he wants to look at to deploy National Guard troops. Do you think that's the best use of federal taxpayer dollars, and are you comfortable with that happening in your state?",
      "REP. LAWLER: Crime has been a major problem in New York for years, and Kathy Hochul and Albany and New York City Democrats have failed miserably to tackle this crime.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN:-- Do you want National Guard troops?-- ,",
      "REP. LAWLER: -- By the way, Kathy Hochul has mobilized- Kathy Hochul has mobilized National Guard's troops to go into the subway system because of the crime in the subway system. So that has been done, obviously, for the purpose of surging resources and trying to prevent crime. When you look at the fact that in New York City, for instance, 80% of gun crimes do not result in a conviction or prosecution, that 80% of these individuals are released back out onto the street despite using guns in the commission of a crime. You look at Washington DC, 1.7% of gun crime convictions result in jail time. So when Democrats talk about gun violence, how come they don't want to actually prosecute and enforce the law against criminals who are using guns in the commission of a crime?",
      "[START CROSSTALK]",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: -- No, but that's a local--",
      "REP. LAWLER: -- This is a fundamental problem and it's why the homicide rate--",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN:-- that's a local issue that would need to get changed. But in terms of the question on the troops--",
      "REP. LAWLER: -- No but- it's- no- but Margaret, this why the homicide rate is so high--",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: -- You'd rather troops than FBI agents or ATF agents or DEA agents. You don't want federal agents who are trained law enforcement officers in New York City. You would rather National Guardsmen --",
      "REP. LAWLER: -- I want- I want all of the above.--",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: -- who have trained to be trained to police?",
      "[END CROSSTALK]",
      "REP. LAWLER: No. No, no, don't put words in my mouth. I'd rather all of the above, the FBI, the DEA, ATF. I've met with ATF just a few weeks ago in my office on this very issue of really cracking down on gun crimes and prosecuting criminals who use guns in the commission of a crime. I was proud last year to lead the passage of the Undetectable Firearms Act, a common sense, bipartisan piece of gun safety legislation enacted into law in the 1980s. We extended it seven years to make sure that no gun is manufactured or sold with less than 3.7 ounces of metal. I led that effort, and the reason I did is because we do not want guns on the street being used in the commission of a crime, and yet, as I pointed out, you look at Washington D.C., only 1.7% of gun crime convictions result in jail time. This is why you've seen the homicide rate double in less than a decade. It's outrageous, and it's exactly why the President is cracking down on crime in major cities, and as we saw in California, he is legally authorized to do so.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: I want to ask you about something in New York State that matters. A good amount of money from that CHIPs bill went to New York. On Friday, the White House announced there's going to be a change to how the government deals with that money that's meant to make America independent of Asian computer chip manufacturing and bring it all back on shore, the President wants to buy a 10% stake in Intel. That company says it's going to now basically have US taxpayers as a shareholder, own 10%. As a conservative, do you think that the government should have ownership stakes in private companies?",
      "REP. LAWLER: Generally speaking, no, I think when you look at prior history, when we've had, for instance, the bank bailouts, when we've had the auto bailouts, you know, in the- in the aftermath of the collapse of the market and '08 the American taxpayer really didn't get a return on that. I think what the President is seemingly trying to do is get a return on these tens of billions of dollars that are being invested by U.S. taxpayers, by U.S. taxpayers into companies like Intel to manufacture chips. And so rather than just give the money away, get a return on that investment. Obviously, this is a national security issue. We want to be in control of the manufacturing of semiconductors and that's critical for our foreign policy.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Congressman, I'm sorry to cut you off. I'm being told I have to go to a commercial break, so I'm going to leave it there. We'll be right back."

      "SEN. JEANNE SHAHEEN: Good morning, or, afternoon here.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Yeah, exactly. You do sit on the Armed Services Committee as well. Here in Washington, there was a sudden round of firings we learned of on Friday. There was Lieutenant General Jeffrey Kruse, the head of the Defense Intelligence Agency. He was dismissed, the Pentagon did not explain why. In addition, the Navy Reserve chief, Vice Admiral Nancy Lacore, was fired. The Navy SEAL who oversees Naval Special Warfare Command, Rear Admiral Milton Sands, was dismissed. Has Congress been informed as to why these leaders are being fired by Secretary Hegseth?",
      "SEN. SHAHEEN: I'm not aware that Congress has been informed about any of these firings, and they come on the heels of firings earlier this year, of the Chairman of the Joint Chiefs, the head of Naval Operations, Admiral Franchetti, and a series of other military leaders. And it's unfortunate, because one of the things, one of the strengths of America's military, are the professional military leaders who have come up through the ranks, who have the training, the expertise, to be able to do the jobs. And what we don't want is political people in those jobs, who are not going to give honest assessments of the military situation wherever we happen to be. So it's very troubling.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: I believe our feed there just froze, and we're going to try to get that back up, if we can. The Senator is joining us from Amman, Jordan. So I'm going to take a break while we reestablish that connection.",
      "SEN. SHAHEEN: The feed just froze.",
      "(ANNOUNCEMENTS)",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: And we're back now with Senator Jeanne Shaheen, who joins us remote from Amman, Jordan. We- we lost you there, but we're so glad you're back with us now, Senator. Let me ask you about why you are in the Middle East right now. We heard on Friday, this internationally recognized body, backed by the UN, the IPC. It tracks hunger. And they confirmed, technically confirmed, there is a man-made famine underway in Gaza. This is a very rare designation, only four other times has one been designated. The country you are in, Jordan, called it a \"shameful failure of humanity\" that Israel is starving Palestinians with impunity, called it a war crime. Would you say that that three month blockade by Israel of Gaza is a war crime?",
      "SEN. SHAHEEN: I think is- it is a shameful black mark on humanity that the world has allowed this to happen and that Israel is allowing this to happen. One of the- we had a very good meeting today with King Abdullah of Jordan, and one of the places that we visited is the Jordan humanitarian assistance program that is trying to get aid into Gaza. This is an- it funded trucks and warehouses and food that the United States has contributed to as part of this administration. They are trying to get in 150 trucks a day into Israel. And Israel has prevented those trucks from going in in a way that would provide the nutrition that Gazans need to prevent starvation. It is unacceptable. Prime Minister Netanyahu is the point at which obstruction is happening. He needs to look at what he's doing and change his position.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: The Israeli Prime Minister's Office on Friday had a very harsh statement about the famine designation. They called it, quote, \"a modern blood libel, spreading like wildfire through prejudice.\" That suggests this is about anti-Jewish hate rather than starvation. How do you make sense of the Israeli defense?",
      "SEN. SHAHEEN: I don't think that's a good defense. The fact is, this is not about antisemitism, which I abhor, and the United States' position is against antisemitism, and we need to do everything we can to prevent it. But the reality is, we have people dying because they are systematically being starved to death, because Israel is refusing to allow in the humanitarian aid that people need to keep alive. Not only that, they're getting ready to do another- or, they've already started, planning another major incursion into Gaza in ways that are going to kill more people. So this is not acceptable. The world needs to speak out. I think it's very important that we allow that humanitarian aid in, to the people who are starving.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: I- I understand your criticism right now. I want to ask you a little bit though about standing U.S. policy, because this has been a problem even during the Biden administration. In fact, former deputy national security adviser for President Biden Joe- Jon Finer, just wrote a piece in the Atlantic, and he said that while he stands by the decision to embrace Israel after October 7, he believes \"we did far too little, far too late to limit the truly catastrophic civilian harm that Israel's response inflicted.\" Do you agree with him, and do you wish that you spoke out more forcefully sooner?",
      "SEN. SHAHEEN: I don't think this is a partisan position. With me on this journey to Jordan is Congressman Joe Wilson from South Carolina. He agreed with me that we need to make sure those humanitarian aid trucks get into Israel. We need to do everything possible to ensure that Prime Minister Netanyahu is stopping the roadblocks that are preventing the humanitarian aid from getting in. I think it's something that, I hope, that both Democrats and Republicans can embrace.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: But- but do you agree with this self criticism by this key Democrat? Do you think Democrats should have said more sooner--",
      "(BEGIN CROSSTALK)",
      "SEN. SHAHEEN: We should be doing more and we should have done more. Absolutely.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Yeah. I want to also ask you--",
      "SEN. SHAHEEN: I think everybody--",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Go ahead.",
      "SEN. SHAHEEN: --should have said more sooner, not just Democrats, but Republicans.",
      "(END CROSSTALK)",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Why are you now?",
      "SEN. SHAHEEN: We had the opportunity to be here today to meet with those Jordanians who are working very hard to try and get humanitarian aid into Gaza, who are being stymied in that effort by bureaucratic obstacles that make no sense. When it takes hours to scan a truck, which could be done in two to three, and it diverts the aid when it's costing hundreds of dollars per truck, and they turn those trucks away, and when they come back the next day, it costs another hundreds of dollars more for the same truck, when they find an excuse for why it gets stopped at the border. That's- that's not a legitimate effort to get humanitarian aid in to the people of Gaza who are starving. And that can be changed. All it takes is Prime Minister Netanyahu saying, we're going to allow that aid in.",

      "MARGARET BRENNAN: We return now to Gaza and that stunning declaration Friday about a monitoring group that Gaza City is experiencing man-made famine, and that those conditions will expand soon. UNICEF Executive Director Catherine Russell joins us now. We want to warn our viewers, there will be some upsetting images in this segment. Executive Director Russell, thank you for joining us. We've spoken so many times over the past few years about the catastrophic starvation. Now you have this technical designation- so rare to see a famine here. They project it's going to spread. Can you explain, in real-world terms, what does this mean for the children who live there?",
      "CATHERINE RUSSELL: Well, thank you, Margaret. Let me say this: You know, it's been, now, almost two years since October 7th, and since then, Israeli children have been killed and taken hostage, and now we're seeing Palestinian children finally facing what we've been yelling and screaming about for months and months and months, which is a terrible famine. You know, we've estimated at this point that about 18,000 children in Gaza have already died. And those are children who die from a whole range of issues. But when you think about that, that's about 28 children a day. That's almost a classroom of children every single day who have died since the beginning of this conflict. We have been saying we beware, right, this- this famine is just right around the corner, and it's- it's almost like you're screaming into an abyss, you know. It's so- it's shocking that it's happened, because, as you said, it happens so rarely, but it's not surprising. And what it means, really, is that children have been spending months and months without sufficient food. And we see just a horrible situation where children are on the verge of starvation and ultimately dying from starvation. And I think, you know, for your viewers who haven't seen this, and hopefully many of them have not, it is a haunting image. Children literally waste away. And you see it in rooms where you know suddenly they're all quiet. The children are so quiet because they have no energy even to cry, and to see that happen, and especially in a place where food is not very far away, right? There's no reason for this. This did not happen because there were cyclones or, you know, droughts. This happened because we could not get enough aid in to these children.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: And as you know, the Israeli government entity that oversees the Palestinian territories, it's called COGAT, says there is no famine. They say the UN data is flawed. The Prime Minister's office says these are fabrications and due to prejudice. Can you explain how you know what you know? We are showing images that we know journalists have shot- journalists who live inside Gaza, because journalists are not allowed into Gaza to report. How do you know that what you're saying is fact?",
      "RUSSELL: Let me say two things about that. One is the IPC, which is the organization that makes this determination, is an independent organization. They're technical people. They're not political people, and they monitor this as they go, and they look at issues like, what are the levels of food deprivation, what's the acute malnutrition level, how many starvation-related deaths, so it's a very technical assessment. And I think we've seen in other places that this is very accurate. I would also say it- to me, it's kind of obscene that we are having these conversations arguing about whether the methodology works or not. We know children are dying, right? I am tired of a discussion about, well, are we giving the right information or not? First of all, let the international press in. Let them make determinations. I mean, we've talked about this, Margaret, of you coming, you should be it yourself. Everyone should be able to get in there. Absent that, we're going to have to rely on the data that we have the people who were there, and I can tell you, from the UNICEF perspective, our people are tortured by this. I mean, I have spoken to our staff, and they are seeing children who are incredibly deprived, many thousands of children who have had amputations, and are, you know, it's just one terrible thing after another for children. And to suggest that there's anything funny going on here is really, in my mind, just- almost making the situation worse, right? Just stop the discussion, stop arguing, and address the problem. Get food in there. Take care of these children, make sure that they have the wherewithal to survive and have a distant future.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: And the Israeli government controls who gets in and who gets out. On the question, though, of making sure that the food you do get in gets to the right people: The former US Ambassador to Israel, Jack Lew, and another Mid-East Envoy have said the UN agencies may not like it, but if the Israeli-backed Gaza Humanitarian Foundation is the only thing really allowed to operate, then maybe there needs to be some compromise. Why- why not? The United States government is putting $30 million to work there. Why not work with them?",
      "RUSSELL: You know, look, I- the methodology of the Gaza Humanitarian Foundation is not something that is consistent with the way humanitarians work. That's a simple answer. And honestly, you know, if you think about it, the UN had 400 places where we would distribute aid. The Gaza Humanitarian Foundation had four, okay? And you have seen on television, you have seen this video of these almost apocalyptic situations where people are streaming towards these places, trying to get food, people are getting shot. It's a terrible situation, and it doesn't work. It's not working that well. Now look, I don't- I don't much care if the Gaza Humanitarian Foundation does some distribution. Just let us our let us do our work, too. Let us in. We know how to do this distribution. And when I say we, it's not just UNICEF, it's the UN, it's the other international NGOs. We do it all around the world. We've done it for decades. We know how to do it. We know how to do it in a way that it gets to the people who need it. And I, you know, do both. I'm fine with that, but at least make sure that humanitarians can get in there and distribute the aid fairly, and make sure that these children are not dying unnecessarily. Nobody wants that. President Trump has said that nobody wants that.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: He did indeed. I want to ask you, as well, about Sudan, where there was a massive humanitarian crisis. If the United States is not leading efforts to get aid in there, is anyone else stepping up?",
      "RUSSELL: You know, look, the United States has the ability to be such a force for good, and we need them to step up and do more. Sudan, as you say, is the largest displacement crisis in the world. Millions of children are on the move. They are not in school. We now have a horrible outbreak of Cholera, which is very destructive and kills children within hours if they can't get aid. I mean, it is absolutely horrific. And the United States can be such a force for making positive contributions. And I think, you know, other countries are trying, but the US really can make a much bigger difference if they try to do this work, and do it as quickly as possible.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: And in Sudan, what is the generational impact here? When you don't look --",
      "RUSSELL: Oh, it's horrible. First of all, they're not getting food. They're facing horrible sexual violence. I was just in Chad and heard stories that could just break your heart, and it's devastating, and the results, as you say, will last for generations.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Thank you for sharing that. That's it for us today. Thank you for watching. I'm Margaret Brennan."

      "When Billy first revealed his NPH diagnosis, the five-time Grammy Award winner said that the condition had been \"exacerbated by recent concert performances, leading to problems with hearing, vision and balance.\"",

      "Common symptoms of NPH include difficulty walking, urinary incontinence and problems with concentration and memory.",

I do analysis on it with the backstories. So I interview him. I go straight to the source, my dad, and I ask him about all the material. And I was asking him, single by single, I said, \u2018Well, which album is this from? What year?\u2019\"",
      "\"He remembers every album, the exact year, the order in which the singles were ordered on the album,\" she added. \"So, as far as I'm concerned, he's sharp as a tack.

      "Alexa recently released her new single \"Riverside Way.\" (Alexa Ray Joel)",
      "\"It is personal to me because it was my way of saying to the world and saying, as an artist, I'm not just one person,\" she said. \"I think there is a sort of societal penchant and interest in putting women in a box and pinpointing them as, 'OK, she's that type.'\"",
      "Alexa continued, \"She's good or she is bad or she's sugar or she's spice or she's sweet or she's a bitch. We have this interest in pigeonholing women a lot of times. Or even people do it [and] they don't even realize, right? You just form quick judgments based on a picture or based on an interview clip, now with sound bites on social media. It's so easy to form judgments too quickly, I feel.\"",
      "\"And so \u2018Riverside Way\u2019 is personal for me because it's my way of saying, 'Hey, you know, just like most women and particularly artists, there's not just one side to us,'\" she added. \"There is the side of me that's very much the good daughter and loves to perhaps be a little more demure. But then there's another side that's...a bit wilder and more curious and more interested in exploring things. And I think with \u2018Riverside Way,\u2019 I wanted to show, it's OK to get outside your comfort zone and take risks, both with storytelling, narrative wise and stylistically with this song.\"",
      "\"I wanted this image of a girl that's just having a fantasy with a guy and, you know, speeding down the highway in a truck at 200 miles per hour, and they're not even sure where they're going or where they'll end up because they're so immersed in the moment. And so I wanted that escapism to be very vivid. And I am an escapist at heart. I love painting a very vivid picture in my mind. That I can just sort of climb into and crawl into. I get a real thrill from that as an artist.\"",

      "Over the past year, more people have reported receiving order shipment emails for purchases they never made. These messages usually come from legitimate retailers, often sportswear brands or electronics stores, and contain real tracking numbers and delivery details. The products are being shipped to different names at different addresses, but for some reason, the buyer's contact email is yours.",

      "HOW TO DETECT FAKE AMAZON EMAILS AND AVOID IMPERSONATION SCAMS",
      "Arthur is right to question what's happening. Scammers are deliberately using real email addresses to push fraudulent purchases through retailer systems with fewer checks. They rely on your email to carry out the scam, even if they have not stolen your payment details.",

      "Some scammers use valid, active email addresses to bypass retailer fraud filters. (Kurt \"CyberGuy\" Knutsson)",
      "What's likely happening with those shipment emails in your inbox",
      "It is unlikely that someone is accidentally typing your email address every single time. Rather, scammers are deliberately using valid, active email addresses like yours to bypass retailer fraud filters. Numerous sources confirm that fake order and shipping confirmation emails are a common tactic in fraud operations, with criminals exploiting the trust systems placed in legitimate email addresses.",
      "When a stolen credit card is used, pairing it with a real email that has not triggered spam alerts increases the chance the transaction will go unnoticed by anti-fraud systems. Retailers often check whether an email address is active or bounces. If the system sees a functioning address, it may be less suspicious than an obviously fake one.",
      "Once the order is placed, products are frequently sent to drop addresses or freight-forwarding services, as confirmed by official investigations into brushing scams. These services act as intermediaries, making the scam harder to trace. In that context, your email is simply a means to an end, a validated contact point that helps the operation move forward smoothly.",
      "Scammers can obtain email addresses when reputable companies experience data breaches. (Kurt \"CyberGuy\" Knutsson)",
      "How bad actors are able to get your email",
      "Your email address may have ended up in the hands of scammers through several common methods. The most likely cause is a data breach. Many well-known companies have\u00a0experienced leaks in which customer emails and other information were exposed.",
      "Once your email is part of a leaked database, it often circulates on the dark web or in underground forums, where it is freely traded and reused. Even if you were not part of a breach, scammers often use a technique called credential stuffing. This involves testing stolen login details across different websites to confirm which email addresses are active.",
      "REMOVE YOUR DATA TO PROTECT YOUR RETIREMENT FROM SCAMMERS",
      "The best thing you can do to prevent this from happening is to invest in a data removal service. While no service promises to remove all your data from the internet, having a removal service is great if you want to constantly monitor and automate the process of removing your information from hundreds of sites continuously over a longer period of time.",

If you discover a match, immediately change any reused passwords and secure those accounts with new, unique credentials.",
      "Scan your inbox regularly for order confirmations, shipping notices or account sign-ups you don't recognize. If something looks off, report it directly to the retailer or platform; it could be part of a larger scam using your email address. Never click on suspicious links, even if the message looks legitimate, and protect your devices with strong antivirus software to catch threats before they spread.",
      "The best way to safeguard yourself from malicious links that install malware, potentially accessing your private information, is to have antivirus software installed on all your devices. This protection can also alert you to phishing emails and ransomware scams, keeping your personal information and digital assets safe.",

      "Avoid entering your email on shady giveaway sites or sketchy online forms. When in doubt, skip the sign-up or use a throwaway email. The fewer places your email lives, the harder it is for scammers to get hold of it.",
      "Set up a dedicated email for online purchases, newsletters and subscriptions. This helps keep your main inbox clean and makes it easier to spot strange activity. Sometimes, it's best to create various email aliases so that you don't have to worry about all your info getting taken in a data breach.\u00a0 An email alias address is a great way for you to stop receiving constant spam mail by simply deleting the email alias address.

      "Kurt\u2019s key takeaway",
      "If you are receiving order confirmations for things you never bought, do not shrug it off. Your email is likely being misused as part of a larger fraud operation, not by accident but intentionally. Scammers are taking advantage of active, trustworthy email addresses to slip past retailer defenses and carry out unauthorized purchases. The repeated use of your email shows that fraud networks are already circulating it, even if your financial information remains untouched.",

    "story": [
      "Surgeries may become safer and more precise than ever before.",
      "A new brain implant now lets people control Apple devices, such as iPads, iPhones and the Vision Pro, using only their thoughts. Synchron, an endovascular brain-computer interface (BCI) company based in New York, demonstrated the first wireless BCI that works with Apple's official protocol.",
      "Ten patients have received the implant: six in the U.S. and four in Australia. With this technology, users living with severe paralysis can navigate apps, send messages and operate devices hands-free. This breakthrough greatly expands independence, as it enables patients to manage their environment, stream shows and control smart home devices, all using only their minds.",
      "Synchron's advancement in BCI technology marks a significant step for assistive devices and hints at how we may interact with computers in the future. The device's hands-free, voice-free operation offers a powerful new level of accessibility and autonomy for people with disabilities.",

      "ALS patient Mark Jackson demonstrates Synchron\u2019s brain-computer interface (BCI) working with an iPad. (Synchron)",
      "A first for brain-tech and Apple",
      "Synchron is the first company to connect a brain implant directly to Apple devices using Apple's official BCI Human Interface Device (HID) protocol. This means no custom hacks or workarounds. The system simply connects over Bluetooth, just like a keyboard or a mouse, and works with iPhones, iPads, and even the Apple Vision Pro. In a powerful video shared by Synchron, ALS patient Mark Jackson demonstrates the tech in action. After losing the use of his hands, he's now able to navigate his iPad entirely with thought. That includes opening apps, composing messages, and staying connected with the people he loves-all without moving a muscle.",
      "Behind the scenes, Synchron's system uses artificial intelligence to decode brain signals and turn them into real-time digital commands. Machine learning models interpret motor intent, such as thinking about tapping your finger, and translate that into actions on the iPad. This AI-powered decoding helps the system feel smooth and responsive as users learn to control it with focus alone.",
      "Synchron's brain-computer interface is seen up close. (Synchron)",
      "The game-changing signal strength meter",
      "One surprising new feature is the built-in signal strength meter. This visual cue shows patients how strong their brain signal is in real time. A blue box appears over an icon or app and fills up based on how clearly the system reads the user's intent. It may sound simple, but this is a huge deal. It helps users like Mark fine-tune their mental focus, adjust their posture, and improve their interaction without outside help. It's like seeing your brain in action and learning to drive it better.\u00a0\"When I lost the use of my hands, I thought I had lost my independence,\" Mark says in the video.\u00a0\"Now, with my iPad, I can message my loved ones, read the news, and stay connected with the world, just by thinking.\"",

      "Mark Jackson operates Synchron\u2019s brain-computer interface, which functions using Apple's official protocol. (Synchron)",
      "What sets Synchron apart",
      "BCIs like Synchron's Stentrode and Elon Musk's\u00a0Neuralink have connected to devices before, but never like this. Previous setups required custom software or physical adapters. Now, thanks to Apple's new BCI HID protocol, brain-computer interfaces can plug right into the Apple ecosystem like any other accessory. That official integration opens the door to more features, better performance, and fewer setup hurdles. Synchron's COO, Kurt Haggstrom, calls it a\u00a0\"game changer\" for both patients and the entire BCI industry.",
      "What this means for you",
      "This tech isn't just for people with paralysis, at least, not forever. Today, it's a medical tool undergoing trials. Tomorrow, it could become a consumer product you buy at your local Apple Store. With Apple embracing BCI as a legitimate input method, everything from your phone to your smart home could one day be controllable by thought. That opens the door for more accessibility, more customization, and completely new ways of interacting with technology.",

      "Kurt's key takeaways",
      "Synchron's Apple demo marks a new era in brain-computer interaction. It turns thoughts into action using mainstream tech you probably already own. While it's still in its early stages, the direction is clear: BCI is moving out of the lab and into real life, and Apple is helping lead the charge.",

      "FORGET 10,000 STEPS \u2014 RESEARCH REVEALS THE REAL NUMBER YOU NEED FOR BETTER HEALTH",
      "What to check:\u00a0On iPhone, open the Health app and review your walking steadiness trends. Android users can check their wearable app dashboards, like Samsung Health or Fitbit, to view step symmetry, cadence, and gait-related data. Look for any changes over weeks or months and take advantage of in-app exercise suggestions to improve balance and strength.",
      "Apps that track physical activity and walking patterns can help users improve their balance and strength, or even detect a change in gait before it becomes an issue. (Kurt \"CyberGuy\" Knutsson)",
      "2) Smart pill dispensers prevent risky mistakes",
      "Forgetting to take medication, or taking too much, can cause grogginess or dizziness that increases fall risk. A smart pill dispenser helps make sure you take the right dose at the right time.",
      "What to look for: Look for dispensers with reminders, dose tracking, and alerts for missed meds.",
      "Smart pill dispensers can assist patients in making sure they take the correct dose of the desired medication at the right time. (Kurt \"CyberGuy\" Knutsson)",
      "3) Fitness trackers keep you motivated to move",
      "Building strength, especially in your legs and core, is one of the best ways to prevent falls. Whether you use an\u00a0Apple Watch, Fitbit or another device, fitness trackers can nudge you toward daily movement goals.",
      "What to check:\u00a0Track your cardio fitness levels, not just step counts. It's a good indicator of your overall strength and endurance.",
      "Fitness tracking devices can help users build strength and resilience. (Kurt \"CyberGuy\" Knutsson)",
      "4) Vital-sign monitors help detect lightheaded spells",
      "Dips in blood pressure or oxygen levels can make you feel woozy, which increases your fall risk.\u00a0Smartwatches and fingertip pulse oximeters help you monitor these changes in real time.",
      "What to check:\u00a0If you're not using a wearable, jot down your daily readings with a standard cuff or oximeter to spot any unusual trends.",
      "5) Motion-activated lighting lights the way",
      "Getting up in the middle of the night without enough light is a common recipe for a fall. Motion-activated lights can illuminate your path without you needing to touch a switch.",
      "What to look for: Try plug-in nightlights that turn on when they sense motion, or during a power outage. Some even double as portable flashlights.",

      "7) Doorbell cameras keep you from rushing",

      "8) Fall-detection devices can call for help",
      "Even the most independent older adults face higher fall risks, and family members who live far away may worry more than they let on. If a fall happens and you're alone, getting help quickly is essential. Wearables like the\u00a0Apple Watch can detect a hard fall and automatically alert emergency services or your emergency contacts.\u00a0Apple Watch SE, Series 4 or later, and Apple Watch Ultra include fall detection. If a hard fall is detected, the watch vibrates, sounds an alarm, and gives the option to call emergency services.",

      "Apps like Nymbl for iPhone or Android, or KOKU for iPhone and Android, offer fun daily balance and cognitive exercises that take just a few minutes. The goal? Keep your body strong and your reflexes sharp.",
      "What to check: Use an app that tracks progress and gives feedback. Some are backed by health researchers or physical therapists.",
      "Using apps to perform balance exercises and cognitive challenges can help keep reflexes honed. (Kurt \"CyberGuy\" Knutsson)",
      "What this means for you",

By using smart tech, you can spot early warning signs, make smarter choices, and stay in control of your health, on your own terms.",
      "Kurt's key takeaways",
      "Getting older doesn't mean giving up your independence. In fact, the right technology can help extend it. Whether it's a\u00a0smartwatch that alerts family during a fall or a simple nightlight that turns on automatically, every tool you use can add peace of mind.

Not even on the radar until someone blows the whistle. Meta has repeatedly shown it couldn't care less about your children's well-being. It's about maximizing time online, pulling in younger users, and monetizing every click. This latest scandal proves once again that parents cannot rely on tech companies to protect kids.",

      "To address growing concerns, OpenAI has introduced new safety measures for ChatGPT. These updates will limit how the chatbot responds to mental health-related queries. The goal is to prevent users from becoming overly dependent and to encourage them to seek proper care. OpenAI also hopes to reduce the risk of harmful or misleading responses through these changes.",

He suffered a lung collapse due to aspiration from his own vomit.",
      "Still, the fraternity members picked him up and returned him to the couch.",
      "\"They threw him back on the couch and throughout the night they were slapping him, throwing alcohol on him, throwing stuff at him. And then finally, at about, you know, 1 o'clock in the morning or so, they all went to bed, and they left him laying there,\" Jim said.",
      "Timothy was found in the basement again the next morning, unconscious and unresponsive. Jim said fraternity members spent 45 minutes deciding what to do before they called 911. A little more than 12 hours later, Timothy died at Hershey Medical Center. He had alcohol poisoning from the incident, and the official cause of death was the brain bleed, known as a subdural hematoma.",

Whether they're his friends or not, how could individuals not care at all to make sure somebody was OK? It's brutal, and it continues to be brutal.\"",

Well, it does happen, and it happens to good kids from good families, you know, wealthy, not wealthy. It's non-discriminating.\"",

      "\"At the end of the day, the pledges have a little bit of power in that they could just band together and say, we're not doing that, because the fraternity members need them,\" he said.",
      "\"They need the money, right? They need money to move in the house, and they need the money to pay the dues,\" he continued. \"And we know of groups that have said, \u2018no, we are not doing that,' and the fraternity members gave them a hard time at first, and then after a while it was like, \u2018OK, well, we still need the pledge class, so fine.\u2019\"",

      "The tunnels remain the most formidable element of Hamas\u2019 defense. Unlike ISIS terrorists in Mosul, Spencer said, Hamas has built an underground tunnel network that allows commanders and fighters to move between positions, avoid strikes and\u00a0conceal hostages. \"The IDF that will go into Gaza City is not the IDF of 2023,\" Spencer said, pointing to rapid adaptations in the use of drones, robots and specialized units for tunnel warfare. \"They\u2019ve learned so much.

    "story": [
      "Fox News senior White House correspondent Peter Doocy reports on President Donald Trump brokering a deal with Azerbaijan and Armenia on \u2018Special Report.\u2019",
      "President Donald Trump\u2019s new deal in the South Caucasus has ended a decades-long conflict and handed Washington a rare strategic foothold on Iran\u2019s northern border, experts say.",
      "The agreement, signed earlier this month between Armenia and Azerbaijan, grants the U.S. a 99-year lease over the Zangezur Corridor - a narrow strip of land that will serve as a critical trade and energy route to Europe, bypassing Tehran entirely. Iranian American journalist and dissident Banafsheh Zand told Fox News Digital the move is \"a wonderful gain for the U.S.\" that also delivers a \"slap in the face\" to the regime in Tehran.",
      "The corridor has long been at the center of the Nagorno-Karabakh conflict, which displaced tens of thousands and fueled three decades of instability. Trump\u2019s intervention brought both sides to the table and created what observers say is a new trade and security lifeline linking the Caspian Basin to Europe, bypassing Iran entirely.",

      "A view from Armenia's southern border reveals the Arax River, with Iran visible across the water. This crossing is a vital lifeline for Armenia, facilitating essential trade and energy flows, especially as tensions rise over the proposed Zangezur Corridor. Iran strongly opposes the corridor, fearing it would sever its direct land access to Armenia and diminish its role as a regional transit hub. The corridor, intended to connect Azerbaijan to its Nakhchivan exclave through Armenian territory, has become a flashpoint in regional geopolitics. (Anthony Pizzoferrato/Middle East Images/AFP via Getty Images)",
      "Known as the Trump Route for Peace & Prosperity (TRIPP), economically, the agreement secures Washington a direct role in overseeing the flow of Caspian hydrocarbons to Europe. The U.S. will manage rail and road infrastructure, telecom networks and energy pipelines running through the corridor, giving American companies a dominant position in regional transit for oil, gas and goods. By controlling this artery, the U.S. not only generates billions in future trade and investment but also locks Europe into alternative supply routes that reduce reliance on both Russia and Iran.",
      "For allies, the corridor offers cheaper and safer access to Caspian energy. For Tehran, it represents lost revenue, lost leverage, and the end of its ability to act as a mandatory gatekeeper for east-west commerce.",
      "Zand said the deal is not only historic but also a direct win for Washington. \"It\u2019s a wonderful gain for the U.S.,\" she said. \"American contractors will be supervising oil and gas from the Caspian Basin, routed through Zangezur and Turkey to Europe. The profit margins are great, and it all happens under NATO\u2019s blessing.\"",
      "Zand said the potential goes even further. \"Nobody\u2019s talking about it yet, but I don\u2019t think it\u2019s out of the question to see U.S. bases there,\" she said. \"If that happens, then checkmate the Khamenei regime and Russia.\"",

(ANDREW CABALLERO-REYNOLDS/AFP via Getty Images)",
      "For Iran, the corridor represents what Zand called a nightmare scenario. Tehran has long used its geography to shape energy and trade flows. By inserting the U.S. into the region, the new deal effectively strips Iran of that leverage. Zand put it in stark terms: \"Iran is shaped like a cat, a sitting cat. This corridor literally runs above the cat\u2019s ears. It bypasses Iran, takes money away from the regime, and pushes them out into the cold.\"",
      "Behnam Ben Taleblu, senior director of the Foundation for Defense of Democracies Iran Program, said the corridor exposes how vulnerable Iran has become in the Caucasus. \"Both the defeat of Armenia in the most recent war with Azerbaijan, as well as the political problems between Moscow and Yerevan today, have made it harder for the Islamic Republic to really benefit from its traditional economic and political relationship with Armenia,\" he told Fox News Digital.",

      "\"They still do have ties, and the regime is an opportunistic actor as much as it is an ideological one. If there is any way to throw stones at this agreement, or extract concessions on the back end, they will try.\"",
      "At the same time, he said the strategic picture is clear. \"The Islamic Republic is, in essence, carved out of this route,\" he said. \"This is not just a critical corridor that could bring stability to the South Caucasus and economic improvement for all countries involved-it also drives home the point that the regime has been such a poor guardian of Iran\u2019s national interest that the Iranian state has been excluded from a major transit route just above its border.\"",
      "Iran's Supreme Leader Ali Khamenei addresses the media during voting for parliamentary elections in Tehran, Iran in May 2024. (Photo by Fatemeh Bahrami/Anadolu via Getty Images)",
      "The timing, Zand argued, makes the impact even greater. She pointed to Iran\u2019s weakening position since October 7, 2023, and Israel's recent 12-day war with Tehran. \"The regime was self-isolated when it couldn\u2019t come to Hamas\u2019s or Hezbollah\u2019s rescue. Iraq\u2019s Shiites are saying they don\u2019t want to be controlled, Syria is out, and Hezbollah has been degraded. For those of us who\u2019ve watched the regime for decades, we always knew it was a paper tiger. October 7 and the war exposed it to the world.\"",
      "The killing of senior IRGC commanders and nuclear scientists has deepened the sense of vulnerability inside Tehran. \"They can huff and puff about blowing the house down, but the truth is, there\u2019s a whole lot of fear among the regime\u2019s leaders now,\" Zand said. \"Khamenei has even gone into hiding again.\"",
      "TRUMP BRINGS PEACE TO CAUCASUS: INSIDE THE ARMENIA\u2013AZERBAIJAN DEAL 30 YEARS IN THE MAKING",
      "Ben Taleblu added that Washington is now using these shifts to turn Iran\u2019s weakness into opportunity. \"Wherever the regime is weak, that invites pushback, whether militarily or economically,\" he said. \"The U.S. has followed Israel\u2019s military success against the Islamic Republic with strikes of its own against nuclear facilities, and it is now following Azerbaijan\u2019s battlefield success with a political and economic success of its own. This corridor is another example of America moving in when Tehran is most vulnerable.\"",
      "An aerial view of the construction of roads and railways that will pass through the Zangezur Corridor, which will connect the western provinces with Nakhchivan and will also be one of the routes of the Central Corridor extending from China to Central Asia, the Caspian Sea, the Caucasus and Turkey. (Photo by Resul Rehimov/Anadolu via Getty Images)",
      "Zand, whose father was a well-known Iranian journalist and intellectual assassinated by the regime, said she views Trump\u2019s direct involvement as the key to the corridor\u2019s success. \"Because it\u2019s Trump, it makes all the difference,\" she said. \u00a0\"Trump doesn\u2019t care about not hurting people\u2019s feelings. He responds to how people act. And with this move, he\u2019s sitting over Iran like a vulture-ominous, watching, ready.\"",
      "For dissidents like Zand, the corridor represents more than a transport route. \"We\u2019ve prayed for this for decades,\" she said. \"Until the regime is gone, people inside Iran will remain too afraid to rise up again. But this corridor is a boon. It shows the regime is surrounded, and its days are numbered.\"",

      "The deal was reached with NATO backing and has already been compared by some observers to historic peace accords. Zand believes the significance lies not only in ending a 30-year conflict but also in turning the U.S. presence in the Caucasus into a permanent reality. \"The regime knows the jig is up.\"",

    "summary": "President Donald Trump on Monday said he would target former President Joe Biden's circle, calling them \"evil people.\"",
    "story": [
      "WASHINGTON \u2014 President Donald Trump on Monday said he would target former President Joe Biden's circle, calling them \"evil people.\"",
      "\"There were some brilliant people,\" Trump said, referring to Biden's allies in his White House. \"But they\u2019re evil people, and they\u2019re going to be brought down. They have to be brought down 'cause they really hurt our country.\"",
      "Trump's threat to have his political opponent's allies \"brought down\" marks his latest move to potentially target political adversaries in a pattern that has alarmed critics who paint the president as pursuing retribution and say he is weaponizing the Justice Department \u2014 a claim the president has made about the Biden administration.",
      "Biden's office did not immediately respond to a request for comment.",
      "Trump made the comments during lengthy remarks in the Oval Office, where the president and his allies made a series of claims about the impact of his anti-crime efforts in D.C. and top officials took turns heaping praise on him. While signing executive orders that aim to do away with cash bail, Trump repeatedly focused on the murder rate in the city, saying it had not seen a single person killed in 11 days \u2014 a change that he has been brandishing in recent days as he touts his administration's efforts to address D.C. crime. That push has included federalizing the D.C. police force, deploying the National Guard and stepping up the federal law enforcement presence in the city.",
      "Trump claimed that it has been \"many years\" since D.C. went a week without a murder. Publicly available crime data from the Metropolitan Police Department, however, indicate that D.C. went 16 days without a murder earlier this year, from Feb. 25 to March 12.",
      "Trump argued that the city's restaurants are experiencing a \"boomtown,\" a comment that is uncertain, as restaurant employees in a D.C. neighborhood with a large immigrant community told NBC News last week that business was declining due to Trump's policies. His deputy chief of staff, Stephen Miller, who attended the signing with Vice President JD Vance, Attorney General Pam Bondi, Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem and Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth, claimed that people in D.C. had resumed wearing jewelry and carrying purses because of Trump\u2019s anti-crime push.",
      "\"They're wearing jewelry again. They're carrying purses again,\" Miller said. \"People had changed their whole lives in this city for fear of being murdered, mugged and carjacked. It is a literal statement that President Trump has freed 700,000 people in this city who were living under the rule of criminals and thugs.\"",
      "At the start of the operation, though, crime in D.C. was down 26% compared to last year. Many city residents, too, have slammed the deployments and said it is scaring Washingtonians.",
      "The president has frequently claimed that Democrats weaponized the Justice Department and other law enforcement agencies against him, pointing to his criminal indictments related to efforts to overturn the 2020 election and his handling of classified documents, as well as his conviction related to falsifying business records, which were dropped when he was elected to a second term. Trump repeatedly denied any wrongdoing in the cases against him.",
      "Democrats have gone after Trump's comments, arguing that the Trump administration's several investigations into his political foes constitute the exact weaponization that he claimed they pursued against him.",
      "The Justice Department is investigating Sen. Adam Schiff, D-Calif., and New York Attorney General Letitia James on allegations of mortgage fraud.",
      "James led a civil fraud case against Trump, and Schiff served as the lead House manager in Trump's first impeachment trial. They denied any wrongdoing.",
      "NBC News has also previously reported that the Justice Department is in the initial stages of an investigation into James\u2019 handling of her civil fraud case against Trump, which her attorney likened to a \"political retribution campaign.\u201d",
      "Trump also threatened Friday to fire a Federal Reserve governor, Lisa Cook, if she did not resign after facing separate accusations of mortgage fraud. Cook said she won't step down.",
      "On Monday night, Trump said he was removing Cook from her post. Trump has been highly critical of the Federal Reserve for not adjusting interest rates as he would like.",
      "And late last week, the FBI searched the home of former national security adviser John Bolton. A source familiar with the matter told NBC News at the time that the search was part of a \"national security investigation in search of classified records.\" Bolton did not respond to NBC News\u2019 request for comment Friday.",
      "Also on Monday, Trump left the door open to investigating former New Jersey Gov. Chris Christie, a staunch critic of Trump who was among the Republicans who ran against him for president. Trump was referring to a 12-year-old scandal called \"Bridgegate.\"",
      "\"If they want to look at it, they can,\" Trump said, responding to a question about whether the White House planned to investigate Christie. \"You can ask Pam. I think we have other things to do, but I always thought he got away with murder.\"",
      "On Sunday, after Christie criticized him on ABC News\u2019 \u201cThis Week,\u201d Trump wrote on his social media site Truth Social, \u201cFor the sake of JUSTICE, perhaps we should start looking at that very serious situation again?\u201d",
      "Meanwhile, Trump's allies in Congress have pushed to hear testimony from Biden's circle about his mental acuity while in office, which Trump and Republicans claim was in decline but was covered up by the former president's team. House Oversight Committee Chairman James Comer, R-Ky., has sought testimony from Biden's former White House physician Dr. Kevin O'Connor and former White House aides, including his domestic policy adviser, Neera Tanden and his deputy chief of staff, Annie Tomasini."

      "Illinois political leaders and Chicago municipal officials are raising alarms over President Donald Trump\u2019s threat to deploy National Guard troops to the city, insisting that sending in soldiers would be baseless and a clear case of federal overreach.",
      "Flanked by political, business and religious leaders, Illinois Gov. JB Pritzker on Monday blasted the president\u2019s suggestion that federal soldiers were needed in the city and emphasized what he said was a significant reduction in homicides, vehicle thefts and other crimes in recent years.",
      "\u201cThere is no emergency in Chicago that calls for armed military intervention,\u201d he said during a news conference. \u201cThere is no insurrection.\u201d",
      "\u201cDonald Trump wants to use the military to occupy a U.S. city, punish his dissidents and score political points,\u201d Pritzker said. \u201cIf this were happening in any other country, we would have no trouble calling it what it is \u2014 a dangerous power grab.\u201d",
      "The number of homicides in Chicago has fallen 32% from last year, Pritzker said, while vehicle thefts and burglaries are both down by more than 20%.",
      "But as National Guard soldiers fanned out across Washington, D.C., to tackle what Trump has framed as an epidemic of \u201ccrime, bloodshed, bedlam and squalor and worse,\u201d the president said that Chicago and New York City are next on his list.",
      "The Washington Post, citing officials familiar with the matter, reported Saturday that the Pentagon has spent weeks planning a military deployment to Chicago.",
      "The plans reportedly involved several options, including dispatching a few thousand members of the Guard to Chicago as soon as September. NBC News has not independently confirmed that report.",
      "Pritzker, a second-term Democrat, said he has heard nothing about those plans from the White House or the Department of Defense.",
      "\"We only read about it in The Washington Post,\" he said during a media availability earlier Monday.",
      "Pritzker said such a deployment would be unconstitutional because the federal government is barred from deploying military troops to an American city for crime-fighting purposes. If the administration moves forward with the plan, Pritzker said, \"the first thing we're going to do is take him to court.\"",
      "Speaking to reporters Monday, Illinois Attorney General Kwame Raoul said he does anticipate filing a pre-emptive lawsuit.",
      "Chicago Mayor Brandon Johnson, a first-term Democrat, struck a similar chord as Pritzker in an interview with NBC News.",
      "\u201cThe guard is not needed,\u201d Johnson said. \u201cThis is not the role of our military. The brave men and women who signed up to serve our country did not sign up to occupy American cities.\"",
      "Traditionally, the federal government deploys enlisted National Guard members to respond to major domestic crises such as national disasters, the Covid pandemic and civil unrest.",
      "Trump, speaking to reporters from the Oval Office on Monday morning, blasted Illinois political leaders and called Chicago a \u201cdisaster.\u201d Trump called Johnson \u201cincompetent\u201d and labeled Pritzker \u201ccorrupt.\u201d",
      "He signed an executive order that creates National Guard units focused on \u201cpublic order issues.\u201d",
      "Earlier this year, Trump deployed the National Guard to Los Angeles to respond to protests over his administration\u2019s immigration raids and deportations. The president did so over the vocal objections of California Gov. Gavin Newsom and Los Angeles Mayor Karen Bass.",
      "Illinois' two senators, Dick Durbin and Tammy Duckworth, both Democrats, excoriated Trump\u2019s talk of troop deployments.",
      "Durbin dismissed Trump\u2019s threats as \u201cpurely political theater\u201d and \u201cnothing more than a power grab.\u201d The fifth-term U.S. senator, who is not seeking re-election in 2026, urged political leaders to instead focus on \u201cproven bipartisan solutions to continue to reduce violent crime.\u201d",
      "Duckworth, a U.S. Army combat veteran and retired Army National Guard lieutenant colonel, slammed Trump\u2019s threat as \u201cdeeply disturbing\u201d and \u201cun-American.\u201d",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s yet another unwarranted, unwanted and unjust move straight out of the authoritarian\u2019s playbook that will only undermine our military\u2019s readiness and ultimately weaken our national security,\u201d Duckworth said in a statement."

    "summary": "The majority of National Guard troops deployed in Washington began carrying weapons this weekend. The pistols and powerful rifles they carry are similar to guns used by local police.",
    "story": [
      "WASHINGTON \u2014 The majority of the more than 2,300 National Guard troops deployed in Washington to support law enforcement began carrying weapons this weekend. But as in other such National Guard deployments, the troops have been told to use their M17 pistols and powerful M4 rifles only for self-defense or as a last resort, two Defense Department officials told NBC News.",
      "Under the rules of engagement, deadly force is authorized only \u201cupon reasonable belief of an imminent threat of death or serious bodily harm,\u201d one of the defense officials said. And a bad actor must have the \u201cability and opportunity\u201d to put a guard member in jeopardy or inflict serious bodily harm. The focus for the guard members, the official added, is to defend themselves or other people.",
      "Armed guard members will carry the type of weapon they are normally issued and trained on, typically M17 handguns and M4 semiautomatic rifles, similar to assault-style rifles, the Defense Department officials said. Some guard members will carry M9 pistols.",
      "The military weapons are similar to those used by local police departments across the United States. The M4 is a standard semiautomatic rifle and has roughly the same capabilities as semiautomatic rifles used by law enforcement agencies.",
      "The M17 handgun is essentially the same as the Sig Sauer P320 pistol, the type of semiautomatic pistol that police across the country have used for years. Police in Washington use semiautomatic handguns and rifles, as well.",
      "Similar to other missions",
      "The troops\u2019 mission in Washington is similar to that of guard members who are activated to support law enforcement in other states, the officials said.",
      "The primary difference is that a governor would normally call up the guard instead of the president\u2019s federalizing it, as occurred in the District of Columbia. In Washington, the mayor typically submits a request to activate the guard through the defense secretary.",
      "After Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth signed an order allowing the guard deployed to D.C. to carry weapons last week, some began carrying them to locations around the city. This deployment comes from D.C. and six states: Louisiana, Ohio, Mississippi, South Carolina, Tennessee and West Virginia.",
      "While officials believe that at any one time there could be 500 to 800 guard members on the streets, the number fluctuates daily depending on need and circumstances, the Defense Department officials said. And only guard members operating in certain areas and on certain missions in Washington will be armed, they added.",
      "For example, guard members who are carrying out \u201cbeautification\u201d duties at national monuments will not typically be armed. But those on so-called presence patrols might be, the officials said. The decision about whether guard members are armed in some locations in the city is up to the local commander.",
      "Arming National Guard members during federal missions is common. Guard troops deployed on a federal mission in Los Angeles this year were also assigned their unit-issued weapons, according to a third Defense Department official. NBC News was not able to identify any examples of the guard members\u2019 firing their rifles or pistols in Los Angeles.",
      "Trump\u2019s claims",
      "President Donald Trump has said his use of the guard to support local law enforcement is part of his effort to rid the nation\u2019s capital of violent crime. And a U.S. official said arming the guard in some neighborhoods was a preventive step, essentially sending a signal to anyone who might target the guard not to do so.",
      "So far, there have been few incidents in Washington involving guard members. But on Saturday, Mississippi National Guard members responded to a call for protection from a D.C. resident who said an assailant was threatening bystanders.",
      "The guard members formed a protective barrier between the person and the alleged victims while also notifying local police. U.S. Capitol Police took the person into custody and obtained statements from the guard members involved, according to a spokesperson for the guard deployment in Washington.",
      "Trump said Monday that because of his deployment of the guard, Washington had not had a murder in 11 days and claimed it had been years since the city had gone more than a week without a murder. In fact, local police data shows that Washington went 16 days without a murder this year, from Feb. 25 to March 12."

      "The man, who identified himself as a 20-year combat veteran in a video posted to social media by the news outlet The Bulwark, said, \"I\u2019m burning this flag as a protest to that illegal fascist president that sits in that House,\" as he pointed toward the White House from Lafayette Square.",

      "The order directs Attorney General Pam Bondi to \"vigorously prosecute\" people who burn the American flag while engaged in other offenses, and it says she \"may pursue litigation to clarify the scope of the First Amendment exceptions in this area.\"",
      "The Supreme Court ruled 5-4 in 1989 that the Constitution protects burning the American flag.",
      "Trump's order does not make flag burning a crime or assess a penalty for it, but it argues that burning flags in a way that is \"likely to incite imminent lawless action\" or amounts to \"fighting words\" is not constitutionally protected.",

      "\u201cThese were extraordinary and dangerous acts of aggression orchestrated by a foreign nation on Australian soil,\u201d Albanese told reporters, adding that it was considered likely that Iran had directed other attacks as well.",
      "\u201cThey were attempts to undermine social cohesion and sow discord in our community,\u201d he said. \u201cIt is totally unacceptable, and the Australian government is taking strong and decisive action in response.\u201d",
      "In addition to expelling the Iranian ambassador, Australia has closed its embassy in Iran, with all of its diplomats already out of the country, Albanese said. He said the Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps, an elite military force loyal to Iran\u2019s supreme leader, would also be listed as a terrorist organization.",
      "The Israeli Embassy in Australia welcomed the designation as a \u201cstrong and important move.\u201d",
      "\u201cIran\u2019s regime is not only a threat to Jews or Israel, it endangers the entire free world, including Australia,\u201d the embassy said in a statement on X.",
      "Albanese said the Australian Security Intelligence Organization had assessed that Iran was behind last year\u2019s Oct. 20 attack on Lewis\u2019 Continental Kitchen in Sydney and Dec. 6 attack on the Adass Israel Synagogue in Melbourne. The two arson attacks caused significant property damage, but no injuries were reported.",
      "Australian intelligence official Mike Burgess said that while not all of the country\u2019s antisemitic incidents are tied to Iran, authorities are investigating whether Tehran was involved in other cases.",
      "No Iranian diplomats or embassy staff in Australia were involved in the attacks, he said.",
      "This is the first time since World War II that Australia has expelled an ambassador, Foreign Minister Penny Wong said, adding that the country will maintain \u201csome diplomatic lines\u201d with Tehran to \u201cadvance the interests of Australians.\u201d",
      "Australia has struggled to address a surge in antisemitic attacks on homes, schools, synagogues and vehicles since the Israel-Hamas war began on Oct. 7, 2023, with a terrorist attack on Israel during which Hamas-led militants killed about 1,200 people and abducted 251 others.",
      "The war has since killed more than 62,000 people in the Hamas-run Gaza Strip, according to the local health ministry, whose numbers are considered credible by the United Nations and other international experts.",
      "Last week, the world\u2019s leading authority on hunger declared there was a famine in Gaza City, where Israel is pushing ahead with a new military offensive. Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu rejected the report\u2019s findings as a \u201clie\u201d and said Israel \u201cdoes not have a policy of starvation.\u201d",
      "The war has been deeply divisive in Australia, where thousands of people joined pro-Palestinian rallies across the country on Sunday.",
      "Albanese, who said Netanyahu was \u201cin denial\u201d about the humanitarian crisis in Gaza, said this month that Australia would join a growing list of Western governments in recognizing a Palestinian state. Netanyahu responded by calling Albanese \u201ca weak politician who betrayed Israel,\u201d saying his political record had been \u201ctarnished forever.\u201d",
      "Albanese played down Netanyahu\u2019s remarks, saying he doesn\u2019t \u201ctake these things personally.\u201d"

      "In almost all the cases, police and administrators said the reports were hoaxes or swatting calls, which is when someone uses temporary cellphone numbers and voice-cloaking apps to create havoc. A few campuses said simply that no evidence of a gunman or violence was found.",
      "The reports were sent to students at the University of Arkansas, University of Colorado Boulder, Iowa State University, Kansas State University, the University of New Hampshire and Northern Arizona University, according to student alerts and school statements.",
      "In addition, according to campus officials, the University of South Carolina received two reports of an active shooter at Thomas Cooper Library in Columbia on Sunday night, the University of Tennessee-Chattanooga received a hoax active shooter call on Aug. 21, and Villanova University near Philadelphia received two false active shooter reports during freshman orientation last week.",
      "The University of Arkansas canceled classes Monday after it determined that reports of \"active threats\" could not be confirmed. \"Students are free to leave campus at this time if desired,\" university police said.",
      "Kansas State University described a false report Monday at its Manhattan campus as \"similar to other swatting reports happening at universities across the country.\"",
      "University of South Carolina police said in a statement Monday that both false reports Sunday night appeared to have been made by the same male and that they triggered a massive response that included \"mutual aid,\" or officers from surrounding communities.",
      "\"Both calls were initiated by an unknown male and included background noise that mimicked gunfire,\" police said.",
      "Northern Arizona University said in a statement that a caller reported a gunman Monday at Cline Library on its Flagstaff Mountain Campus, triggering a response that included Flagstaff police, Coconino County sheriff's deputies and state and federal agents.",
      "\"The report was determined to be a hoax, and at no time was there an active threat to the NAU community,\" the university said in a statement. \"An investigation is underway into the false report, with assistance from the Federal Bureau of Investigation.\"",

      "\"The FBI continues to work with state and local partners to investigate the swatting hoaxes but cannot say at this stage whether or not the incidents are connected,\" the bureau said.",
      "Some of the earliest swatting incidents in the 2010s involved false shooting reports at the homes of celebrities, and in recent years, they have expanded to include politicians and institutions. The FBI created a national database to track such fake calls.",
      "Last year, authorities alleged a California teenager carried out hundreds of swatting calls that targeted historically Black colleges, high schools, the homes of FBI agents and a Florida mosque in a spree he ultimately admitted.",
      "CORRECTION (Aug. 25, 2025, 11:06 p.m. ET): A previous version of this article misidentified one of the schools that received a false shooting report. It was the University of Colorado Boulder, not Colorado State University Boulder."

      "The study points to five risk factors that public health officials \u2014 and, in some cases, women themselves \u2014 can do something about: obesity, diabetes, smoking exposure, food insecurity and low levels of folate (an essential vitamin that helps the body produce cells).",
      "According to the study, 66% of women ages 12 to 49 have at least one of these risk factors, and 10% have three or more. The CDC\u2019s findings, published Tuesday in the American Journal of Preventive Medicine, are based on responses from 5,374 women who completed the agency\u2019s National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey from 2007 to 2020.",
      "\u201cWe can\u2019t underscore enough how important it is to raise awareness about these risk factors and encourage women to speak with their doctors if they have any concerns or questions before becoming pregnant,\u201d Arick Wang, a health scientist at the CDC and the lead author of the new study, said via email.",

      "People with food insecurity can be deficient in nutrients that are vital for a fetus\u2019 organs to develop properly, including folate. For instance, low concentrations of folate in the blood are associated with neural tube defects \u2014 brain or spine defects that develop in the first month of pregnancy. Doctors recommend that people who are pregnant or trying to get pregnant take folic acid, the synthetic version of folate.",

    "summary": "Israel has approved a settlement in the occupied West Bank that would cut the territory in two, and could destroy hopes for a future Palestinian state.",
    "story": [
      "MAALE ADUMIM, West Bank \u2014 The sun-starched strip of sand and brush doesn\u2019t look like much, but if you squint, you can almost glimpse the dreamscape of a future Palestinian capital.",
      "\u201cThese spare lands mean that we can build our parliament, we can build our future institutions,\u201d Khalil Toufakji, a Palestinian expert on geography and settlement expansion, told NBC News earlier this month as he gestured across the controversial \u201cEast 1,\u201d or E1, section of the occupied West Bank.",
      "\u201cIf Israel builds here, it means that everything is finished at the same time,\u201d the 76-year-old expert on Israeli settlements said at an overlook in the Israeli settlement of Maale Adumim. \u201cThis means that Jerusalem is surrounded from everywhere. \u2026 It means that there is no Palestinian geographic continuity between the north and south.\u201d",
      "The almost 5 square miles of land may seem undesirable and the conflict around it theoretical, but both Israel and the Palestinians regard the area\u2019s fate with the same sense of urgency.",
      "So when Israeli authorities approved the development of 3,400 homes last week, ultranationalist lawmakers celebrated what they saw as the death knell for a nascent Palestinian state and an acceleration of plans for Israel to annex the whole of the West Bank.",
      "The development \u201cpractically erases the two-state delusion and consolidates the Jewish people\u2019s hold on the heart of the Land of Israel,\u201d Bezalel Smotrich, Israel\u2019s far-right finance minister, told a news conference when he announced his approval of the plans.",
      "\u201cNow they declare it clearly and they don\u2019t need to hide it,\u201d said Shawan Jabarin, the general director of Al-Haq, a Palestinian human rights organization based in the West Bank. \u201cIt doesn\u2019t need philosophers and intellectuals to analyze. They speak about it themselves: \u2018This is to kill any possibility of a Palestinian state.\u2019\u201d",
      "Since the plan was tabled in the early 1990s, Israeli authorities and Jewish settlers like Smotrich have expounded upon the practical needs for new development as Jerusalem has become too crowded and environmental regulations have forbidden new building in the west of the city, which mostly belongs to Israel.",
      "But Palestinians say the area, which straddles the enormous Maale Adumim Jewish settlement and the Palestinian-majority east Jerusalem, is the only undeveloped land that might host government buildings for a new state.",
      "The construction would also split the West Bank in two, again fracturing an incipient Palestinian state already divided between the West Bank and the Gaza Strip, where almost 63,000 people have been killed since Oct. 7, 2023, according to the enclave\u2019s health ministry. Israel launched its military campaign after the Hamas-led terror attacks that day, which killed 1,200 people and saw around 250 taken hostage.",
      "After almost 23 months of war, the country has faced mounting criticism about its conduct from traditional Western allies like the U.K., France and Canada, which have recently made conditional offers to recognize a Palestinian state, unless Israel revives talks to achieve that and agrees to a ceasefire in Gaza.",
      "Those countries were among 21 that criticized the E1 development plans as a \u201cviolation of international law\u201d in a statement Friday. \u201cWe condemn this decision and call for its immediate reversal in the strongest terms,\u201d it read. British Foreign Minister David Lammy also called Tzipi Hotovely, Israel\u2019s ambassador to the U.K., to raise his objections.",
      "But the recognition of a Palestinian state is seen by some Israeli politicians as rewarding Hamas, leading them to view the E1 proposals as a deliberate broadside against longtime allies whose statements are increasingly drifting away from their country.",
      "\u201cIn the eyes of the right wing of Israeli politics, this is diplomatic pushback,\u201d said David Weinberg, a fellow at the Misgav Institute for National Security and Zionist Strategy. \u201cBut it\u2019s diplomatic pushback that\u2019s already on top of what have long been salient reasons, good reasons, for Israel wanting to build on E1.\u201d",
      "But for the Israeli right, the resounding triumph of President Donald Trump\u2019s return to the White House has drowned out such protests.",
      "\u201cThe E1 plan was initiated three decades ago and it was always blocked due to American pressure,\u201d said Lior Amihai, the executive director of Peace Now, an Israeli advocacy organization. \u201cNow under Trump, they\u2019re approving it. So certainly the lack of American resistance \u2026 enabled the Israeli government to approve it.\u201d",
      "The White House did not return a request for comment from NBC News about the E1 development.",
      "Upon retaking office, Trump lifted Biden-era sanctions on Israeli settlers who had been implicated in repeated violence against Palestinians in the West Bank.",
      "In his first term, he moved the U.S. Embassy to Jerusalem and recognized all of the city as Israel\u2019s capital. Most countries consider east Jerusalem to be occupied territory and do not recognize Israeli sovereignty. Israel, which captured east Jerusalem, including the Old City, from Jordan in the 1967 Middle East war, deems it as its eternal, indivisible capital.",
      "So far this year, Israel has approved 25,000 settlement housing units in the West Bank, Amihai said, far surpassing the record of 12,000 units during the whole of 2020 \u2014 a massive increase Amihai credited in part to Trump because his administration had created \u201can environment where it\u2019s easier for this government,\u201d because \u201cthey don\u2019t have to hide anything, they can say it vocally out loud.\u201d",
      "The additional units will accommodate the burgeoning growth of the 700,000 settlers the United Nations estimates already live in the West Bank in settlements widely considered illegal under international law.",
      "Even as the E1 plan slogged through decades of bureaucratic and diplomatic obstacles, Israeli officials prepared the land some of their countrymen refer to as Judea and Samaria, using the biblical term, with a clear intention to develop it.",
      "The Samaria and Judea Police District headquarters relocated there in 2008. Highways and other roadworks connecting Jerusalem and Maale Adumim\u2019s infrastructure to the same largely uninhabited land have also been installed.",
      "Once housing there is finished, Palestinian observers say the area will become closed to their community. Even those simply driving through from the Palestinian provisional capital of Ramallah to the southern West Bank town of Bethlehem will probably have to seek longer routes, they say.",
      "Such detours shouldn\u2019t preclude further agreements between Palestinians and Israelis, Weinberg said, even as he dismissed the notion of a Palestinian state under current circumstances.",
      "\u201cInstead of battering Israel, the West should be advancing realistic space-saving arrangements for Judea and Sumeria,\u201d he said. \u201cIsrael\u2019s need to build on E1 does not need to be a bar to an agreement with a serious Palestinian government.\u201d",
      "Yet the Israeli right wing has made its intentions known, Jabarin said. Such a sudden, strenuous assault on Palestinian statehood \u2014 particularly with American blessings \u2014 will require more than diplomatic rhetoric to reverse.",
      "\u201cWording there, condemnations here \u2014 it doesn\u2019t make any change,\u201d he said. \u201cIt will not push Israel back in any way.\u201d"

The two arson attacks caused significant property damage, but no injuries were reported.",
      "Australian intelligence official Mike Burgess said that while not all of the country\u2019s antisemitic incidents are tied to Iran, authorities are investigating whether Tehran was involved in other cases.",
      "No Iranian diplomats or embassy staff in Australia were involved in the attacks, he said.",
      "This is the first time since World War II that Australia has expelled an ambassador, Foreign Minister Penny Wong said, adding that the country will maintain \u201csome diplomatic lines\u201d with Tehran to \u201cadvance the interests of Australians.\u201d",
      "Australia has struggled to address a surge in antisemitic attacks on homes, schools, synagogues and vehicles since the Israel-Hamas war began on Oct. 7, 2023, with a terrorist attack on Israel during which Hamas-led militants killed about 1,200 people and abducted 251 others.",
      "The war has since killed more than 62,000 people in the Hamas-run Gaza Strip, according to the local health ministry, whose numbers are considered credible by the United Nations and other international experts.",
      "Last week, the world\u2019s leading authority on hunger declared there was a famine in Gaza City, where Israel is pushing ahead with a new military offensive. Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu rejected the report\u2019s findings as a \u201clie\u201d and said Israel \u201cdoes not have a policy of starvation.\u201d",
      "The war has been deeply divisive in Australia, where thousands of people joined pro-Palestinian rallies across the country on Sunday.",
      "Albanese, who said Netanyahu was \u201cin denial\u201d about the humanitarian crisis in Gaza, said this month that Australia would join a growing list of Western governments in recognizing a Palestinian state. Netanyahu responded by calling Albanese \u201ca weak politician who betrayed Israel,\u201d saying his political record had been \u201ctarnished forever.\u201d",
      "Albanese played down Netanyahu\u2019s remarks, saying he doesn\u2019t \u201ctake these things personally.\u201d"

      "A Utah district judge has ruled that the state must redraw its congressional districts because the state\u2019s Republican-controlled Legislature erred when it overruled a ballot measure passed by voters that sought to rein in partisan gerrymandering.",
      "The ruling adds yet another wrinkle to the national battle for control of Congress next year \u2014 and how the congressional map is evolving ahead of the 2026 midterm elections.",
      "Republicans are defending a narrow lead in the U.S. House, and Texas Republicans, urged on by President Donald Trump, embarked on a rare mid-decade effort to redraw the state's lines in hope of netting up to five more congressional seats for the GOP.",
      "That has lit a match that has a handful of other states considering redrawing their own lines. Last week, in response to Texas, California\u2019s Democratic-controlled Legislature passed its own plan to ask voters to temporarily redraw lines to create up to five new Democratic-leaning seats there. And Republican and Democratic leaders in other states have mused about following suit.",
      "At issue in Utah is a long-running court battle over the 2018 ballot proposition that created an independent redistricting commission to recommend congressional maps. And it\u2019s unclear whether that fight will be resolved and whether Utah will have new maps for the midterms.",
      "The Salt Lake Tribune reported Monday that the Legislature\u2019s attorneys have said they could appeal a ruling to state courts or even the U.S. Supreme Court.",
      "Under the terms of the 2018 ballot measure, the Legislature was required to either approve or disapprove those maps, and voters approved guardrails for how new districts should be drawn. One of those was a ban on partisan gerrymandering.",
      "In 2020, the Legislature responded by passing a law that softened the partisan redistricting ban and removed the requirement that legislators vote on the independent commission's map, among other things.",
      "In her 76-page ruling, Judge Dianna M. Gibson wrote that the Legislature \"intentionally stripped away\" the heart of the 2018 reform passed by voters when it passed its own legislation just a few years later.",
      "\"Redistricting is not a mere exercise in political line-drawing; it strikes at the very heart of our democracy,\" she wrote.",
      "\"The way district boundaries are drawn determines whether the right to vote is meaningful, whether equal protection is honored, and whether the fundamental promises of our state and federal constitutions are upheld,\" Gibson continued. \"How district lines are drawn can either safeguard representation and ensure accountability by elected representatives or erode public trust, silence voices and weaken the rule of law.\"",
      "Finding that the Legislature \"unconstitutionally repealed\" the ballot measure, Gibson barred the state from moving forward with future elections under its current congressional district lines. And she directed the Legislature to create a remedial map within 30 days that follows the guidelines voters passed in 2018.",
      "Utah, a heavily Republican state, backed President Donald Trump by more than 20 points, 58%-37%, in the last election. The state's House delegation is made up of four Republicans.",
      "But its biggest population center \u2014 Salt Lake County, which accounts for more than one-third of Utah's population \u2014 leans Democratic. The county backed Vice President Kamala Harris by 10 points last year. The current congressional map divides it among four districts that fan out across the rest of the state's Republican strongholds."

    "story": [
      "WASHINGTON \u2014 The majority of the more than 2,300 National Guard troops deployed in Washington to support law enforcement began carrying weapons this weekend. But as in other such National Guard deployments, the troops have been told to use their M17 pistols and powerful M4 rifles only for self-defense or as a last resort, two Defense Department officials told NBC News.",
      "Under the rules of engagement, deadly force is authorized only \u201cupon reasonable belief of an imminent threat of death or serious bodily harm,\u201d one of the defense officials said. And a bad actor must have the \u201cability and opportunity\u201d to put a guard member in jeopardy or inflict serious bodily harm. The focus for the guard members, the official added, is to defend themselves or other people.",
      "Armed guard members will carry the type of weapon they are normally issued and trained on, typically M17 handguns and M4 semiautomatic rifles, similar to assault-style rifles, the Defense Department officials said. Some guard members will carry M9 pistols.",
      "The military weapons are similar to those used by local police departments across the United States. The M4 is a standard semiautomatic rifle and has roughly the same capabilities as semiautomatic rifles used by law enforcement agencies.",
      "The M17 handgun is essentially the same as the Sig Sauer P320 pistol, the type of semiautomatic pistol that police across the country have used for years. Police in Washington use semiautomatic handguns and rifles, as well.",
      "Similar to other missions",
      "The troops\u2019 mission in Washington is similar to that of guard members who are activated to support law enforcement in other states, the officials said.",
      "The primary difference is that a governor would normally call up the guard instead of the president\u2019s federalizing it, as occurred in the District of Columbia. In Washington, the mayor typically submits a request to activate the guard through the defense secretary.",
      "After Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth signed an order allowing the guard deployed to D.C. to carry weapons last week, some began carrying them to locations around the city. This deployment comes from D.C. and six states: Louisiana, Ohio, Mississippi, South Carolina, Tennessee and West Virginia.",
      "While officials believe that at any one time there could be 500 to 800 guard members on the streets, the number fluctuates daily depending on need and circumstances, the Defense Department officials said. And only guard members operating in certain areas and on certain missions in Washington will be armed, they added.",
      "For example, guard members who are carrying out \u201cbeautification\u201d duties at national monuments will not typically be armed. But those on so-called presence patrols might be, the officials said. The decision about whether guard members are armed in some locations in the city is up to the local commander.",
      "Arming National Guard members during federal missions is common. Guard troops deployed on a federal mission in Los Angeles this year were also assigned their unit-issued weapons, according to a third Defense Department official. NBC News was not able to identify any examples of the guard members\u2019 firing their rifles or pistols in Los Angeles.",
      "Trump\u2019s claims",
      "President Donald Trump has said his use of the guard to support local law enforcement is part of his effort to rid the nation\u2019s capital of violent crime. And a U.S. official said arming the guard in some neighborhoods was a preventive step, essentially sending a signal to anyone who might target the guard not to do so.",
      "So far, there have been few incidents in Washington involving guard members. But on Saturday, Mississippi National Guard members responded to a call for protection from a D.C. resident who said an assailant was threatening bystanders.",
      "The guard members formed a protective barrier between the person and the alleged victims while also notifying local police. U.S. Capitol Police took the person into custody and obtained statements from the guard members involved, according to a spokesperson for the guard deployment in Washington.",
      "Trump said Monday that because of his deployment of the guard, Washington had not had a murder in 11 days and claimed it had been years since the city had gone more than a week without a murder. In fact, local police data shows that Washington went 16 days without a murder this year, from Feb. 25 to March 12."

      "But Gansler's letter argued an apology would amount to the school's admitting it violated the law.",
      "\"An apology will amount to an admission that the university did something unlawful, opening GMU and the Board up to legal liability for conduct that did not occur under the Board\u2019s watch,\" it says.",
      "George Mason's Board of Visitors said in a statement Friday that it was reviewing specific proposed resolution steps.",
      "Gansler's letter says the university has \u201cmoved swiftly\u201d to ensure continued compliance with new federal mandates since Trump began his second term, including ceasing affirmative action programs for women and minorities, dissolving the university\u2019s Office for Diversity Equity and Inclusion and reviewing diversity statements on job postings.",
      "It adds that at least 17 positions associated with DEI efforts have been eliminated or restructured and that several diversity-related programs and initiatives have been dissolved.",
      "\u201cWell before the federal government turned its attention to GMU, the university, under Dr. Washington and the Board\u2019s leadership, undertook a robust effort to stay ahead of the curve and make many of the changes now being demanded of universities,\u201d it says.",
      "In the letter, Gansler also requests that he be part of discussions about the university's response to the Education Department's demands.",
      "\u201cThe journey toward striking any agreement with OCR must begin with a shared set of facts, which we do not yet have,\" the letter reads."

    "story": [
      "KEYSTONE, S.D. \u2014\u00a0From his real estate developments to his golf courses, President Donald Trump is known for adding his name to his properties. Now, some of his supporters want to add his likeness to one of the most iconic monuments in the country: Mount Rushmore.",
      "Just days after Trump took office for his second term, one of his supporters in Congress introduced a bill to do just that. While the legislation from Rep. Anna Paulina Luna, R-Fla., has not advanced in the Capitol, there is an even more difficult challenge ahead for the bill: Even if the measure passed, the famous mountain does not have enough rock that is suitable to be carved for Trump\u2019s \u2014 or anyone else\u2019s \u2014 face.",
      "\u201cIt comes down to the geology, the engineering,\u201d said Paul Nelson, a retired engineer who oversaw the rock monitoring system at Mount Rushmore. \u201cIt just can\u2019t be done.\u201d",
      "The mountain\u2019s physical limitations were well known to lead sculptor Gutzon Borglum, as he and his son had to adapt their plans to what was feasible with the stone during construction of Mount Rushmore in South Dakota's Black Hills from 1927 to 1941. Before he had even finished, Borglum wrote in May 1936 that the \u201cstone limitations are so serious, that I doubt if it would be possible to change the composition, which is fixed, in any way to include a fifth head.\u201d",
      "That has not stopped supporters of Trump from floating the idea of his head on the monument.",
      "\u201cWell, they certainly have room for it there,\u201d Interior Secretary Doug Burgum told Trump\u2019s daughter-in-law Lara Trump on her Fox News show when she asked whether Trump could be on Mount Rushmore one day.",
      "The National Park Service declined to comment.",
      "Trump himself weighed in on the idea in August 2020, denying a report that White House aides had reached out to then-South Dakota Gov. Kristi Noem\u2019s office about the process to add presidents to the monument. (Noem is now Trump\u2019s homeland security secretary.)",
      "\u201cNever suggested it although, based on all of the many things accomplished during the first 3 1/2 years, perhaps more than any other Presidency, sounds like a good idea to me!\u201d Trump said on what was then called Twitter.",
      "Trump is not the first president to have his supporters believe he should be physically represented on par with George Washington, Thomas Jefferson, Theodore Roosevelt and Abraham Lincoln.",
      "After Ronald Reagan\u2019s death in 2004, there were efforts to memorialize him on the monument. And even before Mount Rushmore was completed, first lady Eleanor Roosevelt advocated for adding suffragist Susan B. Anthony.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s a wonderful thing to speculate about, who could or should be on Mount Rushmore, but it can\u2019t be done,\u201d said Dan Wenk, who was the superintendent at Mount Rushmore for more than a decade. \u201cWould you add another figure to da Vinci\u2019s 'The Last Supper?' I don\u2019t think so. You don\u2019t change great art.\u201d",
      "Wenk said that while it may look like there is space next to Lincoln or Washington, the rock is \u201cnot suitable for carving,\u201d as it is \u201cvery fractured, it\u2019s very soft.\u201d",
      "That has been true since the beginning. Carving for Jefferson\u2019s face initially started to Washington\u2019s left but had to be moved to his right to find stone that was acceptable. Any new carving could jeopardize the already present fractures, Nelson said.",
      "\u201cAnd so if you\u2019re going to do any other carvings on the surface, you have to remove a lot of rock to get down to the competent rock, and you run the risk of maybe mobilizing some fractures,\u201d he said. \u201cSo, no, I wouldn\u2019t want to be messing with Mount Rushmore.\u201d",
      "Aside from the physical capabilities, some of the 2 million tourists per year who visit the monument recently shared their views about who is worthy of being included in the sculpture.",
      "\u201cI think history is going to show that he\u2019s in the same pantheon,\u201d Robert Thomas, a tourist from Missouri, said of Trump.",

    "link": "https://www.nbcnews.com/politics/white-house/trump-removing-federal-reserve-governor-lisa-cook-rcna227138",
    "published": "Tue, 26 Aug 2025 00:18:08 GMT",
    "summary": "Cook, the first Black woman to serve on the Federal Reserve Board, responded saying she has done nothing wrong and that President Donald Trump cannot fire her.",
    "story": [
      "President Donald Trump is removing Federal Reserve Governor Lisa Cook effective immediately, according to a letter he posted to Truth Social on Monday night.",
      "In the letter, Trump writes: \"Pursuant to my authority under Article II of the Constitution of the United States and the Federal Reserve Act of 1913, as amended, you are hereby removed from your position on the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve, effective immediately.\"",
      "Trump cites a \"criminal referral\" from Federal Housing Finance Agency Director William Pulte, in which Pulte accused Cook of mortgage fraud.",
      "In a statement, Cook responded by saying: \"President Trump purported to fire me 'for cause' when no cause exists under the law, and he has no authority to do so. I will not resign. I will continue to carry out my duties to help the American economy as I have been doing since 2022.\"",
      "Her attorney Abbe Lowell said in an accompanying statement that Trump's \"reflex to bully is flawed and his demands lack any proper process, basis or legal authority. We will take whatever actions are needed to prevent his attempted illegal action.\u201d",
      "Under the Federal Reserve Act, the only reason Federal Reserve governors can be removed from their positions is \u201cfor cause,\u201d or some kind of wrongdoing.",
      "Cook has not been charged with any crime, and her removal is likely to lead to a court battle between the independent central bank and the executive branch.",
      "The Supreme Court said in May, while granting Trump the ability to remove members of other independent agencies, that the Federal Reserve is a \u201cuniquely structured, quasi-private entity\u201d that has its own distinct historical tradition. That led many to believe the bar would be high for Trump to be able to remove any Fed board members or its chairman.",
      "Sen. Elizabeth Warren of Massachusetts, the top Democrat on the Banking Committee, said in a statement: \u201cThe illegal attempt to fire Lisa Cook is the latest example of a desperate President searching for a scapegoat to cover for his own failure to lower costs for Americans. It\u2019s an authoritarian power grab that blatantly violates the Federal Reserve Act, and must be overturned in court.\u201d",
      "Spokespeople for Senate Banking Committee Chairman Tim Scott, R-S.C., did not immediately respond to a request for comment.",
      "Cook said in a statement last week that she had \"no intention of being bullied to step down from my position because of some questions raised in a tweet.\"",
      "\u201cI do intend to take any questions about my financial history seriously as a member of the Federal Reserve and so I am gathering the accurate information to answer any legitimate questions and provide the facts,\" she said at the time.",
      "Cook is the first Black woman to serve on the board of the Fed, considered the world's most important independent central bank.",
      "Monday's move against Cook came amid an unrelenting pressure campaign by Trump against the central bank, with Trump and his top aides and allies repeatedly attacking the institution and its chair, Jerome Powell, over current interest rate policies.",
      "Trump has attacked Powell almost nonstop, calling him \"stupid\" and saying he \"hates me.\" Trump has also said the board, which Cook serves on, \"should be ashamed of themselves.\"",
      "After Pulte alleged that Cook committed mortgage fraud, Trump quickly reposted his allegations, saying on Truth Social that she \"must resign, now!!!\"",
      "Pulte said on X after Trump announced Cook's removal, \"Fraud will not be tolerated in President Trump\u2019s housing market.\"",
      "Pulte's focus on Cook's mortgage documentation is just the latest in a series of similar accusations against high-ranking Democrats, such as Sen. Adam Schiff of California and New York Attorney General Letitia James.",
      "He added in a second post, \"If you commit mortgage fraud in America, we will come after you, no matter who you are.\"",
      "The U.S. Dollar Index, a measure of the dollar's strength against a basket of global currencies, declined sharply on Trump's announcement.",
      "Cook, who has a permanent vote on the central bank\u2019s rate-setting committee, was appointed by President Joe Biden to a term running until 2038.",
      "If she is removed from the Fed's board and its rate-setting committee, Trump would gain another opportunity to put his mark on the central bank.",
      "Trump has nominated his top economist, Stephen Miran, to the Fed's board for a term that would run until January. Trump will also have a chance to name a new chair when Powell's term ends in May.",
      "Trump appointed Fed governors during his first term \u2014 Michelle Bowman and Christopher Waller. Both are still serving in those roles. However, interest rates change only when a majority of the 12-member committee votes to do so, and a total of four Trump appointees would still be in the minority.",
      "The committee consists of the Fed chairperson, six Fed governors, the Federal Reserve Bank of New York president and four other regional Fed presidents on a rotating basis, who represent districts across the country.",
      "\u201cThis is a new attempt of the administration to gain more control over the Fed. They\u2019re pulling as many different levers as they can find to get that control,\" former Fed economist Claudia Sahm recently told Bloomberg News."

      "Peter Orth, a supervisory senior resident agent with the FBI\u2019s Seattle office, told reporters that authorities are returning to an area near Rock Island Campground, roughly 150 miles east of Seattle, with the goal of finding evidence that will lead them to Decker or any information related to the murders.",
      "\u201cBy thoroughly searching and documenting the area, we can help prevent the need to review the area in the future by collecting all possible evidence,\u201d he said.",
      "The effort, coordinated by the FBI\u2019s Seattle field office, includes nearly 100 law enforcement personnel, with intelligence analysts, evidence specialists and special agents with expertise in child abduction cases and forensic analysis, Chelan County Sheriff Michael Morrison said.",
      "\u201cThese resources demonstrate the seriousness with which every agency is approaching this case,\u201d Morrison said in a news release.",
      "The search is expected to last through Tuesday, Morrison said.",
      "\u201cWhile this latest operation may or may not yield new findings, our promise is that we will not stop until we have exhausted every possible avenue to find him and to bring closure to this case,\u201d he said.",
      "The sheriff's office continues to follow every credible lead, he said, noting there is still no evidence to indicate whether Decker, 33, is alive or dead.",
      "Authorities have been searching for Decker, an Army veteran described as an avid outdoorsman, since May 30, when his ex-wife contacted police and said he did not return their daughters, Paityn, 9, Evelyn, 8, and Olivia, 5, after a planned visit.",
      "The girls were found at the campground on June 2 with plastic bags over their heads, according to an affidavit in support of an arrest warrant. An autopsy found that they died of suffocation.",
      "Authorities appear to have seen Decker, who is wanted on charges of first-degree murder and kidnapping, just once, when a man believed to be him was seen in the Blewitt Pass area, southeast of Rock Island Campground.",
      "Another sighting in Idaho turned out to be someone else.",
      "Authorities have not identified a possible motive. According to the affidavit, Decker refused to sign a parenting plan last September that ordered him to seek mental health treatment and domestic violence-anger management counseling.",
      "His ex-wife, Whitney Decker, has said she believes her daughters might still be alive had an Amber Alert been issued in the hours after she first contacted police."

      "On Aug. 4, Mann posted a TikTok illustrating his growing obsession with the movie. Featuring the song \u201cGolden,\u201d the video has been viewed about 10 million times. It shows Mann going from mild interest on first watch to dramatically singing into a sword on his 10th watch.",
      "\"This is the pop culture moment of the year,\" he says. \"It has broken the internet.\"",
      "The movie has even infiltrated TODAY host Craig Melvin\u2019s household.",

Six songs from the movie\u2019s soundtrack have taken over Billboard\u2019s Hot 100 chart, with two rising into the top 10 slots, according to Billboard\u2019s website. On Aug. 25, Netflix released a special sing-along edition on its streaming platform.",

      "\"Everybody went. The whole school went,\" he explains. \"It's almost like the school version of Taylor Swift's Eras Tour, where you don't want to miss out.\"",
      "The movie has similarly been \u201cblowing up\u201d teacher Rob D\u2019Urbano\u2019s parent group chat. \u201cHonestly, none of us mind that it\u2019s on repeat in our houses,\u201d he tells TODAY.com. \u201cI feel like all the dads are enjoying it.\u201d",
      "Alongside a TikTok video of himself watching the movie even after his three young daughters went to bed, he wrote, \u201cI can\u2019t be the only parent that bops to this movie.\u201d",
      "No, sir. You certainly are not.",
      "Influencer Josh Jones made a TikTok video similar to Mann's showing his evolution from skeptic to believer. He added costumes, wigs and a dance routine to really show his dedication to the film.",
      "For Jones, it's the \"message behind the movie\" that really resonates.",
      "\"There's this really positive message here, where it perfectly portrays the battle between good and evil,\" he says.

He says, \"It's complimented our spiritual journey as a family very nicely.\"",
      "As the father of one son and five daughters \u2014 with another daughter on the way \u2014 Jones also appreciates the \"girl power\" theme of the movie. \"Having all of these daughters, that's something that I just really want to support,\" he shares.",
      "The phenomenon isn\u2019t limited to girl dads.",
      "Mann's two sons also love the movie. His 4-year-old sings \"Soda Pop\" and his 8-year-old is trying to teach himself to play the song on the piano by ear. Mann, an actor who played the title role in the the Broadway tour of \"Phantom of the Opera\" for 700 performances, does a mean version of \"Golden.\"",
      "\u201cSomething about these competing boy and girl groups is super nostalgic for millennial parents,\" Mann says. \"We get to relive this fandom all over again through our kids. It\u2019s like our boy band DNA meeting parenting reality.\u201d",
      "Mann adds, \"This Halloween, it's going to be only 'KPop Demon Hunters.' I wish I had stock in this movie.\""

      "Jillian Harris and her longtime love, Justin Pasutto, have tied the knot in not one but two \"fairy tale\" ceremonies.",
      "The former \"Bachelorette\" and HGTV star, 45, and her fianc\u00e9, a former pro snowboarder, tied the knot Aug. 21 in a church ceremony before saying \u201cI do\u201d again two days later in front of 176 guests on their farm in West Kelowna, British Columbia, People reported.",
      "\u201cAfter eight years of planning, we\u2019ve decided to really go for it!\u201d Harris told the publication. \u201cIt is an actual fairy-tale dream come true. I\u2019m so happy that we waited this long so that we could truly plan the day that we\u2019ve always dreamed of.\u201d",
      "The newlyweds, who have been together for 13 years, exchanged vows for the first time at the same church where Pasutto\u2019s parents wed. Harris walked down the aisle wearing a custom-made lace wedding dress by Cand\u00e9 Bridal Boutique.",
      "The couple put thought into \"customizing the liturgy\" so that the ceremony felt \"special and personal to us as a couple and as a family,\u201d said Harris, noting that Pasutto's Catholic faith played a \"meaningful\" role.",
      "Afterward, Harris and Pasutto hosted an Italian-themed rehearsal dinner at their home to honor Pasutto's Italian roots.",
      "The pair and their loved ones spent the following day doing yoga and golfing before they walked down the aisle again at Harris and Pasutto\u2019s property in a \"flower farm\"-themed ceremony.",
      "Harris described the ceremony's aesthetic as \u201ctimeless, elegant, and luxurious\" but with a \"floral touch.\"",
      "\u201cJustin has worked tirelessly over the past two years to repair the property, replanting trees, moving dirt, planting grass, irrigating and managing the team,\u201d she said. \u201cHe has devoted the last year of his life to making my wedding venue dreams come true.\u201d",
      "Afterward, at the reception, the couple shared their first dance to Taylor Swift\u2019s \u201cLover.\u201d",
      "Harris starred on Season 5 of \"The Bachelorette\" in 2009 before appearing as a designer on the HGTV series \"Extreme Makeover: Home Edition\" in 2010 and, later, as the co-host of \"Love It or List It Too\" from 2013 to 2019.",
      "She met Pasutto in 2012. The couple, who got engaged on Christmas 2016, share two kids: son Leo, 9, and daughter Annie, 6.",
      "\u201cWell THAT was SOME Christmas morning!!!!!\u201d Harris wrote, announcing their engagement on Instagram next to a photo of the couple in bed with their son and two dogs. \u201cOH MY GOD my heart cannot handle this much LOVE! @slipperygoose you\u2019ve made me the HAPPIEST girl in the world.\u201d",
      "\u201c#Finally,\u201d she added along with the hashtag \u201c#ISimplyAskedForOneThingForChristmas.\u201d",
      "The couple originally planned to walk down the aisle in the summer of 2020  \u2014 with Harris' grandmother meant to be her maid of honor \u2014\u00a0but their wedding plans were thwarted by the COVID-19 pandemic.",
      "Harris's grandmother, who passed away in 2019, still played a role in their ceremony: Harris carried her ashes in the pocket of her dress.",
      "In June, Harris shared a video with footage from her bachelorette party, which was held at the Fairmont Jasper Park Lodge in her native Alberta, Canada, on Instagram.",
      "\"After eight years of being engaged, I finally had my Bachelorette party, and here\u2019s how it went\u2026,\u201d Harris wrote in text in the clip.",
      "The video began by showing Harris and her friends tossing cowboy hats in the air. It went on to show the group of women decorating the lodge \u2014 with a banner that read \"Last Hoedown\" \u2014\u00a0along with footage of them dancing and doing yoga together.",
      "\u201cGoing back to my Alberta roots with 15 of my besties was exactly what my soul needed,\u201d Harris wrote in her caption.",
      "\u201cWe made so many unforgettable memories,\" she added. \"From the yummiest food, to morning pilates and canoeing on the lake, dancing to country music, singing, belly laughing, and stories we\u2019ll be telling for years.\u201d"

      "\u201cI\u2019m also a bad actress and a bad liar \u2014 I think people would be able to catch on quickly,\u201d Amaya chimed in. \u201cI\u2019m like, I need Botox after this, he makes me smile this much.\u201d",

      "Ahead of the \"Love Island USA\" Season 7 Reunion, both Amaya and Bryan have unfollowed each other on Instagram, adding fuel to split speculation that first surfaced earlier this summer.",
      "The rumors began swirling when Bryan was allegedly spotted  with another woman at a nightclub just days after the couple left the villa together.",
      "At the time, the pair seemed to shut down the chatter with a romantic TikTok posted to Bryan\u2019s account. \u201cWhen everyone thinks you\u2019re over meanwhile this is us,\u201d read the caption, accompanying footage of the couple gazing into each other\u2019s eyes before Amaya leaped into Bryan\u2019s arms.",
      "Based on the reunion trailer, Bryan will address the rumors. Here's what to know.",
      "What happened between Amaya and Bryan on \u2018Love Island USA\u2019?",
      "Amaya\u2019s journey to find love in Fiji was far from straightforward.",
      "Entering the villa as a bombshell on Episode 4 alongside Hannah Fields, Amaya originally coupled up with Ace Greene.",
      "While there seemed to be a spark between the pair at first, Ace quickly switched up on Amaya, citing her usage of nicknames (particularly \u201cbabe\u201d) and physical touch as too much, too soon.",
      "From there, Amaya found more connections and obstacles. She coupled up with Austin Shepard on Episode 14, but he, like Ace, began to distance himself from Amaya.",
      "The couple split up when Casa Amor happened on Episode 19, leaving them both single and open to exploring new connections.",
      "Bryan came into the show as a bombshell in Casa Amor, the biggest relationship test of every \u201cLove Island\u201d season. This is where either the men or the women from the main villa are secretly whisked away to a second villa nearby, where they get to meet a group of other singles hoping to find love in Fiji.",
      "In Casa Amor, Bryan quickly hit it off with Andreina. Amaya, meanwhile, was striking up a connection with Zak Srakaew, who also came into the show during Casa Amor. They ultimately coupled up and remained a couple as they went back to the main villa.",
      "However, Zak blindsided Amaya during the \u201cStand on Business\u201d challenge and gang up on her alongside Austin and Ace, which led to Amaya exploring new connections and hitting it off with Bryan.",
      "Wait, what happened during the \u2018Stand on Business\u2019 challenge?",
      "During the \u201cStand on Business\u201d challenge in Episode 26, Amaya was confronted by all three men she had previously been coupled up with: Ace, Austin and Zak.",
      "As Amaya stood in front of her peers, she read cards that had been written about her \u2014 specifically about her emotions and how she expressed herself in her relationships.",
      "\u201cYou cry more than needed. You try to move to fast for everyone,\u201d Austin wrote on a card that Amaya had to read in front of the entire villa.",
      "\u201cGod forbid I\u2019m a sensitive gangsta,\u201d Amaya replied (a phrase that became one of her signature one-liners).",
      "\u201cI would just have to say that many people could view this as a weakness, but to me personally, after everything I\u2019ve been through in my life, I view it as a strength,\u201d she continued. \u201cSo if you guys view it like that, then guess what. I\u2019m just not your cup of tea to be drinking, so don\u2019t f------ drink it.\u201d",
      "Austin admitted to writing the card, explaining that after they initially coupled up, \u201cthe intensity of your emotions and feelings and wants just felt like they built way up.\u201d",
      "Ace and Zak decided to join Austin and gang up on Amaya in front of everyone. But what could have been Amaya\u2019s lowest point in the villa actually became a silver lining, as this is where her and Bryan\u2019s story began.",
      "\u201cOne thing I got to add though,\u201d Bryan interjected that night. \u201cComing from a Hispanic household, calling someone \u2018Babe,\u2019 \u2018Mi amor,\u2019 \u2018Mi vida,\u2019 that\u2019s just how we talk. You\u2019re telling her meet you halfway, you got to meet her halfway, too.\u201d",

      "The pair coupled up on Episode 30, and America eventually voted to send them to the Season 7 finale. Viewers got to see their final date and declarations of love, the loving speeches all the final couples give to one another right before the winners are announced.",
      "During their first and final date, Amaya expressed her appreciation for Bryan, especially for how he spoke on her behalf during the \u201cStand on Business\u201d challenge.",
      "\u201cBabe, you don\u2019t understand how much it meant, that moment, like of you standing up for me in the Stand on Business,\u201d she told him. \u201cYou know, like, if my light is too bright for somebody, wear sunglasses or something.\u201d",
      "\u201cBut with you, you looked right into the sun, you know?\u201d she continued.",

I definitely wanted to leave here letting you know that I want to make stuff exclusive with us and prioritize us. I want to continue taking the right steps with you and attacking the outside world with you.\u201d",
      "Are Amaya and Bryan still together now?",

      "But their decision to unfollow each other on Instagram signals serious trouble in paradise.",
      "Adding to the breakup speculation, Amaya reposted a cryptic TikTok video the same day fans noticed the social media snub.",

    "published": "Mon, 25 Aug 2025 13:58:47 GMT",
    "summary": "Expert reveals how Love Island's isolated environment affects contestants' mental health, decision-making, and relationships through psychological manipulation.",
    "story": [
      "Joining \"Love Island\" may seem like the ultimate dream gig \u2014 a trip to Fiji where you bask in the sun all day surrounded by attractive singles, playing what amounts to glorified frat party games with no real-world distractions. Just you, your best bathing suits, and endless tropical sunshine.",
      "But behind this Instagram-perfect facade is a intense psychological experiment.",
      "The hit reality dating show strips participants of modern life's most basic comforts \u2014 no personal phones, no clocks, little privacy \u2014 creating conditions that could fundamentally alter how they think, feel and form relationships.",
      "TODAY.com spoke with Beverley Andre, a licensed psychologist, about how the villa's unique environment could affect contestants' minds and decision-making processes, and why the show has mental health care professionals on set.",
      "Her insights reveal why \"Love Island USA\" relationships can appear and feel so intense in the moment, yet may struggle to survive in the real world.",
      "When Time Stands Still",
      "Perhaps the most disorienting aspect of villa life is the complete absence of time cues. Without clocks or calendars, contestants lose all sense of how long they've actually known each other.",
      "\"When time is distorted, your day can feel like a week,\" Andre says. \"So you're thinking that you have this really deep bond with this person, but it's only been like one day or two days.\"",
      "This temporal confusion accelerates emotional investment in ways that can seem almost comical to viewers. Remember when contestants declare they\u2019re \u201cready to be locked in\u201d after just 48 hours? That\u2019s not just reality TV drama \u2014 it\u2019s psychology in action.",
      "\u201cThere\u2019s no indication, no cues for you to remember, \u2018You guys just got here. This is brand new,\u2019\u201d Andre says.",
      "The result? Some decisions can be driven more by proximity rather than compatibility.",
      "While \"Love Island's\" relatively tech-free environment might sound like a wellness retreat, it brings both benefits and challenges for contestants.",
      "On the positive side, the absence of digital transactions allows for unprecedented focus.",
      "\"When you aren't surrounded by so much noise, you're able to center in and really focus on your own thoughts,\" Andre says.",
      "Forced introspection can lead to genuine self-discovery and deeper connections.",
      "However, the isolation comes with a major downside: Contestants lose access to established neutral parties. Without the outside perspectives people in the real world often engage with when dating, contestants can become trapped in their own biases and misconceptions.",
      "\u201cYou don\u2019t have neutral sounding boards because technically, the other people there are your competitors,\u201d Andre explains.",
      "When Romance Meets Competition",
      "The villa's unique blend of romantic pursuit and competition creates what Andre calls a \"pressure pot effect.\" Contestants aren't just looking for love, they're fighting for public votes and a cash prize, which fundamentally changes relationship dynamics.",
      "\u201c'How can you gain the fastest connection possible?' becomes the driving question, rather than, 'Is this person right for me?'\u201d Andre says.",
      "The format of the show \u2014\u00a0and the $100,000 cash prize at the end \u2014 can lead people to pursue a relationship for the sake of appearing to be in a strong connection, as opposed to laying the groundwork for a relationship.",
      "(The show aims to \"test\" these motives at the end by forcing one member of the winning couple to decide whether they split the prize money or keep it for themselves, with the goal of proving whether or not they were in the villa for love.)",
      "The constant questioning of motives adds another layer of complexity. As Andre points out, both contestants and viewers, may wonder: \u201cAre you really digging me, or do you just want us to win and look cute?\u201d",
      "Living Under Surveillance",
      "Sharing one bedroom and one bathroom with a house full of strangers, all while being filmed 24/7, would create unprecedented challenges for emotional regulation, Andre says.",
      "\"When you have a hard day at work, sometimes you just need space and time to process without having witnesses,\u201d Andre says. \u201cBut then you can\u2019t, because you have eyes all around you.\u201d",
      "The lack of privacy doesn't just affect comfort. It can actively shape behavior. Contestants must constantly consider how their actions will be perceived by both their fellow Islanders and the viewing public. The result can be emotional shutdown rather than emotional regulation.",
      "For contestants from marginalized groups, this scrutiny carries additional weight. Black women on the show face particular pressure around public perception, which can affect everything from their romantic choices to their physical expressions of affection, Andre says.",
      "\u201cBlack women can\u2019t go on this show and sleep with any of these people or any of these men, because of the public perception around Black women and being overly sexualized,\u201d Andre says.",
      "She cites contestants Olandria Carthen and Chelley Bissainthe, who appeared on Keke Palmer's podcast, \"Baby, This is Keke Palmer,\" on July 22 and spoke to this perception.",
      "During the episode, Palmer asked the former Islanders how often they feel they had to \"tone down\" their emotions and reactions to events in the villa as Black women.",
      "\"It's taken out of context, and I'm a bad guy and I'm a mean girl,\" Olandria responded. \"It\u2019s very exhausting to say the least. I truly feel like initially I had to tone down a lot to not cross over that boundary because a person that looks the opposite of us, as soon as they get emotional it\u2019s like, \u2018Oh, we\u2019re going to cater to this person.\u2019 It\u2019s like bro, what about us? I don\u2019t understand.\"",
      "The 'Challenges'",
      "While \"Love Island\" occasionally includes what Andre calls \"wholesome activities\" that can mirror real relationship milestones, such as family day, some viewers are here for prime reality TV drama. Enter: the challenges.",
      "While many feature elaborate props, costumes and kissing, some can expose interpersonal rifts. For example, the \"Stand on Business\" challenge encouraged contestants to anonymously call out other Islanders, while \u201cHate to Burst Your Bubble\" involved Islanders sorting each other in categories like \"most genuine,\" before revealing how viewers at home ranked them.",
      "Andre says while these challenges are entertaining for the viewer, they can cause emotional harm to the islanders participating in them. She uses Season 7's infamous Heart Rate challenge, which involves Islanders dressing in costume and acting out to try and raise their fellow contestants' heart rates the most, as an example.",
      "\"These situations \u2014 do they really have the time to process?\" Andre says. \"Granted, they\u2019re with each other 24 hours a day, but do they have the capacity and the space to process?\"",
      "The Heart Rate challenge led to a feud between Huda Mustafa and Chelley, after several people in the villa thought Huda went too far while dancing with Ace, the other half of Chelley's couple.",
      "\"'Wow, we just had this experience, and I\u2019m in this relationship, but there are some things that happened in that challenge that made me feel, you know, really jealous, or I felt very humiliated,'\" Andre explains of how Islanders may process these situations. \"'You\u2019re saying that you\u2019re really feeling me, or you love me, but then someone else was kissing up on you, and I don\u2019t know how to react to that, right?'\"",
      "Reality Check: Transitioning Back to the Real World",
      "Perhaps the most significant psychological challenge may come after the cameras stop rolling, when contestants must process an intense, highly controlled experience while navigating new relationships under public scrutiny.",
      "\u201cThey\u2019re still processing the whole experience,\u201d Andre says.",
      "The villa\u2019s emotional intensity, combined with challenges that may have triggered feelings of jealousy or humiliation, would require serious psychological work to unpack.",
      "Add in the pressures of newfound fame, social media attention and public investment in their relationships, and it\u2019s no wonder \"Love Island\" couples can struggle post-villa.",
      "\u201cIf they\u2019re really down for the cause and down for the relationship, I would imagine they\u2019re in therapy,\u201d Andre says."

    "summary": "\"The Hunting Wives\" author May Cobb weighs in on viral theories about the book and how it came to be. She also comments on Margo and Sophie's relationship.",
    "story": [
      "\"The Hunting Wives\" is now a Netflix phenomenon, a star-studded series about southern housewives behaving badly \u2014\u00a0and they're packing more than booze and gossip.",
      "But it all began with a story author May Cobb's mother told her once, while they were driving down the blacktop roads of Longview, her Texas hometown. Cobb's eventual 2021 novel, \"The Hunting Wives,\" went on to inspire the series, first produced for Starz.",
      "\"My mom is such a good storyteller. She started telling me how in high school some of the rich boys would invite her to something called 'the hunting party,'\" Cobb says, speaking to TODAY.com. \"Basically, they would go out to the roofs of their giant cars and try to shoot small game.\"",
      "Cobb, hearing the story, immediately thought of everything that could go wrong with the scenario, and there was a lot. Then it clicked: She wanted to write a novel about it.",
      "\"But I want to swap out the rich boys for women. I want to subvert to 'Texas boys club' and let the women behave badly for a change,\" she remembers thinking.",
      "It's the story of Sophie (Brittany Snow in the series), a Texas transplant who becomes enmeshed in a dynamic friend group in her new town. When a teenage girl winds up dead, they're implicated, although the ending in Cobb's novel is different.",
      "Cobb set the story in a town like the one she grew up in, two hours east of Dallas, in a part of Texas close to the Louisiana border. She describes it as \"eerily beautiful noir,\" a place where Spanish moss hangs from trees and everyone knows everyone's name and history.",
      "She calls the character of Margo, portrayed by Malin \u00c5kerman in the show, a risk-taking and boundary-pushing woman whom Sophie befriends, an \"archetypal east Texas woman\" in the book, but also in the show.",
      "\"It's a party town. The people from my town are high-spirited and fun. I remember one of my editor's notes was, 'Do people drink this much?' And I said, 'I actually toned it down,'\" she says, laughing.",
      "She wanted the book to feel like a \"train wreck\" and a \"downward spiral.\" She was writing when her son was a little kid, and since she was no longer going out for ladies' nights, put the feeling of nights out in the book.",
      "\"I think I went a little too far, but it was so much fun to, like, skew that moral compass and not have to worry about it at all,\" she says.",
      "Cobb stands by her book's morally gray female characters, who party until the late hours and have affairs with high schoolers \u2014 and each other.",
      "\u201cI got a fair amount of backlash when the book came out, and I was honestly shocked. I was like, \u2018Wow, that\u2019s not why I read novels. I read them to escape, to go on an adventure, and I love a good train wreck,\u2019\u201d she says. \u201cI feel like, \u2018Who am I to judge?\u2019\u201d",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s funny. Nobody ever got mad at the women being murderers. They were mad about the misbehaving,\u201d she says.",
      "She no longer lives in Longview, Texas, but she knows people in the town are theorizing about how real people might have inspired the book.",
      "\"I've heard there's group chats. And I'm like, 'Guys, I'm a professional author. These characters are fictional.' I'm not foolish enough to write about anyone that's real from there,\" she says, laughing. (The landscape continues to inspire her: Her upcoming book, \"All the Little Houses,\" is set in Longview.)",
      "'Hunting Wives' Author May Cobb Weighs in on Fan Theories \u2014 Including About Sophie and Margo",
      "Speaking of theories: Since the series's first season dropped, there have been many. Cobb is an executive producer for the show, but even then, some of the theories surprise her.",
      "THEORY: Sophie fired the kill shot at Abby. Then Margo finished the job. \"My knee-jerk reaction would be to say, 'No, it was Margo.' But that's kind of fun.\" THEORY: Jill hit Abby with her car, which is why she was limping. \"Wow. Interesting. Hm. Well, all of this could be such good fodder for Season 2. I don't even know where this part of the internet lives.\"THEORY: Sophie is reading a book on her nightstand called 'The Wide Window,' a Lemony Snicket book about someone being watched. Is she being watched? \"I feel like that's just a happy accident with, like, that's her son's book. That's just me, though that's a really clever \u2014 I love all this.\"THEORY: Graham (played by Evan Jonigkeit in the show) did not leave Sophie: He was abducted. \"No, absolutely not. He was not abducted.\"",
      "THEORY: Sophie fired the kill shot at Abby. Then Margo finished the job. \"My knee-jerk reaction would be to say, 'No, it was Margo.' But that's kind of fun.\"",

      "There is one theory, however, she agrees with, and it's about the nature of Margo and Sophie's relationship. Many \"Hunting Wives\" fans are rooting for Sophie and Margo's romance.",
      "Cobb is, too. \"I do hope they wind up together and ride off into the sunset,\" she says. \"Margo and Sophie forever. Why not?\"",
      "She's hoping for a Season 2 of the show. But for now, she's enjoying where she landed.",
      "This book was her \u201cHail Mary pass,\u201d coming at a crossroads, when she felt like she was at the end of her writing career. She wrote it in a four-month \u201cstate of euphoria,\u201d not plotting it out but rather letting the story carry her. Since then, Cobb has published three books.",
      "\"Those wicked women have been the gift that keeps giving. God bless the hunting wives,\" she says."

      "At the 67th Grammy Awards, Wallen was nominated for his duet with Post Malone, \u201cI Had Some Help,\u201d for best country duo/group performance and best country song. Wallen has never been nominated for any work on his solo albums.",

      "But Drake has had a longstanding history with the National Academy of Recording Arts & Sciences, receiving five Grammys and 55 nominations over the years. He also served as both performer and presenter prior to his critiques.",
      "The \u201cFamily Matters\u201d rapper\u2019s criticism of the Grammys began in 2017, when his hit \u201cHotline Bling\u201d won best rap song and best rap/sung performance. Drake slammed the Grammys for categorizing the song as rap, as opposed to pop.",
      "\u201cI\u2019m a Black artist, I\u2019m apparently a rapper, even though \u2018Hotline Bling\u2019 is not a rap song,\u201d Drake said during in an interview with U.K. DJ Semtex. \u201cThe only category that they can manage to fit me in is in a rap category, maybe because I\u2019ve rapped in the past or because I\u2019m black. I can\u2019t figure out why.\u201d",
      "In 2019, the last time Drake attended the Grammys, he accepted the award for best rap song for \u201cGod\u2019s Plan\u201d and gave a pointed acceptance speech about how he and the other artists there that night \u201cplay in an opinion-based sport, not a factual-based sport.\u201d",
      "After his album \u201cCertified Lover Boy\u201d was nominated in 2022 for best rap album and his single \u201cWay 2 Sexy\u201d was nominated for best rap performance, Drake asked the Recording Academy to remove his work from the nominations. The Academy honored Drake\u2019s request and the rapper didn\u2019t attend the awards show.",
      "In 2023, although Drake refused to submit his 2022 album, \u201cHonestly, Nevermind,\u201d or any of its songs for consideration by the Grammys, he received four nominations. Once again, however, Drake boycotted the awards show.",
      "In 2024, Drake received four Grammy nominations for his joint 2022 album with 21 Savage, \u201cHer Loss.\u201d Per the Grammys, Drake \u201csubmitted material for nomination for the 2024 GRAMMYs,\u201d but the rapper, who did not attend that year, ultimately did not take home an award.",

      "After his his \u201cBlinding Lights\u201d and \u201cAfter Hours\u201d were snubbed from nominations at the 2021 ceremony, The Weeknd announced he would not submit his work to Recording Academy.",
      "He told The New York Times at the time that he will \u201cno longer allow my label to submit my music to the Grammys\u201d due to \u201csecret committees\u201d involved in the nomination process.",
      "From 2022 to 2024, the singer boycotted the award show, until an unexpected return this past year, when the Weeknd sang \u201cCry For Me\u201d and \u201cTimeless\u201d with Playboi Carti from his new album, \u201cHurry Up Tomorrow.\u201d",
      "Irish singer-songwriter and activist Sin\u00e9ad O\u2019Connor first performed at the Grammys in 1989, just two years before writing an open letter to the Recording Academy, criticizing \u201cfalse and destructive materialistic values.\u201d",
      "Just a year prior to O\u2019Connor\u2019s pointed \u201cSNL\u201d performance, during which she destroyed a photo of Pope John Paul II on live television, she dropped her planned Grammys performance and published an open letter in 1991.",
      "Directing her message to both the Academy and the industry at large, O'Connor wrote, per the Los Angeles Times, \u201cThey acknowledge mostly the commercial side of art. They respect mostly material gain, since that is the main reason for their existence. And they have created a great respect among artists for material gain--by honoring us and exalting us when we achieve it, ignoring for the most part those of us who have not.\u201d",
      "O\u2019Connor won the best alternative music performance Grammy in 1991 for her album, \u201cI Do Not Want What I Haven\u2019t Got,\u201d but refused to accept the award, marking the first time in Grammys history that an artist rejected a win.",
      "O\u2019Connor's letter led to waves of artists refusing to attend the awards show.",
      "When best rap performance by a duo or group was not televised at the 1991 Grammys \u2014 following the award show's history of not televising wins in the rap category \u2014 nominee Public Enemy decided to boycott the show and released their own statement, via their label head Russell Simmons, that year.",
      "When Living Colour guitarist Vernon Reid accepted the 1991 win for Best Hard Rock Performance, he donned a T-shirt displaying a giant photo of O\u2019Connor.",
      "In 2022, Bruno Mars told Rolling Stone that he and Anderson .Paak, who together make up R&B duo Silk Sonic, withdrew their album, \u201cAn Evening with Silk Sonic\u201d from Grammys consideration.",
      "\u201cWe truly put our all on this record, but Silk Sonic would like to gracefully, humbly and most importantly, sexually, bow out of submitting our album this year,\u201d Mars told the outlet. \u201cWe hope we can celebrate with everyone on a great year of music and partake in the party. Thank you for letting Silk Sonic thrive.\u201d",
      "The two artists did not attend the 2023 ceremony.",
      "Mars has received 33 Grammy nominations and 16 wins. His last win was at this past year\u2019s ceremony in best pop duo/group performance for \u201cDie With a Smile,\u201d his duet with Lady Gaga.",
      "Why Are Artists Removing Themselves From Grammy Consideration?",
      "While some artist have removed their work from future considerations after past snubs, others have took a stronger stance against the Recording Academy.",
      "While Drake has been vocal about his message that a Grammy win \u201cdoesn\u2019t dictate s---- in our world\u201d as an artist, he has also made reference to his frustration with the Grammys in his music. In his 2023 collaboration with J. Cole, \u201cFirst Person Shooter,\u201d Drake boasts, \u201cI told Jimmy Jam I use a Grammy as a door stop.\u201d",
      "When The Weeknd refused to submit his work for Grammys consideration in 2021, he referred to \u201csecret committees\u201d involved in the nomination process when talking to The New York Times.",
      "In O'Connor's 1991 open letter to the Recording Academy, she wrote that they \u201cacknowledge mostly the commercial side of art. They respect mostly material gain, since that is the main reason for their existence.\u201d She added that the industry has \u201ccreated a great respect among artists for material gain--by honoring us and exalting us when we achieve it, ignoring for the most part those of us who have not.\u201d",
      "In response, per the LA Times, former president of the Academy Michael Greene, said they \u201capplaud that Sinead feels so strongly about these issues and believe that her convictions only add to the seriousness of her work,\u201d while suggesting she \u201cmay be misguided.\u201d",
      "\u201cI\u2019m afraid that Sinead may not be properly informed about the difference between the overtly commercial aspects of popularity contests as opposed to the Grammys, which are voted on by the creative community.\u201d",
      "In a later interview with LA Times, however, O\u2019Connor said, despite directing the letter to the Academy, she was \u201cnot criticizing the Grammys in particular,\u201d clarifying, \u201cI am criticizing the music industry. I am criticizing my peers . . . artists who are not doing their job.\u201d"

      "Among the photos was a solo snap of her younger brother, Christopher Schwarzenegger, months after he got candid about his weight loss. In the photo, he was leaning against the side of the boat while on his phone, donning a short-sleeved white button down and a pair of salmon shorts.",
      "Katherine Schwarzenegger shared several more pictures from the day, including multiple snaps of her husband, Chris Pratt. She also included photos posing with her mom, Maria Shriver, uncle, Anthony Shriver and cousin, Joey Shriver.",

We introduced him always to the gym and all of that kind of stuff,\u201d he added. \u201cAnd then, out of nowhere, he decided that he wanted to be lean. And now he is. So that is of course fantastic, the self-discipline and the self-motivation. I always felt one day it will have to come from him \u2014 and it did.\u201d",

      "\u201cIt\u2019s not an overnight thing, but it took a lot of trial and error,\u201d he said of his weight loss. \u201cAnd even still to this day ... when you\u2019re saying, oh, before and after photos ... I don\u2019t feel like I\u2019m an after yet. I don\u2019t feel like I\u2019m at the point.\u201d",
      "Christopher Schwarzenegger also discussed what lifestyle changes helped him lose weight, including how he was able to cut bread out of his diet after giving up the food for Lent.",
      "\u201cI was like, \u2018Well, if I\u2019m giving up bread, I might as well just take the opportunity and I\u2019m a good Catholic boy, so I\u2019m not going to break it,\u2019\u201d he explained. \u201cAnd that was my one rule.

      "In an Aug. 18 Instagram post, the Humane Society of the Pikes Peak Region in Colorado Springs shared several photos of adoptable cats along with which \u201cSex and the City\u201d character they were most like, and why.",
      "The post was accompanied by a hilarious caption to mark the end of the show\u2019s sequel series, \u201cAnd Just Like That,\u201d which concluded Aug. 14.",
      "\u201cAnd Just Like That has finally come to an end, which means we\u2019ll never again witness Carrie Bradshaw chain-smoking in a tutu while making life-ruining decisions in $500 shoes,\u201d the caption read in part. \u201cTragic. But dry your martini glass tears, because the three orange cats who run this account have graciously taken it upon themselves to entertain you by categorizing our shelter cats as Carries, Mirandas, Charlottes, and Samanthas.\u201d",
      "The Humane Society of the Pikes Peak Region boasted that the selections were \u201cscientifically accurate results,\u201d adding, \u201cWe will not be taking questions. You are what you are (and let\u2019s be real, you\u2019re probably a Miranda).\u201d",
      "Despite that, Carrie Bradshaw took home the win with four cats meeting the criteria of New York City\u2019s resident dating columnist-turned novelist.",
      "For orange cat Stevie, it's due to a complete disregard for understanding \u2014 and learning anything about \u2014 money, being the \u201chot party girl despite being deeply weird\u201d and calling her boyfriend at three in the morning to \u201cyell at him about nothing.\u201d",
      "Pop Tart brings \u201cpure unhinged chaos\u201d to the party, while Ashlynn has uncontainable \u201ctruly bizarre energy\u201d and makes \u201cderanged\u201d statements she thinks are \u201cprofound\u201d thoughts. As for Astrid, well, the Humane Society of the Pikes Peak Region said \u201cno further explanation\u201d was needed.",
      "Penelope, Kitty and Bubba were all deemed Mirandas for their more pragmatic nature.",
      "Case in point, much like Miranda Hobbes, Penelope is \u201cjudgmental, but usually right\u201d and needs a \u201cchill, patient person to balance\u201d her out. Kitty has low tolerance for \u201cstupid people\u201d and may seem like a \u201cgirlboss on the surface\u201d though all she wants is to \u201ccuddle on the couch with takeout,\u201d while Bubba is seeking a partner who is \u201cextremely non-clingy.\u201d",
      "Charlotte York is embodied by Chyna, Midnight and Jericko.",
      "Chyna is the type who \u201cwould dump someone instantly over the wrong china pattern\u201d and doesn\u2019t have a problem \u201cacting helpless\u201d to get more attention. Midnight is a \u201chopeless romantic\u201d (derogatory) who \u201cdesperately need a nice, stable bald man\u201d to keep him grounded. Jericko holds a secret disco obsession and binge-watches Elizabeth Taylor documentaries to get her out of a slump.",
      "Only two cats embodied the elusive essence of Samantha Jones: Fairweather Fred and Purrpuss. Fairweather Fred emanates \u201cmagnetic energy,\u201d can ruin a mimosa at brunch with a shocking statement but is \u201csecretly the kindest and most stable friend.\u201d",
      "Purrpuss has a similar vibe, including the ability to throw a martini at someone and carry on as if nothing happened, lie about his age (but get away with it) and is \u201ctoo cool for most people\u201d while letting them know it.",
      "In the comments section, Instagram users reveled in the silly post, with another rescue writing, \u201chow do you even come up with these ideas.\u201d",
      "\u201cBig, big (no, not *that* \u201cBig\u201d) kudos to the copywriter\u2026 who is SLAYING,\u201d another Instagram user wrote.",
      "Another user wrote, \u201cHeavy on the JUDGEMENTAL BUT USUALLY RIGHT.\u201d",
      "And when one user commented, \u201cHot take: all cats are Mirandas \u2014 always providing side-eye,\u201d the Humane Society of the Pikes Peak Region had the perfect comeback.",
      "\u201cWe don\u2019t know about that,\u201d the response read. \u201cWe\u2019ve got a lot of Carries that are not aware enough of their surroundings to give side eye.\u201d"

      "\"You know when you're in your 20s, you try to, I don't know, you almost try to do what wasn't trendy. Because a lot of the trends were, I'm sorry, they were awful,\" she said. \"I just wanted to be my own self, and I was also very into recycling and showing people that you can look good and not spend a ton of money.",
      "\"Things are not meant to be worn only once,\" added Ryder. \"That was what always drove me nuts about the events. I remember re-wearing things a lot and apparently that was looked down upon sometimes. I thought it was a great thing.\""

      "Australia on Tuesday accused Iran of directing at least two antisemitic attacks in the country, expelling the Iranian ambassador to Canberra in response.",
      "Prime Minister Anthony Albanese said Australia\u2019s domestic spy agency had \u201ccredible intelligence\u201d that Iran was behind two attacks on Jewish sites in Melbourne and Sydney last year, part of a series of what Albanese called \u201cappalling\u201d acts of antisemitism in the country since the Israel-Hamas war began almost two years ago.",
      "\u201cThese were extraordinary and dangerous acts of aggression orchestrated by a foreign nation on Australian soil,\u201d Albanese told reporters, adding that it was considered likely that Iran had directed other attacks as well.",
      "\u201cThey were attempts to undermine social cohesion and sow discord in our community,\u201d he said. \u201cIt is totally unacceptable, and the Australian government is taking strong and decisive action in response.\u201d",
      "In addition to expelling the Iranian ambassador, Australia has closed its embassy in Iran, with all of its diplomats already out of the country, Albanese said. He said the Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps, an elite military force loyal to Iran\u2019s supreme leader, would also be listed as a terrorist organization.",
      "The Israeli Embassy in Australia welcomed the designation as a \u201cstrong and important move.\u201d",
      "\u201cIran\u2019s regime is not only a threat to Jews or Israel, it endangers the entire free world, including Australia,\u201d the embassy said in a statement on X.",
      "Albanese said the Australian Security Intelligence Organization had assessed that Iran was behind last year\u2019s Oct. 20 attack on Lewis\u2019 Continental Kitchen in Sydney and Dec. 6 attack on the Adass Israel Synagogue in Melbourne. The two arson attacks caused significant property damage, but no injuries were reported.",
      "Australian intelligence official Mike Burgess said that while not all of the country\u2019s antisemitic incidents are tied to Iran, authorities are investigating whether Tehran was involved in other cases.",
      "No Iranian diplomats or embassy staff in Australia were involved in the attacks, he said.",
      "This is the first time since World War II that Australia has expelled an ambassador, Foreign Minister Penny Wong said, adding that the country will maintain \u201csome diplomatic lines\u201d with Tehran to \u201cadvance the interests of Australians.\u201d",
      "Australia has struggled to address a surge in antisemitic attacks on homes, schools, synagogues and vehicles since the Israel-Hamas war began on Oct. 7, 2023, with a terrorist attack on Israel during which Hamas-led militants killed about 1,200 people and abducted 251 others.",
      "The war has since killed more than 62,000 people in the Hamas-run Gaza Strip, according to the local health ministry, whose numbers are considered credible by the United Nations and other international experts.",
      "Last week, the world\u2019s leading authority on hunger declared there was a famine in Gaza City, where Israel is pushing ahead with a new military offensive. Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu rejected the report\u2019s findings as a \u201clie\u201d and said Israel \u201cdoes not have a policy of starvation.\u201d",
      "The war has been deeply divisive in Australia, where thousands of people joined pro-Palestinian rallies across the country on Sunday.",
      "Albanese, who said Netanyahu was \u201cin denial\u201d about the humanitarian crisis in Gaza, said this month that Australia would join a growing list of Western governments in recognizing a Palestinian state. Netanyahu responded by calling Albanese \u201ca weak politician who betrayed Israel,\u201d saying his political record had been \u201ctarnished forever.\u201d",

    "story": [
      "MAALE ADUMIM, West Bank \u2014 The sun-starched strip of sand and brush doesn\u2019t look like much, but if you squint, you can almost glimpse the dreamscape of a future Palestinian capital.",
      "\u201cThese spare lands mean that we can build our parliament, we can build our future institutions,\u201d Khalil Toufakji, a Palestinian expert on geography and settlement expansion, told NBC News earlier this month as he gestured across the controversial \u201cEast 1,\u201d or E1, section of the occupied West Bank.",
      "\u201cIf Israel builds here, it means that everything is finished at the same time,\u201d the 76-year-old expert on Israeli settlements said at an overlook in the Israeli settlement of Maale Adumim. \u201cThis means that Jerusalem is surrounded from everywhere. \u2026 It means that there is no Palestinian geographic continuity between the north and south.\u201d",
      "The almost 5 square miles of land may seem undesirable and the conflict around it theoretical, but both Israel and the Palestinians regard the area\u2019s fate with the same sense of urgency.",
      "So when Israeli authorities approved the development of 3,400 homes last week, ultranationalist lawmakers celebrated what they saw as the death knell for a nascent Palestinian state and an acceleration of plans for Israel to annex the whole of the West Bank.",
      "The development \u201cpractically erases the two-state delusion and consolidates the Jewish people\u2019s hold on the heart of the Land of Israel,\u201d Bezalel Smotrich, Israel\u2019s far-right finance minister, told a news conference when he announced his approval of the plans.",
      "\u201cNow they declare it clearly and they don\u2019t need to hide it,\u201d said Shawan Jabarin, the general director of Al-Haq, a Palestinian human rights organization based in the West Bank. \u201cIt doesn\u2019t need philosophers and intellectuals to analyze. They speak about it themselves: \u2018This is to kill any possibility of a Palestinian state.\u2019\u201d",
      "Since the plan was tabled in the early 1990s, Israeli authorities and Jewish settlers like Smotrich have expounded upon the practical needs for new development as Jerusalem has become too crowded and environmental regulations have forbidden new building in the west of the city, which mostly belongs to Israel.",
      "But Palestinians say the area, which straddles the enormous Maale Adumim Jewish settlement and the Palestinian-majority east Jerusalem, is the only undeveloped land that might host government buildings for a new state.",
      "The construction would also split the West Bank in two, again fracturing an incipient Palestinian state already divided between the West Bank and the Gaza Strip, where almost 63,000 people have been killed since Oct. 7, 2023, according to the enclave\u2019s health ministry. Israel launched its military campaign after the Hamas-led terror attacks that day, which killed 1,200 people and saw around 250 taken hostage.",
      "After almost 23 months of war, the country has faced mounting criticism about its conduct from traditional Western allies like the U.K., France and Canada, which have recently made conditional offers to recognize a Palestinian state, unless Israel revives talks to achieve that and agrees to a ceasefire in Gaza.",
      "Those countries were among 21 that criticized the E1 development plans as a \u201cviolation of international law\u201d in a statement Friday. \u201cWe condemn this decision and call for its immediate reversal in the strongest terms,\u201d it read. British Foreign Minister David Lammy also called Tzipi Hotovely, Israel\u2019s ambassador to the U.K., to raise his objections.",
      "But the recognition of a Palestinian state is seen by some Israeli politicians as rewarding Hamas, leading them to view the E1 proposals as a deliberate broadside against longtime allies whose statements are increasingly drifting away from their country.",
      "\u201cIn the eyes of the right wing of Israeli politics, this is diplomatic pushback,\u201d said David Weinberg, a fellow at the Misgav Institute for National Security and Zionist Strategy. \u201cBut it\u2019s diplomatic pushback that\u2019s already on top of what have long been salient reasons, good reasons, for Israel wanting to build on E1.\u201d",
      "But for the Israeli right, the resounding triumph of President Donald Trump\u2019s return to the White House has drowned out such protests.",
      "\u201cThe E1 plan was initiated three decades ago and it was always blocked due to American pressure,\u201d said Lior Amihai, the executive director of Peace Now, an Israeli advocacy organization. \u201cNow under Trump, they\u2019re approving it. So certainly the lack of American resistance \u2026 enabled the Israeli government to approve it.\u201d",
      "The White House did not return a request for comment from NBC News about the E1 development.",
      "Upon retaking office, Trump lifted Biden-era sanctions on Israeli settlers who had been implicated in repeated violence against Palestinians in the West Bank.",
      "In his first term, he moved the U.S. Embassy to Jerusalem and recognized all of the city as Israel\u2019s capital. Most countries consider east Jerusalem to be occupied territory and do not recognize Israeli sovereignty. Israel, which captured east Jerusalem, including the Old City, from Jordan in the 1967 Middle East war, deems it as its eternal, indivisible capital.",
      "So far this year, Israel has approved 25,000 settlement housing units in the West Bank, Amihai said, far surpassing the record of 12,000 units during the whole of 2020 \u2014 a massive increase Amihai credited in part to Trump because his administration had created \u201can environment where it\u2019s easier for this government,\u201d because \u201cthey don\u2019t have to hide anything, they can say it vocally out loud.\u201d",
      "The additional units will accommodate the burgeoning growth of the 700,000 settlers the United Nations estimates already live in the West Bank in settlements widely considered illegal under international law.",
      "Even as the E1 plan slogged through decades of bureaucratic and diplomatic obstacles, Israeli officials prepared the land some of their countrymen refer to as Judea and Samaria, using the biblical term, with a clear intention to develop it.",
      "The Samaria and Judea Police District headquarters relocated there in 2008. Highways and other roadworks connecting Jerusalem and Maale Adumim\u2019s infrastructure to the same largely uninhabited land have also been installed.",
      "Once housing there is finished, Palestinian observers say the area will become closed to their community. Even those simply driving through from the Palestinian provisional capital of Ramallah to the southern West Bank town of Bethlehem will probably have to seek longer routes, they say.",
      "Such detours shouldn\u2019t preclude further agreements between Palestinians and Israelis, Weinberg said, even as he dismissed the notion of a Palestinian state under current circumstances.",
      "\u201cInstead of battering Israel, the West should be advancing realistic space-saving arrangements for Judea and Sumeria,\u201d he said. \u201cIsrael\u2019s need to build on E1 does not need to be a bar to an agreement with a serious Palestinian government.\u201d",
      "Yet the Israeli right wing has made its intentions known, Jabarin said. Such a sudden, strenuous assault on Palestinian statehood \u2014 particularly with American blessings \u2014 will require more than diplomatic rhetoric to reverse.",
      "\u201cWording there, condemnations here \u2014 it doesn\u2019t make any change,\u201d he said. \u201cIt will not push Israel back in any way.\u201d"

      "The case, involving a person who had recently traveled to El Salvador, was confirmed to be screwworm by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention and the Maryland Health Department on Aug. 4.",
      "The Maryland Health Department said in a statement Monday that the resident has recovered \"from the infection, and the investigation confirmed there is no indication of transmission to any other individuals or animals.\"",
      "\"This is the first human case of travel-associated New World screwworm myiasis (parasitic infestation of fly larvae) from an outbreak-affected country identified in the United States,\" HHS spokesperson Emily G. Hilliard said in a statement.",
      "\"The risk to public health in the United States from this introduction is very low,\" he said.",
      "The parasite \u2014 the larva of the New World screwworm fly \u2014 can devastate cattle herds and is rife in parts of Central America and Mexico. It can destroy wildlife and even kill household pets.",
      "There were serious outbreaks in the 1980s and the 1990s in Central America, and it was eradicated at great expense, only to return in the last two years.",
      "Agriculture Secretary Brooke L. Rollins traveled to Texas to announce a five-part plan to combat the screwworm on Aug. 15",
      "It includes plans to breed billions of sterile flies and dump them from the air over southern Texas and Mexico in the hope of stopping the parasite's spread.",
      "The sterilized male flies mate with females, but the eggs don't hatch. Eventually, the population reduces and dies out. The technique worked in the 1960s when the United States suffered its last screwworm outbreak.",
      "And the federal government may face calls to accelerate its work: When it was  first announced in June, the sterilization plan wasn't due to be operational for \"two to three years.\"",
      "Texas Gov. Greg Abbot, commenting on the federal government scheme, said the state agriculture industry, with its 2 million jobs, was worth $867 billion. \"All of this is at risk because of the New World screwworm,\" he said.",

      "The little parasitic flies \u2014 also known as Cochliomyia hominivorax \u2014 have an effect that's vast and devastating but in isolation quite disgusting. The females can lay eggs in any warm-blooded animal, which then hatch, unleashing hundreds of screwworm larvae, so-called because of their sharp mouths and their burrowing being compared to the motion of a screw.",
      "Human infections can be fatal but are rare, and most cases can be treated.",
      "The Agriculture Department has said screwworms have been making their way north into Mexico from other parts of Central America. The fly is endemic in Cuba, Haiti, the Dominican Republic and some South American nations, it said.",
      "Mexico reported a case in Ixhuatl\u00e1n de Madero, Veracruz, last month, 370 miles from the Texas border, prompting Health and Human Services to immediately shut down cross-border cattle trade, following similar stops in November and May."

      "But its new president, Lee Jae Myung, met with Trump on Monday touting a $150 billion offering whose name is sure to appeal to him: \u201cMake America Shipbuilding Great Again.\u201d",
      "The package, which South Korean officials also refer to as MASGA, includes building U.S. shipyards, training shipbuilding personnel and maintaining U.S. Navy ships.",
      "It\u2019s a key part of the last-minute trade deal South Korea struck last month with Trump, who says he wants to revitalize U.S. shipbuilding for both economic and national security reasons. Trade and security were high on the agenda at his summit with Lee, which came amid growing tensions with China and North Korea.",
      "A White House official said before the meeting that Trump \u201clooks forward to hosting\u201d Lee and that they would \u201cdiscuss North Korea, defense posture, trade barriers, maritime security, American shipbuilding, energy dominance, and more.\u201d",
      "Trump himself injected a note of uncertainty into the day\u2019s meeting Monday by posting on Truth Social: \u201cWHAT IS GOING ON IN SOUTH KOREA? Seems like a Purge or Revolution. We can\u2019t have that and do business there.\u201d",
      "It was not clear what Trump was referring to. Later, speaking to reporters at the White House during their meeting, Trump explained that he had \u201cheard from Intel that there was a raid on churches. We\u2019re going to talk about that later.\u201d",
      "After decades of industry decline, the United States now accounts for less than 1% of the global shipbuilding sector, according to the Rand national security think tank, compared with 50% for China, 30% for South Korea and 10% for Japan. South Korean equipment, designs and knowledge could help put the United States back on the map.",

      "No 'bromance' expected",
      "The White House summit is an important opportunity for Lee to advocate South Korea\u2019s interests with Trump after months of political instability created by former President Yoon Suk Yeol\u2019s botched declaration of martial law.",
      "Though Lee comes from a liberal party, he and Trump have much in common \u2014 both have been the subjects of assassination attempts, and both are more open to diplomacy with nuclear-armed North Korea than their predecessors.",
      "But they have very different outlooks on political, economic and foreign policy, which could make the summit challenging, said Bae Jong-chan, president of Insight K, a private think tank in Seoul.",
      "\u201cOne will not be able to expect bromance between President Lee and President Trump,\u201d he said in a phone interview Monday.",
      "The relationship has already been strained by Trump\u2019s tariffs on South Korea, the world\u2019s 10th-largest economy, which has a large trade surplus with the United States.",
      "Trump said last month that the U.S. tariff on South Korean imports would be 15%, down from the 25% he had threatened earlier. He said South Korea, which does not impose any tariffs on U.S. goods, managed to \u201cbuy down\u201d the U.S. tariff by promising $450 billion in U.S. investment and energy purchases, including the $150 billion shipbuilding fund.",
      "Jo said Lee is seeking to lock in the terms favorable to South Korea in the trade deal, which remains unwritten and largely unclear.",
      "\u201cI think he wants that to be firm and solid, to have at least some sense of predictability and stability in their economic relations,\u201d she said.",
      "Trickier are questions about South Korea\u2019s long-standing security alliance with the United States and its position on China.",
      "Trump wants South Korea to take more responsibility for its own defense, freeing up the almost 30,000 U.S. service members stationed there to focus more on containing China, Washington\u2019s biggest strategic rival.",
      "South Korea worries that such a shift could expose it more to threats from North Korea, as well as increase the chances it could be drawn into a potential U.S.-China conflict over Taiwan, the island democracy Beijing claims as its territory.",
      "Though Lee strongly supports the decades-old U.S.-South Korea alliance, he also has to balance relations with China, South Korea\u2019s main trading partner.",
      "On Sunday, a special envoy told Chinese Foreign Minister Wang Yi in Beijing that South Korea hopes to normalize relations with China after years of tension.",

      "France\u2019s foreign ministry said in a statement Sunday that it had summoned Charles Kushner to appear Monday over his criticism, which it said was \u201cunacceptable.\u201d",
      "It said that \u201cFrance firmly rejects these allegations\u201d and that French authorities have \u201cfully mobilized\u201d to combat the \"intolerable\" rise in antisemitic acts over the past two years.",
      "The French ministry said Kushner\u2019s allegations violated international law and the obligation not to interfere with the internal affairs of another country. \u201cThey also fall short of the quality of the transatlantic partnership between France and the United States and of the trust that must prevail between allies,\" it said.",
      "The episode is the latest sign of a growing divide between the United States and its longtime partners in Europe. It comes as Washington's close ally, Israel, increasingly clashes with Western countries amid fallout from its military assault on Gaza.",
      "\u201cAntisemitism has long scarred French life, but it has exploded since Hamas\u2019s barbaric assault on Oct. 7, 2023,\u201d Kushner wrote in an open letter in The Wall Street Journal on Sunday.",
      "\u201cPublic statements haranguing Israel and gestures toward recognition of a Palestinian state embolden extremists, fuel violence, and endanger Jewish life in France,\u201d added Kushner, who is Jewish.",
      "State Department spokesperson Tommy Pigott said Sunday evening that the State Department stood by Kushner\u2019s comments, according to The Associated Press. \u201cAmbassador Kushner is our U.S. government representative in France and is doing a great job advancing our national interests in that role,\u201d he said.",
      "France said last month that it plans to recognize a Palestinian state in September, while other traditional allies of Israel, such as Australia and Canada, have said they will do the same.",
      "Last week, Macron denounced Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu's accusations that the move was fueling antisemitism, calling the suggestion \"abject\" and \"erroneous.\"",
      "France is home to the largest Jewish population in Europe, with an estimated 500,000 Jews, the third-largest Jewish population in the world after Israel and the United States. That is about 1% of the national population.",
      "In his letter, Kushner said that French Jews are living in fear and that Macron should act decisively to protect them, adding that he stands ready to work with French leaders across the country to \u201cforge a serious plan that addresses the roots of antisemitism and defeats it.\u201d",
      "\u201cToday, many French Jews fear that history will repeat itself in Europe,\u201d he wrote.",

      "\u201cWe believe we\u2019ve already seen some significant concessions from both sides, just in the last few weeks,\u201d Vance said in an exclusive interview on NBC News\u2019 \u201cMeet the Press.\u201d",
      "Vance also weighed in on a Russian missile strike in western Ukraine overnight Thursday that hit an electronics factory owned by a U.S.-based company. Asked by moderator Kristen Welker if he was \u201cenraged\u201d by the strike, which the company said injured  several workers, Vance pivoted to a criticism of former President Joe Biden.",
      "\u201cI don\u2019t like it,\u201d Vance said of the assault. \u201cBut this is a war, and this is why we want to stop the killing. The Russians have done a lot of things that we don\u2019t like. A lot of civilians have died. We\u2019ve condemned that stuff from the get-go and, frankly, President Trump has done more to apply pressure and to apply economic leverage to the Russians, certainly, than Joe Biden did for 3 \u00bd years, when he did nothing but talk, did nothing to bring the killing to a stop. So you asked me what I\u2019m enraged by? What I\u2019m enraged by is the continuation of the war.\u201d",
      "Trump told reporters Friday that he was not happy about the strikes on western Ukraine and indicated that any peace deal between the countries could be weeks away.",
      "\u201cI think over the next two weeks, we\u2019re going to find out which way it\u2019s going to go,\u201d Trump said.",
      "During his interview with \u201cMeet the Press,\u201d Vance did not characterize the strike, and a number of other issues, as long-term hindrances to peace, saying there was still plenty of room for negotiation.",
      "\u201cWe\u2019re going to eventually be successful, or we\u2019ll hit a brick wall. And if we hit a brick wall, then we\u2019re going to continue this process of negotiation, of applying leverage,\u201d Vance added. \u201cThis is the energetic diplomacy that\u2019s going to bring this war to a close.\u201d",
      "Welker then asked Vance what the pressure is on Russia if the U.S. is not \u201cimposing new sanctions.\u201d",
      "\u201cHow do you get them to a place of getting to the table with Zelenskyy and stopping to drop bombs?\u201d she asked.",
      "Vance replied by saying Trump has applied \u201caggressive economic leverage,\u201d such as \u201csecondary tariffs on India, to try to make it harder for the Russians to get rich from their oil economy.\u201d",
      "Asked by Welker if he could guarantee that the U.S. would not send troops to help enforce any peace deal, Vance reaffirmed Trump\u2019s opposition to such a deployment.",
      "\u201cThe president has been very clear,\u201d Vance said. \u201cThere are not going to be boots on the ground in Ukraine. But we are going to continue to play an active role in trying to ensure that the Ukrainians have the security guarantees and the confidence they need to stop the war on their end and the Russians feel like they can bring the war to a conclusion on their end.\u201d",
      "The interview, which aired Sunday, comes amid new, heightened tensions in the effort to end the war.",
      "On Friday, Russia\u2019s top diplomat told NBC News that no meetings between Putin and Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy had been scheduled, raising further doubts about Trump\u2019s ability to mediate the conflict.",
      "Meanwhile, details about security guarantees for Ukraine \u2014 and Russia\u2019s role in shaping them \u2014 remain unresolved.",
      "In the interview, Vance said he doesn\u2019t believe the Russians are stringing Trump along.",
      "\u201cI think the Russians have made significant concessions to President Trump for the first time in 3 \u00bd years of this conflict,\u201d he added. \u201cThey\u2019ve actually been willing to be flexible on some of their core demands. They\u2019ve talked about what would be necessary to end the war.\u201d",
      "Trump, Vance added, stepped up efforts to negotiate a diplomatic solution \u201cbecause this war is not in anyone\u2019s interest. It\u2019s not in Europe or the United States\u2019 interest.\u201d",
      "While acknowledging some of the hurdles that have popped up since Trump\u2019s Aug. 15 meeting with Putin in Alaska, Vance expressed optimism that persistence would deliver results.",
      "\u201cThere are hills and valleys to the negotiations,\u201d Vance said. \u201cWe sometimes feel like we\u2019ve made great progress with the Russians, and sometimes, as the president has said, he\u2019s been very frustrated with the Russians. We\u2019re going to keep on doing what we have to do to bring this thing to a close. I don\u2019t think it\u2019s going to happen overnight. I think that we\u2019re going to continue to make progress. But, ultimately, whether the killing stops, that determination is going to belong to whether the Russians and Ukrainians can actually find some middle ground here.\u201d",
      "Putin has rejected calls \u2014 including from Trump before their recent meeting \u2014 for a ceasefire.",
      "\u201cI didn\u2019t say they conceded on everything,\u201d Vance said in the interview, referring to Russia. \u201cBut what they have conceded is the recognition that Ukraine will have territorial integrity after the war. They\u2019ve recognized that they\u2019re not going to be able to install a puppet regime in Kyiv. \u2026 Have they made every concession? Of course they haven\u2019t. Should they have started the war? Of course they [shouldn\u2019t have], but we\u2019re making progress.\u201d",
      "Asked about disagreements surrounding how involved Russia will be in establishing security guarantees for Ukraine, Vance asserted that \u201cthere\u2019s a little bit of talking past each other here.\u201d",
      "\u201cFirst of all, we\u2019re not talking about security guarantees until after the war has come to a close,\u201d Vance said. \u201cAnd, of course, the Russians are going to be a part of the conversation about bringing that war to a close. So, of course, they\u2019re going to have some stake in this.\u201d",
      "The interview with Vance also touched on several domestic issues, including new congressional maps passed by the Republican-controlled Texas House of Representatives that could pad the GOP\u2019s majority by as many as five seats. The issue has become a political flashpoint, with California Democrats preparing retaliatory moves and other states aiming to redraw maps, too.",
      "\u201cAll we\u2019re doing, frankly, is trying to make the situation a little bit more fair on a national scale,\u201d Vance said of GOP efforts. \u201cThe Democrats have gerrymandered their states really aggressively. We think there are opportunities to push back against that, and that\u2019s really all we\u2019re doing.\u201d",
      "On the subject of his own political ambitions, Vance again sidestepped questions about whether he sees himself as Trump\u2019s heir apparent in 2028, when the president is term-limited.",
      "\u201cI see myself as a vice president who\u2019s trying to do a good job for the American people ... and if I do a good job, and if the president continues to be successful, as I know that he will be, the politics will take care of itself,\u201d Vance said. \u201cWe can cross that bridge when we come to it.\u201d",
      "Welker asked if Vance has discussed the possibility with Trump.",
      "\u201cAs you know, the president talks about everything, and if it\u2019s in the news, the president and I have certainly discussed it,\u201d Vance replied. \u201cBut I think the president is just focused on doing a good job for the American people. He wants me to be focused on doing a good job for the American people. That\u2019s what I\u2019ll keep on doing.\u201d"

      "LONDON \u2014 Postal services across the world are halting shipments to the United States this week amid mounting confusion over new import duties that will apply to parcels starting Friday.",
      "President Donald Trump signed an executive order last month abolishing the trade loophole known as \u201cde minimis,\u201d which since 2016 had allowed goods worth up to $800 to enter the U.S. duty-free.",
      "The end of the exemption is being extended worldwide after the loophole was closed in May for packages from mainland China and Hong Kong.",
      "Under the new rules, personal gifts worth less than $100 will still be duty-free, but all other packages will face the same tariffs as standard imports from their country of origin.",
      "The planned policy shift, which operators say lacks clear procedures, has raised concerns about backlogs as services are put on hold.",
      "Postal providers in Belgium, Denmark and New Zealand are among several operators that have already suspended shipments of packages to the U.S. until they can retool their systems to comply with the new rules. Letters and documents are generally unaffected.",
      "Services in Germany, France, Britain and India have announced they will follow suit in the coming days.",
      "France\u2019s national postal service, La Poste, said in a statement that the U.S. did not provide full details or allow enough time to prepare for new customs procedures. New Zealand\u2019s postal service said parcel deliveries to all U.S. states and territories would be \u201ctemporarily unavailable until further notice\u201d while systems are updated to meet new U.S. customs requirements.",
      "DHL, one of the world\u2019s largest courier companies, said Friday that it will stop accepting parcels containing goods from business customers destined for the U.S. beginning Monday.",
      "The company cited unresolved \u201ckey questions\u201d about the process, including \u201chow and by whom customs duties will be collected in the future, what additional data will be required, and how the data transmission to the U.S. Customs and Border Protection will be carried out.\u201d",
      "DHL will, however, continue to deliver private parcels labeled as gifts valued under $100, in line with White House assurances.",
      "The White House said ending the duty-free exemption would help combat \u201cescalating deceptive shipping practices, illegal material, and duty circumvention,\u201d claiming some shippers had \u201cabused\u201d the exemption to send illicit drugs such as fentanyl into the U.S.",
      "It said the number of de minimis parcels jumped from 134 million in 2015 to more than 1.36 billion in 2024 as shippers \u201cdeceptively exploit the de minimis privilege in an effort to evade duties,  inspection, and U.S. law.\u201d",
      "Most of those packages came from mainland China and Hong Kong, which the Trump administration initially targeted as part of efforts to curb American shoppers from ordering low-value goods from China-linked retailers such as Temu and Shein.",
      "The White House briefly closed the loophole for mainland China and Hong Kong in February, but quickly extended the deadline to May 2 amid confusion over how the new duties would be collected."

      "The film, inspired by Chinese mythology, opened in more than 2,500 American theaters on Friday. It is the latest in a wave of successful animations featuring Asian culture, such as Netflix\u2019s recent hit \u201cKPop Demon Hunters.\u201d",
      "The sequel to a hit movie released in 2019, \u201cNe Zha II\u201d tells the story of a child demigod named Ne Zha who rebels against his innate devilry and chooses to use his magical powers and martial arts skills to defend humanity from dragons and other foes.",
      "Yeoh, a Malaysian actor and fluent Mandarin speaker, said she found it hard to follow the English subtitles during some of its more spectacular scenes when she first watched the movie in Hong Kong. She left the theater thinking it needed to be dubbed in English.",
      "She later received a call asking if she wanted to voice Lady Yin, Ne Zha\u2019s mother, for an English-dubbed version being distributed by A24. The New York-based independent film company is known for productions including \u201cMoonlight\u201d and \u201cEverything Everywhere All at Once,\u201d the 2022 film that made Yeoh the first Asian to win the Academy Award for best actress.",
      "\u201cHell yes,\u201d Yeoh said in response, calling the movie \u201ca beautiful way\u201d to cross the cultural bridge between East and West.",

      "Since its release in mainland China in January, \u201cNe Zha II\u201d has become the world\u2019s fifth-highest-grossing movie of all time, just behind James Cameron\u2019s \u201cTitanic.\u201d In February, it surpassed Pixar\u2019s \u201cInside Out 2\u201d as the world\u2019s highest-grossing animated film.",
      "It is also the first non-Hollywood film to exceed $2 billion in global earnings, most of which came from the Chinese box office.",
      "The movie \u2014 which is directed by Sichuan-born Yang Yu, also known as Jiaozi \u2014 has stoked national pride in China, with the state-run newspaper People\u2019s Daily praising its commercial success as the \u201cfruits of a confident nation.\u201d",
      "Many schools, state-owned companies and government entities across China have actively organized group viewings of \u201cNe Zha II\u201d in celebration of what they see as a milestone in Chinese animation.",
      "The success of \u201cNe Zha II\u201d is driven by both the maturation of China\u2019s animation industry and authorities\u2019 \u201cfull support\u201d for strengthening the country\u2019s soft power and cultural exports, said Zeng Hong, assistant professor at Hong Kong Baptist University\u2019s Academy of Film.",
      "Although the English-dubbed version may do better in the U.S. than the earlier Chinese-only release with English subtitles, which earned about $20 million, Zeng said that if \u201cNe Zha II\u201d succeeds with international viewers it is likely to stem more from its domestic acclaim and novelty than from genuine interest in Chinese mythology.",
      "Zeng said while she expects some reviews in the U.S. will criticize the film as Chinese propaganda, other viewers may just watch it out of curiosity.",
      "Kevin Ma, a veteran observer of the film industry who is based in Hong Kong, said another challenge \u201cNe Zha II\u201d faces in its latest release is the tight theatrical window in today\u2019s streaming-dominated market.",
      "New films may capture public attention for only one or two months before moving to streaming platforms, said Ma, who is also a film festival consultant.",
      "Even though \u201cNe Zha II\u201d came out only at the beginning of this year, it almost seems \u201clike a distant memory now\u201d because of consumers\u2019 \u201cshorter attention span\u201d in the streaming age, he said."

      "Israel's military is preparing to push ahead with a new operation to seize Gaza City that could displace hundreds of thousands of people and worsen the dire situation there. It has launched intense strikes on the city this week after announcing it had begun the first stage of its planned assault.",
      "Famine declared",
      "The IPC, an internationally recognized system for classifying food insecurity and malnutrition, said in its report that famine had been confirmed in the Gaza Governorate \u2014 and that it was projected to expand to the Deir al-Balah and Khan Younis Governorates farther south by the end of September if the humanitarian situation does not change.",
      "The number of people now experiencing famine in Gaza was nearly 514,000, the IPC said \u2014 around a quarter of the enclave's population. That was projected to rise to 641,000 by the end of September.",
      "\"Famine is a race against time,\" the IPC said. \"An immediate ceasefire and end to the conflict is critical to enabling an unimpeded, large-scale humanitarian response to save lives.\"",
      "The United Nations-backed body had up until now only declared famine on four other occasions since it was first established in 2004, most recently in Sudan last year.",
      "The report's findings were met with little surprise by global health authorities and humanitarian groups.",
      "\u201cFamine warnings have been clear for months,\u201d said Cindy McCain, executive director of the World Food Program.",

      "The IPC's 59-page report does not state that Israel has a policy of starvation in Gaza.",
      "Earlier, Israel's foreign ministry said the IPC had published a \u201cfabricated report to fit Hamas\u2019s fake campaign.\u201d It hit out at the IPC\u2019s methods, accusing it of having \u201ctwisted its own rules and ignored its own criteria.\u201d",

      "\"You know who IS starving? The hostages kidnapped and tortured by uncivilized Hamas savages,\" he said in a post on X early Friday.",
      "Famine, the highest phase of the IPC Acute Food Insecurity scale, is classified when an area has at least 20% of households facing an extreme lack of food; at least 30% of children suffering from acute malnutrition and at least two people or four children out of every 10,000 people are dying each day from starvation.",
      "But the bar can also be met if 15% of children are considered to be suffering from acute malnutrition based on mid-upper arm circumference with evidence of rapidly worsening underlying drivers, according to the IPC, which cited the latter practice in its report.",
      "The IPC said that this did not mean it had altered its threshold for famine, saying it used this method in line with established standards where a lack of other data is available, as it had also done in South Sudan.",
      "This \"does not represent a 'lowered threshold' in IPC methodology. Instead, it demonstrates the continued application of established IPC standards,\" it said.",
      "Israel has repeatedly denied reports of growing starvation in Gaza, while seeking to blame any hunger in the enclave on humanitarian groups and Hamas.",
      "The hunger crisis in Gaza intensified after Israel launched a blockade on March 2, in the middle of its ceasefire with Hamas, barring the entry of food and other vital supplies for more than two months. It lifted the blockade in May, but only allowed a basic amount of aid in for weeks after that.",
      "Data published by COGAT states that in the weeks since Israel lifted its blockade on May 19 to August 17, when the database was last updated, 9,165 trucks carrying aid entered the enclave, with food making up just over 95% of the supplies.",
      "That boils down to an average of around 100 trucks carrying aid per day during that time period. Prior to Israel\u2019s offensive in Gaza, around 500 trucks per day were entering the enclave, according to humanitarian groups.",
      "Israel threatens 'gates of hell'",
      "Israeli Defense Minister Israel Katz vowed Friday to open the \u201cgates of hell\u201d on Gaza City until Hamas agreed to Israel\u2019s conditions for ending the war, including the release of all hostages and the militant group's complete disarmament.",

      "Netanyahu said a day earlier that he had authorized the operation to take over Gaza City, while also revealing he had instructed \u201cimmediate negotiations\u201d to begin for a deal to end the war in Gaza and secure the release of the hostages who remain held in the enclave.",
      "The video statement followed days of silence after Hamas announced it had accepted a ceasefire proposal put forward by Arab mediators.",
      "The IPC\u2019s declaration comes just over three weeks after it warned that the \u201cworst-case scenario of famine\u201d was already unfolding in the Palestinian enclave under Israel\u2019s offensive and crippling aid restrictions \u2014 but it had emphasized the alert was not a formal famine classification.",
      "Aid groups have repeatedly warned in recent weeks there is still not enough food entering Gaza to stave off famine.",
      "The Palestinian health ministry in Gaza said on Monday it had recorded three new adult deaths \u201cdue to famine and malnutrition\u201d within a 24-hour period, bringing the total death toll from starvation to 266 people, including 112 children.",
      "Israel launched its offensive in Gaza following the Hamas-led Oct. 7, 2023, attacks, in which some 1,200 people were killed and around 250 taken hostage, according to Israeli tallies, marking a major escalation in a decades-long conflict.",
      "Since then, more than 62,000 people have been killed in Gaza, including thousands of children, according to the local Palestinian health ministry, with much of the territory destroyed.",

      "KCNA said Kim laid a flower on a memorial wall and paid a silent tribute at the ceremony, during which the national anthem was also played.",
      "The ceremony on Thursday came a week after Kim received a letter from Russian President Vladimir Putin that also described the North Korean troops as \u201cheroic.\u201d",
      "\u201cThe bonds of militant friendship, goodwill and mutual aid which were consolidated in the days of the war long ago remain solid and reliable even today,\u201d Putin said in the letter published by North Korean state media Voice of Korea.",
      "Pyongyang and Moscow have forged increasingly close ties after the Kremlin found itself diplomatically isolated following its February 2022 invasion of Ukraine. Kim and Putin signed a mutual defense pact last year, and experts say North Korea may have sent Russia troops in exchange for advanced military technology that would aid its nuclear and ballistic missile programs.",
      "Neither Russia nor North Korea confirmed the deployments until months after Pyongyang sent its first soldiers last fall. Though the two countries have not revealed the exact number of troops involved, it could be as high as 15,000, according to South Korean, U.S. and Ukrainian officials.",
      "Of those, about 600 are believed to have been killed, South Korea\u2019s spy agency said, and thousands more injured.",
      "Though North Korea has one of the largest militaries in the world, its troops have had little real-world combat experience since the end of the Korean War in 1953. But they are strongly loyal to Kim and are trained to take their own lives rather than surrender, former North Korean soldiers who defected have told NBC News.",
      "According to South Korean intelligence, there was at least one incident in which a North Korean soldier seeking to avoid capture by Ukrainian forces was killed while trying to detonate a grenade and shouting Kim\u2019s name.",
      "It is unclear how many North Korean troops remain on the frontlines. South Korean lawmakers said after an intelligence briefing in June that North Korea could deploy additional troops to Russia in July or August and that it was continuing to supply Moscow with arms."

      "The expanded campaign also throws ceasefire talks into question after Hamas said it had accepted a new proposal. Israel's defiance of global pressure has led to growing tensions with its allies, and it enters the Gaza City campaign while clashing publicly with major Western powers.",
      "\"I have come to approve the IDF\u2019s plans to take over Gaza City and defeat Hamas,\" Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said in a video statement Thursday. \"At the same time, I have instructed to begin immediate negotiations on the release of all our hostages and an end to the war on terms acceptable to Israel.\"",

      "\"Last time, I was displaced to the south, but this time there\u2019s no possibility for me to move, because our displacement is death \u2014 let\u2019s face it with honor next to our homes,\" he told the Reuters news agency. \"There is no safety, anyway. Israel is letting us go south, but there\u2019s no safe spaces.\""

      "KYIV, Ukraine \u2014 Ukraine has said that it expects rapid progress on the security guarantees its allies could provide in a peace deal with Russia but that one of the possible summit sites the United States is pursuing would be \"challenging.\"",
      "Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy urged swift progress as military officials from the United States and Europe crafted proposed plans ahead of negotiations.",
      "After Russia launched one of its biggest aerial attacks of the year overnight, Zelenskyy said Thursday that there was \"still no signal from Moscow that they truly intend to engage in substantive negotiations and end this war.\u201d",
      "Later, Russian Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov reiterated his government's longstanding demands that Ukraine be demilitarized and stop trying to be allied with the West.",
      "\"Ukraine would remain neutral, non-nuclear and non-aligned,\" Lavrov said at a news conference. He suggested that a meeting between Zelenskyy and Russian President Vladimir Putin depended on addressing those demands in advance and accused Kyiv and its allies of undermining Trump's efforts to secure a peace deal.",
      "\"The goals pursued by the current Ukrainian leadership \u2014 goals that are undoubtedly fueled by the Western sponsors of the Kyiv regime \u2014 are directed against the efforts being made by President Trump,\" he said.",
      "Later Thursday, the U.S. military announced that defense chiefs from Finland, France, Germany, Italy, the United Kingdom, Ukraine, the United States and the Supreme Allied Commander Europe met in Washington this week to develop \"military options to support negotiations.\"",
      "\"These options will be presented to each nation\u2019s respective national security advisors for appropriate consideration in ongoing diplomatic efforts,\" U.S. Joint Staff spokesperson Joseph Holstead said in a statement.",
      "Ukraine's commander-in-chief, Oleksandr Syrskyi, said in a statement Thursday that he had participated in the meeting by videoconferencing with the other military commanders.",
      "\"I am convinced that through joint efforts, with the political and diplomatic support of Ukraine\u2019s dedicated partners, we will be able to achieve a real peace and guarantee security for Ukraine and the whole of democratic Europe,\" he said.",
      "Trump has promised European leaders that the United States would help provide security guarantees in any settlement with Russia, a key concern for Kyiv. He has since made it clear that that would not include U.S. troops on the ground but has said it might involve air support.",
      "Once Kyiv has more clarity about what protections its allies are willing to offer, Zelenskyy said, he would then be ready to meet with Putin. And if Putin was not ready to meet, he said, he \u201cwould like to see a strong reaction from the United States.\"",
      "Where those talks might place has emerged as a possible stumbling block.",
      "The White House has pressed ahead with making arrangements despite some public reluctance from the Kremlin. The Hungarian capital, Budapest, and the Swiss city of Geneva were among the sites being discussed, a senior administration official told NBC News, as Washington sought to secure a location and date.",
      "But Zelenskyy said Wednesday that Budapest would be a \u201cchallenging\u201d venue for his first direct talks with Putin since the Kremlin launched its full-scale invasion.",
      "The meeting should take place in a neutral European country, he said, pointing to Hungarian Prime Minister Viktor Orb\u00e1n's close ties to the Kremlin and lack of support for Kyiv.",
      "\u201cSwitzerland, Austria \u2014 we agree,\u201d Zelenskyy told reporters, adding that Ukraine would also accept Turkey.",
      "Russia signaled Wednesday it was in no hurry for Putin and Zelenskyy to sit down together, with Lavrov saying, \u201cTalks must be prepared with the utmost care.\u201d",
      "Adding to the apparent lack of urgency in talks, Russia launched a massive aerial bombardment overnight that included nearly 600 drones and 40 missiles, Ukraine's air force said early Thursday.",
      "The strikes reached deep inside Ukraine, hitting an American business in the Western region of Zakarpattia, Zelenskyy said, and injuring at least 15 employees. At least one person was killed and two other people were injured in Lviv as dozens of residential buildings were destroyed, governor Maksym Kozytskyy wrote on Telegram.",
      "Zelenskyy said on X: \"The Russians carried out this attack as if nothing has changed at all, as if there are no global efforts to stop this war. This requires a response.\"",
