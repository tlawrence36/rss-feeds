      "The event had the feel of a costume party, rock concert and family reunion as fans clapped, laughed and shouted \u201cYes queen!\u201d",
      "NEW YORK -- To celebrate an upcoming milestone, Alyssa Math could think of nothing more fitting than front-row tickets to \u201cOnyx Storm\u201d author Rebecca Yarros' appearance at The Town Hall in Manhattan.",
      "\u201cI'm getting married next weekend, so this is my bachelorette party,\u201d said Math, an accountant who traveled with friends from her home near Annapolis, Maryland. She has been one of millions of admirers of Yarros' work and a year ago drove two hours to Reston, Virginia, to see the author.",
      "\u201cIt's a huge cult following,\u201d said Math, wearing a white veil in homage to one of Yarros' characters. \u201cThe drama (of her books) keeps you on the edge of your seat.\u201d",
      "Friday night at The Town Hall had the feel of a costume party, rock concert and family reunion as a capacity crowd of around 1,500 clapped, laughed and shouted, \u201cYes, Queen!\" The \u201cEmpyrean\u201d series has made Yarros one of the country's most popular and obsessed-about leaders of romantasy, a newly branded genre combinging romance and fantasy.",
      "\u201cOnyx Storm\u201d is the much-awaited third installment of a planned five centered on the lovers Violet and Xaden, and the first since the million-selling \u201cIron Flame\u201d came out in 2023. In its first week of publication, \"Onyx Storm\" has already topped the bestseller lists of Amazon and sold more than 300,000 copies just through Barnes & Noble, according to a spokesperson for the superstore chain.",
      "Yarros, interviewed for some 75 minutes by Olympic gymnast and avowed fan Laurie Hernandez, shared a few insights about her writings (she already knows how the series will end), spoke lovingly of her husband (\"He's 6'4\" and hot as hell with a baby strapped to his chest\"), swore casually and joked that hers was the \u201conly profession where you can have imaginary fiends\u201d and not be considered insane.",
      "She expressed relief and pleasure over completing \u201cOnyx Storm,\" noting she had to block out her own popularity to get the writing done.",
      "\u201cAs much as I love you guys, I kind of pretend you don\u2019t exist,\u201d she said. \u201cI kind of ignore you, but I love you at the same time.\u201d",
      "\u201cOnyx Storm\u201d isn't quite a Harry Potter-level phenomenon \u2014 the final Potter book by J.K. Rowling, \u201cHarry Potter and the Deathly Hallows,\u201d sold more than 8 million copies in the U.S. in its first 24 hours \u2014 but it carries a similar feeling of obsession, identification and spontaneity.",
      "Like the Potter books, the release of \u201cOnyx Storm\u201d was welcomed with midnight store parties around the country, gatherings for which fans showed up in costume. Some fans at The Town Hall finished the 526-page \u201cOnyx Storm\u201d within hours of receiving it, others are in no hurry.",
      "\"This is a book I personally want to take my time with,\" said Scarlett Fuentes, who arrived with her friend Zy Bao-angan, both of them in black leather.",
      "\"I want to savor this moment,\" Bao-angan said.",
      "Like Potter, enthusiasm for the Yarros books extends well beyond any organized publicity campaigns. The Potter books helped inspire some of the first Internet fan sites for books. Yarros and such fellow romantasy authors as Sarah J. Maas have been favorites of the young readers on BookTok, a TikTok community that has emerged as publishing's most effective driver of sales. Countless fans on BookTok and other social media \u2014 some crying, some cursing in amazement \u2014 have been posting their responses to \u201cOnyx Storm.\"",
      "On Friday, Hernandez and the audience posed questions about her books as if gossiping about friends. If Violet and Xaden were at a bar, what would they order? Violet would go for a lavender lemon drop, Xaden is fine with a beer. And which music genres define them? Xenon is heavy metal, Violet harder to label.",
      "Asked what was the most important lessons she has learned from writing the books, Yarros reminded her fans that she wasn't only a writer or public figure.",
      "\u201cI can say plotting and I can say everything, but probably the most important thing I've learned is that real life is what happens in my house, and what happens around my kitchenette and what happens in my living room chairs and what happens when my kids are all together and my husband's together,\u201d she said. \u201cReal life is not what happens on the internet.\u201d",
      "\u201cI love you guys,\u201d she added. \u201cBut peace out.\u201d"

      "\u201cEverybody I know has been affected,\u201d O'Brien told The Associated Press Friday. \"I\u2019m out of my house. Fortunately, my house, ... the fire got very close but my house survived. But we won\u2019t be back in there for a long time. And I\u2019m the lucky one. I mean, I know so many people who lost their homes and I\u2019m just, was ridiculously lucky. So we want to make sure that that show reflects what\u2019s happening and that we put a light on the right people in the right way.\u201d",
      "Thousands of Angelenos had their homes destroyed in wildfires that tore through the Pacific Palisades and Altadena neighborhoods this month. Many of those whose homes survived cannot yet return due to smoke or other damage.",
      "O'Brien was tapped last year to host the 97th Academy Awards, which will be held March 2 in Los Angeles. The fires twice postponed the academy's nominations announcement, which was held Thursday; \u201cEmilia P\u00e9rez\u201d emerged as the leading nominee.",
      "The fires have upended Hollywood's awards season and effectively turned it into a pledge drive. Some have questioned whether the Oscars should be canceled but its organizers say they will transform the show in a way that \"unites us as a global film community and acknowledge those who fought so bravely against the wildfires.\u201d",
      "\u201cWe want to be sensitive to the moment and we want to be sensitive to what\u2019s happened,\" O'Brien said Friday. \"It is top of our minds and we are talking about it a lot.\"",
      "\u201cThe Oscars is still I think it\u2019s five weeks away. And we want to make sure that we process all of that and that we put on the best show for March 2. Not the best show that we thought of tonight. Not the best show for March 3, the best show for March 2 that reflects what people are feeling in that moment.\u201d",
      "O'Brien, the former \u201cTonight Show\u201d host, spoke at the premiere of his latest film, \u201cIf I had Legs I'd Kick You,\u201d which also stars Rose Byrne."

      "PARK CITY, Utah -- The Sundance Film Festival welcomed back three Oscar-winning documentary filmmakers to help kick off the annual independent film showcase in Park City, Utah.",
      "On Thursday night at The Ray Theater, \u201c20 Days in Mariupol\u201d filmmaker Mstyslav Chernov, who won the Oscar last year, debuted his latest dispatch from Ukraine, \u201c2000 Meters to Andriivka,\u201d a harrowing journey to the front lines of a 2023 counteroffensive. A few hours later, at the Eccles, Ahmir \u201cQuestlove\u201d Thompson, who won an Oscar for \u201cSummer of Soul\u201d in 2022, unveiled his Sly Stone portrait, \u201cSLY LIVES! (aka The Burden of Black Genuis).\u201d Earlier, \u201cOne Day in September\u201d filmmaker Kevin MacDonald also showcased his film \u201cOne to One: John & Yoko,\u201d which debuted last year at the Venice Film Festival and will get an IMAX release on April 11 before hitting Max later this year.",
      "Some critics reflected that \u201c2000 Meters to Andriivka,\u201d a joint production between The Associated Press and PBS Frontline, was even more powerful than \u201c20 Days in Mariupol.\u201d \u201cSLY LIVES!\u201d (on Hulu Feb. 13) was called \u201csublime\u201d and \u201cilluminating\u201d in its examination of an underappreciated, shapeshifting genius.",
      "\u201cI\u2019ve been coming here since 2000 and I thought the coolest thing you could do would be to DJ an after party,\u201d Thompson said before the screening. \u201cI never dreamt this for my future, so this is really humbling.\u201d",
      "It was a full-circle end to a day that began with a slate of documentary Oscar nominations all connected to the Sundance Institute in some way. Some were supported by the Institute, some debuted at the festival as recently as last year.",
      "\u201cBlack Box Diaries,\u201d in which a Japanese filmmaker investigates her own sexual assault, had its premiere in Park City last year and was supported by the Institute\u2019s doc film program. \u201cNo Other Land,\u201d made by a Palestinian-Israeli collective, was also supported by the film fund. \u201cPorcelain War,\u201d about Ukrainian artists in wartime, debuted at the festival in 2024, where it won the grand jury prize. \u201cSoundtrack to a Coup d\u2019Etat,\u201d about the assassination of Congolese leader Patrice Lumumba in 1961, also launched last year and won a special jury prize. And, finally, \u201cSugarcane,\u201d a 2024 festival premiere investing abuse and missing children at an Indian residential school, was supported by a Sundance grant.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s really special,\u201d said Basil Tsiokos, a Sundance senior programmer. \u201cIt does speak to what Sundance brings to the artistic community and to the support that we show to artists out there.\u201d",
      "On Friday night, \u201cSugarcane\u201d filmmakers Julian Brave NoiseCat and Emily Kassie are also being given an award at the Institute\u2019s fundraising gala. Newly anointed Oscar nominees James Mangold and Cynthia Erivo are also being honored.",
      "It\u2019s not lost on those who program for the festival and run the artists programs how crucial that initial support can be for someone trying to make a documentary.",
      "\u201cThe funding landscape is challenging, particularly in the nonfiction space,\u201d Tsiokos said. \u201cGetting early support from the artists programs, from the documentary feature programs is sort of a stamp of approval, of encouragement that helps other funders come in later on to take a seed of an idea and bring it into fruition.\u201d",
      "The Oscars and Sundance have long been connected, especially in the documentary space. For the past 25 years, there has been at least one Sundance movie every year that goes on to get an Oscar nomination. Some that have won the statuette include \u201cAn Inconvenient Truth,\u201d \u201cMan on Wire,\u201d \u201cSearching for Sugar Man,\u201d \u201c20 Feet From Stardom,\u201d \u201cIcarus,\u201d \u201cAmerican Factory\u201d and \u201cNavalny.\u201d",
      "\u201cWe just provide a space for the films,\u201d Tsiokos said. \u201cThe films are from the artists. They\u2019re the ones with the vision to make these films possible. We provide them a platform to be able to meet their audiences. That\u2019s quite an important role that we take very seriously.\u201d",
      "This year, the festival has about 40 feature documentaries premiering across sections on everything from Marlee Matlin and Selena Quintanilla, to one about Nairobi women transforming a formerly whites-only library into a cultural hub, to another on Florida\u2019s stand-your-ground laws. While it\u2019s difficult to project what might be in the Oscar race next year, Tsiokos has observed one trend that might help audiences pick and choose.",
      "\u201cThe influence of the international voters is growing. In the last couple of years especially, most of the nominees for the Oscar race tend to be international titles,\u201d Tsiokos said. \u201cI would tell people to make sure to check out the World Cinema Documentary Competition. There are some real gems.\u201d",

      "Prosecutors say they won\u2019t charge rocker Marilyn Manson after a years-long investigation into sexual assault and domestic violence allegations",
      "LOS ANGELES -- Prosecutors said Friday that they will not file charges against Marilyn Manson after a years-long investigation of allegations of sexual assault and domestic violence.",
      "Los Angeles County District Attorney Nathan Hochman said the allegations are too old under the law and the evidence is not sufficient to charge the 56-year-old shock rocker whose legal name is Brian Warner.",
      "\u201cWe have determined that allegations of domestic violence fall outside of the statute of limitations, and we cannot prove charges of sexual assault beyond a reasonable doubt,\u201d Hochman said. \u201cWe recognize and applaud the courage and resilience of the women who came forward to make reports and share their experiences, and we thank them for their cooperation and patience with the investigation.\u201d",
      "Nearly four years after the investigation began, then-District Attorney George Gasc\u00f3n said on Oct. 9 that his office was pursuing new leads that added to the \u201calready extensive\u201d file that authorities had amassed.",
      "LA County sheriff\u2019s detectives said early in 2021 that they were investigating Manson for incidents between 2009 and 2011 in West Hollywood, where Manson lived at the time. The probe included a search warrant that was served on his West Hollywood home. The case was initially turned over to prosecutors in September 2021, but the Los Angeles County District Attorney\u2019s Office requested more evidence-gathering and the investigation resumed.",
      "\u201cWe are very pleased that, after a thorough and incredibly lengthy review of all of the actual evidence, the District Attorney has concluded what we knew and expressed from the start \u2014 Brian Warner is innocent,\u201d his attorney, Howard King, said in a statement.",
      "The identities of the women police and prosecutors spoke to were not revealed, but \u201cGame of Thrones\u201d actor Esm\u00e9 Bianco \u2014 who sued Manson in a case that has been settled \u2014 said she was part of the criminal investigation. Before the decision not to prosecute, she criticized how long the process was taking at a rally for Hochman, who was elected soon after.",
      "\u201cAlmost four years ago, I did what victims of rape are supposed to do: I went to the police,\u201d she said on Oct. 10. \u201cI described to them in agonizing detail how the rock musician Brian Warner \u2014 better known by his stage name Marilyn Manson \u2014 had raped and abused me over the course of our relationship.\u201d",
      "Bianco said she gave investigators \u201chundreds of pieces of evidence, including photos of my body covered in bites, bruises and knife wounds, emails and text messages, threats to my immigration status.\u201d",
      "In her lawsuit, Bianco alleged sexual, physical and emotional abuse, and said that Manson violated human trafficking law by bringing her to California from England for non-existent roles in music videos and movies.",
      "\u201cWhilst I am deeply disappointed by the decision of the District Attorney to not bring charges in the case against Brian Warner, I am sadly not surprised,\u201d Bianco said in a statement released by her lawyer. \u201cOnce again, our justice system has failed survivors. Not the individual prosecutors and detectives who worked for years on this case, but the system that made them do so with one hand tied behind their collective backs.\u201d",
      "In 2021 Manson's former fianc\u00e9e, \u201cWestworld\u201d actor Evan Rachel Wood, named him as her abuser for the first time in an Instagram post.",
      "Wood and Manson\u2019s relationship became public in 2007 when he was 38 and she was 19, and they were briefly engaged in 2010 before breaking up.",
      "\u201cHe started grooming me when I was a teenager and horrifically abused me for years,\u201d Wood said.",
      "Manson replied on Instagram that these were \u201chorrible distortions of reality.\u201d He sued Wood, saying she and another woman fabricated accusations against him and convinced others to do the same. A judge threw out significant sections of the suit, then in November, Manson agreed to drop it and pay Wood's attorney fees.",
      "The Associated Press does not typically name people who say they\u2019ve been sexually abused, unless they come forward publicly as Bianco and Wood have done.",
      "Other women sued Manson in the months after Wood came forward. Wood's representative did not immedately return a message Friday.",
      "Manson emerged as a musical star in the mid-1990s, known as much for courting public controversy as for hit songs like \u201cThe Beautiful People\u201d and hit album\u2019s like 1996\u2019s \u201cAntichrist Superstar\u201d and 1998\u2019s \u201cMechanical Animals.\u201d"

      "Junya Watanabe has opened his latest menswear show at Paris Fashion Week with beige hunting jackets paired with discreet shirts and ties",
      "PARIS -- Beige hunting jackets with oversized pockets, paired with discreet shirts and ties, opened Junya Watanabe\u2019s latest menswear show at Paris Fashion Week Friday.",
      "It was a deceptively classic start for the avant-garde Japanese designer, whose signature knack for subversive tailoring and patchwork soon disrupted conventions.",
      "What looked like classic Americana \u2014 thick denim jeans, caps, and check shirts \u2014 quickly morphed into something far less predictable. Exaggerated blown-up check pants in red with dramatic turn-ups injected a sense of whimsy, as did splashes of vivid color. A pale yellow jacket and a tactile padded coat in soft pastels softened the masculinity, reworking the rugged aesthetic into something gender-fluid.",
      "Flashes of bold hues, from vibrant red to bright blue checks, became a defining motif. The palette danced across reimagined hunting jackets and distinctly masculine silhouettes, which were disrupted by the designer\u2019s famed use of patchwork. Here, it wasn\u2019t just a technique but a conceptual statement \u2014 ideas and styles stitched together, creating contradictions.",
      "Hunting jackets might evoke tradition, but here they felt fresh, even irreverent, with their clever layering of fabrics and unexpected details. The collection demonstrated Watanabe\u2019s mastery in blending the familiar with the avant-garde, offering a \u201cbro\u201d aesthetic turned on its head by bursts of feminine color.",
      "The recurring themes of denim and disruptive tailoring felt polished yet safe, lacking the urgency or political edge that defined his earlier work."

      "Opening statements are beginning at the trial of rapper A$AP Rocky, who is accused of firing a handgun at a former friend",
      "A$AP Rocky is the celebrity in the room, but A$AP Relli will star at his trial.",
      "The hip-hop star, fashion maven and actor, whose legal name is Rakim Athelaston Mayers, is accused of firing a gun at his former friend Relli, born Terell Ephron, on whose testimony prosecutors are pinning their case.",
      "Opening statements are set to begin Friday at the trial after a jury of seven women and five men was selected over the course of three days. Rocky is charged with two felony counts of assault with a semiautomatic firearm.",
      "He took a major risk by turning down a prosecution plea deal offer of just six months in jail and instead choosing to go to trial. If convicted, he could be sentenced to a term of up to 24 years in prison.",
      "The defense plans to paint Ephron as a money seeker and point out he has sued Rocky in civil court, seeking financial damages for the incident.",
      "\u201cHe\u2019s the witness that this case will rise and fall on, for sure,\u201d Rocky\u2019s lead attorney Joe Tacopina said after a recent pretrial hearing. \u201cWhether he\u2019s a star is something that remains to be seen.\u201d",
      "\u201cThere\u2019s jealousy obviously, and he\u2019s made that clear. He became a hater,\u201d Tacopina said. \u201cThis is in large part about money, money, money.\u201d",
      "Rocky and Relli were part of a group of young creators in high school in New York who called themselves A$AP \u2014 for Always Strive and Prosper \u2014 and initially remained close as Rocky found wealth and fame through music. The relationship soured, coming to a head with the alleged shooting on Nov. 6, 2021, when Ephron says Rocky fired on him and grazed his knuckles.",
      "The defense plans to call witnesses to testify that a firearm seen on a security video is a starter pistol that Rocky carried as a prop for security.",
      "They likely will say that is why, despite a search of the spot by many police officers, no shell casings were found at the site near Hollywood and Vine. Police did not recover a gun in the case.",
      "Ephron went to the police two days later and brought 9 mm shell casings he had picked up himself, which are both points the defense will seize on. No fingerprints were recovered from the casings.",
      "The trial\u2019s celebrity goes beyond Rocky. The Grammy-nominated hip-hop star\u2019s longtime partner is Rihanna and the couple have two toddler sons together.",
      "Tacopina suggested it\u2019s unlikely Rihanna will show up in court and her name may not come up at all, though it did frequently during jury selection when many prospective jurors said they were fans.",
      "Rocky has been named one of the celebrity chairs of the Met Gala in May and has a major role in a Spike Lee-directed film with Denzel Washington to be released soon after. But his life could be upended with a conviction.",
      "In the deal from prosecutors he rejected, Rocky was to plead guilty to one of the two counts in exchange for a sentence recommendation of 180 days in jail, a seven-year suspended prison sentence and three years of probation.",
      "Beyond Ephron, the prosecution's witnesses primarily will be the police who worked on the case.",
      "They also will rely heavily on surveillance video that captured parts of the incident and the circumstances. Prosecutors at the 2023 preliminary hearing showed a still image taken from video with a man in a hooded sweatshirt whose face is not visible holding what appears to be a gun, along with another image showing the face of the man in the sweatshirt, with no gun visible. A detective testified that investigators established it was Rocky.",
      "Rocky himself could take the stand and his attorney has said he wants to, but the lawyers say they have not yet decided and he is legally allowed to avoid testifying."

      "After the screening audiences in the theater, some wiping tears away, greeted Matlin with a standing ovation when she took the stage.",
      "The film delves into all aspects of her life, personal and professional: Her childhood and how her family handled learning she had become deaf at 18 months; her experience winning the best actress Oscar for her first movie role in \u201cChildren of a Lesser God\u201d and her allegedly abusive romantic relationship with her co-star, the late William Hurt, which he denied; and her experiences in an industry not equipped to accommodate deaf actors.",
      "The film was directed by Shoshanna Stern, who also is deaf. Matlin specifically requested that Stern take on the project when American Masters approached her about doing a documentary.",
      "Matlin has written about her experiences before, including her volatile relationship with Hurt and drugs, in a memoir, \u201cI\u2019ll Scream Later.\u201d But before the #MeToo movement, she felt her allegations were largely dismissed or glossed over.",
      "Interviews from the book's press tour show journalists were more interested in the \u201camazing sex\u201d she said she had with Hurt than the stories of the alleged physical and verbal abuse. One interviewer asked her why she waited \u201cso long\u201d to come forward with the claims.",
      "The documentary isn\u2019t just a portrait of Matlin, but a broader look at deaf culture and how Matlin was thrust into the spotlight at a young age as a de facto spokesperson for all deaf causes.",
      "In addition to being the first, and until Troy Kotsur won for \u201cCODA\u201d in 2022, only deaf actor to win an Academy Award, she helped lobby Congress for closed captioning and delved into the Gallaudet University protest about hiring hearing people to preside over the university, which is the subject of another Sundance documentary, \u201cDeaf President Now!\u201d",
      "Matlin also faced backlash when she spoke while presenting the best actor Oscar the year after she won, an experience that she said made her distance herself from deaf causes.",
      "It features moving interviews from her longtime translator and other important figures in her life such as Henry Winkler, who met her when she was a student at age 12.",
      "Winkler watched her perform a song during a school production after she wrote him a fan letter. Later, she stayed in his home for two years after her breakup with Hurt and had her wedding there. In the film, Matlin said she never would have pursued acting if it weren\u2019t for Winkler, although he disagreed.",
      "The film is closed captioned and includes verbal translations for hearing audiences. In a unique approach, the subjects were interviewed by Stern with an earpiece, allowing them to hear translations from another room.",
      "Matlin said she has struggled occasionally to convince the industry to let her play roles that aren\u2019t necessarily written for a deaf actor. Aaron Sorkin, who wrote a part for her in \u201cThe West Wing,\u201d dispelled the notion it is difficult to write for deaf actors.",
      "When \u201cCODA\u201d came around, the studio wanted to cast an A-list, hearing male star opposite Matlin. She threatened to walk if it weren\u2019t a deaf actor and was gratified when Kotsur won the Oscar, hence the \u201cnot alone anymore\u201d subtitle. Her big disappointment was not being able to say a few words on stage during the event.",
      "Asked why this moment was the right time for a documentary, Matlin said, \u201cIt\u2019s never really the right time. So, why not?\u201d",

      "LOS ANGELES -- Reality TV couple Heidi Montag and Spencer Pratt are suing the city of Los Angeles after losing their Pacific Palisades home in the wildfires that have torn through Southern California in recent weeks.",
      "The couple, who rose to stardom on \u201cThe Hills,\" a spin-off of \u201cLaguna Beach,\u201d filed the lawsuit Tuesday along with more than 20 other property owners and residents who were affected by the Palisades Fire. The complaint blames Los Angeles and its municipal water department for the water issues that hampered firefighting efforts and says it ultimately led to the damage to their properties.",
      "The Eaton and Palisades fires, ignited by strong winds during one of the region's driest years on record, have killed 28 people and destroyed more than 12,000 structures, putting them among the most destructive fires in California history.",
      "There has been intense scrutiny over hydrants running dry and problems with water pressure, leading to a barrage of lawsuits against the city and the Los Angeles Department of Water and Power. California Gov. Gavin Newsom has called for an independent investigation into the LA water utility over the issues.",
      "The complaint filed by the couple and others mentions that the Santa Ynez Reservoir, which services the Pacific Palisades neighborhood, was offline and had been out of commission since February 2024 while awaiting repairs. The hydrants in the neighborhood were connected to three tanks that held 1 million gallons (3.7 million liters) of water each and went dry within 12 hours, the complaint said, citing Janisse Qui\u00f1ones, the water utility's chief executive and chief engineer.",
      "Without water from the reservoir, firefighters had to primarily rely on the water tanks, which were not designed to fight such a large fire, the complaint said.",
      "The city and water utility did not immediately respond to emailed requests for comment.",
      "While the repairs to the reservoir were requested in January 2024, the water utility told the Los Angeles Times they would not be completed until April or May 2025.",
      "The lawsuit called the Palisades Fire an \u201cinescapable and unavoidable consequence\u201d of the water system operated by the city and water utility.",
      "\u201cThe system necessarily failed, and this failure was a substantial factor in causing Plaintiffs to suffer the losses alleged in this complaint,\u201d it said.",
      "The plaintiffs cite the principle known as \u201c inverse condemnation,\u201d which is the same mechanism that requires utilities to pay for wildfire damages caused by their equipment."

      "LOS ANGELES -- A jury of five men and seven women was seated Thursday at the trial of rapper A$AP Rocky, who is charged with firing a gun at a former friend in 2021.",
      "Opening statements at the Los Angeles trial of the 36-year-old hip-hop superstar and fashion maven will likely begin Friday after the 12 jurors were selected. Four alternates still need to be selected.",
      "Rocky turned down a prosecution plea offer of 180 days in jail to risk years in prison if the jurors find him guilty of two felony counts of assault with a semiautomatic firearm. He has pleaded not guilty and his lawyer says he committed no crime.",
      "He opted instead to risk trial on two counts of assault with a semiautomatic firearm, charges that with conviction bring a penalty of up to 24 years in prison.",
      "It took the two sides 2 1/2 days to pick the jurors from a pool of more than a hundred candidates who packed into a downtown LA courtroom. Those chosen include a woman who is a podcast editor and actor, and a man who has worked for more than 20 years at Trader Joe's.",
      "Many were excused for cause, others sent away by one of the two sides. Each had 10 jurors they could excuse without a reason. The defense used seven of their challenges, the prosecution just two.",
      "One man questioned Thursday works as a civilian with the Los Angeles Police Department and has extensive ties to law enforcement including a cousin who was on the case's witness list but is not expected to be called.",
      "After the judge declined to dismiss him for cause, Rocky's lawyer Joe Tacopina took him off the jury.",
      "\u201cHere\u2019s a shocker, we\u2019re going to thank and excuse juror number 27.\u201d",

      "He asked one woman, a speech pathologist, whether he should mistrust all speech pathologists based on his bad experience with one.",

      "When she brought up the Rodney King case, he asked, \u201cYou are going to hold against current police something that happened before they were born?\u201d",
      "Many questions were about the fame of both Rocky and especially Rihanna, his longtime life partner and the mother of his two toddler children. She was not in court Thursday, and it's not certain whether she will show up during the trial.",
      "\u201cWhat if Rihanna comes here to court, is it going to be hard for you to look over there, and see the defendant\u2019s family, and deliver a guilty verdict?\u201d Deputy District Attorney John Lewin asked one woman.",
      "After a long pause, she said \u201cyes.\u201d",
      "Rocky is accused of firing three or four shots at Terell Ephron, a friend from his teenage years, on the streets of Hollywood in 2021. Ephron said the shots grazed his knuckles.

    "story": [
      "The film academy had plenty of surprise nominations Thursday for the 97th Oscars",
      "PARK CITY, Utah -- In one of the more wide-open Oscar fields in recent history, there were plenty of nominations surprises Thursday.",
      "Not too long ago, it seemed that people like Angelina Jolie and Nicole Kidman were destined for best actress nominations, while general audience disinterest in the young Donald Trump movie \u201cThe Apprentice\u201d might have indicated its awards chances were dead on arrival.",
      "But the members of the film academy had something different in mind. Here are some of the biggest snubs and surprises from the 97th Oscar nominations.",
      "The young Trump movie \u201cThe Apprentice\u201d has been one of the bigger awards season question marks, especially after it failed to resonate with moviegoers in theaters. And yet both Jeremy Strong, for his portrayal for Trump lawyer Roy Cohn, and Sebastian Stan (who was also in the conversation for \u201cA Different Man\u201d ), for playing the future two-time president, made it in. Only Strong got nominated by the Screen Actors Guild.",
      "This will forever be one of the more confounding awards season oversights. Marianne Jean-Baptiste delivered one of the all-time great performances in Mike Leigh\u2019s \u201cHard Truths,\u201d as the perpetually aggrieved and sharp-tongued London woman Pansy. The general thinking is that it was either going to be Jean-Baptiste or Fernanda Torres, and Torres got in for the equally beloved \u201cI\u2019m Still Here.\u201d",
      "This is perhaps up for debate, but there was certainly a lot of goodwill behind Anderson\u2019s movie-star turn in Gia Coppola\u2019s \u201cThe Last Showgirl,\u201d especially considering her SAG nomination. But like with Jennifer Lopez and \u201cHustlers\u201d a few years ago, it was not meant to be at the Oscars.",
      "James Mangold has directed several awards darlings, including \u201cFord v Ferrari\u201d and \u201cWalk the Line\u201d but had consistently missed out on a best director nomination, until this year with \u201cA Complete Unknown.\u201d It may have come at the expense of Edward Berger, who missed out on a nod for \u201cConclave\u201d or Denis Villeneuve for \u201cDune: Part Two.\u201d",
      "Daniel Craig gave one of his best performances as an American expat in Mexico in the torrid May-December romance in \u201cQueer,\u201d but it hasn\u2019t been resonating with awards voters. The Oscar snub is the final piece in a puzzle that just never came together.",
      "If there ever were a shoo-in for a nomination and an Oscar, on paper at least, it would be for Angelina Jolie playing opera legend Maria Callas. Filmmaker Pablo Larra\u00edn had not missed yet in getting best actress nominations for his famous, tragic women biopics, including Natalie Portman for \u201cJackie\u201d and Kristen Stewart for \u201cSpencer.\u201d But somehow Jolie did not make the cut in the end.",
      "\u201cBabygirl\u201d is not a cliche awards movie by a long stretch, but Nicole Kidman\u2019s performance as Romy, the buttoned-up, married CEO who begins a dangerous affair with a young intern at her company was undeniable. But a best actress win at the Venice Film Festival has never guaranteed Oscar success.",
      "Despite the wide love for \u201cThe Brutalist,\u201d Felicity Jones has been curiously absent from many nominations lists for her sharp portrayal of Erzs\u00e9bet T\u00f3th. The cast did not even get recognized by SAG. But it just goes to show that it\u2019s never too late to sneak in for the big one",
      "A few years after Danielle Deadwyler was famously snubbed for \u201cTill,\u201d she has another snub to add to her resume for Malcolm Washington\u2019s adaptation of \u201cThe Piano Lesson.\u201d This latest campaign might not have had as much steam behind it as \u201cTill,\u201d but at the very least one would assume that it could have been a make good.",
      "Supporting actress was one of the more chaotic and unpredictable categories this year, with so many deserving performers in the mix. Monica Barbaro was one of those that was on the fringe of possibilities for her turn as Joan Baez, singing and all, for \u201cA Complete Unknown.\u201d",
      "One who was not so lucky was Selena Gomez for \u201cEmilia P\u00e9rez,\u201d perhaps because she was partially competing with her co-star, Zo\u00eb Salda\u00f1a who simply had more momentum (and gave a moving speech at the Golden Globes).",
      "The incarceration drama \u201cSing Sing\u201d did get several significant nominations including for Colman Domingo, adapted screenplay and original song. But Clarence \u201cDivine Eye\u201d Maclin, who delivered a revelatory performance based on his own experience, was not among them. He is, however, credited with helping to write the story.",
      "Margaret Qualley seems to have been unfairly left out of much of the awards conversation around \u201cThe Substance,\u201d a movie that only works with a great Sue. But the focus has been more on Demi Moore, overdue for such recognition, and Coralie Fargeat \u2014 the only woman to score a best director nomination.",
      "Trent Reznor and Atticus Ross delivered one of their most popular scores ever this year for \u201cChallengers\u201d and yet were left off in a batch of nominees that included \u201cThe Brutalist,\u201d \u201cConclave,\u201d \u201cEmilia P\u00e9rez,\u201d \u201cWicked\u201d and \u201cThe Wild Robot.\u201d It\u2019s not even that they\u2019re consistently overlooked by the academy \u2014 they\u2019ve already won twice, for \u201cSoul\u201d and \u201cThe Social Network.\u201d",
      "Everyone expected the Latvian cat movie \u201cFlow\u201d to get a best animated feature nomination, especially after it won the Golden Globe. But the big surprise is that it got a second for best international feature \u2014 a first for Latvia. This is not a first for an animated movie to get into the international category, though: \u201cWaltz with Bashir\u201d and \u201cFlee\u201d had the honor before \u201cFlow,\u201d but neither ended up winning.",
      "RaMell Ross\u2019 \u201cNickel Boys\u201d has had quite the rollercoaster awards season journey, even though it\u2019s widely considered one of the best films of the year. The film academy thought so too, including it among the 10 best picture nominees (alongside other relative surprises like \u201cI\u2019m Still Here\u201d and \u201cDune: Part Two\u201d). Oddly, though, it missed out on cinematography despite its inventive first-person point of view."

      "This is a film that the producers would rather audiences experience blind, but the brief synopsis is that Alia Shawkat plays an aspiring actress in a military role-playing facility who falls for a soldier playing an insurgent. Luca Guadagnino produced the film, written and directed by Hailey Gates. It also stars Callum Turner and Chlo\u00eb Sevigny. When asked how she likes to describe the film, Gates told The Associated Press that, \u201cSometimes I describe it as a military industrial complex romantic comedy.\u201d",

In \u201c2000 Meters to Andriivka,\u201d a joint production between the AP and Frontline, Chernov turns his lens to Ukrainian soldiers attempting to traverse one mile of forest to reclaim the occupied village Andriivka. \u201cIt\u2019s a beautiful, horrifying portrait of the futility of war,\u201d said Kim Yutani, the festival\u2019s director of programming.",

In his director\u2019s statement, Bentley said, \u201cIt\u2019s about the people left behind by modernization. It\u2019s about the toll industrialization takes on the natural world. It\u2019s about the possibilities love can open up in our lives and about the hope that can blossom in the aftermath of grief.\"",

This new film grapples with the question of the burden of Black genius (also its title) as it tells the story of his rise, his cultural influence and his struggles with drugs. Elegance Bratton is also debuting an accidental companion doc, \u201cMove Ya Body: The Birth of House.\u201d",

      "\u201cAs crazy as, not even just this last year, the last few years have been for me, this is the happiest I\u2019ve been in a long time. And it\u2019s pretty wonderful,\u201d said Good last week with tears welling in her eyes, emotions heightened as she thought of her relationship with Jonathan Majors, her time on \u201cHarlem\u201d and the Los Angeles wildfires.\u201cI\u2019m just thankful for the journey and I\u2019m thankful to be loved.\u201d",
      "Much of that love has been provided by embattled actor Jonathan Majors, and the fluctuating journey includes their scrutinized relationship, leading Tyler Perry\u2019s \u201cDivorce in the Black\u201d film and starring in the third and final season of \u201cHarlem,\u201d premiering Thursday on Prime Video.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s incredible that the people who have supported us and have watched the show have waited on us like \u2018Game of Thrones,\u2019\u201d said Good, who plays Camille, a Columbia University professor of sex and love. \u201cIt\u2019s really cool to be a part of something so amazing that people love.\u201d",
      "\u201cHarlem\u201d has been a survivor, emerging from the coronavirus pandemic and the Hollywood actors and writers strikes. The Tracy Oliver dramedy follows four women in their 30s (Good, Grace Byers, Jerrie Johnson and Shoniqua Shandai) living in Manhattan\u2019s historic Black neighborhood as they navigate love, friendships and careers. While the series didn\u2019t reach the acclaim of Issa Rae\u2019s \u201cInsecure,\u201d it earned a staunch fan base.",
      "\u201cIf you really think about shows about New York, it\u2019s almost like purposefully excluding Black people ... so when we reflect on shows like \u2018Friends\u2019 or even \u2018Sex and The City,\u2019 I probably can count on one hand how many Black people I\u2019ve seen in those shows. But in New York, it\u2019s unavoidable because Black people have created the culture here, specifically in Harlem,\u201d said Johnson, who plays Tye, a queer dating app designer for LBGTQ+ people of color.",
      "\u201cWe loved our \u2018Living Single,\u2019 and that\u2019s why we loved it because we love seeing these women meeting in this small little apartment to commune with each other ... that\u2019s why we have such a cult following because there was a hole in the market that Tracy brilliantly filled.\u201d",
      "Good, 43, said the relationship she shares with her cast, crew and streaming platform is one she hadn\u2019t experienced. \u201cThis definitely has been the best professional experience I\u2019ve had in my entire career in terms of emotionally, mentally, professionally, spiritually.\u201d",
      "It\u2019s an emphatic declaration by the former child star whose first major film appearance came in Ice Cube\u2019s 1995 classic \u201cFriday,\u201d shined in \u201cEve\u2019s Bayou\u201d and became a household name to kids on Nickelodeon\u2019s \u201cCousin Skeeter\u201d series.",
      "Adored for beauty throughout her relatively drama-free career, many fans questioned her relationship with Majors, the rapidly rising star of \u201cCreed III\u201d and \u201cAnt-Man and the Wasp: Quantumania.\u201d It began toward the end of 2023 following the 35-year-old\u2019s arrest for allegations of escalating incidents of physical and verbal abuse toward ex-girlfriend Grace Jabbari.",
      "But the \u201cThink Like a Man\u201d and \u201cShazam! Fury of the Gods\u201d actor said her Christian faith and life lessons prepared her for the backlash.",
      "\u201cI think about being in my 20s and you see the Media Take Outs and it\u2019s a hundred nice things and there\u2019s like one or two bad things. And I would just internalize it and I would cry and it would hurt my feelings so much,\u201d said Good, who also cited criticism from fellow Christians about her attire and film choices, false skin-bleaching allegations, and the end of her near decade-long marriage with pastor and Hollywood executive DeVon Franklin as perseverance-builders. \u201cI had been praying for maybe like five or six years, \u2019Lord, please deliver me from what people think about me. \u2026 But I will say the part of it that is still hard for me is to see them drag people I love.\u201d",
      "Majors was convicted of one misdemeanor assault charge and a harassment violation. He avoided jail time but was ordered to complete a yearlong counseling program. He also settled a civil suit with Jabbari, but the ordeal nearly extinguished his career.",
      "Good, who was by Majors\u2019 side at court dates and became in engaged to him in November, is optimistic his career will regenerate. (Ironically, Good starred in 50 Cent\u2019s \u201c21 Questions\u201d hit music video in which he proposes scenarios to a potential girlfriend to see if she\u2019d stand by him, including incarceration.)",
      "\u201cThe idea that people are like, \u2019Well, she got paid,\u201d said Good, rolling her eyes at suggestions it\u2019s a publicity stunt \u2014 \u201cit could be hurtful, but I just don\u2019t care anymore. And that\u2019s a good feeling.\u201d",
      "Good, who aspires to star in an action film, has been open about her desire to have children and is focusing on her future with Majors, including launching a health and wellness brand together.",
      "Admirers and industry colleagues believe Good deserves much more recognition.",
      "\u201cPeople have tried to pigeonhole her in a certain area that now she\u2019s breaking free. I always tell her that this is her phoenix moment ... the ashes actually being a metaphor for people\u2019s expectations of her,\u201d said Johnson. \u201cAbout 75% of my favorite movies that shaped my upbringing have Meagan Good in them ... I\u2019ve learned so much about transitioning into womanhood and adulthood through the characters that she\u2019s played.\u201d",
      "Good, however, stresses her focus is not on recognition or major awards, but reaching the hearts of people. She circles back to gratitude for a career that has defied Hollywood odds.",
      "\u201cTo have any appreciation is a gift,\u201d said Good. \u201cI feel like my best is yet to come. And I feel like even now, I\u2019m kind of just getting started.\u201d",

They observe the chipper real estate agent (Julia Fox) preparing for a showing, the painting crew, one of whom believes there\u2019s something around, and finally the family and all the complexities of its dynamics. Lucy Liu (a delightful, wickedly funny scene-stealer) is the mom, Rebecca, a wealthy, successful, type-A woman hyper focused on the success of her eldest, a teenage boy named Tyler (Eddy Maday). The father, Chris (Chris Sullivan), is more of the nurturer, concerned about their teen daughter Chloe (Callina Liang) in the aftermath of her friend\u2019s unexpected death.",
      "There is a family drama transpiring inside the house, only some of which will make sense in the end. We overhear Rebecca drunkenly telling Tyler that everything she does is for him. We listen in as Chris confides to someone on the phone about a hypothetical partner being involved in something illegal and whether they still would be if legally separated. We see Tyler often with his head buried in his phone. And then there's Chloe: Sad, rebellious Chloe, who is the only one to notice that they\u2019re not alone. She\u2019s had the recent trauma, after all, and soon she\u2019s starting a thing with Tyler\u2019s floppy haired, cool guy friend Ryan (West Mulholland). They hook up, they drink, they do drugs, and Chloe gets to escape from her own thoughts \u2014 at least for a little while. Ryan looks straight out of a mid-90s movie, he's an angry, aggrieved kid who assures Chloe that she has the power to decide how this all goes.",
      "\u201cPresence\u201d was written by David Koepp (\u201cJurassic Park\u201d) off of a few pages Soderbergh put together, imagining what it would be like to be the ghost. He is that too, technically, as both director and cinematographer on the project. It\u2019s a slow-burn experience that sneaks up on you, especially once you\u2019ve seen how it plays out. Personally, I didn\u2019t see any of it coming and couldn\u2019t have anticipated the emotional wallop it would pack in the end. It\u2019s a heady experiment that transcends the somewhat gimmicky-on-paper premise \u2014 something Soderbergh manages to do alarmingly well and regularly.",
      "January releases aren\u2019t often the most compelling. Aside from the annual rollout of awards contenders, it\u2019s more often than not a dumping ground. \u201cPresence\u201d is a movie that I first saw last January at the Sundance Film Festival, and yet, even after a year, the chill and the admiration has stubbornly lingered in my mind, like a ghost that just won\u2019t go away, while so many other films have simply faded from memory. It is a rare gem in the January mix.",
      "\u201cPresence,\u201d a Neon release in theaters Friday, is rated R by the Motion Picture Association for \u201cteen drinking, drug material, sexuality, language, violence.\u201d Running time: 85 minutes. Three stars out of four."

      "The collection was as much about pushing boundaries as it was about sartorial musings.",

      "NEW YORK -- NEW YORK (AP) \u2014 Steven Soderbergh isn\u2019t just the director and cinematographer of his latest film. He\u2019s also, in a way, its central character.",
      "\u201cPresence\u201d is filmed entirely from the POV of a ghost inside a home a family has just moved into. Soderbergh, who serves as his own cinematographer under the pseudonym Peter Andrews (his father's name), essentially performs as the presence, a floating point-of-view that watches as the violence that killed the mysterious ghost threatens to be repeated.",
      "For even the prolific Soderbergh, the film, which opens Friday in theaters, was a unique challenge. He shot \u201cPresence\u201d with a small digital camera while wearing slippers to soften his steps.",
      "The 62-year-old filmmaker recently met a reporter in a midtown Manhattan hotel in between finishing post-production on his other upcoming movie (\"Black Bag,\" a thriller Focus Features will release March 14) and beginning production in a few weeks on his next project, a romantic comedy that he says \u201cfeels like a George Cukor movie.\u201d",
      "Soderbergh, whose films include \u201cOut of Sight,\u201d the \u201cOcean's 11\u201d movies, \u201cMagic Mike\u201d and \u201cErin Brockovich,\u201d tends to do a lot in small windows of time. \u201cPresence\u201d took 11 days to film.",
      "That dexterous proficiency has made the ever-experimenting Soderbergh one of Hollywood's most widely respected evaluators of the movie business. In a wide-ranging conversation, he discussed why he thinks streaming is the most destructive force the movies have ever faced and why he's \u201cthe cockroach of this industry.\"",
      "SODERBERGH: No, but what I did is subtle. For the first and only time Peter Andrews has a camera operator credit. That\u2019s not a credit that I typically take because I don\u2019t need it and I typically have another operator working with me. But I felt like this was a workout. It was tricky, but really fun. It was another level of performance anxiety because I ruined more takes than anyone else in the film by a larger factor. I was the one going: \u201cCut. I f\u2014ed that up. We got to go again.\u201d",
      "SODERBERGH: The beauty of projects at this scale is I can just do them without having to talk to anybody. It\u2019s not because I don\u2019t want notes. It\u2019s because it\u2019s just the brain trust and none of the psychic real estate is taken up by things that have nothing to do with what you\u2019re going to shoot. I went from that into a more traditional project in which a lot of psychic real estate gets taken up by the process of having a studio finance your movie. I like these people, it\u2019s just a lot of lawyers. Like, a lot of lawyers.",
      "SODERBERGH: It removes a key reference point for an artist. It\u2019s helpful to know how something is doing, or how it did. You need to know that to calibrate whether you accomplished what you wanted to accomplish, whether you can work at a certain level. That\u2019s one of the most confusing things about it, the black box of it. Apart from the economic invisibility of what\u2019s going on there \u2014 the fact that we can\u2019t really look under the hood of how these streaming companies work economically \u2014 there\u2019s another kind of handrail that\u2019s missing that I find really helpful. At the end of the day, I, at least, want to know. The market will tell you how you\u2019re doing. I want to know that so I can adjust or go in another direction. Being irrelevant isn\u2019t very appealing. What is the overlap between what people seem to be responding to and what I like? Because I don\u2019t want to make these things and have nobody see them. I\u2019ve had enough people say, \u201cOh, did that come out?\u201d It\u2019s a public art form.",
      "SODERBERGH: The good news is, if you talk to Focus Features and Neon and A24, young people are going to the movies. This is the Letterboxd generation. That\u2019s fantastic. I hope that ripples outside the U.S. They are cine-literate and they expect something singular. They want the signature, they want the stamp of a filmmaker. And that\u2019s turning into a real business. One of the things, I think, we all need to do, but especially the people who cover the industry, is to stop using the studio metric for what a success is. That\u2019s not a template you should be applying to everything.",
      "SODERBERGH: There was a period of about 10 to 14 year where the best movies of the year were also the most popular movies of the year. That\u2019s not necessarily true anymore. You can pick one of the movies that\u2019s in the hunt this year and go: That\u2019s a \u201970s movie. That\u2019s as good and interesting as one of those. But it\u2019s not going to do the business that one of those would have done. It\u2019s the artist\u2019s job to adapt. When it comes to trying to control what people want to go see, you\u2019re now in a place like: \u201cIf I really wish hard, it won\u2019t rain.\u201d The weather is the weather. To a certain degree, the audience is a weather system. Luckily because of the way I began, I\u2019m the cockroach of this industry. I can survive any version of it.",
      "SODERBERGH: Yeah, when you see \u201cBlack Bag,\u201d you\u2019re like, \u201cOh, that\u2019s different.\u201d There are more shots in the first four minutes of \u201cBlack Bag\u201d than the entirety of \u201cPresence.\u201d It\u2019s a different thing and it has different demands.",
      "SODERBERGH: No, it feels more like a natural evolution and a natural response in the sense of: I want to be a different filmmaker for this. I don\u2019t want to know the outcome. If you have a conversation with a filmmaker who says they have \u201cfigured things out,\u201d you should run in the other direction. It's like: You\u2019re deluded and you have a very superficial understanding of what this art form demands if you\u2019re not humbled by what it asks of you to be distinctive.",
      "SODERBERGH: No, I still feel like I\u2019m reaching for something I quite possibly won\u2019t ever grasp and maybe shouldn\u2019t. As frustrating as it may be to feel like I've never made a thing that is at the level of one of my heroes made, I don\u2019t know what I\u2019d do if I did feel that. Do you stop, then? The movie \u201cCome and See,\u201d that guy got to basically go: \u201cThat\u2019s my mic drop.\u201d I\u2019ve never made anything approaching that.",
      "SODERBERGH: Oh, I\u2019m very happy with that film. I\u2019m very proud of that film. I can\u2019t say there\u2019s much in it that I\u2019d go back and change. That said, it\u2019s not \u201cApocalypse Now.\u201d Or \u201cThe Third Man.\u201d By my standards, I don\u2019t look at it and go, \u201cThat\u2019s as good as \u2018The Third Man.\u2019\u201d I\u2019m good at pushing myself into areas that are slightly beyond my comfort zone, but I also understand what my limitations are. I\u2019m inherently not a grandiose thinker about myself or my work. That\u2019s a critical component to some of the films I\u2019m talking about that I think are amazing. I could never make \u201cApocalypse Now.\u201d I don\u2019t think of myself as a filmmaker the way Francis (Ford Coppola) thinks of himself. That\u2019s not: He should be like me or I should be like him. It\u2019s just how we\u2019re built. I\u2019m more earthbound, I guess is the word. And that\u2019s what I like and what I\u2019m good at.",
      "SODERBERGH: I think it\u2019s the way I was born and the way I was raised. And the people who were around me when I was younger who mentored me. I just don\u2019t think I was born with the grandiosity gene and there was nobody around me who would have cultivated that even if I had shown signs. Going to Sundance last year with \u201cPresence\u201d was really gratifying. If you\u2019d told me 35 years later you\u2019re going to come back here (where \u201cSex, Lies and Videotape\u201d premiered in 1989) with a movie that people are interested in seeing, I would have wept."

      "Conductor Rapha\u00ebl Pichon makes his New York debut at age 40 on Thursday night, leading the Orchestra of St. Luke\u2019s at Carnegie Hall",
      "NEW YORK -- Rapha\u00ebl Pichon was at Paris Charles de Gaulle Airport with his Ensemble Pygmalion orchestra and chorus on March 12, 2020, catching a plane to New York for his U.S. debut nine days later at the Park Avenue Armory in Monteverdi\u2019s \u201cMarian Vespers.\u201d",
      "First the flight was delayed. Then it was canceled due to the coronavirus pandemic.",
      "\u201cIn the middle of the night they closed the skies,\u201d the conductor said.",
      "His American debut was delayed until December 2021 with Boston\u2019s Handel and Haydn Society. He makes first New York appearance at age 40 on Thursday night, leading the Orchestra of St. Luke\u2019s in a program with baritone Christian Gerhaher and soprano Ying Fang titled \u201cMein Traum (My Dream)\u201d featuring works by Franz Schubert, Robert Schumann and Carl Maria von Weber.",
      "\u201cI think he\u2019s really the future of classical music,\u201d said James Roe, the St. Luke\u2019s orchestra president. \u201cHe sees the potential of the concert experience in a way that\u2019s both expansive and welcoming and of the next generation. And he wants the concerts to propose a story, a narrative, an odyssey, a way of moving an audience member from their everyday life to something extraordinarily pleasurable.\u201d",
      "Rowe first met Pichon at the 2023 Salzburg Festival in Austria, where Pichon led a new production of Mozart\u2019s \u201cLe Nozze di Figaro \u201d by director Martin Ku\u0161ej that included cocaine-fueled fights and a predator priest. Pichon\u2019s wife, soprano Sabine Devieilhe, sang Susanna.",
      "\u201cI think, sadly, the stage director was in a very, very bad mood and a very difficult moment of his life, and, sadly, the consequences were big,\u201d Pichon said.",
      "The Vienna Philharmonic in the pit produced a different sound than the leaner approach Pichon is used to from Pygmalion\u2019s period instruments. As the Salzburg Festival\u2019s resident orchestra since 1922, the Vienna Philharmonic performs in numerous operas and concerts.",
      "\u201cSometimes 100% of the orchestra is changing from one night to the next night, so it could create some fantastic nights and some really banal moments, so it\u2019s really strange,\u201d Pichon said. \u201cI\u2019m not sure it\u2019s really music, but an amazing experience. Learned a lot. Never again. You understand many things about Salzburg, about Austrian culture, about Viennese culture, their role in this classical music world. It\u2019s really something, but it\u2019s a really strange philosophy. Vienna Philharmoniker \u2014 it\u2019s a society inside a society. It\u2019s a really strange world.\u201d",
      "Alex Fortes, a St. Luke\u2019s violin player, said Pichon made an immediate positive impression this week.",
      "\u201cHe has both an incredible clarity and a physical movement in terms of communicating what he wants,\u201d Fortes said, \u201cas well as incredibly eloquent and precise language to describe those things quite figuratively and beautifully that inspire the orchestra.\u201d",
      "Born in Brittany, Pichon played violin when he was young, started singing in a choir when he was 10 and gave that up for piano and harpsichord. He met Devieilhe while singing in a youth choir. They live together with their two young children in Paris\u2019 13th arrondissement, a unit combined from several apartments that is soundproofed, allowing each a piano to practice with.",
      "Gerhaher first encountered Devieilhe when they sang together at Munich\u2019s Bavarian State Opera last summer.",
      "\u201cShe was just absolutely outstanding and amazing and I thought, well, her husband must be equally brilliant. Otherwise they can\u2019t stay together,\u201d Gerhaher said with a laugh.",
      "Pichon founded Pygmalion in 2006. It performs 60-70 concerts per year, including at the Aix-en-Provence Festival, the Dutch National Opera and Paris\u2019 Op\u00e9ra-Comique, where Pichon conducted an opera with his wife for the first time, L\u00e9o Delibes\u2019 \u201cLakm\u00e9,\u201d in 2022. Pichon has commissioned a comic opera from French-Argentine composer Oscar Strasnoy to premiere there in 2027.",
      "\u201cI\u2019m just a bit tired with all these operas telling us (about) the end of the world and I wanted something really different and more corrosive and more comic and more sarcastic,\u201d Pichon said.",
      "While he is a Baroque specialist, he has listened to the British rock band Radiohead for two decades.",
      "\u201cThere are a lot of parallels with classical music, because I\u2019m really so amazed by their ability to erase what they\u2019ve just done and try to explore each time a new world,\u201d Pichon said.",
      "He led the St. Luke\u2019s orchestra on Monday for a rehearsal at The DiMenna Center for Classical Music, in a windswept area of Manhattan near the Hudson River. The harshest cold snap of the winter had set in.",
      "\u201cThe music we are making is the biggest contrast from the weather we experienced outside,\u201d Fortes recalled Pichon saying. \u201cIt\u2019s full of warmth and fire and beauty.\u201d"

      "A new study suggests that a pill used for emergency contraception could be repurposed at a higher dose as an abortion drug, providing a possible alternative to mifepristone, one of the two drugs used in the most common type of abortion in the United States.",
      "Mifepristone has been under attack by abortion opponents, with several states seeking in federal court to restrict its use.",
      "Now used in two-thirds of U.S. abortions, mifepristone blocks a hormone needed to sustain a pregnancy. It's typically used with misoprostol, which causes contractions and bleeding.",
      "In the study, 133 women who were up to nine weeks' pregnant took a 60 milligram dose of ulipristal acetate, the active ingredient in the prescription contraceptive Ella, followed by misoprostol 24 hours later.",
      "For 97% of them, that drug combo was effective at inducing an abortion, an effectiveness equal to the mifepristone-misoprostol combination. Four women needed a procedure or an additional medication to complete the abortion.",
      "The 60 milligram dose of ulipristal used in the study is twice the dose of Ella, a prescription drug used for emergency contraception.",
      "The company that makes Ella says on its website that it won't end an existing pregnancy. It can be taken up to five days after unprotected sex to prevent pregnancy.",
      "The findings, published Thursday in the journal NEJM Evidence, may make emergency contraception a target of abortion opponents.",
      "\u201cI\u2019m really worried that these results could be misapplied by anti-abortion activists to try to further their assault on contraception,\u201d said Dr. Daniel Grossman of the University of California, San Francisco, who wrote an accompanying editorial in the journal.

    "summary": "Digital screens are pervasive at work and in homes and schools stores",
    "story": [
      "Digital screens are pervasive at work and in homes and schools stores",
      "NEW YORK -- The trouble started every day at around 3 p.m., after Cathy Higgins had spent five or six hours staring at an array of computer screens at her desk. Her university job overseeing research projects involved peering closely at numbers and details on contracts, applications and budgets.",
      "\u201cMy vision was so blurry, I couldn\u2019t even see what was on the screen, and I was squinting so much that I could not function,\u201d Higgins said.",
      "When her eyesight got bad, Higgins walked around and spoke with members of her staff. She began planning in-person meetings for afternoons. But she would resume the computer work late at night after her children went to bed.",
      "\u201cIf I had to continue working through the blurry vision, that\u2019s when the migraines would happen,\u201d Higgins said.",
      "Digital screens are pervasive, not only at work but in our homes, schools and shops. An estimated 104 million Americans of working age spend more than seven hours a day in front of screens, according to the American Optometric Association. All that screen time can take a toll.",
      "Too much exposure to screens can lead to dry or watery eyes, fuzzy vision and headaches. It can also lead to myopia, or nearsightedness, in some people, especially children. Some technology workers even describe short bouts of vertigo when they look at screens for too long.",
      "One reason for the discomfort is that staring closely at screens for prolonged periods causes the muscle that helps eye focus to tighten up.",
      "\u201cThat muscle's not supposed to stay tight all day long. And if it does, it's like picking up a light weight and trying to hold it over your head for hours,\u201d American Optometric Association President Steven Reed said. \u201cIt\u2019s not hard to pick it up. But after a while, even though it\u2019s not a heavy lift, your body just gets tired.\u201d",
      "Fortunately, exposure to blue light from computer screens and devices has not been shown to cause permanent eye damage, according to the American Academy of Opthalmology.",
      "Nevertheless, symptoms can disrupt work, family time and rest. As an optometrist in Mississippi, Reed sees patients who complain of frequent eye pain, headaches and blurry vision associated with computer use. He advises getting an eye exam and taking frequent breaks.",
      "For Higgins, trying to catch up on the work she couldn't do when her eyes were too fatigued on weekdays cut into time she spent with her daughters on weekends. \u201cThey\u2019d be playing together, and I couldn\u2019t be as engaged as I would have liked to have been in what they were doing,\u201d she said.",
      "Here are some tips from eye health professionals to reduce eye strain caused by devices.",
      "Take a break every 20 minutes from sitting at a computer. During the break, focus your eyes on something that's about 20 feet away for 20 seconds. Pausing close-up work and looking at something in the distance gives tired, tight muscles time to relax.",
      "\u201cLuckily, eye strain is temporary,\u201d said Raj Maturi, an ophthalmologist at Midwest Eye Institute in Indianapolis who serves as spokesperson for the American Academy of Ophthalmology. \u201cThe best way to avoid these symptoms is by taking breaks from our screens or near work activities and using lubricating eye drops, if needed.\u201d",
      "People usually blink about 18 to 22 times per minute. But when looking at a screen, the rate drops to three to seven times per minute, according to the Cleveland Clinic. That's where eye drops come in.",
      "It's good to move around and go outside, but when you don't have time for an outdoor walk, frequent 20-second breaks can help.",
      "Some people find that using a larger computer monitor helps reduce eye fatigue. You can also increase the font size on your laptop, monitor or smartphone screen.",
      "Higgins did all of the above after she started a new job as senior vice president at Stand Up to Cancer. Since she works remotely from home in Midlothian, Virginia, she got a 29-inch monitor and sits about three feet away from it, about a foot farther than in most office setups.",
      "The changes helped. She still has occasional issues with blurriness, but not as frequently. \u201cWhen I have an extended day, like a 12-hour day, that\u2019s when I start to have vision issues again,\u201d she said.",
      "Sitting an arm\u2019s length away from your screen and adjusting it so you\u2019re looking slightly downward also can help reduce eye strain, according to the American Academy of Opthalmology.",
      "Some products, such as blue light glasses, are marketed with claims that they will reduce digital eye strain, improve sleep and prevent eye disease. But several studies have found the glasses are not very effective, according to the American Academy of Opthalmology. It's really our behavior with digital devices that causes symptoms, not the small amount of blue light coming from screens, the group said.",
      "After stepping away from computers at work, many people find themselves reading or scrolling on smartphone screens. It's not just workers: children are using laptops, tablets and smart screens in school settings throughout the day.",
      "Too much screen time or focusing on nearby objects can accelerate the onset and progression of nearsightedness, especially in children, said Ayesha Malik, pediatric optometrist in the division of ophthalmology at Children\u2019s Hospital of Philadelphia. Anyone streaming shows should do so on a television, instead of a tablet, to help relieve eye strain, she said.",
      "Children should follow the 20-20-20-2 rule, which includes an extra \u201c2\u201d at the end to encourage playing outdoors for 2 hours a day, which helps with eye development, she said.",
      "\u201cThe reality is that most children are engaging with screens throughout the day at school and home. It becomes difficult to track the total number of hours,\u201d Malik said. \u201cAim for not more than 20 minutes during any one session.\u201d",
      "The blue light that digital screens emit can increase alertness, so watching Netflix on an iPad or scrolling through social media feeds in bed may make it hard to get restful sleep.",
      "To give your eyes and brain the rest they need, doctors recommend turning off screens one to two hours before going to sleep. You can also set devices to \u201cdark mode\u201d in the evening to reduce the impact of bright light. If you\u2019re used to streaming videos at night, try listening to an audiobook or podcast instead.",

      "The incident occurred just three days after a fire ripped through a 12-story hotel at a ski resort in northwestern Turkey, killing 78 people. The investigation into the blaze is examining whether proper fire prevention measures were in place.",

      "Monday\u2019s ceremony marking the 80th anniversary of the liberation of Auschwitz is more than just the moment to remember some 6 million Jews who died in the Holocaust",
      "LONDON -- Manfred Goldberg was just 13 years old when \u2014 stripped to his skin and shuffling toward an SS guard at a Nazi labor camp in Latvia \u2014 a man leaned over his shoulder and whispered the secret that saved the young Jew\u2019s life.",
      "\u201cIf he happens to ask you your age, say you are 17,\u2019\u2019 the man told him.",
      "Goldberg followed the advice and the guard directed him to the group selected for slave labor. It was only later that he realized that the younger prisoners were sent to die because the guards believed anyone under 17 was too young to work profitably for the Nazi war machine.",
      "\u201cI sometimes think of that man as an angel who was sent to save me,\u2019\u2019 Goldberg said. \u201cI never saw him again.''",
      "Monday\u2019s ceremony marking the 80th anniversary of the liberation of Auschwitz is more than a moment to remember some 6 million Jews who died in the Holocaust. It is a reminder that the number of survivors is dwindling, leaving fewer and fewer people to bear witness to the Nazi genocide at a time when Holocaust denial and antisemitism are on the rise.",
      "\u201cI\u2019m only a drop in the ocean,\u2019\u2019 he said in an interview at the Jewish Care Holocaust Survivors' Centre in London. \u201cBut I\u2019ve made up my mind that as long as God gives me the strength, physical and mental, to continue doing it, I have committed myself to keep on doing it. So that\u2019s why I\u2019m here at age 94, speaking to you.\u201d",
      "This is his story.",
      "Manfred was born in Kassel, a city of about 220,000 in central Germany. Just 3 years old when the Nazis came to power in 1933, he didn\u2019t realize how the country was changing until he enrolled in the Jewish primary school nearby.",
      "By then, the Hitler Youth, an organization that was outwardly similar to the Boy Scouts but was used to indoctrinate children in Nazi ideology, had begun to spread hatred of the Jews.",
      "\u201cThey lay in wait of us sometimes, to ambush us and assault us or curse us,\u201d Goldberg said.",
      "The children had been warned: Run or face more trouble.",
      "As the Nazis systematically excluded Jews from public life, they first tried to deport Goldberg\u2019s father, then threatened to send him to a concentration camp. Manfred\u2019s mother, Rosa, pleaded for time to get him a visa to emigrate.",
      "She heard diplomats at the British Embassy in Berlin might help, so she traveled 200 miles to see them. There she found Frank Foley, a British secret agent whose embassy job was cover for his spying activities and who ultimately authorized visas for more than 10,000 Jews to escape Germany.",
      "\u201cI believe he was a man with a heart,'' Goldberg said.",
      "Foley gave Goldberg\u2019s father an emergency visa and told his mother that the rest of the family could follow in the coming weeks. But 10 days later, on Sept. 1, 1939, the Nazis invaded Poland. The family was split apart.",
      "As war raged, Germany stepped up anti-Jewish laws.",
      "Jews were required to wear a yellow six-pointed star outdoors, and could only buy food in certain shops. When the shops ran out, Jews were out of luck.",
      "One day, Goldberg\u2019s mother told him to put on his bookbag, which covered the star on his jacket, and go with her to a non-Jewish bakery. Standing across the street, she gave him a handful of coins and told him to run into the shop, ask for a loaf of bread, put the money on the counter and grab the bread before anyone could stop him.",
      "\u201cI was 7 or 8 years old. I just did as she asked me to,\u2019\u2019 he said. \u201cBut in retrospect, I realize how serious the situation must have been. She probably would have been going hungry, but she couldn\u2019t bear to see her children suffer hunger.''",
      "Then in 1942, the Nazi regime embarked on what it called \u201cThe Final Solution,\u201d the systematic execution of European Jews.",
      "When the SS pounded on the door of the Goldbergs\u2019 modest flat, they gave his mother just 10 minutes to pack a suitcase. After three days and three nights on a train without food or water, Manfred, his younger brother, Herman and their mother found themselves in Riga, the capital of Latvia, beginning a nightmare that would take him to five camps over the next three years.",
      "Manfred lost his name. He became No. 56478.",
      "Soon they arrived at a sub-camp known as Precu, where Goldberg and his mother were put to work. But Herman was too young and stayed behind in the camp when Manfred and Rosa went out to work. Eventually, the SS came and took the children away. Manfred never saw his brother again.",
      "\u201cThe next morning, both my mother and I had to line up and go to work as though nothing untoward had happened,\u201d he said. \u201cThe mourning took place internally, but if we had refused to go to work, we would have lost our lives.\u201d",
      "Only months later, Goldberg faced the same fate as his brother when the unknown benefactor whispered in his ear.",
      "As the Nazis began to lose ground on the Eastern Front, they moved their prisoners west to keep them out of Russian hands and continue the killing.",
      "Goldberg was moved to Stutthof, a camp near the Polish city of Gdansk whose front gate became known as the Gateway of Death because so few inmates left alive. More than 60,000 people died at the camp due to typhus, lethal injections and, beginning in June 1944, after they were gassed with Zyklon B, the same compound used in the gas chambers at Auschwitz.",
      "But there was one last horror to come.",
      "With the war in Europe drawing to a close, the Nazis continued to drive the inmates west toward central Germany.",
      "Goldberg and his mother were marched to 25 miles northwest, where hundreds of prisoners were herded onto barges and held offshore for days without food or water. When the SS guards disappeared, the stronger prisoners ripped up planks and used them as oars to paddle the massive boats back to shore.",
      "But just as the inmates landed, the guards returned. First they shot those too weak to escape, and then rounded up those who had made it to shore, including Goldberg and his mother, and started marching them back to Germany.",
      "Then a British tank column arrived.",
      "\u201cSuddenly our armed guards, who moments earlier had still been killing people for not keeping up to speed, turned and ran away in the opposite direction, away from us,\u2019\u2019 Goldberg recalled. \u201cPeople were jubilant. We\u2019re not under guard. We\u2019re free! We\u2019re free! ... You cannot imagine the joy we felt.\u2019\u2019",
      "After being reunited with his father in England, Goldberg forged a career as an engineer, married and had four children.",
      "For more than 50 years, he refused to tell his story.",
      "He wanted his children to have normal parents, unburdened by the weight of the Holocaust. But about 20 years ago, when he was in his 70s, his synagogue asked him to take part in a remembrance service. His wife, Shary, encouraged him to remember: Who will tell your story when you are gone?",
      "He never looked back.",
      "\u201cSilence never helps the oppressed,\u2019\u2019 Goldberg said. \u201cIt always helps the oppressors.\u201d",
      "The living room of Goldberg\u2019s home in London is a testament to all that matters to him, a gallery filled with pictures of children, grandchildren, great-grandchildren and a lifetime of family gatherings. To stand in the room is to see a man who is celebrating the miracle that he was allowed to live.",
      "But there\u2019s also another picture.",
      "It\u2019s a painting of a chubby-cheeked boy with a checkered bowtie and the hint of a smile on his lips. Hung beside the front door, just where it can be seen every time Goldberg steps out into the world, it\u2019s the picture of another boy who didn\u2019t get that chance.",

      "The anniversary has taken on added poignancy due to the advanced age of the survivors, and an awareness that they will soon be gone, even as rising warfare makes their warnings as relevant as ever.",
      "The Auschwitz-Birkenau State Museum says it expects about 50 survivors of Auschwitz and other camps to attend the events on Monday afternoon, joined by political leaders and royalty.",
      "On this occasion, the powerful will sit and listen to the voices of the former prisoners, while there is still time to hear them.",
      "The German authorities founded the Auschwitz concentration camp in 1940 in the Polish town of Oswiecim after their invasion of Poland in 1939. Early on it was a camp for Polish prisoners, including Catholic priests and members of the Polish underground resistance. The Germans later established some 40 camps in the area, but the most infamous is Birkenau, a vast site used for mass killings in gas chambers.",
      "Those arriving at Birkenau were brought in cramped, windowless cattle trains. At the infamous ramp, the Nazis selected those they could use as forced laborers. The others \u2014 the elderly, women, children and babies \u2014 were gassed to death soon after their arrival.",
      "Altogether the Germans murdered 6 million Jews, or two-thirds of all of Europe's Jews, in the Holocaust at Auschwitz and other camps, in ghettoes and in mass executions close to people's homes.",
      "On Jan. 27, 1945, Soviet troops arrived at the gates of the Auschwitz and found some 7,000 weak and emaciated prisoners.",
      "Boris Polevoy, a correspondent for the Soviet newspaper Pravda who was a first eyewitness, described a scene of unbelievable suffering: \u201cI saw thousands of tortured people whom the Red Army had saved \u2014 people so thin that they swayed like branches in the wind, people whose ages one could not possibly guess.\u201d",
      "At the time Allied troops were moving across Europe in a series of offensives against Germany. Soviet troops first liberated the Majdanek camp near Lublin in July 1944, and would go on to liberate Auschwitz, Stutthof and others.",
      "American and British forces, meanwhile, liberated camps to the west, including Buchenwald, Dachau, Mauthausen, Bergen-Belsen.",
      "After liberation day, some prisoners died of disease. Many confronted the grief of murdered parents and children, spouses and siblings. Entire families were wiped out.",
      "\u201cFor Jewish survivors, the liberation day is a very, very sad day,\u201d Havi Dreifuss, a historian of the Holocaust at Tel Aviv University said in a recent online discussion about the anniversary.",
      "Today the site is a museum and memorial managed by the Polish state, and is one of the most visited sites in Poland. Its mission is to preserve the objects there and the memory of what happened there; it organizes guided tours and its historians carry out research. In 2024, over 1.83 million people visited the site.",
      "The museum's challenges are huge, and include efforts to conserve barracks and other objects that were never intended to endure for long. One especially emotional project involves the conservation of shoes of murdered children.",
      "Auschwitz is not only the place where 1.1 million people, 90% of them Jews, were massacred. It also looms large in the world's collective memory as the embodiment of all the Nazis crimes, and an example of what hatred, racism and antisemitism can lead to.",
      "One reason that Auschwitz has emerged as the leading symbol of the Holocaust and other Nazi crimes is that it was also a labor camp and thousands survived, eyewitnesses who could tell the world what happened there.",
      "\u201cRelatively many people survived, which for example barely happened in sites which didn\u2019t have such a forced labor component,\u201d said Thomas Van de Putte, a scholar specialized in cultural and collective Holocaust memory at King\u2019s College London.",
      "Up to 900,000 people, mostly Jews, were murdered in Treblinka from 1942-43, and mass killings also took place at Belzec and other camps, but the Germans sought to cover up the evidence of their crimes, and there were almost no survivors.",
      "At Auschwitz, the Germans left behind barracks and watchtowers, the remains of gas chambers and the hair and personal belongings of people killed there. The \u201cArbeit Macht Frei\u201d (Work Will Set You Free) gate is recognized the world over.",
      "At Birkenau, what remains has also left its mark on the collective conscience. As Van der Putte notes: \u201cYou have the gate, you have the wagon. You have the incredibly long railway platform which leads to the former crematoria and gas chambers.\"",
      "Presidents, royalty, ambassadors, rabbis and priests will be joining the survivors in a heated tent set up at Birkenau on Monday afternoon.",
      "Germany, a country that for decades has been expressing remorse for the nation's crimes under Hitler, will be represented by both Chancellor Olaf Scholz and President Frank-Walter Steinmeier. Also attending will be the president of Austria, which was annexed by Germany in 1938, and Italy, whose dictator Benito Mussolini formed an alliance with Hitler.",
      "Others attending include Poland's President Andrzej Duda, Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau and French President Emmanuel Macron.",
      "Britain's King Charles III, who has long worked to promote Holocaust remembrance, will also attend along with other European royalty, including Spain\u2019s King Felipe VI.",
      "Russian President Vladimir Putin was an honored guest at the 60th anniversary in 2005, a testament to the Soviet role in liberating Auschwitz and the heavy price paid by Soviet troops in defeating Germany.",
      "But he is not welcome anymore due to Russian aggression in Ukraine. It will be the third year in a row \u2014 following Russia's full-scale invasion of Ukraine in February 2022 \u2014 with no Russia representative.",
      "\u201cThis is the anniversary of liberation. We remember the victims, but we also celebrate freedom. It is hard to imagine the presence of Russia, which clearly does not understand the value of freedom,\" museum director Piotr Cywi\u0144ski said.",
      "The war between Israel and Hamas in Gaza also created a stir about whether Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu should attend or not. The International Criminal Court, the world\u2019s top war crimes court, issued an arrest warrant for Netanyahu in November, accusing him of crimes against humanity for Israeli actions in Gaza. That meant that Poland, as a signatory, would have faced an obligation to arrest him.",
      "In the end, the Polish government adopted a resolution vowing to ensure the safe participation of the highest representatives of Israel. Israel, however, is sticking by plans to send its education minister, Yoav Kisch.",

      "The corpses keep coming every day, sometimes dozens at a time brought to morgues in the Palestinian enclave, after being pried from under 15 months of rubble and pulled from battle zones long too dangerous for search-and-rescue teams to reach",
      "DEIR AL-BALAH, Gaza Strip -- The corpses keep coming every day, sometimes dozens at a time, brought to morgues in the Gaza Strip after being pried from under 15 months of rubble and pulled from battle zones long too dangerous for search-and-rescue teams to reach.",
      "These bodies, dug up as a ceasefire took hold this week, are Gaza's \u201cmissing,\" the uncounted dead haunting families scattered by the war. For the Gaza Health Ministry, they were reduced to a bullet-point caveat beneath every daily death toll: \u201cA number of victims are still under the rubble and on the streets, and cannot be accessed.\u201d",
      "On Sunday, as a deal between Israel and Hamas paused the deadliest war in a century of Israeli-Palestinian conflict, families across the enclave scrambled to reunite with their loved ones \u2014 the living, the dead and the missing.",
      "Palestinians crowded the ruins that were once their homes, watching anxiously as civil defense teams hacked at the rubble in search of missing bodies. Each day of the ceasefire, the ministry has logged 50 to 120 recovered corpses.",
      "\u201cFrom the moment the truce began, we were searching and searching,\u201d said Samira Alshaar, 58, who returned Sunday to the house she fled nine months earlier when the southern city of Rafah came under attack. She watched as her son, Ibrahim Qeshta, was killed by an airstrike before he could escape with her.",
      "\u201cWe left our son behind,\" she said.",
      "Ibrahim's younger brother, Abdullah Qeshta, clawed Wednesday with his bare hands through blasted concrete and twisted rebar, his face shining with sweat and smeared with the dust of his family\u2019s life together. For three days, running on adrenaline, and anguish, he and the civil defense workers said they took breaks only to perform daily prayers and to sleep.",
      "Alshaar, looking on, said she felt herself losing hope.",
      "But suddenly, the men began to shout. They heaved stones and shards of concrete to the side.",
      "In the dirt were ragged pieces of 37-year-old Ibrahim's navy blue pajamas, the ones he was wearing on May 6, 2024, when Israeli airstrikes sent everyone running. Ibrahim was running in the opposite direction, shouting to his mother that he\u2019d be back in a second and was grabbing blankets inside. Then the house was struck, the walls collapsing onto him.",
      "\u201cThat\u2019s my brother's hair, I\u2019m certain, it is him,\u201d Abdullah Qeshta said, his voice trembling. \u201cOh God, thank you, God.\u201d",
      "Ibrahim's body was in a state of decay. But in some sense, Alshaar said, she felt \u201ccontent.\u201d She could give her son the dignity of a proper burial. She could find a place to mourn him.",
      "\u201cHe can rest now,\u201d she said.",
      "In an interview, Gaza health official Zaher al-Wahidi put the number of disappeared people and unrecovered bodies at roughly 8,000, based on reports from families about their missing loved ones.",
      "It's an estimate that's impossible to verify more than 15 months after Hamas launched its cross-border attack on Israel on Oct. 7, 2023, abducting some 250 people, killing about 1,200, mostly civilians, and triggering the Israeli military\u2019s retaliatory campaign.",
      "But rescue teams, experts and rights groups agree the Health Ministry\u2019s official death toll \u2014 47,283, as of Friday, with no distinction between civilians and combatants \u2014 is a significant undercount. Israel blames Hamas for the heavy civilian casualties because the group embeds itself in residential areas.",
      "\u201cMissing\u201d could mean bodies like Ibrahim\u2019s rotting under the ruins or in the blazing sun for months, authorities say. In parts of northern Gaza, where constant Israeli airstrikes and crossfire had blocked ambulances and rescue workers, residents tell of finding bloated corpses strewn in the streets.",
      "The missing, al-Wahidi said, also includes Palestinians killed and buried before they could be identified, or those marched into Israeli detention centers.",
      "Families who accept that their missing are dead have flocked to Gaza\u2019s forensics offices since the ceasefire took hold.",
      "At the main forensics center in Rafah on Wednesday, workers wrapped bodies and small piles of remains in white plastic body bags and placed them on the pavement. Inside, a man brought in to identify a loved one gasped, blinking at a pile of bones. He recognized the scarf and shoe of a family member that was found with them \u2014 exactly who was unclear. He was too distraught to talk. He let out a moan as he doubled over.",
      "Investigators scrawled names on the bags in green marker. If the identity remained unknown, they labeled the bags with numbers in hopes of the long-blockaded Gaza Strip one day obtaining the DNA testing that would allow authorities to return the unclaimed dead to their families.",
      "\u201cWe leave the numbered bags in a specially designated place where the ministry can identify them in the future,\u201d said Dr. Ahmed Zuhair, director of Rafah\u2019s Department of Forensic Medicine. \u201cAll we can do is ask international bodies to please, please help us.\u201d",
      "On Wednesday, officials said some of the recovered bodies had surfaced when recent rains washed away layers of dirt or had been dug up by wild dogs that ripped and scattered people's limbs.",
      "The rest of the remains were found following hours, sometimes days, of digging and hurling aside mountains of rubble with little more than shovels. Civil defense workers reported that Gaza has no more than three excavators \u2014 the kind of heavy machinery needed for rescue work.",
      "\u201cWe need help from hundreds of rubble removal specialists and thousands of large machines,\u201d said al-Wahidi. Otherwise, he warned, \"we will not be able to recover the bodies.\u201d",
      "Each day of the ceasefire so far, Mohammad Deifallah, like dozens of other Palestinians, has come to the forensics center in Rafah filled with despairing hope.",
      "On Wednesday, he unzipped body bag after body bag, cupping his hand over his nose because of the smell. His brother \u2014 who he lost 50 days ago, he said, in the chaotic search for safety as Israel\u2019s bombardment of Rafah intensified \u2014 was nowhere to be found.",
      "\u201cI don\u2019t know where to go. I checked all these bodies,\u201d Deifallah said, lifting a tarp to find a skeleton. \u201cNothing resembles him. Nothing is even recognizable.\"",

      "MEXICO CITY -- It may have been embraced by the Academy, but just a day after its debut in Mexico, the acclaimed \u201cnarco-musical\u201d Emilia P\u00e9rez was already drawing rebukes for superficial portrayals of sensitive subjects.",
      "The movie by French director Jacques Audiard debuted in Mexico on Thursday on the heels of wins at Cannes and the Golden Globes, as well at 13 Oscar nominations \u2013 a record for a non-English-language film.",
      "The film tells the story of a fictional Mexican drug trafficker nicknamed Manitas del Monte ( Karla Sofia Gasc\u00f3n ), who leaves behind her life of crime by becoming a transgender woman and activist searching for Mexico's thousands of disappeared. But problems arise from Manitas' uncontrollable jealousy toward her ex-wife Jessi (Selena Gomez), despite falling deeply in love with another woman Epifan\u00eda (Adriana Paz).",
      "Yet the ambitious \u201cEmilia P\u00e9rez\u201d and its star-studded cast met with a fizzle at the box office \u2013 20,000 attendees at its premiere and about US$74,000 (1.5 million pesos) \u2013 and mounting criticisms that it was a not-so-faithful portrayal of Mexico that glamorizes the violence that has long plagued the nation.",
      "Viewers filing out of theaters Thursday night said they had been eager or curious to see the movie after hearing it was the most nominated film at the Oscars.",
      "It was nominated for Best Picture, Best Actress for Gasc\u00f3n, Best Supporting Actress for Salda\u00f1a and two nominations for Best Original Song. That comes after receiving a number of prizes at its world premiere at Cannes and wins in four different categories at the Golden Globes.",
      "But many left with mixed feelings.",
      "Dora Pancardo said she found it entertaining to the point of not blinking during the musical numbers, but she did not like the film's portrayal of violence.",
      "\u201cThe director wanted to convey the part that we're in a violent society, which isn't a lie, but it seemed crude to me,\u201d said the 45-year-old mentor for women. \u201cI also didn't like that Selena Gomez spoke such bad Spanish. There's certain dialogue and certain expressions that we don't use in Mexico.\u201d",
      "The film's writing has been a frequent target of criticism, as well as a cast of leading actors that only includes one Mexican in a very supporting role - Paz - making for a mishmash of Spanish accents. It was also shot in France.",
      "Mexican film critic Gaby Meza said \u201cEmilia P\u00e9rez\u201d is \u201cexotic and bold,\u201d but without depth. \u201cNot in the trans experience, not in the narco experience, not in the disappeared, but rather a touch of everything like an ingredient to sweeten.\u201d",
      "While narco violence and the dramatic tales of cat-and-mouse between criminals and authorities in Latin America have long captured the imagination of Hollywood, they're also a point of trauma for many Mexicans who live with the consequences. of such violence.",
      "More than 121,000 people have gone missing in Mexico\u2019s drug war, according to federal government data. Families spend years searching for their missing loved ones and demanding justice, often putting their own lives at risk to do so.",
      "Among them was Artemisa Belmonte, who has sought justice for her mother and three uncles who went missing in the northern state of Chihuahua in 2011. Belmonte started a petition on Change.org asking that the movie not be released in Mexico.",
      "\u201cI feel like it's extremely offensive, overly simplistic, it makes it frivolous, I don't understand the point of making something like that and that it has so many awards,\u201d Belmonte said from Ciudad Juarez, across the border from El Paso.",
      "\u201cYou can\u2019t talk about the subject as if it were something to make a musical about,\u201d she said, stressing that the wound of disappearances is still open. \u201cEvidently they didn\u2019t investigate anything, they did not sit down with a person who has had a missing family member.\u201d",
      "During a press conference in Mexico, director Audiard assured that he approached the subject with prudence and reflection, but recognized the criticism.",
      "\u201cIf it seems to you that I do it too lightly, I apologize,\u201d he said.",
      "Prominent filmmakers like Guillermo del Toro, Issa L\u00f3pez, James Cameron, Denis Villeneuve and Meryl Streep have come to the movie\u2019s defense.",
      "H\u00e9ctor Ayala, a 58-year-old retiree, said he ran to theaters when he heard about the film\u2019s Oscar nominations.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s good that they\u2019re focusing on (the violence), that way governments and society will do more to stop problems like disappearances and organized crime,\u201d he said.",

      "\u201cIt's an international movie made to understand Mexico a little,\u201d said the 49-year-old financial adviser. \u201cSo the community that's unfamiliar with this Mexican problem and that doesn't go to see Mexican documentaries \u2014 because they're never going to see them \u2014 at least has an experience that helps them see a little more.\u201d",
      "L\u00e1urel Miranda, a transgender human rights advocate said she had received a casting call for the film looking for \"a middle-aged transgender actress with a robust build, because of course we trans women always have to be hardy,\u201d she said sarcastically.",
      "In addition infusing the movie with \u201csoap opera stereotypes\u201d of what transgender women should look like, Miranda questioned the original script that had Manitas only wanting to become a woman to evade justice. Gasc\u00f3n pushed to change the motivation to a woman looking to make her transition.",
      "For years, Mexico has been the second most deadly place in the world for transgender women, a reality not reflected in the film.",
      "\u201cEmilia P\u00e9rez is portrayed as an all-powerful character, even at the end as a saint, when in Mexico the reality for trans people is diametrically opposed, we should think about who this representation serves,\u201d she said."

      "The Chinese coast guard and navy\u2019s harassment of the Philippine vessels took place Friday near Sandy Cay, three small uninhabited sandbars planked by an artificial island base of Chinese forces and a Philippines-occupied island in the Spratlys archipelago, the coast guard said.",
      "The coast guard ships approached two larger vessels, which maneuvered to avoid a collision, and a Chinese navy helicopter flew low over two smaller boats deployed by the ships, forcing the survey to be called off.",
      "Videos released by the Philippine coast guard show a Chinese coast guard ship sailing very close to a ship officials identified as one of the Philippine vessels. Another video shows a Chinese military helicopter hovering low over the rough seas near a vessel flying a Philippine flag.",

      "The latest flare-out of the long-simmering territorial disputes in one of the world\u2019s busiest trade and security passageways could test President Donald Trump\u2019s commitment to maintain America\u2019s role as a counterweight to China, which has increasingly carried out assertive actions in the disputed waters.",

      "SEOUL -- South Koreans are repurposing flower wreaths and K-pop light sticks as political protest tools amid the nation\u2019s deepest political crisis in decades, sparked by President Yoon Suk Yeol\u2019s short-lived martial law declaration in December.",
      "Hundreds of wreaths, predominantly directed at Yoon himself, have been sent to his residence and government buildings connected to the impeachment proceedings, with some targeting other officials involved in the martial law controversy. Local media estimate the number of wreaths delivered to government offices as several thousand.",
      "While many wreaths carry moderate messages supporting Yoon or opposing impeachment, several contain extreme rhetoric directed at recipients. The black-ribboned funeral wreaths with white chrysanthemums and celebratory wreaths with vibrant roses and orchids, costing as much as $75, carry messages reflecting Korea\u2019s deepening political divide.",
      "The protest method has gained traction, with media coverage increasing in tandem over the last few years. A search on Big Kinds, which collects and analyzes articles from over 100 local news outlets, shows wreath protests received four times more media coverage in 2024 compared to 2023, reflecting the method\u2019s growing popularity. News articles about these protests started to appear in the early 2010s, though experts cannot specify their exact origin",
      "While dozens of flower shops say they haven\u2019t received protest wreath orders, and a handful of online blogs promote wreath sales emphasizing political neutrality, certain shops have become focal points for the movement.",
      "Yoon Miyoung, of Seoul-based Dongsung Flower, said she has delivered over 1,000 wreaths since December, exclusively for pro-Yoon supporters. \u201cWe\u2019ve sent out so many wreaths that Seoul is running out of flowers,\u201d she said, adding that over one-third of her customers are in their 20s and 30s, with orders coming from outside South Korea including Japan, United States and the Netherlands.",
      "\u201cEven though the form remains the same, the types of flowers or the messages differ,\u201d said Choi Hang-sub, a sociology professor at Kookmin University. \u201cWhile wreaths avoid physical violence, the messages on funeral wreaths have evolved into a form of offline hate speech, similar to malicious online comments but now decorated with flowers.\u201d",
      "Professor Kim Hern Sik, from Jungwon University, said wreath protests remain \u201can isolated form of demonstration limited to certain political groups,\u201d making it difficult to gain broader public support.",
      "Experts also raise concerns about wreath protests\u2019 environmental impact. \u201cMost wreaths use cheap, non-environmentally friendly materials that neither help flower farmers nor the environment,\u201d said Kim.",
      "However, Kim sees promise in younger generations\u2019 protest methods. \u201cK-pop fandom culture, especially centered around young women in their teens and 20s, is now being applied to political rallies,\u201d he said.",
      "Last December, outside the National Assembly where lawmakers voted to impeach Yoon, thousands of people wielded K-pop light sticks costing around $50 from popular bands like BIGBANG, NCT, and Epik High during pro-impeachment rallies.",
      "\u201cEven though these idol lightsticks are expensive ... people are bringing their most precious possessions to express their opinions,\u201d said Hong Gayeong, a 29-year-old protester at a Dec. 13 protest calling for Yoon\u2019s impeachment. The phenomenon has sparked a protest coalition, with some offering free shipping and light-stick rentals through popular resale apps.",
      "The crisis began when Yoon imposed military rule Dec. 3 and dispatched troops to the National Assembly, leading to his impeachment 11 days later. Yoon was apprehended Jan. 19 in a massive law enforcement operation at his residential compound.",
      "The Constitutional Court now has 180 days to decide whether to formally remove him from office or reinstate him as he faces potential rebellion charges.",

      "DAKAR, Senegal -- Fighting has escalated sharply in recent weeks in eastern Congo, where rebels have seized key towns and are closing in on the city of Goma, the government\u2019s last stronghold in the region bordering Rwanda.",
      "The offensive by the Rwanda-backed M23 rebel group has stretched local hospitals to the limit, with hundreds of wounded coming in every day as civilians get caught in the crossfire. Thousands have been displaced, exacerbating an existing humanitarian crisis and prompting fears of an all-out regional war.",
      "Here is what to know about the fighting:",
      "Explosions from Goma's outskirts have been reverberating across the city of 2 million people this week. Schools and stores are closed and police are out in full force. Military checkpoints, erected overnight, stop and check all vehicles.",
      "On Friday, the governor of eastern Congo\u2019s North Kivu province, where Goma is the provincial capital, died of wounds sustained on the front line. The circumstances of Maj. Gen Peter Cirimwami's death were not immediately known \u2014 he was visiting troops fighting the rebels when he was wounded.",
      "On Thursday, the rebels seized Sake, a town only 27 kilometers (16 miles) from Goma, sending panic surging as concerns mounted that the city could soon fall. Earlier in the week, they captured Minova, a strategically important port on the shores of Lake Kivu, and also the towns of Katale and Masisi, west of Goma.",
      "Most of the fighting between the Congolese army and the rebels on Friday was focused on Kibumba, a town about 25 kilometers (15 miles) north of Goma, and also around Sake.",
      "The M23 rebels \u2014 or The March 23 Movement \u2014 is one of about 100 armed groups vying for a foothold in the mineral-rich region in a decades-long conflict in eastern Congo. In recent weeks, the rebels have made significant territorial gains, seizing towns and villages and encircling Goma.",
      "The group was created in 2012 after the failed integration of ethnic Tutsis who broke away from the Congolese army. It claims to defend Tutsi from discrimination but critics say it's a pretext for Rwanda to obtain economic and political influence over eastern Congo.",
      "\u201cStudies have long highlighted the smuggling of resources\" from Congo into Rwanda, said Ladd Serwat, senior Africa analyst with U.S.-based Armed Conflict Location & Event Data Project. \u201cCongolese officials increasingly accuse Rwanda of pursuing control over the region\u2019s resources and aiming to annex parts\u201d of Congo.",
      "In territories under its control, M23 implements its own tax system, runs a local government and controls natural resources.",
      "Congo, the United States and U.N. experts accuse Rwanda of backing the M23, which had only hundreds of members in 2021. Now, according to the United Nations, the group has around 6,500 fighters.",
      "While Rwanda denies that claim, it acknowledged last year that it has troops and missile systems in eastern Congo, allegedly to safeguard its security. U.N. experts estimate there are up to 4,000 Rwandan forces in Congo.",
      "Serwat, the Africa analyst, says that Rwanda's engagement has brought it into direct conflict with Congolese forces, \u201cescalating political tensions\u201d between the neighbors.",
      "A \u201cdeclaration of war\" by Congo against Rwanda would risk turning \"into a regional conflict in East Africa,\u201d said Darren Davids, an analyst with the Economist Intelligence Unit.",
      "The U.N. refugee agency says more than 400,000 people have been displaced in eastern Congo since the beginning of the year, exacerbating \u201cdesperate conditions\u201d in severely overcrowded displacement centers in and around Goma and triggering an increase in cholera cases.",
      "Jean Claude Bauma, 35, fled Masisi when M23 overran the town and was staying with his family at the Nzulo camp for the displaced on the outskirts of Goma. But relentless shelling near the camp forced the father of five to flee into the city center this week.",
      "\u201cWe fear for our lives, since the birth of my children, we have been fleeing the war,\u201d Bauma told the AP. \u201cThis time ... if it\u2019s to die, I will die here.\u201d",
      "The city is a regional hub for trade, security and humanitarian efforts, and its airport is key for transporting supplies.",
      "Back in 2012, the rebels seized Goma and controlled it for about a week but after mounting international pressure on Rwanda \u2014 including suspension of aid from the United States and Britain \u2014 the M23 surrendered the city.",
      "Since 2021, Congo\u2019s government and allied forces, including Burundian troops and U.N. troops, have been keeping the rebels away from Goma.",
      "\u201cThe capture of such a large city\u201d will certainly be a huge boost for the rebels and a major defeat of the government forces, said Davids, the economist.",
      "Its fall would also have a \u201ccatastrophic impact on hundreds of thousands of civilians, putting them at risk of heightened exposure to human rights violations and abuses,\u201d said Ravina Shamdasani of the U.N. human rights office.",
      "Francois Moreillon, head of the International Committee of the Red Cross for Congo, said he's worried also that ICRC staff running the main hospital in Goma would have to evacuate. If the hospital and the staff were no longer safe, who would treat the patients, he asked.",
      "\"This situation is simply unacceptable,\u201d Moreillon said."

      "The secessionist campaign in southeastern Nigeria dates back to the 1960s when the short-lived Republic of Biafra fought and lost a civil war from 1967 to 1970 to become independent from the West African country. An estimated 1 million people died in the conflict, many from starvation.",

      "A community in southern Madagascar has pulled together to save thousands of critically endangered tortoises that were swept away from their sanctuary and left swimming for their lives in floods this month caused by a tropical cyclone",
      "CAPE TOWN, South Africa -- A community in southern Madagascar has pulled together to save thousands of critically endangered tortoises swept away from their sanctuary and left swimming for their lives in floods this month caused by a tropical cyclone.",
      "The 12,000 radiated and spider tortoises that were housed at the Lavavolo Tortoise Center had been confiscated from illegal wildlife traffickers but faced a new and unexpected ordeal when Cyclone Dikeledi hit the southern part of the Indian Ocean island in mid-January. Flood waters a meter (3.2 feet) high engulfed the sanctuary, and the tortoises \u2014 many of them mere whippersnappers in the tortoise world at about 25-50 years old \u2014 were carried away.",
      "Sanctuary staff, members of the community and even police officers joined together in a rescue operation, wading through the water with large containers to collect the bewildered tortoises. Some rescuers converted damaged building structures into makeshift rafts for the tortoises to ride on as they moved around to find others.",
      "Hery Razafimamonjiraibe, the Madagascar director for the Turtle Survival Alliance, which runs the sanctuary, said they were optimistic that they had saved more than 10,000 tortoises, although they still had to do an official count. That's not easy, he said, as tortoises can move faster than you think when they want to and rarely cooperate.",
      "The rescuers had recovered around 700 dead tortoises so far, which Razafimamonjiraibe said were trapped by rocks and debris in the floods.",
      "\u201cFortunately, most of the tortoises were able to float,\u201d Razafimamonjiraibe said. \u201cTortoises are actually very good swimmers,\u201d he added. \u201cYou should see them.\u201d",
      "While most of the tortoises have been returned to the sanctuary, the floods were a blow to the center, which has lost much of its infrastructure, said the Turtle Survival Alliance.",
      "Lavavolo Tortoise Center underwent a major renovation in 2018 when authorities seized a group of 10,000 radiated tortoises from wildlife traffickers and needed somewhere to keep them. More confiscated tortoises arrived later.",
      "Most of the tortoises at Lavavolo are radiated tortoises, which are native to Madagascar and the nearby islands of Reunion and Mauritius. They generally grow to about 30 centimeters (11,8 inches) in length but are long-lived and can reach 100 years or more.",
      "British explorer Captain James Cook is believed to have given a radiated tortoise to the Tongan royal family as a gift in 1777. The tortoise reportedly died in 1966 at the age of 188.",
      "Radiated and spider tortoises are critically endangered in Madagascar because of habitat destruction and poaching. They are eaten, but also illegally trafficked to be sold as pets because of the striking yellow and black markings on their shells, Razafimamonjiraibe said.",
      "There were once tens of millions of radiated tortoises in Madagascar, the Turtle Alliance said, but their numbers have been drastically reduced and they've disappeared from 65% of their natural habitat.",

Officials from the Philippine coast guard and military, and the education secretary, were also present.",

      "However, the Houthis have run a campaign targeting U.N. staff, aid workers and others for some time.",
      "The group has also been airing repeated programs on television channels they control parading people they describe as working with Western intelligence agencies or the Israelis.",
      "The war in Yemen has killed more than 150,000 people, including fighters and civilians, and created one of the world\u2019s worst humanitarian disasters, killing tens of thousands more.",
      "The Houthis\u2019 attacks on shipping during the Israel-Hamas war have helped deflect attention from their problems at home. But they have faced casualties and damage from U.S.-led airstrikes targeting the group for months now, as well as other strikes by Israel.",
      "Thousands have been imprisoned by the Houthis during the war. An AP investigation found some detainees were scorched with acid, forced to hang from their wrists for weeks at a time or were beaten with batons. Meanwhile, the Houthis have employed child soldiers and indiscriminately laid mines in the conflict."

      "MOSCOW -- The Kremlin insisted Friday that a settlement in Ukraine couldn\u2019t be facilitated by a drop in global oil prices as U.S. President Donald Trump has suggested.",
      "Speaking by video from the White House to the annual World Economic Forum in Davos, Switzerland, Trump said on Thursday that the OPEC+ alliance of oil exporting countries shares responsibility for the nearly three-year conflict in Ukraine because it has kept oil prices too high.",
      "\u201cIf the price came down, the Russia-Ukraine war would end immediately,\u201d Trump said. Energy sales form a large part of Russia's earnings.",
      "Asked about Trump's comments, Kremlin spokesperson Dmitry Peskov affirmed Moscow's view that the Ukrainian conflict was triggered by the West's refusal to take into account Russian security interests.",
      "\u201cThe conflict doesn't depend on oil prices,\u201d Peskov said in a conference call with reporters. \u201cThe conflict is ongoing because of the threat to Russia\u2019s national security, the threat to Russians living on those territories and the refusal by the Americans and the Europeans to listen to Russia\u2019s security concerns. It\u2019s not linked to oil prices.\u201d",
      "He said Russian President Vladimir Putin remains ready for contacts with Trump.",
      "Peskov's comments echoed Putin\u2019s statements that he had to send troops into Ukraine in February 2022 to fend off a threat to Russia\u2019s security resulting from plans for Ukraine to join NATO and to protect Russian speakers living there. Ukraine and the West have denounced Moscow\u2019s action as an unprovoked act of aggression.",
      "Asked to comment on Trump\u2019s claim that Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy is ready for a peace deal, Peskov pointed out the Ukrainian leader\u2019s earlier decision to rule out any talks with Moscow.",
      "\u201cZelenskyy can\u2019t be ready for a deal,\u201d Peskov told reporters, adding that \u201cin order to reach a settlement it\u2019s necessary to conduct talks, and Zelenskyy forbade himself to hold talks by his own decree.\u201d",
      "On Wednesday, Trump threatened to impose stiff taxes, tariffs and sanctions on Russia if an agreement isn\u2019t reached to end the war in Ukraine.",
      "Peskov said that the Kremlin was closely following Trump's statements and noted that he imposed a slew of sanctions during his first term. He said Moscow \u201cremains ready for an equal dialogue, for a mutually respectful dialogue.\u201d",
      "\u201cThis dialogue took place between the two presidents during Trump\u2019s first presidency. And we are waiting for signals that we have not received yet,\u201d Peskov said.",

      "Indonesia has signed a deal to send home an ailing French national on death row for drug offenses",
      "JAKARTA, Indonesia -- Indonesia signed a deal on Friday to repatriate an ailing French national who has been on death row since 2007 for alleged drug offenses.",
      "In 2015 Serge Atlaoui won a last-minute reprieve from being executed by a 13-member firing squad.",
      "The transfer agreement was signed remotely by Indonesia\u2019s senior minister of law Yusril Ihza Mahendra and France\u2019s Minister of Justice G\u00e9rald Darmanin, and was witnessed by delegations from both countries in Jakarta and Paris.",
      "It came after Atlaoui, 61, made a last-ditch plea to be returned home last month.",
      "The father of four, who is reportedly suffering from cancer, wrote to the Indonesian government requesting to serve the rest of his sentence in France. The deal will allow him to return home on Feb. 4, Mahendra said.",
      "\u201cThe Indonesian government has decided not to execute the prisoner and has agreed to transfer him to France,\u201d Mahendra told a joint news conference attended by France's ambassador to Indonesia, Fabien Penone.",
      "Penone thanked the Indonesian government for granting Atlaoui's request.",
      "\"We want to develop our legal cooperation in a much more straightforward way,\u201d Penone said, adding: \u201cWe are reinforcing our bilateral relationship, we have a real partnership.\u201d",
      "Atlaoui was arrested in 2005 for his alleged involvement in a factory manufacturing the psychedelic drug MDMA, sometimes called ecstasy, on the outskirts of Jakarta. His lawyers say he was employed as a welder at the factory and did not understand what the chemicals on the premises were used for.",
      "Atlaoui, from Metz, has maintained his innocence during his 19 years\u2019 incarceration, claiming that he was installing machinery in what he thought was an acrylics plant. Police accused him of being a \u201cchemist\u201d at the site. He was initially sentenced to life, but the Supreme Court in 2007 increased the sentence to death on appeal.",
      "His case has drawn attention in France, which vigorously opposes the death penalty \u201cin all places and under all circumstances.\u201d",
      "Mahendra said the French government had informed him that the maximum criminal penalty in France was 30 years imprisonment.",
      "Once repatriated, \u201cthe authority to treat the convict is entirely under French government,\u201d Mahendra said. If the France want to pardon Atlaoui or grant clemency, \u201cthat is entirely their authority and which we must also respect,\u201d the minister added.",
      "Indonesia executed eight death-row prisoners in May 2015, but Atlaoui was granted a stay of execution because he still had an outstanding court appeal. An Administrative Court in Jakarta denied that appeal the following month.",
      "Indonesia\u2019s government last month returned Mary Jane Veloso, a Filipina woman who had been on death row and who was nearly executed by firing squad in 2015, after longstanding requests from her home country.",
      "Five Australian who spent almost 20 years in Indonesian prisons for heroin trafficking also returned to Australia in December under a deal struck between the governments.",
      "The United Nations Office on Drugs and Crime says Indonesia is a major drug smuggling hub despite having some of the strictest drug laws in the world, in part because international drug syndicates target its young population.",
      "About 530 people are on death row in Indonesia, mostly for drug-related crimes, including nearly 100 foreigners, the Ministry of Immigration and Corrections\u2019 data showed last month. Indonesia\u2019s last executions, of a citizen and three foreigners, were carried out in July 2016."

      "Relatives of hostages still being held by militants in Gaza have called on Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu to ensure all remaining captives are freed",
      "TEL AVIV, Israel -- Relatives of hostages still being held by militants in Gaza called on Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu Friday to ensure all remaining captives are freed, while also appealing to U.S. President Donald Trump to continue pressing for their release.",
      "As a fragile six-week ceasefire between Israel and Hamas entered its sixth day, Israelis waited anxiously for the names of the next four hostages who will be released from among the more than 90 still held in Gaza.",
      "In the Palestinian enclave, civilians in the central and southern part of the Gaza Strip hoping to return to the remnants of their home in the battered north faced an agonizing wait.",
      "Israel believes about a third, or possibly as many as half, of the more than 90 hostages still in Gaza have died. Hamas has not released definitive information on how many captives are still alive or the names of those who have died.",
      "\u201cDear President Trump, first of all we want to say thank you for the happy moments we felt this week. But we want to tell you we still have 94 hostages, we need them all at home,\u201d said Ayelet Samerano, whose son Yonatan Samerano is among those still being held. \u201cPlease do not stop. Please continue to press and do everything so that all the 94 hostages will come home immediately.\u201d",
      "In the first phase of the ceasefire deal, 33 hostages are expected to be released gradually in return for hundreds of Palestinian prisoners held by Israel.",
      "The first three Israeli hostages were freed in exchange for 90 Palestinian prisoners on Sunday, the first day of the ceasefire that has halted the 15-month war that has devastated Gaza. Wide swathes of the territory have been destroyed, while more than 47,000 Palestinians have been killed, according to Gaza health authorities, who do not differentiate between combatants and civilians but say more than half are women and children.",
      "According to the deal, on Friday Hamas is to announce the names of the next four hostages to be released on Saturday, after which Israel will also release a list of which Palestinian prisoners will be freed.",
      "The hostages were among about 250 men, women and children captured by militants who burst across the border into Israel on Oct. 7, 2023, killing around 1,200 people in an attack that sparked the war in Gaza. About 100 were released during a brief ceasefire in November that year, while the bodies of around three dozen hostages have been recovered in Gaza and eight hostages have been rescued by the army.",
      "\u201cI call from here to the Prime Minister and negotiating team -- you\u2019re doing excellent work -- do whatever is necessary to bring everyone back, to the last hostage,\u201d Samerano said. \u201cWe ask you to ensure phase two of the deal is agreed upon before finishing the current phrase. We cannot continue living in uncertainty. All hostages must return, and none of them has time left.\u201d",
      "The 33 to be released in the first phase will include women, children, sick people and those over 50 \u2014 almost all civilians, though the deal also commits Hamas to freeing all living female soldiers in Phase 1. Hamas will release living hostages first, but could release some bodies if they don\u2019t have enough living hostages in this category. Male soldiers are not expected to be released in the first phase.",
      "\u201cThis week we were moved to watch images of mothers embracing their daughters, but our hearts break thinking that my son Nimrod and other men remain behind, and each day they\u2019re there poses a real danger to their lives,\u201d said Vicky Cohen, whose son Nimrod Cohen is among the hostages. \u201cThe worry that the deal won\u2019t be fully implemented gnaws at us all. All senior officials openly say that stopping the deal means a death sentence for those left behind.\u201d",
      "Under the terms of the deal, Palestinians in Gaza will have more freedom of movement from the north to the south of the enclave. Civilians in the south will be allowed to take a coastal road to northern Gaza from Saturday, when Israeli troops are expected to withdraw from the key route and Hamas is set to release the next four Israeli hostages.",
      "Those in other parts of the strip seized on the ceasefire this week to reunite with scattered family members, picking their way through vast swaths of rubble and trying to salvage what remained of their homes and their belongings. But those displaced from the north have had to wait.",
      "\u201cThe first thing I\u2019ll do, I\u2019ll kiss the dirt of the land on which I was born and raised,\u201d said Nadia Al-Debs, one of the many people gathered in makeshift tents in Gaza\u2019s central city of Deir al-Balah preparing to set out for home in Gaza City the next day. \u201cWe\u2019ll return so my children can see their father.\u201d",
      "Nafouz al-Rabai, another displaced woman in Deir al-Balah from al-Shati, along the coast in Gaza City, said the day she walks home will be a \u201cday of joy for us.\u201d",
      "The return stirs bittersweet emotions. Al-Rabai acknowledged it would be painful to absorb the scale of damage to the home and the urban refugee camp she knew and loved. \u201cGod knows if I\u2019ll find (my house) standing or not,\u201d she said. \u201cIt\u2019s a very bad life.\u201d",

      "Speaking on state radio, Orb\u00e1n said that Ukraine's decision to cease transiting Russian gas into Central Europe through the Brotherhood pipeline had forced Hungary to turn to alternative routes, which raised energy prices.",
      "Meanwhile, he claimed EU sanctions against Russia for its war in Ukraine had cost Hungary 19 billion euros ($20 billion) since the start of the full-scale invasion in February 2022. He did not cite how that sum was calculated.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s no good that we pay for the economic consequences of sanctions to help Ukraine while they turn around and mess with us,\u201d he said of Kyiv's decision to allow a prewar transit deal with Russia to expire at the end of 2024.",
      "Natural gas prices did spike at the beginning of the year following the expiration of Ukraine's transit contract with Russia, though an increase in liquefied natural gas shipments to Europe has kept prices fluctuating.",

      "Orb\u00e1n, considered to have the closest relationship with the Kremlin of any other EU leader, has long been a vocal opponent of EU sanctions against Moscow, though he has ultimately always voted for them.",
      "But following the inauguration of U.S. President Donald Trump last week, Orb\u00e1n has publicly demanded an end to sanctions, raising the possibility that he would veto the newest round which must be decided by Jan. 31.",
      "\u201cThe question of extending the sanctions is now on the agenda, and I pulled the handbrake and asked European leaders to understand that this cannot be continued,\" he said Friday. \u201cIt is not possible that Hungary will pay the price of the sanctions in this proportion.\u201d",
      "\u201cI told my (EU) colleagues to please understand that we are asking for help,\" he continued. \"We ask that they be able to get the Ukrainians to restore the gas pipeline.\u201d",

      "Discount store chain Target says it\u2019s joining rival Walmart and a number of other prominent American brands in scaling back corporate diversity, equity and inclusion initiatives",
      "NEW YORK -- Discount store chain Target said Friday that it would join rival Walmart and a number of other prominent American brands in scaling back diversity, equity and inclusion initiatives that have come under attack from conservative activists and, as of this week, the White House.",
      "The Minneapolis-based retailer said the changes to its \u201cBelonging at the Bulleye\u201d strategy would include ending a program it established to help Black employees build meaningful careers, improve the experience of Black shoppers and to promote Black-owned businesses following the police killing of George Floyd in 2020.",
      "Target, which operates nearly 2,000 stores nationwide and employs more than 400,000 people, said it also would conclude the diversity, equity and inclusion, or DEI, goals it previously set in three-year cycles.",
      "The goals included hiring and promoting more women and members of racial minority groups, and recruiting more diverse suppliers, including businesses owned by people of color, women, LGBTQ+ people, veterans and people with disabilities.",
      "In a memo to employees, Kiera Fernandez, Target\u2019s chief community impact and equity officer, as a \u201cnext chapter\u201d in a decades-long process to create \u201cinclusive work and guest environments that welcome all.\u201d",
      "\u201cMany years of data, insights, listening and learning have been shaping this next chapter in our strategy,\u201d Fernandez wrote in the memo, which Target shared Friday. \u201cAnd as a retailer that serves millions of consumers every day, we understand the importance of staying in step with the evolving external landscape, now and in the future.\u201d",
      "There's no doubt the U.S. civil rights landscape has undergone a massive transformation in the five years since much of corporate America adopted DEI goals in response to the Black Lives Matter protests that followed Floyd's death in Minneapolis.",
      "A 2023 U.S. Supreme Court decision that outlawed affirmative action in college admissions emboldened conservative groups to bring or threaten lawsuits targeting corporate initiatives such as employee resource groups and hiring practices that prioritize historically marginalized groups.",
      "Walmart, McDonald\u2019s , Ford, Harley-Davison and John Deere are among the well-known consumer brands that reduced or phased out their DEI commitments in recent months.",
      "President Donald Trump this week signaled his administration's agreement with conservatives who argue that policies designed to increase minority representation by considering factors such as race, gender and sexual orientation are unconstitutional.",
      "On his first day in office, Trump signed an executive order aimed at ending DEI programs across the federal government. The order calls for revoking all DEI mandates, policies, preferences and activities, along with the review and revision of existing employment practices, union contracts, and training policies or programs.",
      "Unlike some of the companies retooling or retiring their diversity initiatives, Target's work to build a more inclusive workforce predated 2020, and the company also was long seen as a trailblazer with respect to LGBTQ+ inclusion.",
      "But the employee memo shared Friday said Target no longer would participate in surveys designed to gauge the effectiveness of its actions, including an annual index compiled by the Human Rights Campaign, a national LGBTQ+ rights organization. Target said it would further evaluate corporate partnerships to ensure they\u2019re connected directly to business objectives, but declined to share details.",
      "Getting corporations to withdraw from the Human Rights Campaign's Corporate Equality Index and to stop sponsoring Pride activities have been goals of DEI opponents.",
      "Steering clear of a backlash from conservative customers and organizations is something that Target has tried to navigate for a while. As transgender rights became a more prominent issue in 2016, the company declared that \u201cinclusivity is a core belief at Target\u201d and said it supported transgender employees and customers using whichever restroom or fitting room \u201ccorresponds with their gender identity.\u201d",
      "But after some customers threatened to boycott Target stores, the company said that more stores would make available a single-toilet bathroom with a door that could be locked.",
      "In 2023, Target removed some of its Pride Month merchandise after online complaints and in-store confrontations that the retailer said threatened employees\u2019 well-being. The company decided last year not to stock Pride Month products at every U.S. store.",
      "Still, some prominent companies have resisted public pressure to retreat from their diversity plans. On Thursday, Costco shareholders rejected a proposal urging the wholesale club operator to evaluate any risks posed by its diversity, equity and inclusion practices.",
      "According to preliminary results shared by Costco executives, more than 98% of shares voted against the proposal submitted by a conservative think tank based in Washington. Costco's board of directors had recommended a no vote.",

      "Utah lawmakers have advanced a bill that experts say would establish one of the most restrictive labor laws in the country",
      "SALT LAKE CITY -- Utah lawmakers advanced a bill Thursday that experts say would establish one of the most restrictive labor laws in the country as Republicans seek to curb the political influence of unions serving teachers and other public service professionals.",
      "The GOP proposal would ban collective bargaining across all of Utah's public sectors \u2014 education, transit, law enforcement and more. It would bar labor unions from negotiating on behalf of workers for better wages and working conditions.",
      "Many educators, the state's most frequent users of collective bargaining, view the bill as way for Republicans to weaken teachers unions and clear a path for their own education agenda.",
      "\u201cThe harm of the bill will be borne by public school educators living and working in every single legislative district,\u201d said Sara Jones of the Utah Education Association. \u201cIt sends a message that educators don\u2019t deserve a collective voice in their profession, don\u2019t deserve input on their salaries or working conditions or benefits, or don\u2019t deserve a say in the policies that impact their classrooms.\u201d",
      "Teachers unions are some of the most outspoken opponents of Republican policies in Utah and other states where lawmakers have sought to eliminate diversity, equity and inclusion programs, expand school choice vouchers and restrict transgender bathroom use and sports participation in schools.",
      "The unions tend to skew liberal, which Republicans argue makes them unfit to represent teachers with conservative political views.",
      "\u201cWe need all voices to be heard in the teaching profession, and not just those that align with the union and their political views,\u201d said Cole Kelley, a Republican on Utah\u2019s State Board of Education who teaches high school in American Fork.",
      "State Rep. Jordan Teuscher, a South Jordan Republican who is sponsoring the bill, said collective bargaining agreements often restrict workers from participating in their own contract negotiations, only allowing communication between the union representative and the employer. The bill creates a system in which employers can engage directly with all employees when addressing workplace concerns, he said.",
      "The measure passed the GOP-led House Business, Labor and Commerce Committee in a 11-4 vote with support from some of the state\u2019s most powerful Republicans, including House Speaker Mike Schultz.",
      "State employees could still join unions under the bill, but the unions could not formally negotiate on their behalf.",
      "President Donald Trump has backed policies making it harder for workers to unionize, yet his populist appeal helped Republicans make steady gains among union members in the 2024 election. Republicans have tried to bring some blue-collar workers into the fold, but largely from the private sector, said John Logan, a labor expert at San Francisco State University.",
      "\u201cRepublicans see teachers unions as the main obstacle to transforming public education the way they would like to,\u201d Logan told The Associated Press. \u201cThey want the working class on their side, but public sector unions, they don't have any use for them. Ideologically, they're just an obstacle.\u201d",
      "Logan said Utah's bill is \u201cfairly extreme\u201d and would place the state among the most restrictive for public sector unions, along with North Carolina and South Carolina.",
      "Collective bargaining has been banned for decades across all public sector jobs in the Carolinas. The two states have flip-flopped between having the lowest percentage of union workers in the country for the past two decades, with South Carolina currently in lowest spot at 3%, according to the Bureau of Labor Statistics.",
      "In Texas and Georgia, only police and firefighters have the right to bargain. They could not do so under the Utah bill, which also faced opposition from firefighters who worried they would not be able to advocate for proper worker safety without union support."

That figure represents an 85.3% increase from 2023, when losses totaled about $117.5 billion. It's also the largest annual tally of economic losses from natural disasters since 2017.",
      "Insured losses, or the portion of economic losses that are covered by insurance, also rose last year. They climbed 36% to $112.7 billion, the most since 2022.",
      "Hurricane Helene tore across six southeastern states last fall, costing $75 billion in economic losses, mainly due to inland and coastal flooding. according to Aon.

      "The promise is not new but it\u2019s still hard to believe: 100% of profits from the sale of Newman\u2019s Own foods, like salad dressings and popcorn, are donated to charity",
      "The promise is not new, but still hard for many to believe: 100% of profits from the sale of Newman\u2019s Own foods, like salad dressings, pasta sauce and popcorn, are donated to charity.",
      "And to celebrate what would have been company founder Paul Newman \u2019s 100th birthday on Jan. 26, the Newman's Own Foundation is inviting others to join them in that commitment, as part of the 100% for Purpose Club.",
      "In a TED talk released Thursday, Alex Amouyel, the foundation\u2019s CEO and president, made the case for why more for-profit companies should donate all of their profits to social causes. She also pledged that the foundation will provide guidance and advice to organizations that want to make the switch.",
      "\u201cIt is trying to be a proof point and trying to serve as a model for a completely different type of organization,\u201d Amouyel told The Associated Press in an interview.",
      "Newman, who was a megawatt, Oscar-winning Hollywood star and whose face adorns all the product's labels, founded the food company in 1982. When he died in 2008, he donated it to his foundation.",
      "Newman's Own's structure is not one-of-a-kind, but it is unusual, especially in the U.S.",
      "Companies and founders reach out informally all the time, Amouyel said, and she hopes that more will seriously consider it. An Australian company, Humanitix, also donates 100% of their profits from selling event tickets to charity and is the second founding member of The 100% for Purpose Club.",
      "It is easier for companies to follow the Newman's Own model after Congress passed the Philanthropic Enterprise Act in 2018. The company lobbied for the legislation for years because after Newman's death, they found themselves in a bit of dilemma, said Celia Roady, a partner at Morgan Lewis and an attorney for Newman\u2019s Own Foundation.",
      "At the time, foundations were prohibited from owning more than 20% of any company in an effort to ensure that they focused on their charitable work. The Philanthropic Enterprise Act, which then-President Donald Trump signed into law, allows foundations to own corporations with some conditions.",
      "\u201cThey\u2019re not trying to open up any big loopholes,\u201d Roady said, but instead pursued narrow changes \u201cthat would let companies that were wanting to give it all away to be owned by a private foundation, which seems like a logical owner for a company that has that kind of initiative.\u201d",
      "Those conditions were that the foundation must own the company entirely, that the company must donate 100% of its profits to charity, that a majority of the foundation\u2019s board must be independent of both the company and the donor, and that the donor may no longer be involved in the company\u2019s operation.",
      "In launching an invitation for companies to join them, Newman's Own is also offering other levels of participation for companies that have committed a smaller percentage of their profits to charity or resources for companies or employees to learn more about how their organization might donate more of their profits to a social purpose. Amouyel said they know other foundations or companies may pursue different structures.",
      "Humanitix is organized differently, in part because they are incorporated in Australia. Another high-profile example, the outdoor clothing company Patagonia, reorganized in 2022 to transfer its ownership to a trust and to donate its profits to a nonprofit advocacy organization that will campaign to protect the planet.",
      "Amouyel said these models offer a path forward for those who believe that capitalism works better than any other system, but isn\u2019t working well enough to do good in the world.",
      "\u201cThis allows you to use its power and to generate money, but then to make sure that the money is not about making rich people richer and richer and richer,\u201d she said, adding that she knows this won't work for all businesses or sectors, but thinks it can work for more.",
      "Nien-h\u00ea Hsieh, a professor at Harvard Business School, has studied Patagonia's transformation and he sees value in having different ownership models and a diversity of organizational forms across the economy.",
      "\u201cWhether it\u2019s a concern about monopoly or concentrated ownership\" or \"the idea that, if you have a broader array or diverse array of shareholders, that may lead companies to focus on different kinds of ends and goals and be aware of some of the harms they\u2019re causing,\u201d he said.",
      "In 2022, Newman's Own said it had given away $600 million to charities over the years, with a focus on supporting children. Newman founded a network of camps for seriously ill kids, which continue to operate across the country today, like Camp Boggy Creek near Orlando, Florida, which provides a free experience for campers and their families. The foundation also supports nutrition education in schools and food justice for Indigenous communities.",
      "So far, it's not clear that any other companies have used the Philanthropic Enterprise Act to donate a company to be fully owned by a foundation and to give away 100% of its profits. But Roady, the attorney for Newman's Own, thinks it's still too early to judge the law's impact.",
      "\u201cIn the scheme of things, the legislation is still pretty recent,\" she said. \"And so there\u2019s still lots of time.\u201d",

      "LONDON -- Should I stay or should I go \u2014 from Meta's social media platforms?",
      "That's what some Facebook, Instagram and Threads users are wondering after Meta CEO Mark Zuckerberg's announcement this month that the company is relaxing rules on harmful content such as hate speech and abandoning its fact checking program and replacing it with crowdsourced notes.",
      "The changes have renewed interest among some users about deleting their Meta social media accounts. If you want to stop using platforms owned by Meta, here are some pointers:",
      "Before deleting your Facebook account, you should download a copy of all your personal information, which includes details about your activity on the platform, things you've shared and data that the company has collected about you.",
      "You'll have to go to your settings or the accounts center \u2014 the master control panel for all your Meta accounts \u2014 where you can choose to download everything or just items such as your profile, posts, messages, comments and reactions, and list of friends, even the ads you\u2019ve clicked on and IP addresses you\u2019ve used to connect to Facebook.",
      "You can download information from a certain date range, such as the past month or six months, or for all the time you've had an account. If you're downloading photos, you can select their quality level: low, medium, high.",
      "For security purposes, you'll only have four days to download your file. The process is similar for Instagram and Threads users.",
      "Instagram users will need a password to download and access files and it could take up to 30 days to receive a download link by email, the platform says on its help page.",
      "Maybe you don\u2019t want to download all your personal information but instead want to get any photos and videos you've posted. Facebook provides a separate option to transfer these files to another online service, with options including Google Photos, Dropbox or Photobucket.",
      "A tip for Facebook users: before you pull the plug, check if you have friends or connections you don\u2019t want to lose complete contact with.",
      "Send them a message asking for their phone, email or other non-Meta contact details. You could also make a final post telling people that you\u2019re leaving, though there\u2019s a chance not everyone will see it.",
      "If you're not ready to go all the way, Facebook allows users to temporarily shut down their accounts in case they just want to take a break from social media.",
      "You can do this through the account center, where you can click on the Personal details section, and then the Account ownership and control setting.",
      "Temporarily deactivating an account means other users won't see it anymore, but your posts, photos and videos won't be deleted and you can still use Facebook Messenger. You can reactivate the account at any time.",
      "Don't change your mind too often: Instagram and Threads users can only temporarily deactivate their accounts once a week.",
      "Ready to take the plunge and delete your account permanently?",
      "After tying up any loose ends, head back to the accounts center, click the Personal details section, and then Account ownership and control, where you can choose to delete it.",
      "Once you've triggered the deletion process, you've got 30 days to change your mind, which you can do by logging back into your account and clicking the Cancel Deletion button.",
      "\u201cAfter 30 days, your account and all your information will be permanently deleted, and you won\u2019t be able to retrieve your information,\u201d Facebook warns on its help center.",
      "Take note: Deleting a Threads account won't have any effect on your corresponding Instagram account. But deleting an Instagram account will also result in the deletion of the linked Threads account because Instagram accounts are used to manage Threads accounts.",
      "Meta also owns WhatsApp, although Zuckerberg's content policy changes aren't likely to affect the chat app.",
      "Similar to Meta's social platforms, WhatsApp users can export a copy of their chat history or ask for information on their settings or channels.",
      "If you decide you want to get rid of WhatsApp and perhaps switch to competing chat services like iMessage or Signal, it's easy to do through the app's settings.",
      "Deleting WhatsApp will erase your account info, your chat history backup and your presence from any chat groups as well as any channels you set up where you're the only admin.",

      "Officials say a waitress who jumped out of a burning hotel at a popular ski resort has succumbed to her injuries",
      "ANKARA, Turkey -- A waitress who was in serious condition after jumping out of a burning hotel at a popular ski resort has succumbed to her injuries, officials and reports said Thursday, becoming the latest victim of a tragedy that has shocked the nation and revived concerns over lax safety regulations in the country.",
      "Turkish officials early on Thursday revised the number of deaths from Tuesday\u2019s blaze at the 12-story Grand Kartal hotel in Kartalkaya, in northwestern Bolu province, from 79 to 78, including Sevval Sahin. The 25-year-old waitress died in the intensive care unit of a hospital late Wednesday. Dozens of others were injured in the blaze.",
      "The government has appointed six prosecutors to lead an investigation into the cause of the fire, which came at the start of a two-week winter break for schools, when hotels in the area are filled to capacity. Authorities have detained 11 people for questioning, including the hotel\u2019s owner, Bolu\u2019s deputy mayor and the acting fire department chief. No charges have been brought yet.",
      "The government of Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan has traded accusations of blame with the Bolu municipality, which is controlled by Turkey\u2019s main opposition party.",
      "The blaze appeared to have started at the restaurant section on the fourth floor of the wooden-clad hotel and spread quickly through to the upper floors. Guests and staff jumped out of windows to escape smoke and flame-filled rooms or dangled sheets out of windows to lower themselves out.",
      "Culture and Tourism Minister Mehmet Nuri Ersoy has stated that the hotel had been inspected in 2021 and 2014, and had a fire safety certificate. Bolu Mayor Tanju Ozcan has claimed that hotels in Kartalkaya are outside his municipality\u2019s jurisdiction and that the hotel\u2019s last fire department certificate dated back to 2007.",
      "Survivor accounts indicate that the hotel\u2019s fire detection system didn't function, that there were no sprinklers and that guests weren't able to locate the building\u2019s two fire escapes in the smoke-filled corridors. HaberTurk television and other media reports have suggested that the design of the fire escapes ended up spreading the blaze to other floors.",
      "Witnesses have also reported that the firefighters arrived 45 minutes after the fire was first reported.",
      "\u201cIf there was a fire escape, there\u2019s no way we\u2019d be able to find it,\u201d Hulya Karadag, a vacationer who survived the fire along with her daughter and two grandsons, told the IHA news agency.",
      "\u201cThere was (no fire alarm). That is the worst thing. If there was a fire alarm and we had been notified in advance, people would have acted more cautiously,\u201d said Karadag, whose room was on the lower section of the hotel and was able to escape out of a window by jumping on the roof of an extension.",
      "Describing the chaos in the corridors, Karadag said: \u201cWe couldn\u2019t go two rooms forward, we were out of breath. On top of that, people were bumping into each other. We don\u2019t know who we bumped into. There were children, people were screaming as they collided into each other.\u201d",
      "Meanwhile, the country continued holding funerals for the deceased.",
      "In Ankara, classmates and teachers gathered to bid farewell to 12-year-old Ayse Maya Dogan and her parents, Aysemin Elif Dogan and Mehmet Cem Dogan, leaving a note on her coffin that read: \u201cOur dear girl. We love you very much. We will never forget you. You will always be sitting in our classroom.\u201d",
      "Esra Nazik, a 25-year-old cook who was Sahin\u2019s roommate, was buried in her hometown of Konya in central Turkey. Like Sahin, Nazik also died after jumping out of the building, the Sabah newspaper reported.",
      "Sahin, who had started working at the hotel just over a month ago, called her father from the 12th-floor window, asking him for advice on what to do before she leapt out of the building, local media reports said.",
      "The T24 news website quoted Sahin\u2019s cousin, Murat Bakir, as saying her father told her not to jump. The waitress nevertheless threw herself out of the building, no longer able to withstand the smoke and flames, the website reported."

      "His promotion of a business joint venture that could invest up to $500 billion in infrastructure tied to AI has drawn plaudits from tech-oriented executives in Davos, even if Trump ally and multibillionaire Elon Musk \u2014 who is not on hand \u2014 scoffed on his X social media platform that the partners \u201c don't actually have the money.\u201d",

      "Milei launched a diatribe against what he called the ills of \u201cwokeism\" and described a global struggle between libertarians \u2014 like him \u2014 and left-wing progressives. He slammed social welfare, feminism, identity politics and the fight against climate change.",

      "Seven families are suing TikTok in France, accusing the platform of failing to moderate harmful content and exposing children to life-threatening material",
      "CASSIS, France -- In the moment when her world shattered three years ago, Stephanie Mistre found her 15-year-old daughter, Marie, lifeless in the bedroom where she died by suicide.",
      "\u201cI went from light to darkness in a fraction of a second,\u201d Mistre said, describing the day in September 2021 that marked the start of her fight against TikTok, the Chinese-owned video app she blames for pushing her daughter toward despair.",
      "___",
      "EDITOR\u2019S NOTE \u2014 This story includes discussion of suicide. If you or someone you know needs help, the national suicide and crisis lifeline in the U.S. is available by calling or texting 988. There is also an online chat at 988lifeline.org. Helplines outside the U.S. can be found at www.iasp.info/suicidalthoughts.",
      "___",
      "Delving into her daughter\u2019s phone after her death, Mistre discovered videos promoting suicide methods, tutorials and comments encouraging users to go beyond \u201cmere suicide attempts.\u201d She said TikTok\u2019s algorithm had repeatedly pushed such content to her daughter.",
      "\u201cIt was brainwashing,\u201d said Mistre, who lives in Cassis, near Marseille, in the south of France. \u201cThey normalized depression and self-harm, turning it into a twisted sense of belonging.\u201d",
      "Now Mistre and six other families are suing TikTok France, accusing the platform of failing to moderate harmful content and exposing children to life-threatening material. Out of the seven families, two experienced the loss of a child.",
      "Asked about the lawsuit, TikTok said its guidelines forbid any promotion of suicide and that it employs 40,000 trust and safety professionals worldwide \u2014 hundreds of which are French-speaking moderators \u2014 to remove dangerous posts. The company also said it refers users who search for suicide-related videos to mental health services.",
      "Before killing herself, Marie Le Tiec made several videos to explain her decision, citing various difficulties in her life, and quoted a song by the Louisiana-based emo rap group Suicideboys, who are popular on TikTok.",
      "Her mother also claims that her daughter was repeatedly bullied and harassed at school and online. In addition to the lawsuit, the 51-year-old mother and her husband have filed a complaint against five of Marie\u2019s classmates and her previous high school.",
      "Above all, Mistre blames TikTok, saying that putting the app \"in the hands of an empathetic and sensitive teenager who does not know what is real from what is not is like a ticking bomb.\u201d",
      "Scientists have not established a clear link between social media and mental health problems or psychological harm, said Gr\u00e9goire Borst, a professor of psychology and cognitive neuroscience at Paris-Cit\u00e9 University.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s very difficult to show clear cause and effect in this area,\u201d Borst said, citing a leading peer-reviewed study that found only 0.4% of the differences in teenagers\u2019 well-being could be attributed to social media use.",
      "Additionally, Borst pointed out that no current studies suggest TikTok is any more harmful than rival apps such as Snapchat, X, Facebook or Instagram.",
      "While most teens use social media without significant harm, the real risks, Borst said, lie with those already facing challenges such as bullying or family instability.",
      "\u201cWhen teenagers already feel bad about themselves and spend time exposed to distorted images or harmful social comparisons,\" it can worsen their mental state, Borst said.",
      "Lawyer Laure Boutron-Marmion, who represents the seven families suing TikTok, said their case is based on \u201cextensive evidence.\u201d The company \"can no longer hide behind the claim that it\u2019s not their responsibility because they don\u2019t create the content,\u201d Boutron-Marmion said.",
      "The lawsuit alleges that TikTok\u2019s algorithm is designed to trap vulnerable users in cycles of despair for profit and seeks reparations for the families.",
      "\u201cTheir strategy is insidious,\u201d Mistre said. \u201cThey hook children into depressive content to keep them on the platform, turning them into lucrative re-engagement products.\u201d",
      "Boutron-Marmion noted that TikTok\u2019s Chinese version, Douyin, features much stricter content controls for young users. It includes a \u201cyouth mode\u201d mandatory for users under 14 that restricts screen time to 40 minutes a day and offers only approved content.",
      "\u201cIt proves they can moderate content when they choose to,\u201d Boutron-Marmion said. \u201cThe absence of these safeguards here is telling.\u201d",
      "A report titled \u201cChildren and Screens,\u201d commissioned by French President Emmanuel Macron in April and to which Borst contributed, concluded that certain algorithmic features should be considered addictive and banned from any app in France. The report also called for restricting social media access for minors under 15 in France. Neither measure has been adopted.",
      "TikTok, which faced being shut down in the U.S. until President Donald Trump suspended a ban on it, has also come under scrutiny globally.",

      "Masahiro Nakai, one of Japan's top TV hosts and a former pop star, says he is retiring to take responsibility over sexual assault allegations",
      "TOKYO -- Masahiro Nakai, one of Japan\u2019s top TV hosts and a former pop star, said Thursday he was retiring to take responsibility over sexual assault allegations that are part of a wave roiling Japan's entertainment industry and have triggered an avalanche of lost advertising at one of the networks where he worked.",
      "Weekly magazine Shukan Bunshun reported in December that Nakai had reached a 90 million yen ($580,000) settlement with a woman over the alleged sex assault at a 2023 dinner party that Fuji TV staff allegedly helped to organize. He acknowledged \u201ca trouble\u201d and a settlement, while denying any violence, in a statement earlier this month. The magazine has also alleged that Fuji TV has long exploited its female announcers to entertain stars like Nakai.",
      "\u201cI, Masahiro Nakai, is retiring from entertainment activity as of today,\u201d Nakai said in a statement distributed to his paid fan club and posted on social media by apparent members. Japanese media also confirmed and reported his retirement.",
      "\u201cI am truly sorry for causing trouble and losses to so many people,\u201d Nakai said, and repeated his \u201csincere apology\u201d to the woman. \u201cI'm really, really sorry for saying good-bye this way ... Sayonara.\u201d",
      "Japan\u2019s entertainment industry is in the midst of a wave of sexual assault cases, including the abuses of hundreds of boys and young men by late talent mogul Johnny Kitagawa, whose now-defunct agency Johnny & Associates managed many boy bands, including the one to which Nakai belonged, SMAP.",
      "Last Friday, Fuji TV President Koichi Minato acknowledged the company had been aware of the problem six months before the magazine report and hadn't disclosed it. Minato apologized and said Fuji TV would investigate the case but also said he believed his employees had not done anything wrong.",
      "After dozens of commercials were withdrawn, Fuji TV apologized for causing trouble to advertisers and agencies but declined to disclose details.",
      "Fuji Television Network\u2019s vice-chairperson Ryunosuke Endo, who is also head of Japanese commercial broadcasters\u2019 association, in a news conference Thursday said he learned about the problem in December when he was asked for a comment about the scandal and \u201cwas extremely shocked.\u201d Endo said the problem was kept confidential among a handful of people, which did not include him, to protect the victim's privacy and stand by her.",
      "He said his company should prioritize regaining trust by explaining what happened through an appropriate third-party investigation.",
      "Separately, Fuji TV and its parent company Fuji Media Holdings held a board meeting Thursday and announced that they have set up an independent panel of lawyers and in line with guidelines set by the Japan Federation of Bar Associations.",
      "They met following shareholders' demands for further clarification about the scandal and steps the company had taken and what measures are planned,",
      "Nakai said in his statement that he has sorted out all negotiations of terminating his shows and contracts with television, radio and sponsors. He said he has yet to taken all his responsibility and promised to \u201cface various problems and respond sincerely.\u201d",
      "Endo noted Nakai\u2019s retirement was his \u201cpersonal decision\u201d but said Nakai was part of the upcoming investigation and that he hoped for his sincere cooperation.",
      "Endo acknowledged attending a number of parties years ago accompanied by female announcers known as \u201cjoshi anna,\u201d who often appear as assistants on entertainment shows. He said the parties were for networking and business, but noted the culture might have resulted from male-dominated decision-making.",

      "Saudi Arabia\u2019s crown prince says the kingdom wants to invest $600 billion in the United States over the next four years, comments that came after President Donald Trump mused about returning to the kingdom as his first foreign trip",
      "DUBAI, United Arab Emirates -- Saudi Arabia\u2019s crown prince said Thursday the kingdom wants to invest $600 billion in the United States over the next four years, comments that came after President Donald Trump earlier put a price tag on returning to the kingdom as his first foreign trip.",
      "Trump's 2017 trip to Saudi Arabia upended a tradition of U.S. presidents first heading to the United Kingdom as their first trip abroad. It also underscored his administration's close ties to the rulers of the oil-rich Gulf states as his eponymous real estate company has pursued deals across the region as well.",
      "The comments from Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman, reported early Thursday by the state-run Saudi Press Agency, came in a phone call with Trump. It marked Trump's first call with a foreign leader since his inauguration Monday.",
      "\u201cThe crown prince affirmed the kingdom\u2019s intention to broaden its investments and trade with the United States over the next four years, in the amount of $600 billion, and potentially beyond that,\u201d the report said.",
      "The readout did not elaborate on where those investments and trade could be placed. The U.S. in recent years has increasingly pulled away from relying on Saudi oil exports, which once was the bedrock of their relationship for decades. Saudi sovereign wealth funds have taken large stakes in American businesses while also looking at sports as well.",
      "Saudi Arabia does, however, rely predominantly on U.S.-made weapons and defense systems, which could be a part of the investment.",
      "The White House on Thursday issued a statement acknowledging the call, saying the two leaders \u201cdiscussed efforts to bring stability to the Middle East, bolster regional security and combat terrorism.\u201d",
      "\u201cAdditionally, they discussed the kingdom of Saudi Arabia\u2019s international economic ambitions over the next four years as well as trade and other opportunities to increase the mutual prosperity of the United State and the kingdom of Saudi Arabia,\u201d the statement said, without elaborating.",
      "The crown prince, the de facto ruler of the oil-rich kingdom, also spoke with U.S. Secretary of State Marco Rubio early Thursday.",
      "On Monday after his inauguration, Trump talked about possibly heading to the kingdom again as his first foreign trip, as he did in 2017.",
      "\u201cThe first foreign trip typically has been with the U.K. but ... I did it with Saudi Arabia last time because they agreed to buy $450 billion worth of our products,\u201d Trump told journalists in the Oval Office. \u201cIf Saudi Arabia wanted to buy another $450 billion or $500 \u2014 we\u2019ll up it for all the inflation \u2014 I think I\u2019d probably go.\u201d",
      "On a potential trip to Saudi Arabia, White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt told journalists Thursday: \u201cI\u2019m not aware of any plans at this time.\u201d",
      "Trump's 2017 visit to the kingdom set in motion a yearslong boycott of Qatar by four Arab nations, including the kingdom.",
      "Trump maintained close relations with Saudi Arabia, even after Prince Mohammed was implicated in the 2018 killing and dismemberment of Washington Post columnist Jamal Khashoggi in Istanbul. The kingdom also had been talking for years with the Biden administration about a wider deal to diplomatically recognize Israel in exchange for U.S. defense protections and other support.",
      "The $600 billion pledge, which dwarves the gross domestic product of many nations, also comes as the kingdom faces budgetary pressures of its own. Global oil prices remain depressed years after the height of the coronavirus pandemic, affecting the kingdom's revenues.",
      "Meanwhile, Prince Mohammed also wants to continue his $500 billion project at NEOM, a new city in Saudi Arabia's western desert on the Red Sea. It also will need to build tens of billions of dollars' worth of new stadiums and infrastructure ahead of it hosting the 2034 FIFA World Cup.",

      "BANGKOK -- The Chinese government is trying to encourage people to spend more by ensuring that share prices will rise, ordering pensions and mutual funds to invest more in domestic stocks to help jolt its languid markets out of the doldrums.",
      "Officials told reporters in Beijing on Thursday that beginning this year mutual funds should increase holdings of onshore stocks, called A-shares, by at least 10% a year over the next three years.",
      "Commercial insurance funds will have to put 30% of their annual new premium revenue into share markets beginning this year, they said.",
      "\u201cThis means that at least several hundred billion yuan of long-term funds will be added to A-shares every year,\u201d said Wu Qing, chairman of the China Securities Regulatory Commission.",
      "The announcement followed a meeting of top financial officials including ministries in charge of pensions and the central bank.",

      "The ruling Communist Party announced this move just ahead of China\u2019s biggest holiday of the year, the Lunar New Year, which begins on Wednesday, Jan. 29. It\u2019s a time when families tend to splash out on food and travel and little red packets of money for children and young adults, a time of wishes for good fortune.",
      "Markets in Hong Kong and Shanghai rose early Thursday after the announcement, with the Shanghai Composite index gaining 1.4%. The Hang Seng in Hong Kong, a market linked to limited trading by mainland Chinese investors, shed early gains, edging 0.1% lower.",
      "China's share markets are huge but they hit their peak value before the 2008 global financial crisis and have meandered well below that level since. A lack of gains in share prices, along with falling housing prices, has discouraged Chinese families from spending, slowing consumer demand and economic growth.",
      "So far, the government's efforts to get people to spend more and save less have had mixed success. An initiative to promote purchases of energy efficient vehicles and appliances by paying subsidies to people who turn in their old versions of such items has boosted sales of such products. But share prices had traded stubbornly within a narrow range after a brief-lived rally late last year.",
      "Wu said pension funds will be required to revamp how they assess their performance and companies will be encouraged to conduct more share buybacks and pay higher dividends to give shareholders better returns.",
      "\u201cThis is a very important institutional breakthrough for the entry of medium- and long-term funds into the market. It can be said that it has solved a problem that has been unsolved for many years,\u201d he added.",
      "Sell-offs by major shareholders and high market volatility have handicapped the Chinese markets, Lei Meng, a China equity strategist at UBS Securities, said in a commentary Thursday.",
      "So, \u201cthe willingness of long-term investors to participate in the stock market has dwindled,\u201d Lei said. \u201cThe proposal of market value management reform directly addresses this issue because it is directly related to investors\u2019 sense of gain.\u201d",
      "But such moves have often failed in the past, since they attempt to override prevailing market sentiment by fiat.",
      "\u201cAs we\u2019ve seen in the past, such efforts can be likened to attempting to kindle a fire with damp wood \u2014 often proving ineffective and short-lived,\u201d Stephen Innes of SPI Asset Management said in a commentary."

      "Defending champion Jannik Sinner will face Alexander Zverev in the Australian Open men's final on Sunday",
      "MELBOURNE, Australia -- It's not often that a man is able to follow up his first Grand Slam title by repeating as the champion at the same tournament a year later, which is what Jannik Sinner will be trying to do Sunday when he faces Alexander Zverev in the Australian Open final.",
      "The last time it happened was nearly 20 years ago: Rafael Nadal accomplished that sort of repeat at the 2005 and 2006 French Opens. He turned out OK.",
      "For the No. 1-ranked Sinner, the past year also included the doping case that is still unresolved. He tested positive for a trace amount of an anabolic steroid twice in March, which didn't become public until his exoneration was announced shortly before the start of play at the U.S. Open \u2014 which he won. There is a hearing in the World Anti-Doping Agency's appeal scheduled in April.",
      "\u201cHe finds playing tennis matches to be his safe place. That\u2019s where he can go and do his thing and feel like this is what he knows, this is what he understands, what is what he\u2019s good at. It become a home for him to step on to the court and play tennis,\u201d said one of Sinner's two coaches, Darren Cahill, who will leave the team after this season.",
      "\u201cThere's been a lot of pressure around him for the last nine months now, since April last year. He deals with it as well as anybody that I\u2019ve ever seen deal with pressure,\" Cahill said. \"He\u2019s an amazing young man that\u2019s been able to put that to one side. ... He has a clear conscience.\u201d",
      "Over these two weeks in Australia, Sinner also dealt with health issues. He got medical attention when he felt dizzy and had an upset stomach during his fourth-round victory against No. 13 Holger Rune, then cramping late in his semifinal win over No. 21 Ben Shelton.",
      "\u201cThere's a lot of things going on, on and off the court. I try to isolate myself a little bit, trying to be myself on the court. Sometimes it\u2019s a bit easier. There are days where it\u2019s easier, days where I struggle a little bit more,\u201d said Sinner, a 23-year-old from Italy who can become the youngest man to win consecutive championships at the Australian Open since Jim Courier in 1992-93.",
      "\u201cI'm just happy to put myself in this position again,\u201d Sinner said, \u201cto play for a big trophy again.\u201d",
      "Standing in his way is No. 2 Zverev, a 27-year-old from Germany who is 0-2 in previous major finals, losing both in five sets \u2014 to Dominic Thiem at the 2020 U.S. Open after taking the first two sets and holding a match point, and to Carlos Alcaraz at last year's French Open after leading by two sets to one. Zverev won his semifinal in Paris last June hours after an out-of-court settlement was announced in Berlin that ended a trial stemming from an ex-girlfriend\u2019s accusation of assault during a 2020 argument.",
      "Zverev got his spot in the Australian Open final \u2014 play is scheduled to start at 7:30 p.m. local time (3:30 a.m. EST) on Sunday \u2014 when 24-time major champion Novak Djokovic stopped playing because of a leg injury just one set into their semifinal on Friday.",
      "This will be the first title match at Rod Laver Arena between the men seeded 1 and 2 since No. 1 Djokovic defeated No. 2 Nadal in 2019.",
      "\u201cJannik has been the best player in the world for the past 12 months,\u201d Zverev said. \u201cThere\u2019s no doubt about it.\u201d",
      "That is not really up for debate.",
      "Sinner went 73-6 in 2024 with eight titles, the most on the ATP Tour since 2016, and is currently on a 20-match winning streak that began late last season.",
      "He is listed as a -275 money-line favorite against Zverev, according to BetMGM Sportsbook.",
      "But don't expect Sinner to proclaim that status or be willing to talk about himself in glowing terms.",
      "\u201cBack of my head, I also know that I\u2019m 23 years old, and I am not perfect, no? I know that I have things still to improve. I have certain areas where I can get better. That\u2019s why we work,\u201d Sinner said. \u201cEvery day is a big challenge. Every day you have a different opponent. You try to understand what\u2019s happening. Sometimes you have some issues and then trying to understand that whatever works best for that day and trying to go for it.\u201d",

The four-time PGA Tour winner put his 131-yard third shot inside 3 feet on the 18th, holing out for the 54-hole lead.",
      "\u201cI\u2019ve played this place for a long time now, and I feel like I know where to miss it, where to be aggressive and where to be patient,\u201d English said. \u201cI feel like I picked my spots really well today, and it\u2019s nice when you\u2019re seeing some putts go in.\u201d",
      "Although English has nine top-10 finishes in the past two seasons, he hasn\u2019t won since 2021, when he survived an epic eight-hole playoff with Kramer Hickok at the Travelers Championship.",
      "But he is more than comfortable at Torrey Pines: He went to a four-way playoff at the Farmers in 2015 before losing to Jason Day, and he finished third at the U.S. Open held on this San Diego course in 2021.",

South African rookie Aldrich Potgieter was at 7-under 209 after the latest display of his impressive power off the tee, while Joel Dahmen, Lanto Griffin, Matti Schmid and K.H. Lee were four shots back of English at a tournament that has seen its share of electrifying final-day rallies..",

      "Potgieter, the promising 20-year-old who leads the tournament in driving distance, birdied three par-3 holes and eagled the par-4 12th. He holed out from 173 yards with an 8 iron, celebrating with a hug from his caddie.",
      "\u201cPar 3s probably aren\u2019t my strongest out of the pars, but I was hitting the ball a lot better today,\u201d Potgieter said. \u201cEspecially on those holes, I put myself in good spots to hole some putts.\u201d",
      "Potgieter became the youngest winner in Korn Ferry Tour history a year ago. He battled through the wind to a 76 on Thursday, but got better along with the weather.",
      "So did Novak, who buried a 20-foot birdie putt on the 18th. Novak is chasing his first victory in his fourth season on tour, and he's also a big fan of Torrey Pines, even if his career results on the course don't reflect it.",
      "\u201cYou want to win, and anytime you want something, you might put pressure on yourself,\u201d Novak said. \u201cThere\u2019s going to be nerves (Saturday). You know, I\u2019ve gone through Q-school. I\u2019ve been sweating out cut lines. It\u2019s all just nerves. I\u2019ve been nervous a lot of times playing golf. It\u2019s just part of it. You just have to step up and hit the golf shot.\u201d",
      "English and Novak should have fun in the final group Saturday: They both live on St. Simons Island in Georgia.",
      "Ludvig Aberg, who led after each of the first two rounds, fell to 4-under 212 after shooting 75 while looking visibly ill during his round. Aberg might have caught the same bug affecting several players in the locker room, and he hit only eight greens in regulation in the third round.",

      "Officials say they have recaptured the final four monkeys who escaped two months ago from a South Carolina compound that breeds them for medical research",
      "YEMASSEE, S.C. -- Authorities in South Carolina said Friday the last four of 43 escaped monkeys have been recaptured after two months living in the woods, weathering a rare snowstorm and being temped back into captivity by peanut butter and jelly sandwiches.",
      "The rhesus macaque monkeys, all females, made a break for it after police say an employee did not fully lock their enclosure at Alpha Genesis, a facility that breeds them for medical research \u2014 known to locals as \u201cthe monkey farm.\u201d",
      "The recaptured monkeys appeared to be in good health, Alpha Genesis CEO Greg Westergaard said in a statement relayed by Yemassee Police in a social media post, without further details.",
      "While they were on the loose, the area saw its first snow in seven years, accumulating up to 3 inches (8 centimeters).",
      "The rhesus macaques made a break for it on Nov. 6, and mostly hung around near the facility. They're about the size of a cat, weighing roughly 7 pounds (3 kilograms).",
      "It appears a worker unintentionally left the gates unlocked when the monkeys escaped, Westergaard said in November. Workers were supposed to lock and latch one gate before opening another, but all three gates and latches were left unsecure.",
      "The monkeys posed no risk to public health, said Alpha Genesis, federal health officials and police.",
      "Alpha Guard employees kept an eye on the monkeys and set out humane traps. Most were lured back with food and were given peanut butter and jelly sandwiches and \"monkey biscuits\" \u2014 a high-protein Purina Monkey Chow specially formulated for the rhesus macaques.",
      "The facility breeds the monkeys to sell to medical facilities and other researchers. Humans have been using the monkeys for scientific research since the late 1800s. Scientists believe rhesus macaques and humans split from a common ancestor about 25 million years ago and share about 93% of the same DNA.",
      "The compound is about a mile (1.6 kilometers) from downtown Yemassee and about 50 miles (80 kilometers) northeast of Savannah, Georgia."

      "Google is pledging to crack down on fake online reviews with tougher punishments for rogue reviewers and businesses after an investigation by regulators in Britain",
      "LONDON -- Google pledged to crack down on fake online reviews with tougher punishments for rogue reviewers and businesses that try to profit from them, British regulators said Friday following an investigation.",
      "The Competition and Markets Authority said that Google has committed to \u201crigorous steps\u201d to detect and remove sham reviews, so it can quickly identify and investigate businesses and reviewers trying to benefit from the phony posts.",
      "Google will delete all reviews written by people who repeatedly write fake or misleading reviews \u2014 either positive or negative \u2014 for U.K. businesses, the watchdog said. These reviewers will also be banned from posting new reviews, whether or not they're in the U.K.",
      "Businesses that try to artificially boost their star ratings will also face consequences. Warning alerts will be slapped on their Google profiles, and new reviews will not be allowed. And if they repeatedly engage in fake review activity, all their reviews for the past six months or more will be deleted, the CMA said.",
      "Google's also adding a way for consumers to quickly and easily report shady reviews, including payments or rewards offered for a positive review.",
      "\u201cThe changes we\u2019ve secured from Google ensure robust processes are in place, so people can have confidence in reviews and make the best possible choices,\u201d the watchdog's CEO Sarah Cardell said. \u201cThey also help to create a level-playing field for fair dealing firms.\u201d",
      "Google said its \u201clongstanding investments to combat fraudulent content help us block millions of fake reviews yearly \u2013 often before they ever get published.\" The company said in a brief statement that its \"work with regulators around the world, including the CMA, is part of our ongoing efforts to fight fake content and bad actors.\u201d",
      "A separate investigation into Amazon over fake reviews is ongoing, the watchdog said. It opened the probes in 2021 to examine whether the two companies broke U.K. consumer law by failing to protect shoppers. It began looking into phony reviews on some big websites amid the boom in online shopping fueled by the coronavirus pandemic.",
      "Phony reviews have long plagued the internet. Some online travel and shopping platforms have banded together to fight fraudulent reviews. Authorities in the U.S. meanwhile have also been trying to crack down, with the Federal Trade Commission banning their sale or purchase and fining businesses and individuals who engage in the practice.",
      "Fake reviews are typically traded on private social media groups between fake review brokers and businesses willing to pay. Sometimes, such reviews are initiated by businesses that offer customers incentives such as gift cards for positive feedback.",

      "Seven families are suing TikTok in France, accusing the platform of failing to moderate harmful content and exposing children to life-threatening material",
      "CASSIS, France -- In the moment when her world shattered three years ago, Stephanie Mistre found her 15-year-old daughter, Marie, lifeless in the bedroom where she died by suicide.",
      "\u201cI went from light to darkness in a fraction of a second,\u201d Mistre said, describing the day in September 2021 that marked the start of her fight against TikTok, the Chinese-owned video app she blames for pushing her daughter toward despair.",
      "___",
      "EDITOR\u2019S NOTE \u2014 This story includes discussion of suicide. If you or someone you know needs help, the national suicide and crisis lifeline in the U.S. is available by calling or texting 988. There is also an online chat at 988lifeline.org. Helplines outside the U.S. can be found at www.iasp.info/suicidalthoughts.",
      "___",
      "Delving into her daughter\u2019s phone after her death, Mistre discovered videos promoting suicide methods, tutorials and comments encouraging users to go beyond \u201cmere suicide attempts.\u201d She said TikTok\u2019s algorithm had repeatedly pushed such content to her daughter.",
      "\u201cIt was brainwashing,\u201d said Mistre, who lives in Cassis, near Marseille, in the south of France. \u201cThey normalized depression and self-harm, turning it into a twisted sense of belonging.\u201d",
      "Now Mistre and six other families are suing TikTok France, accusing the platform of failing to moderate harmful content and exposing children to life-threatening material. Out of the seven families, two experienced the loss of a child.",
      "Asked about the lawsuit, TikTok said its guidelines forbid any promotion of suicide and that it employs 40,000 trust and safety professionals worldwide \u2014 hundreds of which are French-speaking moderators \u2014 to remove dangerous posts. The company also said it refers users who search for suicide-related videos to mental health services.",
      "Before killing herself, Marie Le Tiec made several videos to explain her decision, citing various difficulties in her life, and quoted a song by the Louisiana-based emo rap group Suicideboys, who are popular on TikTok.",
      "Her mother also claims that her daughter was repeatedly bullied and harassed at school and online. In addition to the lawsuit, the 51-year-old mother and her husband have filed a complaint against five of Marie\u2019s classmates and her previous high school.",
      "Above all, Mistre blames TikTok, saying that putting the app \"in the hands of an empathetic and sensitive teenager who does not know what is real from what is not is like a ticking bomb.\u201d",
      "Scientists have not established a clear link between social media and mental health problems or psychological harm, said Gr\u00e9goire Borst, a professor of psychology and cognitive neuroscience at Paris-Cit\u00e9 University.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s very difficult to show clear cause and effect in this area,\u201d Borst said, citing a leading peer-reviewed study that found only 0.4% of the differences in teenagers\u2019 well-being could be attributed to social media use.",
      "Additionally, Borst pointed out that no current studies suggest TikTok is any more harmful than rival apps such as Snapchat, X, Facebook or Instagram.",
      "While most teens use social media without significant harm, the real risks, Borst said, lie with those already facing challenges such as bullying or family instability.",
      "\u201cWhen teenagers already feel bad about themselves and spend time exposed to distorted images or harmful social comparisons,\" it can worsen their mental state, Borst said.",
      "Lawyer Laure Boutron-Marmion, who represents the seven families suing TikTok, said their case is based on \u201cextensive evidence.\u201d The company \"can no longer hide behind the claim that it\u2019s not their responsibility because they don\u2019t create the content,\u201d Boutron-Marmion said.",
      "The lawsuit alleges that TikTok\u2019s algorithm is designed to trap vulnerable users in cycles of despair for profit and seeks reparations for the families.",
      "\u201cTheir strategy is insidious,\u201d Mistre said. \u201cThey hook children into depressive content to keep them on the platform, turning them into lucrative re-engagement products.\u201d",
      "Boutron-Marmion noted that TikTok\u2019s Chinese version, Douyin, features much stricter content controls for young users. It includes a \u201cyouth mode\u201d mandatory for users under 14 that restricts screen time to 40 minutes a day and offers only approved content.",
      "\u201cIt proves they can moderate content when they choose to,\u201d Boutron-Marmion said. \u201cThe absence of these safeguards here is telling.\u201d",
      "A report titled \u201cChildren and Screens,\u201d commissioned by French President Emmanuel Macron in April and to which Borst contributed, concluded that certain algorithmic features should be considered addictive and banned from any app in France. The report also called for restricting social media access for minors under 15 in France. Neither measure has been adopted.",
      "TikTok, which faced being shut down in the U.S. until President Donald Trump suspended a ban on it, has also come under scrutiny globally.",
      "The U.S. has seen similar legal efforts by parents. One lawsuit in Los Angeles County accuses Meta and its platforms Instagram and Facebook, as well as Snapchat and TikTok, of designing defective products that cause serious injuries. The lawsuit lists three teens who died by suicide. In another complaint, two tribal nations accuse major social media companies, including YouTube owner Alphabet, of contributing to high rates of suicide among Native youths.",
      "Meta CEO Mark Zuckerberg apologized to parents who had lost children while testifying last year in the U.S. Senate.",
      "In December, Australia enacted a groundbreaking law banning social media accounts for children under 16.",
      "In France, Boutron-Marmion expects TikTok Limited Technologies, the European Union subsidiary for ByteDance \u2014 the Chinese company that owns TikTok \u2014 to answer the allegations in the first quarter of 2025. Authorities will later decide whether and when a trial would take place.",
      "When contacted by The Associated Press, TikTok said it had not been notified about the French lawsuit, which was filed in November. It could take months for the French justice system to process the complaint and for authorities in Ireland \u2014 home to TikTok\u2019s European headquarters \u2014 to formally notify the company, Boutron-Marmion said.",
      "Instead, a Tiktok spokesperson highlighted company guidelines that prohibit content promoting suicide or self-harm.",
      "Critics argue that TikTok\u2019s claims of robust moderation fall short.",
      "Imran Ahmed, the CEO of the Center for Countering Digital Hate, dismissed TikTok\u2019s assertion that over 98.8% of harmful videos had been flagged and removed between April and June.",
      "When asked about the blind spots of their moderation efforts, social media platforms claim that users are able to bypass detection by using ambiguous language or allusions that algorithms struggle to flag, Ahmed said.",
      "The term \u201calgospeak\u201d has been coined to describe techniques such as using zebra or armadillo emojis to talk about cutting yourself, or the Swiss flag emoji as an allusion to suicide.",
      "Such code words \"aren\u2019t particularly sophisticated,\u201d Ahmed said. \"The only reason TikTok can\u2019t find them when independent researchers, journalists and others can is because they\u2019re not looking hard enough,\u201d Ahmed said.",
      "Ahmed\u2019s organization conducted a study in 2022 simulating the experience of a 13-year-old girl on TikTok.",
      "\u201cWithin 2.5 minutes, the accounts were served self-harm content,\u201d Ahmed said. \u201cBy eight minutes, they saw eating disorder content. On average, every 39 seconds, the algorithm pushed harmful material.\u201d",
      "The algorithm \u201cknows that eating disorder and self-harm content is especially addictive\u201d for young girls.",
      "For Mistre, the fight is deeply personal. Sitting in her daughter\u2019s room, where she has kept the decor untouched for the last three years, she said parents must know about the dangers of social media.",
      "Had she known about the content being sent to her daughter, she never would have allowed her on TikTok, she said. Her voice breaks as she describes Marie as a \u201csunny, funny\u201d teenager who dreamed of becoming a lawyer.",
      "\u201cIn memory of Marie, I will fight as long as I have the strength,\u201d she said. \u201cParents need to know the truth. We must confront these platforms and demand accountability.\u201d",

      "Elon Musk is clashing with OpenAI CEO Sam Altman over the Stargate artificial intelligence infrastructure project touted by President Donald Trump, the latest in a feud between the two tech billionaires that started on OpenAI's board and is now testing Musk's influence with the new president.",
      "Trump on Tuesday had talked up a joint venture investing up to $500 billion through a new partnership formed by OpenAI, the maker of ChatGPT, alongside Oracle and SoftBank.",
      "The new entity, Stargate, is already starting to build out data centers and the electricity generation needed for the further development of fast-evolving AI technology.",
      "Trump declared it \u201ca resounding declaration of confidence in America\u2019s potential\u201d under his new administration, with an initial private investment of $100 billion that could reach five times that sum.",
      "But Musk, a close Trump adviser who helped bankroll his campaign and now leads a government cost-cutting initiative, questioned the value of the investment hours later.",
      "\u201cThey don\u2019t actually have the money,\u201d Musk wrote on his social platform X. \u201cSoftBank has well under $10B secured. I have that on good authority.\u201d",
      "Altman responded Wednesday to say Musk was \u201cwrong, as you surely know\u201d and inviting Musk to come visit the first site in Texas that is already under construction.",
      "\"(T)his is great for the country. i realize what is great for the country isn\u2019t always what\u2019s optimal for your companies, but in your new role i hope you\u2019ll mostly put (America) first,\u201d Altman wrote, using a U.S. flag emoji to represent America.",
      "The public clash over Stargate is part of a years-long dispute between Musk and Altman that began with a boardroom rivalry over who should run OpenAI, which both men helped found.",
      "Musk, an early OpenAI investor and board member, sued the artificial intelligence company last year alleging it had betrayed its founding aims as a nonprofit research lab benefiting the public good rather than pursuing profits.",
      "Musk has since escalated the dispute, adding new claims and asking for a court order that would stop OpenAI\u2019s plans to convert itself into a for-profit business more fully. A hearing is set for February in a California federal court.",
      "The world\u2019s richest man, whose companies include Tesla, SpaceX and X, last year started his own rival AI company, xAI, that is building its own big data center in Memphis, Tennessee. Musk says it faces unfair competition from OpenAI and its close business partner Microsoft, which has supplied the huge computing resources needed to build AI systems such as ChatGPT.",
      "Tech news outlet The Information first reported on an OpenAI data center project called Stargate in March 2024, indicating that it's been in the works long before Trump announced it.",
      "Another company \u2014 Crusoe Energy Systems \u2014 announced in July it was building a large and \u201cspecially designed AI data center\u201d at the northwest edge of Abilene, Texas at a site run by energy technology company Lancium. Crusoe and Lancium said in a joint statement at the time that the project was \u201csupported by a multibillion-dollar investment\u201d but didn't disclose its backers.",
      "AI technology requires huge amounts of electricity to build and operate and both companies said the project would be powered with renewable sources such as nearby solar farms, in a way that Lancium CEO Michael McNamara said would \u201cdeliver the maximum amount of green energy at the lowest possible cost.\u201d Crusoe said it would own and develop the facility.",
      "It's not clear how and when that project became the first phase of the Stargate investment revealed by Trump. Abilene Mayor Weldon Hurt said construction began about nine months ago but \u201cwe didn\u2019t know it was going to be quite this big. We thought it was going to be about a third of this size.\u201d",
      "Oracle co-founder Larry Ellison said Tuesday that the Abilene project is the first of about 10 data center buildings currently being built and that number could expand to 20.",
      "Hurt told The Associated Press that the region surrounding Abilene, a city of about 130,000 people, benefits from a wealth of energy sources, including oil, gas, solar and some of the \u201clargest wind farms in the world,\u201d though Trump signaled opposition to wind power this week by temporarily halting approval of wind projects on federal lands.",
      "\u201cWe have the capability to produce the energy for this market so it really means a lot for a town like Abilene,\u201d Hurt said. \u201cTo have this opportunity here in west-central Texas, to have something like this to make Abilene substantial, we\u2019re just excited about it.\u201d",
      "Missing from Trump's press conference Tuesday was Microsoft, which has long supported OpenAI with billions of dollars in investments and enabling its data centers to be used to build the models behind ChatGPT and other generative AI tools.",
      "Microsoft is also a technology partner in the Stargate project, along with chipmakers Nvidia and Arm, but put out a statement noting that its OpenAI partnership will \u201cevolve\u201d in a way that enables OpenAI \u201cto build additional capacity, primarily for research and training of models.\u201d",
      "Asked about Musk's comments about the Stargate deal Wednesday during a CNBC interview at the World Economic Forum in Davos, Switzerland, Microsoft CEO Satya Nadella pivoted to his company's own $80 billion plan to build out its global AI infrastructure, of which $50 billion is being spent in the U.S.",
      "\u201cLook, all I know is, I\u2019m good for my $80 billion,\u201d said Nadella, laughing."

Most of the hardware on the Galaxy S25 is mostly the same as last year's model, except for a faster chip and a more powerful ultrawide lens on the camera.",
      "In its next phase, Samsung is positioning the Galaxy S25 as an \u201cAI companion\u201d capable of pulling more requests out of conversations, learning people\u2019s routines, anticipating people's needs and performing more technological tricks, such as being able to remove unwanted sounds from videos or identifying the name of a song upon request.",
      "The AI on the new Galaxy phones has been designed to toggle from one app to another to fetch, summarize and manage information, entertainment and other content stored on the devices. In an attempt to make the technology even more indispensable, the AI on Galaxy S25 will be able to create customized digital dossiers on users' behavior patterns and other unique characteristics that Samsung is calling a \u201cpersonal data engine.\u201d",
      "\u201cEverything you see here is the beginning of a new reality,\" said TM Roh, the Samsung executive who oversees its smartphones. \u201cThings that you thought you could never do, but now you can.\u201d",
      "As Apple has been doing with its AI features, Samsung is promising that its technology will shield users' privacy while also peering into their lives. Samsung is providing the protection primarily by keeping all the knowledge accrued by its AI technology on the Galaxy devices \u2014 within a digital fortress the company nicknamed after Fort Knox, the Kentucky Army base seated next to the U.S. government\u2019s depository for gold.",
      "After raising prices last year, Samsung is standing pat with the Galaxy S25 phones, with the standard model starting at $800, the Plus model at $1,000 and the Ultra model at $1,300. The phones are scheduled to be in stores starting Feb. 7.",
      "Forrester Research analyst Thomas Husson thinks the Galaxy S25 models \u201cwill offer a more intuitive user experience with more integrated vocal and cross-app experiences, but AI is not yet a key reason to buy a new smartphone.\u201d",
      "Samsung is doubling down on its AI bet after getting a sales bump from the past year's emphasis on the technology. The South Korean company sold 32 million of its Galaxy S24 models from January through September last year, a 25% increase from the same time in the previous year, according to the research group Canalys.",
      "But Samsung didn\u2019t fare as well in the lower end of the smartphone market, where it was hurt by cheaper devices made by Chinese competitors. That\u2019s one of the reasons Samsung\u2019s total smartphone shipments fell by 1% last year, leaving it slightly behind Apple in the worldwide market, according to the research firm International Data Crop.",
      "As was the case with last year\u2019s models, the Galaxy S25 will draw heavily on AI technology made by Google, the maker of the free operating system Android that Samsung has long used for its smartphones.",
      "Some of the new AI tricks, such as the ability to deploy Google's \u201ccircle to search\u201d technology to quickly identify the song title of music playing in a video, will debut on the Galaxy S25 before coming to other Android phones later this year. Google also has been planting more AI on its own phone, the Pixel, but that device still lags far behind the iPhone and Galaxy.",

      "NEW YORK -- Scientists have detected cosmic waves that sound like birds chirping in an unexpected place.",
      "These bursts of plasma, called chorus waves, ripple at the same frequency as human hearing. When converted to audio signals, their sharp notes mimic high-pitched bird calls.",
      "Researchers have captured such sounds in space before, but now they have sensed the chirping waves from much farther away: over 62,000 miles (100,000 kilometers) from Earth, where they've never been measured before.",
      "\u201cThat opens up a lot of new questions about the physics that could be possible in this area,\u201d said Allison Jaynes, a space physicist at the University of Iowa who was not involved with the work.",
      "Scientists still aren\u2019t sure how the perturbations happen, but they think Earth\u2019s magnetic field may have something to do with it.",
      "The chorus has been picked up on radio antennas for decades, including receivers at an Antarctica research station in the 1960s. And twin spacecraft \u2014 NASA's Van Allen Probes \u2014 heard the chirps from Earth's radiation belts at a closer distance than the newest detection.",
      "The latest notes were picked up by NASA's Magnetospheric Multiscale satellites, launched in 2015 to explore the Earth and sun's magnetic fields. The new research was published Wednesday in the journal Nature.",
      "Chorus waves have also been spotted near other planets including Jupiter and Saturn. They can even produce high-energy electrons capable of scrambling satellite communications.",
      "\u201cThey are one of the strongest and most significant waves in space,\u201d said study author Chengming Liu from Beihang University in an email.",
      "The newfound chorus waves were detected in a region where Earth's magnetic field is stretched out, which scientists didn't expect. That raises fresh questions about how these chirping waves form.",
      "\u201cIt's very captivating, very compelling,\u201d Jaynes said. \u201cWe definitely need to find more of these events.\u201d",

      "The site \u2014 currently https://www.whitehouse.gov/es/ \u2014 now gives users an \u201cError 404\u201d message. It also included a \u201cGo Home\u201d button that directed viewers to a page featuring a video montage of Trump in his first term and on the campaign trail. The button was later updated to read \u201cGo To Home Page\u201d.",
      "Hispanic advocacy groups and others expressed confusion at the abrupt change and frustration at what some called the administration\u2019s lack of efforts to maintain communication with the Latino community, which helped propel him to the presidency.",
      "The Spanish profile of the White House\u2019 X, @LaCasaBlanca and the government page on reproductive freedom also were disbanded. Meanwhile, the Spanish versions of other government agencies such as the Department of Labor, Justice and Agriculture remained available for users on Tuesday.",
      "Asked about the changes, White House principal deputy press secretary Harrison Fields responded Tuesday that the administration is \u201ccommitted to bringing back online the Spanish translation section of the website.\u201d",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s day two. We are in the process of developing, editing and tweaking the White House website. As part of this ongoing work, some of the archived content on the website went dormant. We are committed to reloading that content in a short timeline,\" he said without elaborating.",
      "Trump removed the Spanish version of the page in 2017. At that time, White House officials said they would reinstate it. President Joe Biden reinstated the page in 2021.",
      "The page's removal coincided with Trump\u2019s first-day wave of executive orders highlighted by the launch of an illegal immigration crackdown that was one of his key campaign pledges. Trump on Monday declared a national emergency at the U.S.-Mexico border and announced plans to send U.S. troops to help support immigration agents and restrict refugees and asylum.",
      "According to 2023 Census Bureau estimates, about 43.4 million Americans \u2014 13.7% of the U.S. population age 5 and older \u2014 speak Spanish at home. The U.S. has no official language.",
      "Monica Rivera, a brand and communications strategist in New York City of Puerto Rican and Cuban descent, said the shutdown sends a clear signal.",
      "\u201cThere are 43 million Latinos who speak Spanish as their first language and removing access to information directly from the White House draws a distinct line as to who they are serving and more dangerously, signals to the administration\u2019s MAGA base that we as Latinos are \u2018other\u2019 and a less significant part of this country,\" Rivera said.",
      "Anthony Hernandez, a paralegal in the nation's capital, wasn\u2019t initially aware of the move and said it suggests what the coming years of a second Trump presidency would look like, with specific issues making headlines while \u201cminor but equally malicious things like that go unnoticed.\u201d",
      "\u201cA move like shutting down the Spanish White House page and X profile serves no purpose other than to cut off resources for millions of Hispanic Americans and immigrants attempting to enter the United States legally,\" Hernandez said. \"And it\u2019s a slap in the face to the millions of Hispanic voters that supported him in this recent election.\u201d",
      "Trump\u2019s secretary of state, Marco Rubio, is Cuban American and speaks Spanish. At his swearing-in Tuesday, he gave remarks in Spanish, thanking God, his family and Trump.",
      "Meanwhile, Hispanic leaders and communication strategy experts expressed surprise with the page's removal, given Trump\u2019s popularity with certain Latino voters.",
      "\u201cIf the White House is seriously interested in engaging with Latinos, the second largest group in this country, then they need to make sure that updates can also be distributed in Spanish, a preferred language for millions in our community,\u201d said Frankie Miranda President and CEO of the Hispanic Federation.",

      "Jeff Lee, former deputy cabinet secretary and deputy director of external and international affairs for former California Gov. Jerry Brown, said the move seems counterintuitive given the opportunity to \u201cshowcase\u201d policy changes, especially ones related to economics and border security.",

      "AP VoteCast, a nationwide survey of more than 120,000 voters, found Trump won a larger share of Black and Latino voters than he did in 2020, and most notably among men under age 45. Young Latinos, particularly young Latino men, also were more open to Trump than in 2020. Roughly half of young Latino men voted for Democratic Vice President Kamala Harris, compared with about 6 in 10 who went for Biden.",

      "President Donald Trump is talking up a joint venture investing up to $500 billion for infrastructure tied to artificial intelligence by a new partnership formed by OpenAI, Oracle and SoftBank",
      "WASHINGTON -- President Donald Trump on Tuesday talked up a joint venture investing up to $500 billion for infrastructure tied to artificial intelligence by a new partnership formed by OpenAI, Oracle and SoftBank.",
      "The new entity, Stargate, will start building out data centers and the electricity generation needed for the further development of the fast-evolving AI in Texas, according to the White House. The initial investment is expected to be $100 billion and could reach five times that sum.",
      "\u201cIt's big money and high quality people,\u201d said Trump, adding that it's \u201ca resounding declaration of confidence in America\u2019s potential\u201d under his new administration.",
      "Joining Trump fresh off his inauguration at the White House were Masayoshi Son of SoftBank, Sam Altman of OpenAI and Larry Ellison of Oracle. All three credited Trump for helping to make the project possible, even though building has already started and the project goes back to 2024.",
      "\u201cThis will be the most important project of this era,\" said Altman, CEO of OpenAI.",
      "Ellison noted that the data centers are already under construction with 10 being built so far. The chairman of Oracle suggested that the project was also tied to digital health records and would make it easier to treat diseases such as cancer by possibly developing a customized vaccine.",
      "\u201cThis is the beginning of golden age,\u201d said Son, referencing Trump's statement that the U.S. would be in a \u201cgolden age\u201d with him back in the White House.",
      "Son, a billionaire based in Japan, already committed in December to invest $100 billion in U.S. projects over the next four years. He previously committed to $50 billion in new investments ahead of Trump's first term, which included a large stake in the troubled office-sharing company WeWork.",
      "While Trump has seized on similar announcements to show that his presidency is boosting the economy, there were already expectations of a massive buildout in data centers and electricity plants needed for the development of AI, which holds the promise of increasing productivity by automating work but also the risk of displacing jobs if poorly implemented.",
      "The initial plans for Stargate go back to the Biden administration. Tech news outlet The Information first reported on the project in March 2024. OpenAI has long relied on Microsoft data centers to build its AI systems, but it has increasingly signaled an interest in building its own data centers.",
      "OpenAI wrote in a letter to the Biden administration\u2019s Commerce Department last fall that planning and permitting for such projects \u201ccan be lengthy and complex, particularly for energy infrastructure.\u201d",
      "Other partners in the project include Microsoft, investor MGX and the chipmakers Arm and NVIDIA, according to separate statements by Oracle and OpenAI.",
      "The push to build data centers predates Trump's presidency. Last October, the financial company Blackstone estimated that the U.S. would see $1 trillion invested in data centers over five years, with another $1 trillion being committed internationally.",
      "Those estimates for investments suggest that much of the new capital will go through Stargate as OpenAI has established itself as a sector leader with the 2022 launch of its ChatGPT, a chatbot that captivated the public imagination with its ability to answer complex questions and perform basic business tasks.",
      "The White House has put an emphasis on making it easier to build out new electricity generation in anticipation of AI's expansion, knowing that the United States is in a competitive race against China to develop a technology increasingly being adopted by businesses.",
      "Still, the regulatory outlook for AI remains somewhat uncertain as Trump on Monday overturned the 2023 order signed by then-President Joe Biden to create safety standards and watermarking of AI-generated content, among other goals, in hopes of putting guardrails on the technology's possible risks to national security and economic well-being.",
      "CBS News first reported that Trump would be announcing the AI investment.",
      "Trump supporter Elon Musk, worth more than $400 billion, was an early investor in OpenAI but has since challenged its move to for-profit status and has started his own AI company, xAI. Musk is also in charge of the \u201cDepartment of Government Efficiency\u201d created formally on Monday by Trump with the goal of reducing government spending.",

      "TikTok\u2019s China-based parent ByteDance was supposed to find a U.S. buyer or be banned on Jan. 19. Trump\u2019s order could give ByteDance more time to find a buyer.",
      "\u201cI guess I have a warm spot for TikTok,\u201d Trump said.",
      "Trump has amassed nearly 15 million followers on TikTok since he joined last year, and he has credited the trendsetting platform with helping him gain traction among young voters. Yet its 170 million U.S. users could not access TikTok for more than 12 hours between Saturday night and Sunday morning.",
      "The platform went offline before the ban approved by Congress and upheld by the U.S. Supreme Court took effect on Sunday. After Trump promised to pause the ban on Monday, TikTok restored access for existing users. Google and Apple, however, still have not reinstated TikTok to their app stores.",
      "Business leaders, lawmakers, legal scholars, and influencers who make money on TikTok are watching to see how Trump tries to resolve a thicket of regulatory, legal, financial and geopolitical issues with his signature.",
      "TikTok's app allows users to create and watch short-form videos, and broke new ground by operating with an algorithm that fed viewers recommendations based on their viewing habits. But concerns about its potential to serve as a tool for Beijing to manipulate and spy on Americans pre-date Trump's first presidency.",
      "In 2020, Trump issued executive orders banning dealings with ByteDance and the owners of the Chinese messaging app WeChat. Courts ended up blocking the orders, but less than a year ago Congress overwhelmingly passed a law citing national security concerns to ban TikTok unless ByteDance sold it to an approved buyer.",
      "The law, which went into force Sunday, allows for fines of up to $5,000 per U.S. TikTok user against major mobile app stores \u2014 like the ones operated by Apple and Google \u2014 and internet hosting services like Oracle if they continued to distribute TikTok to U.S. users beyond the deadline for ByteDance's divestment.",
      "Trump on Sunday said he had asked TikTok's U.S. service providers to continue supporting the platform and app while he prepared to sign an executive order to stop the ban for now.",
      "\u201cThe order will also confirm that there will be no liability for any company that helped keep TikTok from going dark before my order,\u201d Trump posted on Truth Social, his social networking site.",
      "The law that Congress passed and now-former President Joe Biden signed in April allowed for a 90-day extension if there had been progress toward a sale before the statute's effective date. Less certain is whether that provision can be applied retroactively, according to Sarah Kreps, director of Cornell University\u2019s Tech Policy Institute.",
      "\u201cExecutive orders cannot override existing laws,\u201d Kreps said. \u201cIt\u2019s not clear that the new president has that authority to issue the 90-day extension of a law that\u2019s already gone into effect.\u201d",
      "Kreps also doubts the conditions for a delay exist at this point without so much as even a potential buyer being named to prove that a sale was moving along.",
      "But Alan Rozenshtein, a University of Minnesota law professor, has written that the law also empowers the president to decide what constitutes a \"qualified divestiture\u201d \u2014 suggesting Trump could have discretion to say whether or when ByteDance meets the terms of the Protecting Americans from Foreign Adversary Controlled Applications Act.",
      "Although ByteDance spent months repeating it wasn't interested in selling, Beijing on Monday also signaled a possible easing on China's stance on TikTok to allow it to be divested from its Chinese parent company. China\u2019s vice president held meetings with Vice President JD Vance and Tesla tech titan Elon Musk on Sunday.",
      "Chinese Foreign Ministry spokeswoman Mao Ning, said Monday that business operations and acquisitions \u201cshould be independently decided by companies in accordance with market principles.\u201d",
      "\u201cIf it involves Chinese companies, China\u2019s laws and regulations should be observed,\u201d Mao said.",
      "Until now, it was widely believed that Beijing would not allow the sale of TikTok, which had come to embody China\u2019s defiance in the face of \u201cU.S. robbery.\u201d However, TikTok was among several issues brought up in a phone call between Chinese President Xi Jinping and Trump on Friday, though details were not available.",
      "Trump later announced plans to delay the TikTok ban and suggested a joint venture in which the U.S. would get a 50% ownership of the app. Shou Zi Chew, TikTok\u2019s CEO, attended Trump\u2019s inauguration, seated with American tech heavyweights.",
      "The Justice Department is generally tasked with enforcing the laws of the federal government, so it\u2019s possible that Trump will direct the DOJ to ignore the law. Such a move might itself be subject to legal scrutiny but would buy time for TikTok.",
      "Trump\u2019s efforts to save TikTok may put him at odds with some of the House members and senators who voted for the law, which received broad bipartisan support. House Speaker Mike Johnson called ByteDance's ownership \u201ca very dangerous thing,\u201d and said he expected a full sale to happen.",
      "\u201cI think we will enforce the law,\u201d Johnson told NBC News\u2019 \u201cMeet the Press\u201d on Sunday.",
      "Legislators now stand to \u201clook a little bit silly\u201d if the ban doesn\u2019t last, Kreps said.",
      "\u201c(The case) becomes about the separations of powers, and checks and balances, that we don\u2019t have a king who decides what happens with the law,\u201d Kreps said. \u201cEnforcement isn\u2019t only up to the executive branch.\u201d",
      "Sen. Tom Cotton of Arkansas, in a message posted on X, listed a number of state and federal agencies, and private entities, that might be willing to go to court to get the ban enforced.",
      "\u201cAny company that hosts, distributes, services, or otherwise facilitates communist-controlled TikTok could face hundreds of billions of dollars of ruinous liability under the law, not just from DOJ, but also under securities law, shareholder lawsuits, and state AGs,\u201d Cotton noted.",
      "Despite the intense scrutiny and potential costs involved, the machinations over TikTok are in some ways just business as usual for the tech companies involved, according to Gus Hurwitz, a legal scholar with the International Center for Law and Economics.",
      "\u201cThe fines that we\u2019re talking about are civil penalties and companies risk civil penalties all the time,\u201d Hurwitz said.",
      "Still, the hard business calculus of complying with a law in limbo or risk defying a president who holds lucrative federal contracts over those companies could come into focus if shareholders sue.",
      "Oracle, for example, has a part of the Pentagon\u2019s $9 billion contract to build its cloud computing network.",
      "\u201cThis actually could be the right business decision to make,\u201d Hurwitz said. \u201cThat\u2019s not necessarily a breach of duty to shareholders.\u201d",
      "There\u2019s been lots of questions about how companies such as Oracle and Akamai Technologies are powering TikTok\u2019s servers to stay online, while others such as Apple and Google have made the app unavailable for new users to download.",
      "None of the companies have responded to requests for comment.",
      "Oracle in 2020 announced it had a 12.5% stake in TikTok Global after securing its business as the app\u2019s cloud technology provider.",
      "Meanwhile, as of Monday night, a search for TikTok on Apple\u2019s app store directs to an online statement that reads in part: \u201cApple is obligated to follow the laws in the jurisdictions where it operates,\u201d while Google\u2019s app store notes downloads for TikTok \u201care paused due to current US legal requirements.\u201d",

      "Proponents of the uniquely volatile commodity argue it is a valuable hedge against inflation, similar to gold.",
      "Many bitcoin enthusiasts and investors are quick to say government-backed currencies are prone to devaluation and increased government buy-ins will stabilize future price swings, giving them more legitimacy and boosting already rising prices.",
      "But the risks are significant. Critics say crypto investments are highly speculative, with so much unknown about projecting future returns. They warn that investors should be prepared to lose money.",
      "Only a couple of public pension funds have invested in cryptocurrency. A U.S. Government Accountability Office study on 401(k) plan investments in crypto, issued late last year, warned it has \u201cuniquely high volatility.\u201d It found no standard approach for projecting the future returns of crypto.",
      "2024 was a landmark year for crypto, with bitcoin surpassing $100,000. The U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission approved the first exchange-traded funds that hold bitcoin. Now, crypto enthusiasts are banking on Trump's promise to make the United States the \u201cbitcoin superpower\u201d of the world.",
      "Lawmakers in more states can expect to see bills this year to make them crypto-friendly. Analysts say crypto is becoming a powerful lobby. Bitcoin miners are building new installations and venture capitalists are underwriting a growing tech sector that caters to cryptocurrencies.",
      "Meanwhile, a new crypto-friendly federal government under Trump and Congress could consider legislation from Sen. Cynthia Lummis, R-Wyoming, to create a federal bitcoin reserve on which states can piggyback.",
      "A bill introduced in November in Pennsylvania's House of Representatives sought to authorize the state's treasurer and public pension funds to invest in bitcoin. It went nowhere before the legislative session ended, but it caused a stir.",
      "\u201cI had a friend who is a rep down the road text me, \u2018Oh my god, I\u2019m getting so many emails and phone calls to my office,' more than he ever did about any other bill,\u201d said the measure's sponsor, Republican Mike Cabell.",
      "A bitcoin enthusiast who lost his reelection bid, Cabell expects a colleague to reintroduce his bill. Leaders of bitcoin advocacy group Satoshi Action say they expect legislation based on their model bill to be introduced in at least 10 other states this year.",
      "Keith Brainard, research director for the National Association of State Retirement Administrators, said he doesn\u2019t expect many public pension fund investment professionals, who oversee nearly $6 trillion in assets, to invest in crypto.",
      "Pension fund professionals take risks they deem to be appropriate, but bitcoin investing has a short track record, might only fit into a niche asset class and may not fit the risk-to-reward profile they seek.",
      "\u201cThere might be a bit of dabbling in bitcoin,\u201d Brainard said. \u201cBut it\u2019s difficult to envision a scenario in which pension funds right now are willing to make a commitment.\u201d",
      "Louisiana Treasurer John Fleming helped make the state the first to introduce a system allowing people to pay a government agency in cryptocurrencies.",
      "Fleming said he's not trying to promote cryptocurrency, but rather views it as a recognition that the government must innovate and be flexible about helping people do business with the state. He said he would never invest his money, or the state's, in crypto.",
      "\u201cMy concern is that at some point it\u2019ll stop growing and then people will want to cash in,\u201d Fleming said. \u201cAnd when they do, it could tank the value of a bitcoin.\u201d",
      "In Pennsylvania, Treasury Department officials said they have the authority to decide for themselves if cryptocurrencies meet the agency's investment standards under state law and don't need new legislation.",
      "Still, a highly volatile asset is ill-suited to the agency's need for predictability, considering it writes millions of checks a year. The overwhelming majority of the roughly $60 billion it invests at any given time is in short-term, conservative investments designed for an investment period of months, officials there said.",
      "Pension boards, which invest on a 30-year time horizon, may already hold small investments in companies involved in mining, trading and storing cryptocurrencies. But they have been slow to embrace bitcoin.",
      "That could change, said Mark Palmer, managing director and a senior research analyst at The Benchmark Company in New York.",
      "Pension boards got investment tools they like last year when the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission approved the first exchange-traded funds that hold bitcoin. In October, it approved listings of options on those funds, Palmer said.",
      "Many \u201care likely in the process of getting up to speed on what it means to invest in bitcoin and kicking the tires, so to speak, and that\u2019s a process that typically takes a while at the institutional level,\u201d Palmer said.",
      "Several major asset managers like BlackRock, Invesco and Fidelity have bitcoin ETFs.",
      "In May, the State of Wisconsin Investment Board became the first state to invest when it bought $160 million worth of shares in two ETFs, or about 0.1% of its assets. It later scaled back that investment to $104 million in one ETF, as of Sept. 30. A spokesperson declined to discuss it.",
      "Michigan's state investment board reported about $18 million in bitcoin ETF purchases, while a candidate for New Jersey governor, Steven Fulop, said that if elected he would push the state's pension fund to invest in crypto.",
      "Fulop, the Democratic mayor of Jersey City, just across the Hudson River from Manhattan, has been preparing for months to buy bitcoin ETF shares for up to 2% of the city's $250 million employee pension fund.",
      "\u201cWe were ahead of the curve,\" Fulop said. \u201cAnd I think that\u2019s what you\u2019re eventually going to see is this is widely accepted, with regard to exposure in all pension funds, some sort of exposure.\u201d",

      "During his first term as president, Donald Trump led the effort to ban TikTok, the hugely popular video-sharing site he said posed threats to U.S. national security",
      "NEW YORK -- During his first term as president, Donald Trump led the effort to ban TikTok, the hugely popular video-sharing site he said posed a threat to U.S. national security. But on the eve of his return to the White House, the president-elect is being hailed as the app's savior.",
      "After going dark for users this weekend, Trump said on his social media site that he would issue an executive order after he's sworn in for a second term on Monday delaying a TikTok ban \u201cso that we can make a deal to protect our national security.\u201d He said the order would make clear that companies will not be held liable for violating a law that aimed to force TikTok's sale by its China-based parent company. Hours later, the app returned, to the relief of its legions of dedicated users.",
      "\u201cThanks for your patience and support. As a result of President Trump's efforts, TikTok is back in the U.S.!\" read the announcement.",
      "Trump's legal authority to unilaterally decide not to enforce the law, which passed with overwhelming bipartisan support in April and was upheld by the Supreme Court on Friday, is unclear. But the rapid developments over the weekend served as a reminder of how dramatically debates over technology, social media and national security have changed since Trump was last in the White House. It also signaled how closely Trump is following those shifts after waging a successful campaign in which he made inroads with voters in part by harnessing the appeal of some social media platforms.",
      "Trump can now take credit for reviving an app with 170 million users that is especially popular with younger Americans, many of whom spend hours a day on the platform to get news, make money and find entertainment.",
      "\u201cThis is one of those things where the domestic politics has become so upside down and crazy that it turns out there\u2019s only upside for Trump now,\u201d said Bill Bishop, a China expert who has been closely following the back-and-forth. If the bans ends up being enforced, he said, Trump will say it was on outgoing President Joe Biden\u2019s watch. \u201cAnd if it does come back then Trump is a savior. And he will be rewarded both by users\u201d as well as the company, which he said is now \u201cbeholden to Trump\u201d and will have an incentive to make sure content on the platform is favorable to him.",
      "TikTok\u2019s move comes as tech companies and CEOs have been been working furiously to improve their standing with Trump. X owner and Tesla CEO Elon Musk has enjoyed unprecedented access to the president-elect after spending more than $200 million and personally campaigning to help him get elected.",
      "Meta CEO Mark Zuckerberg met with Trump at Mar-a-Lago and reshaped his social media platforms\u2019 policies to align more closely with Trump\u2019s worldview earlier this month, ending third-party fact-checking, loosening rules against hate speech, ending his company\u2019s diversity and equity policies and naming Dana White, the president and CEO of Ultimate Fighting Championship and a familiar figure in Trump\u2019s orbit, to its board.",
      "OpenAI CEO Sam Altman, Amazon, Meta and Google have all pledged to donate $1 million each to Trump\u2019s inaugural fund.",
      "The companies have a lot on the line, including regulatory challenges. Although federal regulators began cracking down on Google and Facebook during Trump\u2019s first term as president \u2014 and flourished under Biden \u2014 most experts expect his second administration to ease up on antitrust enforcement and be more receptive to business mergers.",
      "TikTok also worked to curry Trump's favor, with CEO Shou Chew meeting with him at Mar-a-Lago in December. In a video responding to the Supreme Court decision, Chew was careful to praise Trump and cast the app's fate as dependent on him.",
      "\u201cOn behalf of everyone at TikTok and all our users across the country, I want to thank President Trump for his commitment to work with us to find a solution that keeps TikTok available in the United States,\u201d he said. \u201cWe are grateful and pleased to have the support of a president who truly understands our platform.\"",
      "When the app went dark, it had initially posted a simple message informing users of the change, but later updated the language to include Trump.",
      "\u201cSorry, TikTok isn\u2019t available right now,\u201d it read. \u201cA law banning TikTok has been enacted in the U.S. Unfortunately, that means you can\u2019t use TikTok for now. We are fortunate that President Trump has indicated that he will work with us on a solution to reinstate TikTok once he takes office. Please stay tuned!\u201d",
      "The federal law had required TikTok parent company ByteDance to cut ties with the platform\u2019s U.S. operations by Sunday. The Biden administration had stressed in recent days that it did not intend to enforce the ban before Trump took office. But TikTok said it would nonetheless \u201cgo dark\u201d because the Biden administration had not provided \u201cnecessary clarity and assurance\u201d to service providers \u2014 a stance outgoing Deputy National Security Adviser Jon Finer cast as disingenuous.",
      "\u201cFrankly, it doesn\u2019t feel completely on the level,\u201d he said on ABC\u2019s \u201cThis Week.\" \u201cI think we were extremely clear that there was no need to take this action,\u201d he said.",
      "Trump said in an interview with NBC News on Saturday that he was considering granting ByteDance a 90-day extension to sell. ByteDance has repeatedly refused to sell, but the company is being eyed by investors including Trump\u2019s former Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin and billionaire businessman Frank McCourt.",
      "Sarah Kreps, director of Cornell University\u2019s Tech Policy Institute, said there was no evidence ByteDance had made any meaningful progress toward divestiture, \u201cso I don\u2019t see how, by any measure, it would legally meet those conditions.\u201d",
      "\u201cFurther, an Executive Order cannot legally override or cancel a law that Congress passed,\u201d she said. \"Laws enacted through the legislative process have a higher legal standing and an EO that conflicts with the existing law, the law takes precedence and the EO would likely be struck down by the courts.\u201d",
      "Sen. Tom Cotton, the Republican chairman of the Senate Select Committee on Intelligence, warned Sunday that there is no legal basis for the kind of extension Trump is pursuing.",
      "\u201cAny company that hosts, distributes, services, or otherwise facilitates communist-controlled TikTok could face hundreds of billions of dollars of ruinous liability under the law, not just from DOJ, but also under securities law, shareholder lawsuits, and state AGs,\u201d he wrote on X. \u201cThink about it.\u201d",
      "Trump, in his Sunday post, proposed new terms of a deal in which he said the United States would have \u201ca 50% ownership position in a joint venture\u201d that would be \"set up between the U.S. and whichever purchase we so choose.\u201d But the details remained murky and it was unclear whether Trump was proposing control by the U.S. government or another company. Trump did not elaborate during a rally Sunday night, where he hailed the move.",
      "\u201cAs of today, TikTok is back,\u201d he said. \u201cWe have no choice. We have to save it.\u201d",
      "Though Trump sought to ban TikTok during his first term, he reversed that stance during his 2024 campaign, when he came to believe a ban would help the app's rival, Facebook, which he held responsible, in part, to his 2020 election loss to Biden.",
      "Trump ended up joining the app last year and has grown his following to nearly 15 million users. He has since credited the app for helping him win over young voters.",
      "\u201cI have a warm spot in my heart for TikTok,\u201d he said during a December news conference. \u201cTikTok had an impact.\u201d",

      "Some users reported Sunday that the app was working again, but it remained unavailable for download in Apple and Google\u2019s app stores. Others remained locked out of accessing their profiles and the communities they had built online.",
      "Here's how content creators are reacting:",
      "On a typical morning, esthetician and social media personality Lee Zavorskas scrolls on TikTok while she sips coffee. Sunday morning was different \u2013 she scribbled a to-do list instead, which included playing with her cats and dog and plotting how to bolster her presence on other platforms like YouTube since TikTok went dark for her Saturday night.",
      "\u201cI\u2019m a 58-year-old content creator that found a seat at the table that\u2019s not available on Instagram,\u201d Zavorskas said.",
      "While Zavorskas has more followers on Instagram, she found a large crowd of people over the age of 40 on TikTok, making it easier to build her audience. She held out some hope that she would be able to return to the community she found on the app.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s like going to your favorite restaurant and ordering your favorite food, and they\u2019re like, \u2018You know what? We took it away,\u2019\u201d she said.",
      "Tiffany Cianci, a Maryland-based content creator who owns small businesses, stopped posting on Twitter and Instagram and cut her advertising with Meta and Google out of frustration.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s TikTok or nothing for me,\u201d she said.",
      "She thinks lawmakers unfairly punished TikTok for succeeding alongside its profitable competitors. And they played \u201cpolitical football\u201d with an app that millions of small businesses rely on to survive, she said.",
      "\u201cI spoke to small businesses in the last three days that have sobbed on my livestreams, afraid they\u2019ll have to lay their employees off tomorrow morning,\u201d Cianci said. \u201cThey are so afraid because they have other people\u2019s lives in their hands.\u201d",
      "Tiffany Watson, a 20-year-old beauty content creator, had been making videos since the days of Musical.ly, and was just starting to figure out the kind of content she was passionate about when TikTok went dark.",
      "\u201cThe community on TikTok is like nothing else, so it\u2019s weird to not have that anymore,\u201d she said.",
      "With spare time on her hands, Watson plans to focus on bolstering her presence on Instagram and YouTube. She also wants to devote more time to school as the psychology major and criminal justice minor prepares to graduate from Wingate University in North Carolina and enter \u201cthe real world.\" But being a content creator remains her \u201cmain dream,\" she said.",

      "Emails and videos of burned buildings in Los Angeles versus those still standing have been flying back and forth among architects, builders and fire safety specialists around the world",
      "Emails and videos of burned buildings in Los Angeles next to those left standing have been flying back and forth among architects, builders and fire safety specialists around the world.",
      "For many homeowners, like Enrique Balcazar, the sometimes scattershot nature of the carnage can seem like random chance. Balcazar, a real estate agent, posted video that showed little more than chimneys remaining of most homes on his block after fire leapt through his Altadena neighborhood. Balcazar stood on his neighbor's destroyed classic Mustang to douse his smoldering roof, but his home was otherwise fine.",
      "\u201cIt's an older house and it still has the old wood sidings,\u201d Balcazar said. \u201cTo me there's nothing explainable in logical or scientific reason of why my house would not have burned.\u201d",
      "Many experts say luck does play a part. After all, wind can shift 180 degrees in a split second, pushing fire away from your house and towards a neighbor's. But they also say there are many ways that homes can be made less vulnerable to fire.",
      "\u201cBecause there are, say, 50 ways a fire can burn your house,\" said Greg Faulkner of Faulkner Architects in California, who has focused on less combustible home exteriors for more than a decade. \u201cIf you eliminate half of those, or three-quarters of them, that\u2019s not luck, that\u2019s increasing your odds.\u201d",
      "People in fire country generally know that trees, landscaping and wood fences near homes can be a fire risk. Architects and contractors are going beyond that, using newer materials and techniques in roofing, walls and windows to keep buildings standing. The measures do add cost to the homes \u2014 around 3% to 6%, Faulkner said, or as much as 10% for the most robust protection.",
      "Many of these experts no longer use wood siding. Where it is used, or still allowed, it needs to have a fire-resistant barrier underneath, often made of gypsum, the same material used to make drywall. That way if the wood catches fire, it takes longer for the heat to reach inside the home",
      "But even with that, you\u2019re still putting a combustible material on the building, said Richard Schuh, with Nielsen : Schuh Architects. \u201cSo that would be something we would avoid. Use of fire-resistant materials is critical.\u201d",
      "Stucco, a cement material, is a common exterior for Southern California houses and it's fire-resistant. Reviewing AP photographs showing buildings still standing, Arnold Tarling, who has four decades experience in fire protection and building inspection in Britain, said houses with stucco walls appeared to survive the Los Angeles fires better. Yet if more of them had had a layer of gypsum beneath the stucco, it would have given more protection from the heat, he said.",
      "Windows are a huge factor in whether a home burns down, because so much heat is transmitted through them. Double-pane windows significantly slow heat coming from the burning building next door.",
      "\u201cThe outside layer protects the inside layer until it fails,\u201d said Schuh. Codes in many places require one of the two panes to be tempered, which is much more resistant to heat than conventional glass, he said.",
      "Tarling noted one intact Malibu beachfront home, surrounded by gutted buildings. He speculated that the fact that no windows faced a neighbor helped protect it because radiated heat couldn\u2019t penetrate as easily.",
      "In his buildings, Faulkner builds in fire shutters that can slide closed and cover the windows.",
      "Then there's the roof \u2014 a convenient landing pad for fire embers.",
      "Simpler roof lines can allow red-hot embers to slide off. Spanish Mission, for example, is an iconic Los Angeles style \u2014 part of what says \u201cHollywood\u201d in movies about the city, for example, as well as a reminder of its Mexican and Spanish history. That style doesn\u2019t always have simple roof lines \u2014 the knee walls that are common on Mission-style roofs create corners.",
      "\u201cThe embers could, just like snow, gather in that corner,\u201d Faulkner said.",
      "Many roofs in the U.S. are covered in asphalt. Areas that are designated as wildfire-prone in California \u2013 an ever-growing area \u2013 are required to use roofing that delays the transfer of heat to the inside of the building, called one-hour or Class A.",
      "Still, asphalt is a petroleum product. Some building professionals prefer metal, which doesn\u2019t burn. Metal has its own downside, though: It conducts heat. Putting a layer of gypsum under a metal roof is becoming a common practice in some areas.",
      "Maybe as important as which material is used on a roof is whether the roof offers fire a way to get in. Here, as in so many tradeoffs, one effort to do good conflicts with another: Contractors have been more careful over the years to make sure moisture doesn't build up in attics by making sure air circulates, using those vents that are visible on many roofs or under eaves.",
      "But in a powerful fire, Schuh says, \u201cif you\u2019re on the side where the wind is putting pressure against the house, it\u2019s also blowing the flames into the house like a blow torch,\u201d and fire gets in through the vents.",
      "On the other side of the house, it can create a vacuum, several experts said, sucking fire in.",
      "But you can\u2019t easily just eliminate roof ventilation because it will cause moisture problems, said Cesar Martin Gomez, an architect at the University of Navarra, Spain, who\u2019s worked for 25 years in building services.",
      "Faulkner said in some buildings he's eliminating the need for ventilation in the roof structure by sealing the spaces. Schuh is using a cover on roof vents that can actually respond to fire with a mesh that closes.",
      "Martin Gomez noted that in some parts of Australia, new homes are required to have water tanks. \u201cIf each home has the ability to protect itself, fire won\u2019t be able to spread as much,\u201d he said.",
      "And some homes in the U.S. are now built with sprinkler systems for the outside of the house, not just the inside. It sprays water with a soapy solution to make it flow over the surface of the building, Schuh said.",
      "\u201cYou\u2019re adding one more layer of protection to your building, and that\u2019s more of a priority now than ever because your insurance company may or not be around for you,\u201d he said.",

      "Hegseth lost the support of two Senate Republicans during that Thursday vote.",
      "The Senate, in an extremely narrow vote, confirmed Pete Hegseth, President Donald Trump's embattled pick to serve as secretary of defense.",
      "The vote was initially 50-50, with Vice President JD Vance then casting the tie-breaking vote.",
      "Former GOP leader Mitch McConnell, of Kentucky, voted no. He joined Sens. Susan Collins, of Maine, and Lisa Murkowski, of Alaska, along with all Democrats in voting against Hegseth's nomination.",
      "Hegseth, a former \"Fox and Friends\" television anchor, was nominated by Trump in November to lead the Defense Department. In the time since his nomination was announced, Hegseth has been scrutinized for a number of accusations made against him, including those of sexual assault and financial mismanagement of two different veterans organizations.",
      "Hegseth has fiercely denied the allegations. He appeared before the Senate Armed Services Committee for a public hearing earlier this month, where he asserted to the panel that he was a \"changed man.\"",
      "\"I am not a perfect person, but redemption is real,\" he told the panel.",
      "Speaking to reporters while on a visit to Los Angeles, President Donald Trump said he was \"very happy\" with the vote, and said he was not aware of McConnell's vote.",
      "In a statement released while the vote was still going on, McConnell said that Hegseth's desire to be a \"change agent\" was not enough to qualify him for the role of secretary of defense.",
      "\"Effective management of nearly 3 million military and civilian personnel, an annual budget of nearly $1 trillion, and alliances and partnerships around the world is a daily test with staggering consequences for the security of the American people and our global interests,\" McConnell said in the statement. \"Mr. Hegseth has failed, as yet, to demonstrate that he will pass this test. But as he assumes office, the consequences of failure are as high as they have ever been.\"",
      "Hegseth was confirmed by one of the narrowest Senate margins of any defense secretary in modern history. Most defense secretaries have been confirmed with broad bipartisan votes.",
      "Lloyd Austin, former President Joe Biden's pick for defense secretary, was confirmed in a 93-2 vote and Trump's first pick for defense secretary in his first term, James Mattis, was confirmed in a 98-1 vote.",
      "Before the vote, Hegseth arrived at the Capitol with his wife and children to watch the proceedings in person, a rare move for a Cabinet nominee.",
      "With the Senate's vote Friday, Hegseth becomes the third member of Trump's team to be confirmed by the Senate, following Marco Rubio as secretary of state and John Ratcliffe, as CIA director.",
      "During the same hearing, he affirmed his promise to restore the \"warfighting ethos\" of the DOD, touting his experience in the National Guard.",

Roger Wicker, the chairman of the Senate Armed Services Committee, said in a floor speech endorsing Hegseth on Thursday. \"He will restore a warfighting ethos and relentlessly focused on the military's core mission: to deter conflict and, if necessary, to win a war.\"",
      "The Senate Armed Services Committee advanced his nomination on a party-line vote on Monday. Then, in a closely watched moment on Thursday, Hegseth's nomination passed a key test vote that set the table for Friday's vote of final passage.",
      "The nomination only required a simple majority in the Senate to advance, and it cleared the threshold narrowly, with only GOP backing.",
      "Collins and Murkowski also voted no on that occasion.",
      "In a statement, Murkowski explained that she could not support Hegseth due to concerns about this character and lack of experience.",
      "\"I believe that character is the defining trait required of the Secretary of Defense and must be prioritized without compromise,\" Murkowski said in the post. \"The leader of the Department of Defense must demonstrate and model the standards of behavior and character we expect of all servicemembers, and Mr. Hegseth's nomination to the role poses significant concerns that I cannot overlook.\"",
      "Collins took issue with comments Hegseth made in the past about his belief that women should not serve in combat roles in the military. Though Hegseth has since changed his tune on that, Collins said she was unconvinced.",
      "\"I am also concerned about multiple statements, including some in the months just before he was nominated, that Mr. Hegseth has made about women serving in the military,\" Collins said. \"He and I had a candid conversation in December about his past statements and apparently evolving views. I am not convinced that his position on women serving in combat roles has changed.\"",
      "Trump expressed confidence in Hegseth ahead of the vote on Friday, though he added, \"You'll never know what's going to happen.\"",
      "McConnell, the former GOP leader, and North Carolina Sen. Thom Tillis, ultimately cast votes in favor of advancing Hegseth's nomination in the earlier test vote, although the president questioned whether McConnell will vote no on Hegseth Friday morning.",
      "Tillis said he was still considering the most recent slate of allegations against Hegseth, leveled in an affidavit from Hegseth's former sister-in-law Danielle Hegseth. In that affidavit, which ABC News obtained, Danielle Hegseth attested that Pete Hegseth's ex-wife Samantha told her she \"once hid in her closet from Hegseth because she feared for her personal safety\" in the home they shared during their marriage. It also detailed episodes of binge drinking by Pete Hegseth.",
      "An attorney for Pete Hegseth denied these allegations, and allegations of abuse were also rejected by his ex-wife.",
      "Tillis said he so far has not found credible evidence to back many of the allegations that have be levied against Pete Hegseth but that he's still doing his vetting on these most recent developments.",
      "\"I am in the process of completing due diligence on what appears to be the last allegation. All the other ones I couldn't conclude had validity,\" Tillis said Thursday. \"So I'm talking to people that can give me data inputs. It all goes back to the same thing -- first-hand, eye-witness, corroborated account.\"",

      "Officials say they have recaptured the final four monkeys who escaped two months ago from a South Carolina compound that breeds them for medical research",
      "YEMASSEE, S.C. -- Authorities in South Carolina said Friday the last four of 43 escaped monkeys have been recaptured after two months living in the woods, weathering a rare snowstorm and being temped back into captivity by peanut butter and jelly sandwiches.",
      "The rhesus macaque monkeys, all females, made a break for it after police say an employee did not fully lock their enclosure at Alpha Genesis, a facility that breeds them for medical research \u2014 known to locals as \u201cthe monkey farm.\u201d",
      "The recaptured monkeys appeared to be in good health, Alpha Genesis CEO Greg Westergaard said in a statement relayed by Yemassee Police in a social media post, without further details.",
      "While they were on the loose, the area saw its first snow in seven years, accumulating up to 3 inches (8 centimeters).",
      "The rhesus macaques made a break for it on Nov. 6, and mostly hung around near the facility. They're about the size of a cat, weighing roughly 7 pounds (3 kilograms).",
      "It appears a worker unintentionally left the gates unlocked when the monkeys escaped, Westergaard said in November. Workers were supposed to lock and latch one gate before opening another, but all three gates and latches were left unsecure.",
      "The monkeys posed no risk to public health, said Alpha Genesis, federal health officials and police.",
      "Alpha Guard employees kept an eye on the monkeys and set out humane traps. Most were lured back with food and were given peanut butter and jelly sandwiches and \"monkey biscuits\" \u2014 a high-protein Purina Monkey Chow specially formulated for the rhesus macaques.",
      "The facility breeds the monkeys to sell to medical facilities and other researchers. Humans have been using the monkeys for scientific research since the late 1800s.

      "Congress late last year replenished the disaster relief fund by $110 billion, with $29 billion for FEMA's response, recovery and mitigation activities related to presidentially declared major disasters, including Hurricane Helene and Milton, which President Joe Biden signed into law in December.",
      "When a disaster hits, state and local governments are in charge, and a lot of what FEMA currently does is support them and reimburse states for disaster aid.",
      "Trump has claimed this process has not worked well and hurt people in disaster areas.",
      "\"You want to use your state to fix it and not waste time calling FEMA. And then FEMA gets here and they don't know the area. They've never been to the area, and they want to give you rules that you've never heard about. They want to bring people that aren't as good as the people you already have. And FEMA has turned out to be a disaster,\" Trump told reporters Friday.",
      "However, lawmakers from both sides of the aisle have traditionally supported FEMA, given assistance from the agency could be needed at any time. A majority of direct FEMA assistance since 2015 has gone to states such as Florida, Louisiana and Texas, which have been hit with several natural disasters, according to federal records.",
      "Trump's proposals have been echoed by many of his supporters, including the Heritage Foundation, which pushed forward proposals in its \"Project 2025\" playbook.",
      "The think tank proposed moving the agency out of DHS and privatizing some of its programs, including the National Flood Insurance Program, which operates in vulnerable areas where, in some instances, private insurers won't -- and raising the damage and cost threshold that states need to meet in order to qualify for federal relief.",
      "It also proposed changing the cost-sharing arrangement so that the federal government only covers a maximum of 75% of the costs of disasters instead of 100%.",
      "There was little initial reaction from Capitol Hill on Trump's call to end FEMA. However, one key Republican said she is not fully on board.",

      "The 1,500 troops will not be engaging in law enforcement duties, according to a U.S. official, who also stressed the military personnel are only being sent to the border in support of the Department of Homeland Security and that they will not have any interactions with migrants crossing the southern border.",
      "The first word of the C-17 deportation flights came from the White House's X account. The first official video footage of the Marines at the border in San Diego was also posted on that same account later in the day.",

      "But a notable exception was made for posts about the military's support mission along the southern border, which he labeled \"a top priority\" and notably means that the only Defense Department social media posts for the next 10 days will be about operations along the border.",
      "The arrival of the C-17 flights in Guatemala were open to the local press, which captured video and stills of the 160 deportees getting off the huge military transports.",
      "There are no further deportation flights scheduled for the near future, said a U.S. official, who noted that the pace of the flights depends on a variety of factors -- namely the State Department being able to get diplomatic acceptance by the country that will be receiving back its nationals.",
      "Typically, DHS uses contracted civilian aircraft to undertake deportation or removal flights to the deportees' home countries.",
      "A spokesman for U.S. Transportation Command told ABC News that the two deportation flights were the first time that USTRANSCOM aircraft had been used for such a mission since the military command was established in 1982.

      "However, U.S. officials said there is no current planning for a near-term expansion of the border mission as the focus remains on ensuring that the 1,500 troops being sent to the border are fully operational.",

      "One fears the intelligence community will keep resisting despite Trump's order.",
      "Experts who've spent decades studying the assassination of President John F. Kennedy told ABC News Friday they are hopeful that President Donald Trump will see to the disclosure of government documents on the killing that have been withheld from the public.",
      "But despite the president's order Thursday directing a plan for \"full and complete release\" of the material, some prominent researchers are not holding their breath.",
      "\"This order is a good first step, but it has loopholes in it,\" warns author Jefferson Morley, whose website, jfkfacts.org, says it seeks to \"abolish the official secrecy\" that surrounds the 1963 assassination.",
      "Pointing to language in Trump's order that calls for a \"plan\" for the release, Morley fears continued foot-dragging within the intelligence community over some 3,600 documents in the National Archives' JFK collection that still contain redactions.",
      "\"These agencies have not been cooperative with the law, with Congress, or with anybody over the last 60 years,\" Morley said. \"That resistance to full disclosure is not going to stop because Trump issued an order.\"",
      "The order Trump signed Thursday directs a plan within 15 days for the \"full and complete release\" of JFK-related material, and within 45 days for information about the killings of Robert F. Kennedy and Martin Luther King, Jr.",
      "New York-based attorney Larry Schnapf, who has in the past sued the government to compel the release of JFK documents, says years of experience battling a reluctant national security apparatus inform his skepticism.",
      "\"We're hoping this is going to be a mechanical plan,\" Schnapf said. \"But if they're going to do a substantive [document-by-document] review, then it's going to be a while before the records are released.\"",
      "Schnapf also worries that the current lack of confirmed Trump-appointees in key roles at the intelligence agencies could slow the disclosures.",
      "\"If [Trump] doesn't get his people in within 15 days, I think we're going to have an initial delay, anyway,\" Schnapf said.",
      "In 1992, Congress passed a law requiring full disclosure of the JFK documents by 2017. But the law also allowed for exceptions if the president certified that \"identifiable harm\" to national security would be done if the secrets were revealed. Even as they oversaw the release of tens of thousands of pages, both Donald Trump and Joe Biden yielded to concerns of the CIA, FBI and other agencies, that thousands more documents should remain redacted.",
      "A December 2022 memo to the White House has the CIA's chief data officer writing that \"limited redactions\" were still necessary to keep secret the names of CIA employees, intelligence assets, sources and methods still in use, as well as \"still-classified covert action programs still in effect.\"",
      "Jefferson Morley calls that bunk.",
      "\"The fact that they're using techniques today that they used in an operation involving Oswald -- and therefore it should remain secret -- that's absurd,\" Morley said.",
      "Author Gerald Posner, who wrote the 1993 book, \"Case Closed: Lee Harvey Oswald and the Assassination of JFK,\" is less pessimistic than Morley and Schnapf about the timing of the releases.",
      "\"[Trump] doesn't like to be humiliated or made to look as though there's a limit on his power,\" Posner said. \"And if [the agencies] come back and want to hold onto stuff this time, they're going to have a tougher road.\"",
      "Posner and the other experts agree that the CIA is likely to be embarrassed by the disclosures, since the redacted documents are expected to shine further light on the spy agency's tracking of Lee Harvey Oswald as early as 1959 -- surveillance that intensified in the months leading to Kennedy's death as Oswald traveled to Mexico City with a plan to defect to Communist Cuba.",
      "\"In an ideal world, we would get to that bottom of that story by finding out more about the officers who had Oswald under surveillance, more about the CIA operations that enveloped Oswald as he made his way towards Dallas,\" Morley said, calling the CIA's files \"key to the story.\"",
      "One key advocate for release aims to have a seat at Trump's cabinet table, and is hoping to learn more from government records about the 1968 assassination of his father.",
      "\"The 60-year strategy of lies and secrecy, disinformation, censorship, and defamation employed by Intel officials to obscure and suppress troubling facts about JFK's assassination has provided the playbook for a series of subsequent crises,\" Robert F. Kennedy Junior said in a statement, pointing to the killings of RFK and MLK, the wars in Vietnam and Iraq, 9/11 and the government's handling of Covid-19.",
      "\"[E]ach accelerated the subversion of our exemplary democracy by the Military/Medical Industrial Complex and pushed us further down the road toward totalitarianism,\" Kennedy said.",

    "summary": "President Donald Trump's first week in office focused on immigration over the economy and continued to play to his base.",
    "story": [
      "He focused on immigration over the economy and continued to play to his base.",
      "Welcome to 538's politics chat. The transcript below has been lightly edited.",
      "tia.yang (Tia Yang, senior editor): President Donald Trump's second term began on Monday, and he's already taken a record number of executive actions. A lot has happened this week, so today we thought we'd debrief and discuss what mattered most (or least), what it tells us about how Trump is approaching his second presidency and what we might expect moving forward.",
      "So, what stood out to you all the most this week?",
      "meredithconroy (Meredith Conroy, political scientist at California State University, San Bernardino and 538 contributor): Right out of the gate, the Trump administration is testing the degree to which the other branches are willing to exercise their constitutional obligation to check executive power and authority with the flurry of executive orders he issued.",
      "As we noted earlier this week, in terms of sheer number of executive orders, it's more than any modern president has issued on their first day, and in one of those orders he rescinded 78 that were signed by former President Joe Biden. Executive orders can run the gamut from what are effectively toothless press releases to major policies that are quickly actionable, and it looks like there is a mix of that among Trump's. Notably, a few are obviously unconstitutional or conflict with existing statutes (e.g. the law banning TikTok), so the extent to which the newly GOP-controlled Congress or this Supreme Court, which has been friendly to Trump on a number of issues, are open to ceding their power is being immediately tested.",
      "tia.yang: Right, already just yesterday a court halted one of those actions \u2014 the one ending birthright citizenship, a right that's been guaranteed by the Constitution for over a century. That means that, at least for now, the order won't have immediate effects and could be DOA. But what happens next could tell us something important about Trump's continuing relationship with the courts. In his first term, he appointed three justices to the Supreme Court, as well as a significant share of those serving on lower courts (some of whom could be vying for a future Supreme Court nomination from him).",
      "meredithconroy: On birthright citizenship and how that challenges interbranch power dynamics, Adam Serwer at The Atlantic put it this way: \"Trump's executive order on birthright citizenship is an early test of the federal judiciary, and of the extent to which Republican-appointed judges and justices are willing to amend the Constitution from the bench just to give Trump what he wants.\"",
      "Monica Potts (Monica Potts, senior politics reporter): Yes, I expect there to be so many legal challenges to nearly everything. But I think part of that is the point. Some legal ground will seem, or actually will be, unsettled because he is challenging centuries- and decades-old laws. It'll open businesses and governments up to lawsuits potentially no matter what they do.",
      "The other thing I would say is that he has threatened to investigate local government officials and prosecutors who don't enact his policy desires, so it's setting up battles up and down the government.",
      "gelliottmorris (G. Elliott Morris, editorial director of data analytics): Jamelle Bouie over at The New York Times also has a good point about this. His most recent column talks about an influential right-wing commentator, codenamed Mencius Moldbug, who has argued for a dictator-president (he calls his ideal form of government a monarchy via CEO-king) and is very popular with the types of Silicon Valley conservatives who are increasingly gaining power in Trump's circles. To them, and to Trump, testing the limits of power is the whole point.",
      "To Tia's initial question, aside from the sheer breadth of Trump's interpretation of executive powers (which Meredith rightly points out will not result in immediate policy outputs for many of the executive orders he has signed), what stood out to me was how little Trump has focused on or even mentioned the one issue of his 2024 campaign that arguably did the most to get him elected: the economy.",
      "You can see this if you look through that long list of Trump's first-week executive orders. The only ones that even mention the economy substantively* are primarily focused on energy: his declaration of a national energy emergency, which says high energy prices have \"devastated\" low-income Americans, and his broader order on domestic energy production, which aims to bolster oil and gas drilling. But economists say this will have little impact on prices of everyday goods and services.",
      "(By the way, gasoline as a share of average income is approaching a decade-long low.)",
      "Beyond this, Trump has dedicated almost all of his initial efforts to immigration. He suspended refugee resettlement and stopped flights of immigrants already cleared to land in America, canceled appointments for asylum and, of course, there's his attempt to upend birthright citizenship.",
      "I feel like this is the key theme worth watching moving forward. Trump won in 2024 in large part because people were upset about prices. Where do they go from here, especially if he pursues aggressive tariffs which many economists (and the Congressional Budget Office) believe will be inflationary?",
      "Monica Potts: To Elliott's point about the economy: An AP-NORC poll from a few days ago showed that many voters are skeptical that Trump will be able to fulfill his promises on lowering prices, so they seem to acknowledge that that is really beyond a president's power. But you're right, many voters chose Trump because they remained upset about high prices and the affordability crisis across the board. What they likely want to see is more money in their pockets and more economic security, and I don't think many of Trump's actions so far were directly designed to do that.",
      "That being said, a point I will hit on constantly is that presidents don't have a huge effect on the economy one way or another, at least not directly or quickly. Inflation had already returned to almost normal by the time Biden left office, and Americans will also just become used to some things costing more. I don't think they'll directly hold Trump accountable whatever happens, unless the economy is a mess in four years' time and they're deciding whether to keep Republicans in power or to change course.",
      "gelliottmorris: To that point, Monica, I'd note just how confusing it is to credit any given leader or policy with overall economic growth: My modal expectation for Trump is that he will get some credit for the economic growth that happened in the last few years of Biden's presidency. As inflation in the 2021-2023 period fades from peoples' minds, Trump will get credit for prices coming down and economic activity restarting post-pandemic. Look at the boom in building development in Austin, Texas, for example. Rents there have gone down by more than 10 percent over the last year. Biden obviously didn't get credit for that. Trump could.",
      "tia.yang: As you point out, Elliott, immigration seems to be where Trump has directed most of his focus \u2014 I want to get at why that is. Of the issues he's tackled so far, immigration seems to easily be the issue area where the public is most on his side. Do you think Trump has focused so heavily on immigration to score some easy points? And has he scored some easy points? After all, immigration consistently ranked as the other big issue that Trump and Republicans won on this fall, and is an area that presidents can have more immediate and direct impacts on than the economy.",
      "Monica Potts: I do think that a lot of the moves will score points with voters who feel that he is doing something on immigration. Polls showed that many voters did want Trump to get what they believe to be a border crisis under control.",
      "But when asked about or pressed on some of the consequences of a tough border policy, like the potential to lose foreign workers, which will have economic effects, or splitting families apart, voters were less keen on some of those ideas. And it's hard to forget how Trump's border policies were a lightning rod for opposition during his first term, spawning massive protests and backlash. So he might get early points from some voters on that, but we'll have to see if and how these actions are enforced to truly understand how voters feel. I suspect many of these actions will prove unpopular in the long run.",
      "gelliottmorris: Tia, I think you're right about why Trump's administration is focusing executive action where they are. At the start of a term, a president wants to score big wins where he can and as fast as possible. Think about Biden's early executive orders and the policies he pushed to pass in Congress, including an extra pandemic stimulus package that was popular (and arguably inflationary).",
      "But rhetoric is another matter entirely. Talk is cheap, and Trump could have gone big on all the things he will do to fix the economy. Instead, he went big on immigration, tariffs and good-old-fashioned American hegemony in his inaugural address and speeches later that day. When it comes to the economy, he promised a \"golden age\" for America ... but that was pretty much it.",
      "Of course, maybe that's the point. Inflation is firmly in the Federal Reserve's target range now. The job market is appropriately tight (putting less pressure on wages to rise, which increases prices). Overall labor force participation is high, and unemployment is at or near historic lows every month we get new data. The economy, broadly speaking, is on a tear and has been for about a year. It's likely that Trump's team knows they extracted proper political power out of Americans' dissatisfaction with high inflation during last year's election, and now as a president inheriting a good economy, they shouldn't rock the boat.",
      "meredithconroy: The immigration issue checks a lot of boxes for the Trump administration. MAGA Republicanism has a narrow vision of what it means to be an American, and it goes part and parcel with their efforts to \"restore\" the United States as a country that is dominant, powerful and defined by a singular, exclusionary identity that many of his more vocal supporters endorse. For example, \"replacement theory\" \u2014 a conspiracy theory that nonwhite people are being brought into the U.S. to replace white voters and support Democrats \u2014 was regularly discussed on Fox News, so it was approaching a mainstream conservative view by the election.",
      "Monica Potts: Yes, Meredith, I agree with that. It's very important to MAGA Republicans and so this is where their focus will be.",
      "tia.yang: I'd also emphasize, though, that these immigration moves aren't just something that will appeal to Trump's base \u2014 the public has come around to Trump's anti-immigration policies in a big way since his first presidency. That's especially true of his party as a whole.",
      "For one, I thought it was pretty striking that the Senate passed a GOP-backed bill to require the detention of undocumented immigrants charged with crimes, on the very day of Trump's inauguration. That bill is similar to some provisions of an executive order Trump signed later that day, and is named after Laken Riley, whose murder became a major rallying point for GOP anger over immigration throughout the 2024 election. It had already picked up some support from Democrats last year and has now passed both chambers with modest bipartisan support. It's presumably going to be the first bill Trump signs into law in his second term.",
      "The new GOP majority scheduling that vote on Trump's first day was a powerful sign of unity behind the new president from the upper chamber, which has generally been less \"Trumpy\" than the House. I got a push alert about the Senate vote literally as I was watching the inaugural parade. Of course, that doesn't necessarily mean new Majority Leader John Thune, who is more of an establishment than MAGA figure, will line up behind Trump on every issue, but the message on day one was unity behind the MAGA agenda.",
      "meredithconroy: Yeah, that's a good point, Tia. The Trump administration was successful at elevating episodic crimes committed by undocumented immigrants or migrants during his first term, too, to garner public support for stricter immigration policies. The rapid spread of baseless claims that migrants in Ohio were eating pets, amplified by Trump during the September presidential debate, is a more recent example.",
      "Monica Potts: Right, he's been on the national stage for a decade now, and being anti-immigration was arguably how he started his presidential career. So he has probably brought some voters over to his side on this and remade the political landscape to some extent.",
      "gelliottmorris: At the same time, it's hard to know exactly what public opinion is (and what it has been previously) on some of these executive orders. That's because they are in some cases especially narrow policy proposals, with the meaning of the order turning on specific wording that doesn't always make it into polls. An AP-NORC poll conducted earlier this month found supermajority support for deporting immigrants \"who have been convicted of a violent crime\" \u2014 with higher support for immigrants who are here illegally (83 percent) versus those that are here legally (69 percent). But punishing criminals, I reckon, is probably pretty popular despite immigration status: I bet you'd also get a large percentage of Americans saying we should deport citizens who have been convicted of violent crimes.",
      "There are a couple wrinkles here, though: First, the executive order Trump signed, and his subsequent plans for mass deportation, calls for detaining and then deporting immigrants who are arrested for, not convicted of, crimes. That is, a jury of your peers does not need to say you are guilty of a crime for the federal government to deport you, according to the new EO. That is different from the language used in the poll specifying convicted criminals and has already raised legal challenges over due process, so support for Trump's more expansive policy may be lower. (At the same time, that immigration law that just passed Congress gives state and federal immigration officials the power to deport immigrants accused of crimes, so maybe Trump will have political cover here.)",
      "And secondly, I could not find any poll that asks about deporting criminal undocumented immigrants from before 2024. So, we have no idea how popular this was before Trump campaigned on it last year/signed an executive order on it this year. It's possible \u2014 perhaps even likely \u2014 that this was always popular with voters, despite higher resistance to mass deportations in the recent past.",
      "tia.yang: Beyond immigration, Trump also took a load of actions that were, safe to say, not bipartisan. Many of them had to do with his plans to consolidate executive power, including by firing political opponents and installing loyalists throughout the government \u2014 seeming to make good on his campaign promises to enact \"retribution\" on his political enemies.",
      "Our colleague Nathaniel Rakich wrote on Monday about how Trump's planned actions could weaken democracy, or already have. Have we already seen him take some of those steps this week? Are they likely to succeed?",
      "Monica Potts: Oh absolutely. The pardons for Jan. 6 defendants are probably the top example of that. These are folks who were motivated by Trump's baseless claims that he won the 2020 election to try to overturn the results of a democratic election on Trump's behalf, who were fairly tried in our criminal justice system, and who Trump has now pardoned. That is a blatant disregard for the rule of law, even though pardons are within the purview of the president and something he is technically allowed to do. That weakens democracy and absolves the political violence that occurred four years ago.",
      "Speaking of pardons, Republicans have criticized some of Biden's preemptive pardons issued before just leaving office, which included officials involved in COVID-19 policies like Dr. Anthony Fauci, officials involved in the Jan. 6 investigation like former Rep. Liz Cheney, and members of his own family. But Biden made these unprecedented pardons in direct response to Trump's promises to investigate and prosecute political enemies, so they are really part and parcel with how Trump had already eroded Democratic norms, by normalizing the targeting of government officials and public figures for political reasons. (Trump, of course, claims the Jan. 6 prosecutions and related legal cases against him were politically motivated, though experts disagree.)",
      "gelliottmorris: Yeah, pardoning people who stormed the Capitol on Jan. 6 and committed violent crimes along the way is decidedly not popular.",
      "So, there's the bigger point about democratic backsliding here, but also that it represents a counter-majoritarian action by the president. This was the expected balance of Trump's actions when he was elected in 2016 by winning the Electoral College and losing the popular vote, but perhaps more surprising when he won both in 2024 and could, in theory, keep popular support by doing things that the majority of people who voted for him actually want, as opposed to taking actions that appeal primarily to his base.",
      "I'm not sure if y'all saw this in his press conference on Wednesday, but it actually looks like Trump may have been unaware that we has pardoning violent offenders when he issued those pardons \u2014 which speaks to a couple dynamics in the White House, including about the breadth of actors exerting influence on him.",
      "Or maybe it was a calculated move, and he was just lying in that press conference.",
      "meredithconroy: I did see that, Elliott! I am not sure what to make of it. The political fallout for the administration will probably be minimal. But some of these violent offenders are people who have said they want retribution against their political enemies and may turn to political violence \u2014 so it could be a consequential mistake, if it was one.",
      "tia.yang: Elliott, I was thinking about that counter-majoritarian streak as well when you mentioned earlier what Trump notably did not address in his inauguration day speeches. In addition to big swings on the economy, we're used to hearing certain unifying rhetoric from new presidents: appeals to the opposite side, messages of hope for the country, aspirational plans.",
      "What we heard instead was exactly the opposite \u2014 something that sounded a lot like Trump's campaign speeches \u2014 directly attacking his predecessor and his other political opponents and leaning into issues that appeal most to his base.",
      "Monica Potts: Recent polls have shown that few voters thought Trump did a good job trying to unify the country or reach out to Harris supporters after the election, even though many say it's important he do so. And only a third expected him to \"heal political divisions\" in his second term. So he's living up to expectations on that score.",
      "tia.yang: Another note on Trump's enemies: The inauguration being held inside the Capitol (due to cold weather) really drove home the message, visually, \"I belong here\" and \"I'm the head of the government.\" This feels sort of superficial, but images like this do matter and can significantly influence how people perceive and remember events (see: that old chestnut about Richard Nixon losing the debate because he looked sickly on TV).",
      "One enduring image of the inauguration this year will be Trump lambasting Biden and Democrats, with many of those Democrats packed into the Capitol and even sitting in frame for his entire speech. It was a huge contrast from four years ago, when he lost the election and his supporters stormed the same building \u2014 some violently, as we've discussed \u2014 threatening some of those same lawmakers sitting feet away from Trump this time around.",
      "gelliottmorris: Tia: The message conveyed here was not only \"I'm the head of government\" and \"I belong here,\" but also \"and the people in this room are who I choose to give power to.\" Mega-billionaire tech executives and ultra-right-wing donors are not who put Trump in the White House, swing voters are. I'm not convinced (and polls back this up) that the elevation of these powerful elites is what they really wanted. Speaking literally, people voted for Trump, not for the people he has surrounded himself with.",
      "meredithconroy: Yes, I am glad you brought up the billionaires in the front row at the inauguration. Couple this with the Trump meme coin and you don't really have the symbolism of a man of the people.",
      "Monica Potts: Right? People are really unhappy with CEOs, corporate greed, etc. And here were the richest people in the world lined up with Trump. I wonder how many of his voters, or swing voters, will square that with Trump's populist, anti-status-quo rhetoric.",
      "tia.yang: Yeah, Monica and I were just looking at some polling yesterday (which we will be covering soon!) about how one big thing driving Trump voters across the spectrum is that they're angry. They're angry at what they see as the government \"establishment\" \u2014 but they're also angry at big corporations. Trump replacing the traditional political establishment with tech and industry elites isn't what most mean when they say \"drain the swamp.\"",
      "gelliottmorris: I'll just note that a YouGov/The Economist poll released Wednesday has Mark Zuckerberg's personal favorability rating underwater by 30 points, and net-negative among Republicans as well as Democrats. I think those pictures of Trump surrounded by people worth over $1.5 trillion probably won't play well if grocery prices go up 20 percent again (eggs, anyone?).",
      "Monica Potts: This has always been part of the paradoxical thing about his appeal, though, right? A New York businessman born with a silver spoon in his mouth and head of the party that has always represented wealthy business interests has somehow managed to pitch himself as a champion of \"the forgotten man.\" It's \u2026 something.",
      "meredithconroy: That's true \u2014 Trump positioning himself as a channel for that populist anger is probably why he gets away with surrounding himself with wealthy people at the inauguration, and growing his business' wealth as president.",
      "gelliottmorris: I'm reminded that most Americans think political leaders do not represent their interests. That is true for Trump, too. So while he benefited from anger and resentment in 2024, that doesn't mean he will in the future. For example, to me it is indisputable that Trump benefited from economic conditions being bad after COVID-19 and a broader anti-incumbent wave that has swept the globe since 2021. But in two years, if people still feel the system is \"rigged\" and what-not, who do they point to? Probably the guy in charge.",
      "Putting this a different way: People did vote for change in 2024. But a negative signal against the incumbent party, against a status quo that has left people behind, etc. is not an affirmative signal for everything the opposition is offering. (The Labour government in Britain is figuring this out the hard way right now.) If Trump's team misunderstands his victory as an affirmative vote for unpopular policies and decisions that he has wrapped up in his more appealing anti-elitist, populist veneer, then, well, his second term will probably take a similar trajectory to his first.",
      "Footnotes",

      "In a new letter, Democratic lawmakers are asking federal regulators to look into legal and ethical questions around the meme cryptocurrency coins launched by President Donald Trump and the first lady.",
      "The letter formally raises concerns about the risk of foreign countries trying to curry influence by buying the coins \u2014 and the ethics of Trump making \"extraordinary profits off his presidency.\"",
      "Sen. Elizabeth Warren, the top Democrat on the Senate Banking Committee and an advocate for crypto regulation, co-wrote the letter with Rep. Jake Auchincloss, D-Mass., who sits on the House Committee on Energy and Commerce.",
      "Warren and Auchincloss point to the foreign emoluments clause of the U.S. Constitution, which states \"[N]o Person holding any Office of Profit or Trust under [the United States], shall, without the Consent of the Congress, accept of any present, Emolument, Office, or Title, of any kind whatever, from any King, Prince, or foreign State.\"",
      "\"Anyone, including the leaders of hostile nations, can covertly buy these coins, raising the specter of uninhibited and untraceable foreign influence over the President of the United States, all while President Trump's supporters are left to shoulder the risk of investing in $TRUMP and $MELANIA,\" Warren and Auchincloss wrote to the Office of Government Ethics, the Treasury Department, the Commodity Futures Trading Commission and the Securities and Exchange Commission.",
      "The meme coins also pose a conflict of interest, they write, because Trump's family members are expected to directly profit off an industry he is charged with regulating. The president nominates the Chairs of the Commodity Futures Trading Commission, and Securities and Exchange Commission, the Directors of the Financial Crimes Enforcement Network and Consumer Financial Protection Bureau, and the Secretary of the Treasury.",
      "\"This creates an unavoidable conflict of interest, as he will be in a position to both benefit directly from the sale of the tokens while also setting the policy on how these markets are regulated. He will be in a position to seek commitments from agency heads, to not only decide how the market is valued, but to implement lax policies to crack down on crypto scams like pump-and-dump schemes that are regularly conducted through meme coins,\" the letter says.",
      "ABC News reached out to the White House for comment.",
      "Trump launched the $TRUMP coin Friday night, just days before he took office. Its estimated value is now $7 billion, according to CoinGecko. The $MELANIA coin is worth around $400 million. A big share of the profits from these coins go toward Trump and his businesses, according to financial disclosures.

      "Lujan Grisham echoed the sentiment that Wikler will value and invest in governors.",
      "\"I will be voting for Ben Wikler for DNC Chair because he has shown that he knows how to raise historic funds for candidates up and down the ballot -- all while standing up for working families and the year-round organizing we need to fight and win across the country,\" Lujan Grisham said.",
      "Kotek offered similar praise, saying Wikler is the \"changemaker the Democratic Party needs.\"",
      "\"The next leader of the DNC needs to be someone with the experience to get our party back and deliver for working people. I urge DNC members from Oregon and across the country to join me in supporting Ben for DNC chair,\" Kotek said.",
      "Earlier in the race, Gov. Tony Evers of Wikler's home state of Wisconsin also endorsed Wikler's run.",
      "Two governorships will be up for grabs this year, and Democrats are looking to play competitively in both -- namely by keeping control of New Jersey and flipping Virginia. These races will be the first large-scale electoral tests for the party since its sweeping losses last November.",
      "The support from the slate of governors also points to a late-stage surge for Wikler after both Martin's and O'Malley's teams indicated that the Wisconsin party chairman was lagging behind them in support. Earlier this month, O'Malley's team asserted, \"This is a three-way race and we are not in third place.\"",
      "These endorsements also come just days after Martin said he has garnered support from 200 voting members, by far the highest private whip count announced in the race thus far, rapidly approaching the 225 votes needed to win. (Martin currently has the majority of public endorsements.)",
      "But Wikler and O'Malley disputed the assertion, calling Martin's count inflated and accusing him of muddying the process. Wikler received the backing of four powerful public sector unions and the Senate's top Democrat, Chuck Schumer.",
      "Wikler also came forward with his team's internal whip count for the first time during the race earlier this week, claiming to have 131 members supporting him. O'Malley's campaign says he has 100 supporters.",
      "Wikler had previously said he would not release details about his internal whip count. But in a series of social media posts on Wednesday night, Wikler said he was changing course, taking a veiled swipe at Martin and citing a statement from O'Malley's campaign.",
      "\"Until tonight, I'd held back from releasing my whip count,\" Wikler said. \"But another candidate released a count so inflated that, as another campaign rightly said, it was 'disrespectful to the 448 voting members of the DNC -- many of whom are still making up their minds.'\"",
      "He continued, \"In a moment of national crisis, DNC members deserve the chance to choose the next Chair based on vision and record, not based on whisper campaigns and attempts to manufacture an illusion of inevitability.\"",
      "Nevertheless, no campaign has provided a full list of exactly who is backing their bids, and there are a number of other long-shot candidates who have qualified to run and could peel off a handful of members along the way. It's unclear, too, if any candidate will clinch a majority of votes to win on the first ballot, opening up the race and allowing members to reconsider their choice in subsequent ballots.",
      "Wikler said he is \"honored\" to have the backing of these governors, who he said are \"some of the most important Democratic voices in the country.\"",
      "\"Democratic governors present the model for how Democrats can compete and win in the toughest states in the country,\" Wikler said, \"and we need to invest in their leadership in a way that reflects their invaluable power as messengers and leaders. I'm ready to expand the map and win, together.\"",

      "The Supreme Court has agreed to take on a new culture war dispute: whether the nation\u2019s first publicly funded religious charter school should be allowed to open in Oklahoma",
      "WASHINGTON -- The Supreme Court agreed Friday to take on a new culture war dispute: whether the nation\u2019s first publicly funded religious charter school should be allowed to open in Oklahoma.",
      "The justices said they would review an Oklahoma Supreme Court decision that invalidated a state board's approval of an application by the Catholic Church in Oklahoma to open a charter school.",
      "The conservative-dominated high court has issued several decisions in recent years signaling a willingness to allow public funds to flow to religious entities. At the same time, conservative-led states have sought to insert religion into public schools, including Louisiana's requirement that the Ten Commandments be posted in classrooms.",
      "The case probably will be argued in late April and decided by early summer. Justice Amy Coney Barrett is not taking part in the case, but did not explain why.",
      "Last June, Oklahoma\u2019s top court held by a 7-1 vote that a taxpayer-funded religious charter school would violate the part of the First Amendment that prohibits government from making any law \u201crespecting an establishment of religion.\u201d",
      "The decision followed a 3-2 vote in 2023 by the Statewide Virtual Charter School Board to approve an application by the archdiocese for the St. Isidore of Seville Virtual Charter School. The K-12 online school had planned to start classes for its first 200 enrollees last fall, with part of its mission to evangelize its students in the Catholic faith.",
      "A group of Oklahoma parents, faith leaders and a public education nonprofit sued to block the school.",
      "\u201cUnder Oklahoma law, a charter school is a public school,\u201d Justice James Winchester, an appointee of former Republican Gov. Frank Keating, wrote in the court\u2019s majority opinion. \u201cAs such, a charter school must be nonsectarian.",
      "\u201cHowever, St. Isidore will evangelize the Catholic school curriculum while sponsored by the state.\u201d",
      "In dissent, Justice Dana Kuehn wrote that excluding St. Isidore from operating a charter school based solely on its religious affiliation would violate a different part of the First Amendment that protects religious freedom.",
      "The high court's decision to intervene was warmly received by Alliance Defending Freedom, the Christian legal advocacy group representing the state board. \"There\u2019s great irony in state officials who claim to be in favor of religious liberty discriminating against St. Isidore because of its Catholic beliefs,\u201d the group's chief legal counsel, Jim Campbell, said in a statement.",
      "Opponents of the Oklahoma charter school called on the justices to uphold the state court ruling. \u201cThe law is clear: Charter schools are public schools and must be secular and open to all students,\u201d the American Civil Liberties Union and other legal groups said in a statement. They are representing the school\u2019s opponents in a separate lawsuit.",
      "The case puts Oklahoma's Republican governor, Kevin Stitt, and its Republican attorney general, Gentner Drummond, on opposing sides. Stitt favors the school. Drummond reversed the advice given to the charter school board by his Republican predecessor, warning that the Catholic charter school would in his view violate the Constitution.",

    "summary": "A federal judge in Seattle has signed a temporary restraining order blocking President Donald Trump\u2019s executive order on birthright citizenship.",
    "story": [
      "Numerous states have sued over Trump's plan to end the 14th Amendment policy.",
      "A federal judge in Seattle on Thursday signed a temporary restraining order blocking President Donald Trump's executive order on birthright citizenship.",
      "U.S. District Judge John Coughenour heard a request by four Democratic-led states to issue a temporary restraining order against the executive order signed by Trump that purports to limit birthright citizenship -- long guaranteed by the 14th Amendment -- to people who have at least one parent who is a United States citizen or permanent resident.",
      "\"I have been on the bench for over four decades,\" said Judge Coughenour, who was nominated to the bench by President Ronald Reagan in 1981. \"I can't remember another case where the question presented is as clear as it is here. This is a blatantly unconstitutional order.\"",
      "Thursday's ruling was the first legal test of Trump's executive order reinterpreting the 14th Amendment's guarantee of birthright citizenship, which Trump long promised on the campaign trail. The executive action is expected to spark a lengthy legal challenge that could define the president's sweeping immigration agenda.",
      "\"In your opinion, is this executive order constitutional?\" Judge Coughenour asked Justice Department attorney Brett Shumate during Thursday's hearing.",
      "\"Yes, we think it is,\" Shumate said, drawing the judge's rebuke.",
      "\"I have difficulty understanding how a member of the bar can state unequivocally that this is a constitutional order. It boggles my mind,\" Coughenour said. \"Where were the lawyers when this decision was being made?\"",
      "Shumate implored Coughenour to hold off on blocking the order, saying that it does not take effect until Feb. 19.",
      "\"It's enough to say there is no imminent harm that the states will incur as a result of this order,\" Shumate said. \"We urge the court not to grant any temporary order today on the merits. What makes sense is to have a full briefing on the preliminary injunction.\"",
      "\"Births cannot be paused while the court considers this case,\" said Lane Polozola, an attorney representing the state attorneys general, who said Trump's executive order attempts to change a part of the Constitution that is \"off limits\" after being settled across a century of legal precedent.",
      "Judge Coughenour appeared convinced, ending the hearing by saying that he signed the temporary restraining order and that he would consider whether to grant a long-term injunction over the coming weeks.",
      "Coughenour's order temporarily enjoins Trump and any federal employee from enforcing or implementing the executive order for 14 days, until Feb. 6, when the judge scheduled a hearing to consider issuing a preliminary injunction against the order.",
      "\"The Plaintiff States have also shown that they are likely to suffer irreparable harm in the absence of preliminary relief,\" Coughenour wrote in the restraining order, citing the costs of medical care, social services, and administrative work encountered by the four states who sued Trump.",
      "\"The balance of equities tips toward the Plaintiff States and the public interest strongly weighs in favor of entering temporary relief,\" the order said.",
      "Trump himself signaled confidence when asked about the ruling Thursday afternoon.",
      "\"Obviously we will appeal it,\" Trump said in the Oval Office. \"There's no surprises with that judge.\"",
      "\"The Department of Justice will vigorously defend President Trump's EO, which correctly interprets the 14th Amendment of the U.S. Constitution,\" said a statement from the Justice Department. \"We look forward to presenting a full merits argument to the Court and to the American people, who are desperate to see our Nation's laws enforced.\"",
      "Thursday's ruling was the first legal test of Trump's executive order reinterpreting the 14th Amendment's guarantee of birthright citizenship, which Trump long promised on the campaign trail. The executive action is expected to spark a lengthy legal challenge that could define the president's sweeping immigration agenda.",
      "Democratic attorneys general from 22 states and two cities have sued Trump over the executive order, and the president faces at least five separate lawsuits over the policy.",
      "In an interview with ABC News after the hearing, Washington state Attorney General Nick Brown said he plans to continue fighting the executive order if the Trump administration appeals to a higher court.",
      "\"I don't think it ends here,\" Brown said. \"First and foremost, there are other cases being brought across the country, and so those cases will continue to move forward, and this president and this administration certainly has a propensity to keep these fights going, and so I anticipate that will happen moving forward.\"",
      "Coughenour scheduled Thursday's in-person hearing in the case brought by the attorneys general of Arizona, Oregon, Washington and Illinois. In a federal complaint filed on Tuesday, the four attorneys general argued that Trump's policy would unlawfully strip at least 150,000 newborn children each year of citizenship entitled to them by federal law and the 14th Amendment.",
      "\"The Plaintiff States will also suffer irreparable harm because thousands of children will be born within their borders but denied full participation and opportunity in American society,\" the lawsuit says. \"Absent a temporary restraining order, children born in the Plaintiff States will soon be rendered undocumented, subject to removal or detention, and many stateless.\"",
      "The lawsuit argues that enforcement of Trump's executive order would cause irreparable harm to the children born from undocumented parents by preventing them from enjoying their right to \"full participation and opportunity in American society.\"",
      "\"They will lose their right to vote, serve on juries, and run for certain offices,\" the complaint says. \"And they will be placed into lifelong positions of instability and insecurity as part of a new underclass in the United States.\"",
      "Lawyers for the Department of Justice, now under new leadership, opposed the request for a temporary restraining order in a court filing Wednesday.",
      "Intended to take effect next month, Trump's executive order seeks to reinterpret the 14th Amendment's guarantee of birthright citizenship by arguing a child born in the United States to an undocumented mother cannot receive citizenship unless his or her father is a citizen or green card holder.",
      "While most countries confer a child's citizenship based on their parents, the United States and more than two dozen countries, including Canada and Mexico, follow the principle of jus soli or \"right of the soil.\"",
      "Following the Civil War, the United States codified jus soli through the passage of the 14th Amendment, repudiating the Supreme Court's finding in Dred Scott v. Sanford that African Americans were ineligible for citizenship.",
      "\"President Trump and the federal government now seek to impose a modern version of Dred Scott. But nothing in the Constitution grants the President, federal agencies, or anyone else authority to impose conditions on the grant of citizenship to individuals born in the United States,\" the states' lawsuit argued.",
      "The Supreme Court further enshrined birthright citizenship in 1898 when it found that the San Francisco-born son of Chinese immigrants was an American citizen despite the Chinese Exclusion Act restricting immigration from China and prohibiting Chinese Americans from becoming naturalized citizens.",
      "By seeking to end birthright citizenship, Trump's executive order centers on the same phrase within the 14th Amendment -- \"subject to the jurisdiction thereof\" -- that the Supreme Court considered in 1898. Trump's executive order argues that text of the 14th Amendment excludes children born of parents who are not \"subject to the jurisdiction\" of the United States, such as people who are unlawfully in the U.S.",
      "While legal scholars have expressed skepticism about the legality of Trump's executive order, the lawsuit could set the stage for a lengthy legal battle that ends up before the Supreme Court.",

    "summary": "The tallest building in Havana is impossible to miss",
    "story": [
      "The tallest building in Havana is impossible to miss",
      "HAVANA -- It\u2019s impossible to miss. The huge rectangular mass of concrete and glass \u2014 the tallest building in Havana \u2014 dominates the city skyline, towering 150 meters (490 feet) above colonial homes with its 542 luxury rooms and majestic views of the city and the sea.",
      "The Selection La Habana hotel, managed by Spanish chain Iberostar, has yet to be inaugurated but it is already the target of criticism \u2014 and not only for its unusual shape. Cubans are questioning the government\u2019s allocation of millions of dollars towards luxury tourism while the island grapples with a severe economic crisis and tourism numbers plummet to historic lows.",
      "\u201cAll that money could have been spent to build hospitals and schools,\u201d lamented Susel Borges, a 26-year-old artisan, as she looked up to the towering edifice, known to locals as the \u201cK and 23 building\u201d because of its location.",
      "Located near the legendary Habana Libre hotel and the iconic Coppelia ice cream parlor, the new hotel is part of a government plan to build a dozen luxury establishments \u2014 mainly in Havana \u2014 that did not stop even during the COVID-19 pandemic and while existing luxury hotels remained largely unoccupied.",
      "For decades, tourism drove the Cuban economy, generating annual revenues of up to $3 billion. But in December, Cuban authorities said only 2.2 million tourists visited the island in 2024, a decrease of roughly 200,000 from 2023 and significantly lower than the 4.2 million tourists who visited in 2019.",
      "The government attributes the decline in tourism to a \u201cperfect storm\u201d of factors including supply shortages, a severe energy crisis causing massive blackouts and a lack of personnel, due to emigration and low wages. Furthermore, the island is grappling with a surge in U.S. sanctions, including restrictions on travel by U.S. citizens, a ban on cruise ships and other measures specifically designed to stifle the growth of Cuba\u2019s tourism industry.",
      "\u201cTourism is gone,\u201d said Julio Garc\u00eda Campos, driver of a shiny red 1951 Pontiac with an original engine. \u201cTourists used to line up to get on one of these!\u201d he said, recalling a bygone era when the island was bustling with American and European travelers following a removal of sanctions by then-President Barack Obama.",
      "The new Selection La Habana, like all other hotels in Cuba, is state-owned and operates under GAESA, a conglomerate belonging to the Ministry of the Revolutionary Armed Forces that has often been criticized because of the opacity of its businesses. As a military-run operation, it is exempt from audits by the Comptroller General\u2019s Office and has not disclosed the amount it invested in the 40-story hotel.",
      "Cuban economist Pedro Monreal notes the \u201cincongruity\u201d of investing capital in the tourism sector when very little is being allocated to strategic areas such as agriculture.",
      "\"With food insecurity a concern, it\u2019s troubling that agricultural investment lags significantly behind tourism investment, remaining 11 times lower,\u201d Monreal noted last year on social media.",
      "Architects also expressed little enthusiasm for the new hotel, pointing at its disruptive appearance within the environment, its excessive height violating urban regulations and tall glass windows that are ill-suited for a tropical climate.",
      "\u201cThis building serves as a perfect example in our classes of what should not be done in terms of bioclimatic design,\u201d said Abel Tablada, an architect and university professor, adding it's \"unforgivable\" that the little money available to the Cuban state has been allocated to a building that does not add value to the city.",

      "A group of former American military officers and diplomats who served in Kyiv are teaming up with a Ukrainian winery owner to bring a taste of the Black Sea coast to a U.S. audience",
      "MONTCLAIR, Va. -- In a wine shop an hour outside of Washington, owner Arthur Lampros sampled a wine from a part of the world that was totally new to him, racking his brain to pin down the tastes on his tongue.",
      "Was there a body of water near the vineyards, he wondered, that would moderate any storms or heat waves buffeting the grapes?",
      "\u201cAbsolutely, absolutely\u201d \u2014 Ukraine's Black Sea coast, near Odesa, said Giorgi Iukuridze, a Ukrainian winery owner introducing Ukraine's modernized wines to a broad U.S. audience for the first time.",
      "Sam Lerman, a U.S. Air Force vet and one of a number of former American military officers and diplomats in Ukraine backing him in the endeavor, nodded, beaming at the words of praise that followed for many of the wines.",
      "Ukraine is in the eyes of the world as it battles the Russian invasion with the aid of the United States and dozens of other countries. But Lerman said he and the others who teamed up with Iukuridze for the U.S. launch want Americans to see \u201cthat Ukraine is more than an ally at war, suffering tremendous tragedy.\u201d",
      "Bringing the wines to the U.S. will help show \u201cwhat Ukraine was really about, and has always been about,\u201d he said.",
      "For Kurt Volker, a former U.S. ambassador to NATO who served as President Donald Trump's special representative to Ukraine during a stormy time in his first term, what Ukraine is about is determination, dedication and hope.",
      "\u201cRight now, because of Russia\u2019s invasion and the military assistance the U.S. has given to Ukraine, when people hear and talk about Ukraine, it is all about the war. And it\u2019s a little bit groaning ... like, \u2018Oh, geez, you know, how much more we\u2019re going to spend on this?\u2019'' Volker told The Associated Press.",
      "Russian President Vladimir Putin's invasions of neighboring countries have served to introduce a whole community of American military people and diplomats to the burgeoning wine regions of the former Soviet Union.",
      "Volker met his winemaker wife, and bought a small winery in Georgia, owing to Russia's 2008 invasion. He traveled often to Iukridze's Shabo winery in Ukraine for production tips.",
      "It was Russia\u2019s invasions of Ukraine, especially in February 2022, that made more American military into fans of the wines of Ukraine\u2019s Black Sea coast, and of the country\u2019s best vodkas.",
      "Lerman, a former technical sergeant decorated for valor in combat in Afghanistan, first went to Ukraine in a team of volunteer military advisers in the first weeks after Russia\u2019s 2022 invasion, and now represents a U.S. defense company there.",
      "Militaries have a venerable history of revering alcohol. U.S. sailors treasure rationed beer at rare \u201csteel beach picnics\u201d on deck. Officers off-duty in Iraq sipped hoarded zero-alcohol beer and pretended it was more. Militias fighting brutal civil wars in West Africa spared the beer factories, if nothing else.",
      "Lerman sampled Ukraine\u2019s alcohol for the first time in a safehouse with other U.S. vet volunteers and Ukrainian allies in the first weeks of the war. Someone had placed a bottle of Ukrainian vodka on the table where they worked, amid the laptops and firearms.",
      "\u201cI was blown away,\u201d Lerman recounted. \u201cI thought I didn\u2019t even like vodka.\u201d",
      "Soon, Lerman was toting out bottles of vodka and Shabo wines for his family and friends back home. Searches of U.S. stores for more struck out, since much of what little Ukrainian wine was shipped to the U.S. was of an older, sweeter variety aimed at the Ukrainian diaspora.",
      "That led to him teaming up with Iukuridze and partners to set up Spyrt Worldwide, a new U.S. import company to bring in Shabo wines and two Ukrainian vodkas. A share of the profits is designated for Invictus Global Response, a mine-removal nonprofit run by veterans.",
      "Ukraine's Black Sea coast claims a 2,500-year history of growing wine thanks to settlements founded by ancient Greeks, and some of the vines at Shabo winery date back to the subsequent Ottoman era. Swiss settlers in the 1800s made Shabo and the area around it a proper wine-growing region, prizing its soil and climate.",
      "Wine under Soviet rule, on the other hand, was \u201cbarely drinkable muck,\u201d said Volker. He sees the region's best wines today as a model for private companies shaking off the Soviet mindset.",
      "Soviet state-run wineries wanted cheap wines in big quantities, especially sweeter ones. Shabo's vines survived a Soviet crackdown on alcohol under Mikhail Gorbachev in the final years before the Soviet collapse thanks only to a Shabo worker who falsified forms, claiming the vineyards produced only table grapes, Iukirdze said.",
      "After the Soviet Union crumbled in 1991, Iukeridze and his father, who have roots in wine production in Georgia, were among the largest producers in an independent Ukraine bringing production up to modern standards. Shabo's wines have won international awards and are featured in Michelin-starred restaurants.",
      "Shabo is far from the front lines of the war, but Russian rockets on rare occasions have fallen within sight of workers in the vineyards, and Shabo\u2019s wine salesmen have faced checkpoints and immediate induction into Ukraine\u2019s military while traveling their sales routes. The most reliable route for shipping the wines to the United States lies through neighboring Moldova.",
      "\u201cThe grape does not wait for any diplomatic solutions,\u201d Iukeridze said. \u201cWe continue working without stopping any single day.\u201d",
      "Over the winter holidays, members of Congress, a former defense secretary, defense industry executives and others, including Lerman and Volker, turned out in Washington for the launch of the import company.",
      "All were attuned to the joint mission of wine and war. Unspoken was the worry about Russia\u2019s larger military grinding down Ukraine, and uncertainty over whether Trump would withdraw vital U.S. military support to Ukraine once back in office.",
      "But Iukeridze told a story: In 2014, when the Russian military first invaded eastern Ukraine and seized Crimea on the Black Sea, a family that lived nearby drove by Shabo's vineyards as they fled toward the border with Moldova.",
      "But the family spotted Shabo's head winemaker out in the field, planting new vines that would take three years to produce wine. They stopped the car.",
      "\u201c\u2018What is happening?\u2019\u201d they asked the winemaker.",
      "\u201c\u2019We\u2019re planting new wines, for Ukrainian, independent, glorious country,\u201d Iukeridze recounted the winemaker answering.",

      "The U.S. Secret Service says its agents visited a Chicago elementary school while investigating a threat",
      "CHICAGO -- The U.S. Secret Service said its agents visited a Chicago elementary school Friday while investigating a threat, hours after school officials mistakenly claimed that U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement agents had come to the building.",
      "In a statement Friday evening, Chicago Public Schools leaders said that after their initial comments went out about ICE agents, they learned the agents were from the Secret Service. The false alarm heightened fears among immigrant communities in the country\u2019s third-largest city.",
      "\u201cOur original communication was a result of a misunderstanding, reflective of the fear and concerns in the community amid the new administration\u2019s focus on undocumented immigrants,\u201d the statement said.",
      "The Trump administration touted deportation efforts this week and published new rules making it easier to remove people as part of a flurry of actions to crack down on illegal immigration.",
      "The statement from Chicago Public Schools said two people showed up at the door of Hamline Elementary School and presented identification including the name Department of Homeland Security, the federal agency that oversees ICE. School officials responded to the agents with the understanding that they were from ICE, amid rumors and reports that the agency was in the community, school district officials said.",
      "The agents were from the Secret Service Chicago Field Office and visited the school while investigating a threat made against a government official they protect, according to statement sent by Secret Service spokesperson Anthony Guglielmi. He said agents first visited a home in a local neighborhood and then went to the school.",
      "\u201cAgents identified themselves to the school principal and provided business cards with their contact information,\u201d the statement said.",
      "He said the agents left without incident.",
      "\u201cWe do not investigate nor enforce immigration laws,\u201d the statement said.",
      "ICE officials said in a statement that no immigration enforcement actions took place Friday at or near a school in Chicago.",
      "Chicago Public Schools officials said the agents were not allowed into the school or to speak with staff or students.",
      "\u201cWhile this was a misunderstanding in terms of the specific branch of DHS, the school\u2019s response demonstrates that our system, in partnership with community organizations, is prepared and ready to keep our students and staff safe,\u201d the statement said."

      "But a second order from the 8th Circuit U.S. Court of Appeals raises questions on future court proceedings now that President Donald Trump is in the White House.",
      "The department and an immigrant rights groups sued Iowa in May over the law, which looks similar to Texas and Oklahoma laws that are also on hold while courts consider whether they unconstitutionally usurp federal immigration authority. A district court judge granted the Biden administration and the immigrant rights group a temporary block on the law, and Iowa appealed.",

      "The federal appeals court said that the lawsuit filed by Iowa Migrant Movement for Justice on behalf of its organization and two individuals should be dismissed by the district court judge \u2014 because the U.S. v. Iowa lawsuit makes it moot.",
      "\u201cRight now we're just figuring out what our legal next steps are,\u201d said Veronica Fowler, communications director for the ACLU of Iowa, one of the legal teams representing Iowa Migrant Movement for Justice, \"because obviously we are committed to doing everything we can to strike down this really terrible law.\u201d",

      "The FBI announced the arrest of Teresa Youngblut, 21, on Friday, four days after the deaths of Border Patrol Agent David Maland and Felix Baukholt in Coventry, about 20 miles (32 kilometers) from the Canadian border. She was charged on one count of using a deadly weapon while assaulting a Border Patrol agent, and one count of using and discharging a firearm during and in relation to that assault.",
      "An FBI affidavit filed in U.S. District Court shed some light on the events leading up to the fatal encounter, but many questions remain.",
      "Here are some things to know:",

State police and Department of Homeland Security investigators tried to question the duo, who said they were in the area looking to buy property but declined to have an extended conversation, the FBI said.",
      "On Sunday, investigators saw the pair walking in downtown Newport, just north of Coventry, wearing similar tactical clothing. And about two hours before the shooting, investigators watched Baukholt leave a Walmart in Newport with two packages of aluminum foil, get in the car and wrap something in the passenger seat.",
      "Investigators later found foil-wrapped cellphones in the car.",
      "According to the FBI affidavit, Youngblut was driving Baukholt\u2019s car when a border agent pulled it over on Interstate 91 to conduct an immigration inspection. At the time, Baukholt appeared to have an expired visa, according to a Department of Homeland Security database, but investigators later confirmed that his visa was current, the FBI said Friday.",
      "Youngblut got out and opened fire on Maland and other officers without warning, the FBI said. Baukholt tried to draw a gun but was shot, according to the affidavit. At least one border agent fired on Youngblut and Baukholt, but authorities haven\u2019t specified whose bullets hit whom.",
      "Authorities who searched the car after the shootout found a ballistic helmet, night-vision goggles, respirators and ammunition, the FBI said. They also found a package of shooting range targets, including some that had been used, two-way radios, about a dozen \u201celectronic devices,\u201d travel and lodging information for multiple states, and a journal.",
      "Authorities released no information about Youngblut other than her name, age and home state.",
      "A man reached at a phone listing for Youngblut\u2019s family in Washington identified himself as her grandfather and declined to comment. No one answered the door at multiple homes in Washington associated with Youngblut\u2019s name, and neighbors declined to comment.",
      "The public defender\u2019s office that will be representing Youngblut did not respond to a voicemail seeking further information.",
      "Maland\u2019s aunt, Joan Maland, declined on behalf of his family to comment on the arrest. The family issued a statement expressing gratitude for the support they\u2019ve received.",
      "Relatives have described Maland as a dedicated public servant who passed up promotion opportunities to continue field work. He was a U.S. Air Force veteran and had worked as a border patrol agent for nine years, including in Texas before heading to the northern border.",

      "Quintez Brown was arrested shortly after leaving Greenberg's campaign office, where one of his six shots grazed Greenberg\u2019s sweater. Four other staffers were in the room with Greenberg, and one of them rushed to close the door on Brown after he fired.",
      "Greenberg, who was elected mayor later that year, said in court Friday that he saw a man he didn\u2019t recognize come to the door of his campaign headquarters, and when a staffer tried to engage the man in conversation, \u201cI saw a gun pointed directly at me and I\u2019ll never forget the sound of those gun shots fired,\u201d Greenberg told the court. Greenberg said in the ensuing days, he felt \u201cfear and confusion that made me physically numb for days.\u201d",
      "Brown, 24, pleaded guilty in July to federal charges of interfering with a federally protected activity and discharging a firearm in relation with a crime of violence. The plea agreement called for a sentencing range of 15 to nearly 18 years.",
      "U.S. District Judge Benjamin Beaton said Brown's attack was premeditated and was a threat to the community's political system. He ordered Brown be on supervised release for five years after he is out of prison.",
      "Brown, a former standout student and Louisville newspaper columnist who was running for city council at the time, apologized to Greenberg and his staff who were present at the Feb. 14, 2022, shooting.",
      "\u201cWhen I shot that gun, I taught everybody a wrong lesson,\u201d he said, looking in the direction of Greenberg, who was sitting in the front row of the gallery with his wife. \u201cI want to tell those who were in the room that I'm sorry. I can't believe I caused all this.\u201d",
      "After the shooting, Brown was charged with attempted murder but was bailed out of jail a few days later by a nonprofit bail fund group, outraging Greenberg and other city leaders. At the time, Greenberg said it was \u201cnearly impossible to believe that someone can attempt murder on Monday and walk out of jail on Wednesday.\u201d",
      "Federal officials investigated the case, and in April of that year unsealed an indictment charging Brown. Federal prosecutors said Brown searched the Internet for Greenberg\u2019s campaign headquarters, along with searches of his family, according to a sentencing memo from federal prosecutors. Brown bought a gun and even went to Greenberg\u2019s home in the night before the shooting, but prosecutors believe he had a problem with the gun jamming.",
      "So Brown bought another gun from a pawn shop the next day and traveled to Greenberg\u2019s campaign office, where he fired multiple shots at Greenberg, who was sitting at a desk, according to prosecutors.",
      "Defense attorneys for Brown pleaded for a lighter sentence, arguing that the shooting was aberrant behavior from a person suffering a mental illness episode who had not prior criminal record.",
      "Brown still faces charges in state court of attempted murder and wanton endangerment. Those cases have been on hold while the federal case proceeded, but they are not expected to add to the length of Brown's sentence."

      "WASHINGTON -- WASHINGTON (AP) \u2014 President Donald Trump is emphasizing that targeting Russia's oil revenue is the best way to get Moscow to end its nearly three-year war against Ukraine.",
      "Trump, who pledged in the campaign that he'd broker a quick end to the grinding conflict, in his first days in office has leaned in on the idea that OPEC+, the alliance of oil producing nations, holds the key to ending the war by reducing oil prices.",
      "The president on Friday renewed his call on the group of oil producing exporters, led by Saudi Arabia, to reduce the price of oil. It's a move he says would bleed Russia of much needed revenue to pay for the conflict and force Vladimir Putin to reconsider the war.",
      "\u201cOne way to stop it quickly is for OPEC to stop making so much money,\" Trump told reporters. \u201cSo, OPEC ought to get on the ball and drop the price of oil. And that war will stop right away.\u201d",
      "But the push on OPEC+ is an uphill battle, according to industry experts. The alliance last month put off increasing oil production as it faces weaker than expected demand and competing production from non-allied countries.",
      "Trump made similar calls on OPEC+ this week during a virtual address to the World Economic Forum in Davos, Switzerland, the annual gathering of world leaders and corporate elites.",
      "Meanwhile, the president's special envoy to Ukraine and Russia, Keith Kellogg, said Friday that OPEC+ cutting oil prices to $45 per barrel could push Russia to end the war.",
      "\u201cRussia is gaining billions of dollars of money from oil sales,\u201d Kellogg said in a Fox News interview. \u201cWhat if you drop that to $45 a barrel, which is basically a baseline break-even point?\u201d",
      "The Saudi and Russian relationship is complicated, though the countries have cooperated on oil.",
      "In 2016, Russia and other oil producers that weren\u2019t part of the alliance joined with Saudi Arabia and other members of the oil cartel to form OPEC+. Russia and Saudi Arabia are by far the biggest producers in the expanded alliance. That move was largely made in response to dramatically falling oil prices due to U.S. shale oil output. The United States is not a member of OPEC or OPEC+.",
      "Patrick De Haan, head of petroleum analysis at GasBuddy, said Trump has a better relationship with Saudi Arabia\u2019s crown prince, Mohammad bin Salman, than did his predecessor, Democrat Joe Biden. Still, he said, the Saudis \u201cstill have bills to pay,\u201d and Trump is making a \u201chuge ask.\u201d",
      "\u201cOil companies respond to economics and not to personal favors,\u201d he added.",
      "The Kremlin on Friday dismissed the idea that Russia could be pressed into talks on ending the war by the U.S. and its allies targeting the oil sector.",
      "\u201cThe conflict doesn\u2019t depend on oil prices,\u201d Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov said in a call with reporters. \u201cThe conflict is ongoing because of the threat to Russia\u2019s national security, the threat to Russians living on those territories and the refusal by the Americans and the Europeans to listen to Russia\u2019s security concerns. It\u2019s not linked to oil prices.\u201d",
      "The U.S. and its allies have imposed a $60 per barrel price cap on Russian oil. But Moscow has been able to sustain a steady stream of revenue from sales by relying on buyers, including China and India, who have taken advantage of discounted prices from the Russians.",
      "Trump earlier this week spoke by phone with the Saudi crown prince, his first foreign leader call after his return to the White House. Press secretary Karoline Leavitt declined to comment on whether the two leaders discussed Trump's push for slashing oil prices.",
      "After the call, the crown prince said the kingdom would look to invest $600 billion in the United States over the next four years, and Trump publicly said he'd like to see the Saudis spend $1 trillion. Trump is also hopeful for landing a long sought Israel-Saudi Arabia normalization deal, to formalize relations between the Middle East's two biggest powers.",
      "Trump may be making a risky gambit by publicly pressing the Saudis and other OPEC+ nations.",
      "Biden, who was critical of the Saudis' human rights record early in his term, faced an embarrassing setback months into the Ukraine war when the Saudis rejected the Democrat's public push to increase the global flow of oil.",
      "Asked why Trump could succeed where Biden failed, Leavitt, Trump's press secretary, offered confidence but no specifics. \u201cThe Biden administration said a lot of things that never actually came to fruition, and President Trump is a man of his word,\u201d she said. \"You\u2019re seeing that already.\u201d",
      "It\u2019s possible that Saudi Arabia and other allies would want to answer Washington\u2019s call eventually, but not immediately, said Kevin Book, the managing director who leads the research team at ClearView Energy Partners LLC, a Washington research firm.",
      "Global oil supply is currently ahead of demand by about 700,000 barrels per day, according to the International Energy Agency, a surplus that already weighs on the price. Brent crude, a benchmark for international oils used by many U.S. refineries, was trading at about $78 on Friday morning. Book said whether Trump will have better luck than Biden depends on his terms -- what he asks for and what pressure he brings.",
      "\u201cWhat Biden was essentially asking for was going to divide the two biggest players in OPEC+ and that\u2019s essentially what\u2019s on the table right now, too,\u201d he said. \u201cIt was challenging then. It would be challenging now.\u201d",
      "Kellogg said Trump feels strongly that drumming up economic pressure will be more useful to getting Russia to the negotiating table than helping Ukraine score battlefield wins.",
      "Both sides have suffered hundreds of thousands of casualties. Kellogg expressed doubt that the incredible human cost would have much impact on the Kremlin's calculations.",
      "\u201cThis is a nation that was willing to lose 700,000 killed in six months at Stalingrad in World War II. They just throw troops at it,\u201d Kellogg said. He added, \u201cSo when you look at Putin, you can\u2019t just say, 'Well, stop the killing,' because candidly, that\u2019s not their mentality, that\u2019s not how they do things.\u201d",
      "Criticism of Biden's handling of the Ukraine conflict was a cornerstone of Trump's 2024 campaign. He regularly pilloried Biden and Vice President Kamala Harris for the enormous amount of military aid poured into Ukraine in the aftermath of Russia's February 2022 invasion.",
      "He boasted on the campaign trail that the war would have never happened if he were president and that he would end the war within 24 hours of being sworn in.",
      "Since his election victory, he's acknowledged that the war remains complicated and has said it could take months to find a resolution to the war.",
      "In a posting on his Truth Social site, Trump earlier this week said the U.S \u201cmust never forget that Russia helped us win the Second World War.\u201d And he's repeatedly said that he will hold talks with Putin.",
      "\u201cI really would like to be able to meet with President Putin soon and get that war ... ended,\u201d Trump said at Davos. \u201cAnd that\u2019s not from the standpoint of economy or anything else. It\u2019s from the standpoint of millions of lives are being wasted. Beautiful, young people are being shot in the battlefield.\u201d",

      "\u201cWe\u2019re just stunned right now,\u201d Corwin, 66, said Friday by phone. \u201cIt\u2019s a very, very sad time. We\u2019re trying our best to work our way through this, one step at a time.\u201d",
      "He said the family will have to reckon with the future of the fourth-generation business, which was established in 1908 and is tucked among the vineyards and agricultural lands of Long Island's North Fork, about 80 miles (129 km) east of Manhattan.",
      "Corwin said he was forced to lay off 47 of the farm\u2019s 75-member staff, including many who had worked there for decades as the farm\u2019s revenue cratered.",
      "\u201cIf duck farming isn\u2019t an option, I\u2019m not sure what we\u2019d do,\u201d he said. \u201cWe\u2019re not really set up for anything else.\u201d",
      "Long Island was once a center of duck production in the U.S., thanks to its abundance of freshwater streams, friendly climate and proximity to major East Coast cities.",
      "During its heyday in the early 1960s, the region boasted more than 100 farms, producing up to 7.5 million birds annually, or about two-thirds of the nation\u2019s duck output.",
      "Crescent Duck Farm has been the island\u2019s lone remaining operation for the better part of a decade, as higher operating costs, tougher regulations and increasing suburban sprawl took their toll.",
      "Today the farm supplies nearly 4% of all the ducks sold in the country, supplying restaurants across the Northeast and beyond, including a number of high-end establishments in New York City, Corwin said.",
      "The key to its longevity has been the quality of its ducks, which he said have a thick, meaty breast and just enough skin fat to keep them tender and moist during cooking.",
      "\u201cThe only way we\u2019ve survived on Long Island is by making a duck that is different from our competition,\u201d Corwin said.",
      "Following the outbreak, the farm was allowed to hold on to several thousand duck eggs, which he hopes will help rebuild its flock and preserve the distinctive genetics honed over generations.",
      "The quarantined eggs will first be sanitized and hatched offsite, with regular testing for any signs of the virus.",
      "But Corwin said he is reluctant to restart without federal approval for vaccinating poultry \u2014 something larger industrial farms oppose because of its impact on international sales.",
      "Without vaccination, he said, smaller operations will continue to be at risk of total ruin.",
      "Even now, Corwin said he is not sure how the virus entered the tightly controlled facility after he noticed signs some of the birds were amiss last week.",
      "The farm, he said, imposed strict protocols to prevent infection as bird flu has ravaged poultry operations globally.",
      "Cases of this strain of bird flu jumping into humans is rare. There have been 67 confirmed human cases and one death reported in the United States so far, according to federal health officials. Cattle outbreaks have been reported in several states. Infections in commercial flocks, though, have become more common. At least 13 million birds have been infected in the past 30 days alone, according to the USDA, with a handful of farms being effected each day.",
      "\u201cWe had identified weaknesses and tightened everything up,\u201d Corwin lamented. \u201cIt wasn\u2019t enough, I guess.\u201d",

      "North Dakota\u2019s highest court has ruled that the state\u2019s overturned abortion ban will not be enforced during an appeal of a judge\u2019s ruling that struck down the law in September",
      "BISMARCK, N.D. -- North Dakota\u2019s abortion ban will not be enforced while the state appeals an earlier decision that found it unconstitutional, the state's highest court ruled Friday.",
      "That appeal has yet to fully play out in the state Supreme Court after a judge struck down the law in September.",
      "North Dakota has had no abortion providers since the only one moved from Fargo to neighboring Moorhead, Minnesota, in 2022. The only scenarios in which North Dakotans can currently obtain an abortion in the state would be for life- or health-preserving reasons at a hospital.",
      "The plaintiffs had contended that keeping the overturned ban from being enforced was important for patients with pregnancy complications who go to a hospital seeking medical care that might be delayed because of the law.",
      "Attorneys for the state had asked the North Dakota Supreme Court to let the ban be enforced pending appeal. They said a stay \u201cis warranted because this case presents serious, difficult, and unresolved constitutional questions that are of profound importance to the people of this State,\u201d among other reasons.",
      "State District Judge Bruce Romanick had earlier denied such a request, saying: \u201cIt would be non-sensical for this Court to keep a law it has found to be unconstitutional in effect pending appeal.\u201d",
      "The Center for Reproductive Rights, which represents the abortion clinic and several physicians who challenged the law, opposed enforcement of the overturned ban. The court heard oral arguments on the state\u2019s request in November.",
      "In the three-member majority opinion, Justice Daniel Crothers cited several legal reasons against the state's arguments, writing at one point: \u201cThe upshot of the State\u2019s argument is that any decision that recognizes a previously unobserved constitutional right should warrant a stay. We reject the request to adopt such a tenuous connection between the proposition advanced by the State and our precedent.\u201d",
      "The plaintiffs welcomed the decision.",
      "\u201cToday\u2019s decision to keep the abortion ban blocked was the only logical outcome,\" Meetra Mehdizadeh, senior staff attorney at the center, said in a statement. \"People are dying without access to abortion, and still the State sought to stop pregnant North Dakotans facing dangerous situations from getting the care they need. It\u2019s shameful. We will not stop fighting until this ban is struck down once and for all.\u201d",
      "In a statement, North Dakota Attorney General Drew Wrigley said: \"This is only a decision on the stay motion, not on the constitutional merits of the legislation. North Dakota will continue moving forward to fully litigate this matter before the state Supreme Court, where we intend to establish that the law passed by our legislature is clearly constitutional.\"",
      "The case has had a winding road since the Red River Women\u2019s Clinic initially challenged the state\u2019s previous abortion ban in the wake of the U.S. Supreme Court overturning Roe v. Wade in 2022.",
      "In 2023, North Dakota\u2019s Republican-controlled Legislature revised the state\u2019s abortion laws. That law criminalized the performance of an abortion as a felony, with the only exceptions to save the life of a mother or to prevent a \u201cserious health risk\u201d to her. The ban also allowed for abortions in cases of rape or incest but only up to six weeks gestation, which is often before many women know they are pregnant. The plaintiffs said the law was unconstitutionally vague and its health exception too narrow.",
      "Republican state Sen. Janne Myrdal, who introduced the 2023 bill that became law, said she doesn't view Friday's decision as a setback.",
      "\u201cIt's not a reflection of the validity of the constitutionality of the law ... and I don't read anything more into that fact, actually,\" Myrdal said.",
      "A Center for Reproductive Rights spokesperson said the clinic has no current plans to return to North Dakota."

    "story": [
      "The Minnesota Supreme Court has sided with Democrats in a power struggle with Republicans over control of the state House of Representatives",
      "MINNEAPOLIS -- The Minnesota Supreme Court sided with Democrats on Friday in a power struggle with Republicans in the state House of Representatives but left it up to lawmakers to figure out a way to work together.",
      "The justices unanimously agreed with House Democratic leaders who argued that a quorum in the House was 68 members under the state constitution, not the 67 that Republicans claimed. The House GOP holds a 67-66 majority pending a special election to fill an empty seat that\u2019s expected around March 11. House Democrats have stayed away from the Capitol all session to try to prevent Republicans from exploiting their advantage.",
      "The high court's chief justice said Thursday that the disagreement had left the House \u201ccompletely dysfunctional.\" The court issued a three-page order Friday and said it would follow up with a detailed opinion explaining its legal reasoning later. The justices did not directly declare that all the actions that House Republicans have taken so far are legally invalid, as Democrats had wanted, but said they \u201cassume that the parties will now conform to this order.\u201d",
      "House Democrats said the ruling \u201ceffectively invalidates every action Republicans took since the first day of session\u201d last week.",
      "\u201cWe need to work together in order to get things done, and we are anxious to get together with Republicans, and we\u2019re hopeful that the court\u2019s order now enables us to move forward and reach a negotiated agreement,\" the top House Democrat, Melissa Hortman, of Brooklyn Park, said at a news conference.",
      "But House Republicans were noncommittal in their initial public reaction about whether they're willing to reopen talks.",
      "\u201cThis decision drives home the fact that House Democrats are disrespecting not just their own constituents, but the entire state of Minnesota by refusing to do their jobs,\" the top GOP leader, Lisa Demuth, of Cold Spring, said in a statement. \"House Republicans will be showing up to work on Monday \u2014 it\u2019s time for the Democrats\u2019 walkout to end and for the legislature to get on with its work.\u201d",
      "Hortman and other Democratic leaders had expressed hope before the ruling that a win for them would at least incentivize their GOP counterparts to negotiate a power-sharing agreement similar to one that they agreed to after the November election when it looked like the House would be tied 67-67 when the Legislature convened its 2025 session Jan. 14.",
      "That agreement collapsed after a Ramsey County judge ruled that the Democratic winner of a Roseville-area seat didn\u2019t live in his district and was ineligible. That gave Republicans a temporary one-seat majority. The eventual special election to fill the seat is expected to restore the tie because it\u2019s a heavily Democratic district. After the session convened last week, Republicans pressed forward with voting to elect Demuth as speaker, introducing legislation and holding hearings.",
      "It wasn't immediately clear exactly what will happen Monday afternoon when the House is scheduled to reconvene. Under state law, the secretary of state convenes the opening session of the House and serves as presiding officer until a quorum is present and a speaker is elected, which is normally a fairly quick formality.",
      "Democratic Secretary of State Steve Simon, who adjourned the first day's floor session after declaring there was no quorum, said in a statement that he'll try again, though he didn't specify when.",
      "\"I look forward to re-convening the House of Representatives \u2014 and to working with an organized legislature to advance the interests of all Minnesotans,\u201d Simon said in a statement.",
      "Hortman said her last offer to Demuth, which is still on the table, would let the Republicans run the House until the special election presumably restores the tie, when they would revert to the previous power-sharing agreement. She said she's ready to resume talks but did not commit her members to returning Monday without a deal.",
      "\u201cWe can come up with an agreement that respects both sides, comes up with a win-win and gets us all back at the Capitol working together very soon.,\u201d Hortman said.",
      "House Democrats have also said they won\u2019t return to the Capitol until Republicans promise not to refuse to seat Democratic Rep. Brad Tabke, of Shakopee, who won reelection by just 14 votes in a swing district where the GOP would stand a good chance of winning a low-turnout special election. Republicans have refused to give that assurance, even though a Scott County judge declared Tabke the legal winner, and the losing candidate said Friday that he won't appeal. Denying Tabke his seat would lock in the GOP majority at least until that seat could be filled.",
      "In trying to block a quorum, House Democrats are using tactics that lawmakers around the country have tried at least two dozen times before to thwart their opponents. While it\u2019s unusual in Minnesota, it\u2019s not a first for the state. In 1857, Republicans wanted to move the Minnesota Territory\u2019s capital from St. Paul to St. Peter, about 75 miles (121 kilometers) away. A Democratic lawmaker took physical possession of the bill and hid in a local hotel until it was too late to act on the measure."

      "WASHINGTON -- The Supreme Court agreed Friday to take on a new culture war dispute: whether the nation\u2019s first publicly funded religious charter school should be allowed to open in Oklahoma.",
      "The justices said they would review an Oklahoma Supreme Court decision that invalidated a state board's approval of an application by the Catholic Church in Oklahoma to open a charter school.",
      "The conservative-dominated high court has issued several decisions in recent years signaling a willingness to allow public funds to flow to religious entities. At the same time, conservative-led states have sought to insert religion into public schools, including Louisiana's requirement that the Ten Commandments be posted in classrooms.",
      "The case probably will be argued in late April and decided by early summer. Justice Amy Coney Barrett is not taking part in the case, but did not explain why.",
      "Last June, Oklahoma\u2019s top court held by a 7-1 vote that a taxpayer-funded religious charter school would violate the part of the First Amendment that prohibits government from making any law \u201crespecting an establishment of religion.\u201d",
      "The decision followed a 3-2 vote in 2023 by the Statewide Virtual Charter School Board to approve an application by the archdiocese for the St. Isidore of Seville Virtual Charter School. The K-12 online school had planned to start classes for its first 200 enrollees last fall, with part of its mission to evangelize its students in the Catholic faith.",
      "A group of Oklahoma parents, faith leaders and a public education nonprofit sued to block the school.",
      "\u201cUnder Oklahoma law, a charter school is a public school,\u201d Justice James Winchester, an appointee of former Republican Gov. Frank Keating, wrote in the court\u2019s majority opinion. \u201cAs such, a charter school must be nonsectarian.",
      "\u201cHowever, St. Isidore will evangelize the Catholic school curriculum while sponsored by the state.\u201d",
      "In dissent, Justice Dana Kuehn wrote that excluding St. Isidore from operating a charter school based solely on its religious affiliation would violate a different part of the First Amendment that protects religious freedom.",
      "The high court's decision to intervene was warmly received by Alliance Defending Freedom, the Christian legal advocacy group representing the state board. \"There\u2019s great irony in state officials who claim to be in favor of religious liberty discriminating against St. Isidore because of its Catholic beliefs,\u201d the group's chief legal counsel, Jim Campbell, said in a statement.",
      "Opponents of the Oklahoma charter school called on the justices to uphold the state court ruling. \u201cThe law is clear: Charter schools are public schools and must be secular and open to all students,\u201d the American Civil Liberties Union and other legal groups said in a statement. They are representing the school\u2019s opponents in a separate lawsuit.",
      "The case puts Oklahoma's Republican governor, Kevin Stitt, and its Republican attorney general, Gentner Drummond, on opposing sides. Stitt favors the school. Drummond reversed the advice given to the charter school board by his Republican predecessor, warning that the Catholic charter school would in his view violate the Constitution.",

      "Connecticut is set to award $5.9 million to the family of a disabled man who served a quarter century in prison before his murder conviction was overturned",
      "HARTFORD, Conn. -- More than four years after his death, Richard Lapointe's family is set to receive a nearly $5.9 million award from Connecticut for his wrongful, quarter-century imprisonment that ended in 2015 when his murder conviction was overturned in the rape and killing of his wife's 88-year-old grandmother.",
      "Lapointe's case became a cause celebre, receiving widespread publicity from advocates for the disabled and celebrities, including writers Arthur Miller and William Styron, who called for his release. Lapointe, who died at age 74 in 2020, had Dandy-Walker syndrome, a rare congenital brain malformation that his lawyers believe was a factor in his falsely confessing to the crime.",
      "The award by the state claims commissioner's office, which now moves to the legislature for approval, was issued Jan. 2 after years of legal battles between Lapointe's lawyers and the state attorney general's office. Lapointe was never declared innocent, but the two sides eventually agreed to settle, leading to the award.",
      "\u201cThe award is by no means adequate compensation for what was done to Richard Lapointe,\u201d his attorney, Paul Casteleiro, said Friday. He said the state destroyed his life \u201cfor a crime he did not commit.\u201d",
      "The award, he said, is \"a recognition by the state of the wrong it committed in prosecuting and imprisoning an innocent man. Sadly, Richard did not live long enough to witness his final vindication.\u201d",
      "Asked about the award and Lapointe's case, the attorney general's office released a brief statement Friday saying it \u201cnegotiated a resolution of this claim in the interests of all parties. This reflects that process.\u201d",
      "In his decision, Claims Commissioner Robert Shea Jr. said his office agreed that the award is \u201creasonable and appropriate.\u201d The agency decides whether people can file lawsuits against the state or receive money under the state's wrongful incarceration law.",
      "A spokesperson for the claims commissioner\u2019s office did not immediately return an email message seeking additional comment.",
      "Bernice Martin, the grandmother of Lapointe's wife, was found stabbed, raped and strangled in 1987 in her burning apartment in Manchester, about 10 miles (16 kilometers) east of Hartford.",
      "Lapointe, a dishwasher, was convicted of murder in 1992 and sentenced to life in prison without the possibility of release, with key evidence including confessions he made during a 9 1/2-hour interrogation by Manchester police. His lawyers argued his mental disability made him vulnerable to giving false confessions, and alleged the confession was coerced without any defense lawyers present.",
      "The state Supreme Court ruled 4-2 in 2015 that Lapointe was deprived of a fair trial because prosecutors failed to disclose notes by a police officer that may have supported an alibi defense. Later the same year, prosecutors said new DNA testing did not implicate Lapointe and all the charges were dropped. No one else has been charged in the killing.",
      "Ten days after the court's ruling, Lapointe was freed and emerged from the Hartford courthouse wearing a black T-shirt that read \u201cI didn't do it.\" He threw his hands into the air in triumph.",
      "\u201cOf course I didn\u2019t do it,\u201d Lapointe said. \u201cThat wasn\u2019t me. I wouldn\u2019t do nothing like that to nobody. I wouldn\u2019t even kill my worst enemy.\u201d",
      "Casteleiro said the case destroyed Lapointe's family, who shunned him. Before the killing, Lapointe and his wife, who has cerebral palsy, \u201cwere making a life together. They were doing OK,\u201d Casteleiro said. She divorced him after his arrest, and he lost all contact with his son, who was young at the time.",
      "After he was released from prison, Lapointe began suffering from dementia, was placed in a nursing home in East Hartford and died after a bout with COVID-19, his lawyers said.",
      "Through the years, he was supported by an array of advocates, including the groups Friends of Richard Lapointe and Centurion, a Princeton, New Jersey-based organization for whom Casteleiro works that helps the wrongly convicted."

      "Tire manufacturer Bridgestone Americas is closing its LaVergne, Tennessee, plant and laying off 700 workers there",
      "NASHVILLE, Tenn. -- Tire manufacturer Bridgestone Americas is closing its LaVergne, Tennessee, truck and bus radial tire plant and laying off 700 workers there, the company announced in a news release.",
      "Bridgestone said the closure will help the company \u201coptimize its business footprint\u201d and \u201cstrengthen its competitiveness.\u201d",
      "In addition, Bridgestone announced capacity and workforce reductions at its Des Moines, Iowa, agriculture tire plant and additional workforce reductions in U.S. corporate, sales and operations. In Latin America, it plans reductions in workforce and production capacity in Argentina and Brazil.",
      "\u201cReductions in force are impacting our corporate, sales and operations in the Americas where a realignment of staffing levels is needed in response to the challenging economic environment,\u201d company spokesperson Emily Weaver said in an email. \u201cOf our nearly 44,000 teammates across North America and Latin America, just under 4% of our teammates are leaving the company as part of the voluntary and involuntary workforce reductions.\u201d",
      "The LaVergne plant was the first tire-producing facility in North America for the Bridgestone Corporation. The company stopped making tires for cars and light trucks at the plant in 2009, laying off roughly half of the workers at the time. LaVergne's United Steelworkers master union workers have preferential hiring rights at the company's plants in Des Moines; Akron, Ohio; and Russellville, Arkansas, Weaver said."

      "The Senate confirmed Pete Hegseth as the nation\u2019s defense secretary in a dramatic late-night vote",
      "WASHINGTON -- The Senate confirmed Pete Hegseth as the nation's defense secretary Friday in a dramatic late-night vote, swatting back questions about his qualifications to lead the Pentagon amid allegations of heavy drinking and aggressive behavior toward women.",
      "Rarely has a Cabinet nominee faced such wide-ranging concerns about his experience and behavior as Hegseth, particularly for such a high-profile role atop the U.S. military. But the Republican-led Senate was determined to confirm Hegseth, a former Fox News host and combat veteran who has vowed to bring a \u201cwarrior culture\u201d to the Pentagon, rounding out President Donald Trump's top national security Cabinet officials.",
      "Vice President JD Vance was on hand to cast a tie-breaking vote, unusual in the Senate for Cabinet nominees, who typically win wider support. Hegseth himself was at the Capitol with his family.",
      "Senate Majority Leader John Thune said Hegseth, as a veteran of the Army National Guard who served tours in Iraq and Afghanistan, \u201cwill bring a warrior's perspective\" to the top military job.",
      "\u201cGone will be the days of woke distractions,\u201d Thune said, referring to the diversity, equity and inclusion initiatives being slashed across the federal government. \u201cThe Pentagon's focus will be on war fighting.\u201d",
      "The Senate's ability to confirm Hegseth despite a grave series of allegations against him will provide a measure of Trump's political power and ability to get what he wants from the GOP-led Congress, and of the potency of the culture wars to fuel his agenda at the White House.",
      "Next week senators will be facing Trump's other outside Cabinet choices including particularly Kash Patel, a Trump ally who has published an enemies list, as the FBI director; Tulsi Gabbard as director of the office of national intelligence; and Robert F. Kennedy, Jr, the anti-vaccine advocate at Health and Human Services.",
      "\u201cIs Pete Hegseth truly the best we have to offer?\u201d said Sen. Jack Reed of Rhode Island, the top Democrat on the Senate Armed Services Committee, urging his colleagues to think seriously about their vote.",
      "Hegseth himself was working the phones late Friday to shore up his support, his confirmation at stake.",
      "\u201cHe\u2019s a good man,\" Trump said of Hegseth while departing the White House to visit disaster-hit North Carolina and Los Angeles. \"I hope he makes it.\u201d",
      "Trump leveled criticism of Sen. Lisa Murkowski of Alaska and Sen. Susan Collins of Maine, who announced they would vote against Hegseth. And Tump raised fresh questions about Sen. Mitch McConnell, R-Ky., saying, \u201cAnd of course Mitch is always a no vote, I guess. Is Mitch a no vote?\u201d",
      "In the end all three voted against Hegseth, as tensions soared late Friday at the Capitol.",
      "McConnell, the former GOP leader in the Senate, had not declared his vote, but signaled skepticism in an earlier speech when he declared he would confirm nominees to senior national security roles \u201cwhose record and experience will make them immediate assets, not liabilities.\u201d He voted against.",
      "It takes a simple majority to confirm Hegseth, and Republicans, with a 53-47 majority in the Senate, could only lose one more objection.",
      "One Republican, Sen. Thom Tillis of North Carolina, sent the Senate swirling as he raised questions and was provided information and answers, said a person familiar with the situation Thursday and granted anonymity to discuss it.",
      "But Tillis ultimately voted to confirm Hegseth who he said \u201chas a unique perspective\u201d and is passionate about modernizing the military. He said he spoke to Hegseth for \u201cnearly two hour\u201d about his concerns.",
      "Democrats, as the minority party, have helped confirm Secretary of State Marco Rubio and CIA Director John Ratcliffe in bipartisan votes to Trump's national security team within days of his return to the White House.",
      "But Democrats gravely opposed to Hegseth have little power to stop him, and instead have resorted to dragging out the process.",
      "Hours before the vote, Democrat after Democrat took to the Senate floor to object.",
      "Sen. Chris Murphy, D-Conn., said during the debate there are few Trump nominees as \u201cdangerously and woefully unqualified as Hegseth.\u201d",
      "Hegseth faces allegations that he sexually assaulted a woman at a Republican conference in California, though he has denied the claims and said the encounter was consensual. He later paid $50,000 to the woman.",
      "More recently, Hegseth's former sister-in-law said in an affidavit that he was abusive to his second wife to the point that she feared for her safety. Hegseth has denied the allegation, and in divorce proceedings, neither Hegseth nor the woman claimed to be a victim of domestic abuse.",
      "During a fiery confirmation hearing, Hegseth dismissed allegations of wrongdoing one by one, and vowed to bring \u201cwarrior culture\u201d to the top Pentagon post.",
      "Hegseth has promised not to drink on the job if confirmed.",
      "But Republican senators facing an intensive pressure campaign by Trump allies to support Hegseth have stood by his nomination, echoing his claims of a \u201csmear\u201d campaign against him.",
      "A Princeton and Harvard graduate, Hegseth represents a newer generation of veterans who came of age in the aftermath of the Sept. 11, 2001, attacks. He went on to a career at Fox News as the host of a weekend show, and was unknown to many on Capitol Hill until Trump tapped him for the top Defense job.",
      "Hegseth's comments that women should have no role in military combat drew particular concern on Capitol Hill, including from lawmakers who themselves served. He has since tempered those views as he met with senators during the confirmation process.",
      "Murkowski said in a lengthy statement ahead of a test vote on Hegseth that his behaviors \u201cstarkly contrast\u201d with what is expected of the military.",
      "\u201cI remain concerned about the message that confirming Mr. Hegseth sends to women currently serving and those aspiring to join,\u201d Murkowski wrote on social media.",
      "Collins said that after a lengthy discussion with Hegseth, \u201cI am not convinced that his position on women serving in combat roles has changed.\u201d",
      "But one prominent Republican, Sen. Joni Ernst of Iowa, herself a veteran and sexual assault survivor, came under harsh criticism for her skepticism toward Hegseth and eventually announced she would back him.",
      "Hegseth would lead an organization with nearly 2.1 million service members, about 780,000 civilians and a budget of $850 billion.",
      "In exercising its advise and consent role over Trump\u2019s nominees, the Senate is also trying to stave off his suggestion that the GOP leaders simply do away with the confirmation process altogether, and allow him to appoint his Cabinet choices when the Congress is on recess.",
      "Trump raised the idea of so-called \u201crecess appointments\u201d during a private White House meeting with Thune and House Speaker Mike Johnson, a step many senators are trying to avoid.",

      "President Donald Trump\u2019s new Justice Department leadership is curtailing prosecutions against people accused of blocking access to abortion clinics and reproductive health centers",
      "WASHINGTON -- President Donald Trump's new Justice Department leadership issued an order Friday to curtail prosecutions against people accused of blocking access to abortion clinics and reproductive health centers, calling the cases an example of the \u201cweaponization\u201d of law enforcement.",
      "Prosecutions and civil actions under the Freedom of Access to Clinic Entrances Act or \u201cFACE Act\u201d will now be permitted only in \u201cextraordinary circumstances\u201d or in cases presenting \u201dsignificant aggravating factors,\" attorney general chief of staff Chad Mizelle said in a memo sent to the head of the department's Civil Rights Division.",
      "Mizelle also ordered the immediate dismissal of three FACE Act cases related to 2021 blockades of clinics in Tennessee, Pennsylvania and Ohio.",
      "The memo signals a sharp departure from Justice Department under the Biden administration, which brought cases involving dozens of defendants accused of violating the law. The act prohibits physically obstructing or using the threat of force to intimidate or interfere with a person seeking reproductive health services, and prohibits damaging property at abortion clinics and other centers.",
      "The legal group Thomas More Society, which represents many of the defendants, called the move a \u201chuge moment in the fight against FACE.\"",
      "\u201cIn each of these three FACE Act cases, Thomas More Society attorneys were representing several brave and peaceful pro-life defendants \u2014 who can now breathe easy without the heavy burden of federal prosecutors on their backs,\u201d the group said Friday.",
      "The announcement comes hours after Trump vowed to support tens of thousands of anti-abortion protesters at Friday\u2019s March for Life, declaring, \u201cWe will again stand proudly for families and for life\u201d in a prerecorded address. A day earlier, Trump pardoned several anti-abortion activists convicted of blockading abortion clinic entrances in violation of the FACE Act, which is designed to protect abortion clinics from obstruction and threats.",
      "\u201cPresident Donald Trump campaigned on the promise of ending the weaponization of the federal government and has recently directed all federal departments and agencies to identify and correct the past weaponization of law enforcement,\u201d Mizelle wrote in the memo obtained by The Associated Press.",
      "\u201cTo many Americans, prosecutions and civil actions under the Freedom of Access to Clinic Entrances Act ('FACE Act') have been the prototypical example of this weaponization. And with good reason,\" he wrote.",
      "Mizelle, who was brought on to serve as chief of staff to Trump's pick for attorney general, Pam Bondi, said \u201cmore than 100 crisis pregnancy centers, pro-life organizations, and churches were attacked in the immediate aftermath\u201d of the U.S. Supreme Court ruling that overturned Roe v. Wade. Yet, nearly all of the prosecutions under the FACE Act have been against anti-abortion protesters, he wrote.",
      "\u201cThat is not the even-handed administration of justice,\u201d he wrote.",
      "Vice President JD Vance, who spoke to the crowd at the March for Life in person, celebrated pardons for FACE Act defendants and called Trump \u201cthe most pro-life American president of our lifetimes.\u201d",
      "Abortion-rights advocates slammed Trump's pardons of those convicted of violating the law, which was passed in 1994 during a time where clinic protests and blockades were on the rise, as was violence against abortion providers, such as the murder of Dr. David Gunn.",
      "\u201cNot even a week into his presidency, Donald Trump has disregarded the law and greenlit violence against abortion providers, all at the expense of people who wish to live in peace and safely exercise the right to control their own bodies and health,\u201d Krista Noah, national director of affiliate security and response planning at Planned Parenthood Federation of America, said Thursday."

    "story": [
      "President Donald Trump is criticizing California water policy as he prepares to tour wildfire damage in Los Angeles",
      "As President Donald Trump prepares to tour wildfire damage in California, he's zeroing in on one of his frequent targets for criticism: State water policy.",
      "Since the fires broke out Jan. 7, Trump has used social media and interviews to accuse the state of sending too much water to the Pacific Ocean instead of south toward Los Angeles and highlighted how some hydrants ran dry in the early hours of the firefight in Pacific Palisades.",
      "In the first hours of his second term, Trump called on federal officials to draft plans to route more water to the crop-rich Central Valley and densely populated cities in the southern part of the state. Two days later he threatened to withhold federal disaster aid unless California leaders change the state\u2019s approach on water.",
      "Here's a look at the facts behind Trump's comments and what power the president has to influence California water:",
      "In general, most of the state's water is in the north, while most of its people are in the drier south.",
      "Los Angeles, the nation\u2019s second largest city, depends on drawing water from elsewhere. Meanwhile the relatively dry Central Valley is home to fertile land where much of the nation's fruits and vegetables are grown.",
      "Two complex systems of dams and canals channel rain and snowmelt from the mountains in the north and route it south. One is managed by the federal government and known as the Central Valley Project, while the other is operated by the state of California and known as the State Water Project.",
      "Both transport water through the Sacramento-San Joaquin River Delta, an estuarythat provides critical habitat to fish and wildlife including salmon and the delta smelt, one of Trump's fascinations.",
      "Southern California gets about half its water from local supplies such as groundwater, according to the Metropolitan Water District of Southern California, a regional water wholesaler. Metropolitan provides the rest of the water from state supplies and the federally managed Colorado River system.",
      "The Los Angeles Department of Water and Power also manages its own aqueducts that draw water from the eastern Sierra Nevada.",
      "Federal officials guide how much is routed to the delta to protect threatened species and how much goes to Central Valley Project users, mostly farms. That project does not supply water to Los Angeles.",
      "State officials are expected to follow the same environmental guidelines, said Caitlin Peterson, a research fellow at the Public Policy Institute of California's Water Policy Center.",
      "Federal and state officials typically coordinate how they operate those systems.",
      "The delta connects inland waterways to the Pacific, and keeping a certain amount of water flowing through helps support fish populations and the waterway itself.",
      "But Trump and others say the state lets too much water go to the ocean rather than cities and farms.",
      "His prior administration allowed more water to be directed to the Central Valley and out of the delta. Environmental groups opposed that, saying it would harm endangered species.",
      "Gov. Gavin Newsom filed a lawsuit saying the rules would drive endangered fish populations to extinction. There were concerns about the tiny delta smelt, which is seen as an indicator of the waterway's health, as well as and chinook salmon and steelhead trout, which return annually from the Pacific to spawn in freshwater rivers.",
      "Then-President Joe Biden's administration issued its own rules in December that environmental groups said provided modest improvements over those of the first Trump administration.",
      "He has continued to question how California's water managed. Last year on his Truth Social platform, he criticized the \u201crerouting of MILLIONS OF GALLONS OF WATER A DAY FROM THE NORTH OUT INTO THE PACIFIC OCEAN, rather than using it, free of charge, for the towns, cities, & farms dotted all throughout California.\u201d",
      "Such comments buoyed the spirits of many farmers and water managers in the Central Valley who say federal water allocations have been too limited in the past two years since ample rain boosted reservoir levels. A series of major storms in 2023 helped California emerge from a multi-year drought, but dry conditions have started to return in the central and southern parts of the state.",
      "Trump has now directed the federal government again to route more water in the system it controls to farmers and cities.",
      "Not much. The farms-versus-fish debate is one of the most well-worn in California water politics and doesn't always fall along party lines. Some environmentalists think Newsom is too friendly to farming interests. But that debate is not connected to fire-related water troubles in Los Angeles.",
      "Trump has suggested that state officials \u201c turn the valve \u201d to send more water to the city. But state water supplies are not to blame for hydrants running dry and a key reservoir near Pacific Palisades that was not filled.",
      "The problem with the hydrants was that they were overstressed, and the Santa Ynez Reservoir was empty because it was undergoing maintenance.",
      "Newsom has called for an investigation into how the Los Angeles Department of Water and Power managed both issues.",

      "On the other side of the Atlantic, President Donald Trump was starting his political comeback as the new US president.",
      "\"Nothing will stand in our way\", he declared, as he vowed to end America's \"decline\".",
      "Towards the end of the gathering, President Trump was beamed in straight from the White House webcam to deliver his message of world domination directly to the global elite.",
      "While he charmed, almost seduced the audience with a credible picture of a booming US economy about to scale new technological heights, he simultaneously menaced with threats of tariffs to those who did not choose to shift their factories into the US.",
      "Trillions of dollars of tariffs for the US Treasury for those businesses exporting into the US market from foreign factories.",
      "\"Your prerogative\" he said, with a smile not out of place in a Godfather movie. And then for one of his own, the Bank of America chief Brian Moynihan, a remarkable public lashing accusing the lending giant of \"debanking\" many of his conservative supporters.",
      "He awkwardly mumbled about sponsoring the World Cup.",
      "In this first week of his second term, most people at Davos were nodding along, as they cannot think what else to do, just yet.",
      "Two worlds colliding, as the 'America First' President was beamed in like a 30-foot interplanetary emperor, into the beating heart of the rules-based international economic order.",
      "It is one thing suggesting that trade deficits are a problem with your domestic electorate. It is quite another to suggest at an internationalist forum that a G7 ally, Canada, become a state of your nation, eliciting gasps in the audience, and not just from Canadians.",
      "The address was, by design, charming and offensive. There was carrot and stick for the rest of the world.",
      "As delegates absorbed the mix of threats, invites and on occasion, praise, many appeared to be trying to decide just how much Trump might damage the global trading system, whilst assessing just how far ahead his America is getting in this tech driven AI boom.",
      "Davos has been for this first week the alternative pole of the Trump second term.",
      "There was a coherence to his agenda to use every means to drive down energy prices including by pressurising the Saudis on oil.",
      "This he said would not just help to lower inflation, but also drain Russia's war coffers of oil dollars to help end the Ukraine war, by economic means. The ceasefire in the Middle East has already bought Trump some geopolitical credibility in these circles.",
      "Christine Lagarde, David Miliband, and John Kerry shuffled into the hall. Various bank chiefs assembled on stage to praise and then lightly question the President.",
      "The bottom line was this: Is president Trump serious about what sounded like campaign trail threats to the world economic system? The answer will reverberate for the next four years and beyond.",
      "The answer sounded like a most definitely, yes. However, this does not mean it is going to work.",
      "Some leading US CEOs told me that they were preparing for tit-for-tat retaliatory tariffs to be applied to their exports. Their assumption was that the President's love of a rising stock market would restrict his deployment of tariffs.",

      "The rest of the world does have some counter leverage, once it decides to get back up after the Trump whirlwind.",
      "The Canadians are now briefing on their retaliatory tariffs. In conversations with both the British business secretary and EU trade minister, Jonathan Reynolds and European Union trade chief, Maros Sefcovic, I detected a desire for calm dialogue.",
      "Both are making similar arguments to try to dissuade Trump from wider tariffs.",
      "Mr Reynolds told me that as the US does not have a goods trade deficit with the UK, there is no need for tariffs.",
      "Mr Sefcovic said that the US should really think about its services surplus too.",
      "But do they not consider the threats to G7 and Nato allies Canada and Denmark (over Greenland) to be straightforwardly unacceptable and as absurd as France claiming back Louisiana? Sefcovic did not want to whip anything up.",
      "Diplomats are making lists of US goods that Europe can now purchase to demonstrate \"wins\" for President Trump, from arms to gas to the magnets in wind turbines.",
      "It might make some sense for the rest of the G7 to work in unison on retaliation against the tariffs, in order to concentrate the minds of Congress, and the competing factions inside the court of Trump.",
      "There is no sign of that happening.",
      "The US tech supremacy story epitomised by the broligarchy \u2013 including Amazon founder Jeff Bezos, Meta boss Mark Zuckerberg, Apple leader Tim Cook, and Google chief Sundar Pichar -  had top seats at the inauguration this week.",
      "While the US is streets ahead of Europe, its standing against China is more uncertain.",
      "One of the talks of Davos was DeepSeek's high performing, much cheaper AI model, made in China. The prediction that the tech bros would be tearing strips out of each other in the court of Trump began to come true within hours, rather than months.",
      "Meanwhile, while most, though not all, here in Davos sounded rather seduced by Trump's tech-fuelled optimism, some in Europe also see a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity to attract top researchers who may be rather less than enamoured with the direction of US politics. It was openly suggested by the European Central Bank chief Christine Lagarde.",

    "published": "Fri, 24 Jan 2025 00:02:10 GMT",
    "summary": "Engineers are working on systems that can turn lunar regolith into useful elements like oxygen.",
    "story": [
      "Inside a giant sphere, the engineers pored over their equipment. Before them stood a silvery metal contraption swathed in colourful wires \u2013 a box that they hope will one day make oxygen on the moon.",
      "Once the team vacated the sphere, the experiment began. The box-like machine was now ingesting small quantities of a dusty regolith \u2013 a mixture of dust and sharp grit with a chemical composition mimicking real lunar soil.",
      "Soon, that regolith was gloop. A layer of it heated to temperatures above 1,650C. And, with the addition of some reactants, oxygen-containing molecules began to bubble out.",
      "\u201cWe\u2019ve tested everything we can on Earth now,\u201d says Brant White, a program manager at Sierra Space, a private company. \u201cThe next step is going to the moon.\u201d",
      "Sierra Space\u2019s experiment unfolded at Nasa\u2019s Johnson Space Center this summer. It is far from the only such technology that researchers are working on, as they develop systems that could supply astronauts living on a future lunar base.",
      "Those astronauts will need oxygen to breathe but also to make rocket fuel for spacecraft that might launch from the moon and head to destinations further afield \u2013 including Mars.",
      "Lunar base inhabitants might also require metal and they could even harvest this from the dusty grey debris that litters the lunar surface.",
      "Much depends on whether we can build reactors able to extract such resources effectively or not.",
      "\u201cIt could save billions of dollars from mission costs,\u201d says Mr White as he explains that the alternative \u2013 bringing lots of oxygen and spare metal to the moon from Earth \u2013 would be arduous and expensive.",
      "Luckily, the lunar regolith is full of metal oxides. But while the science of extracting oxygen from metal oxides, for example, is well understood on Earth, doing this on the moon is much harder. Not least because of the conditions.",
      "The huge spherical chamber that hosted Sierra Space\u2019s tests in July and August this year induced a vacuum and also simulated lunar temperatures and pressures.",
      "The company says it has had to improve how the machine works over time so that it can better cope with the extremely jagged, abrasive texture of the regolith itself. \u201cIt gets everywhere, wears out all sorts of mechanisms,\u201d says Mr White.",
      "And the one, crucial, thing that you can\u2019t test on Earth or even in orbit around our planet, is lunar gravity \u2013 which is roughly one sixth that of the Earth. It might not be until 2028 or later that Sierra Space can test its system on the moon, using real regolith in low gravity conditions.",
      "The moon\u2019s gravity could be a real problem for some oxygen-extracting technologies unless engineers design for it, says Paul Burke at Johns Hopkins University.",
      "In April, he and colleagues published a paper detailing the results of computer simulations that showed how a different oxygen-extracting process might be hindered by the moon\u2019s relatively feeble gravitational pull. The process under investigation here was molten regolith electrolysis, which involves using electricity to split lunar minerals containing oxygen, in order to extract the oxygen directly.",
      "The problem is that such technology works by forming bubbles of oxygen on the surface of electrodes deep within the molten regolith itself. \u201cIt is the consistency of, say, honey. It is very, very viscous,\u201d says Dr Burke.",
      "\u201cThose bubbles aren\u2019t going to rise as fast \u2013 and may actually be delayed from detaching from the electrodes.\u201d",
      "There could be ways around this. One could be to vibrate the oxygen-making machine device, which might jiggle the bubbles free.",
      "And extra-smooth electrodes might make it easier for the oxygen bubbles to detach. Dr Burke and his colleagues are now working on ideas like this.",
      "Sierra Space\u2019s technology, a carbothermal process, is different. In their case, when oxygen-containing bubbles form in the regolith, they do so freely, rather than on the surface of an electrode. It means there is less chance of them getting stuck, says Mr White.",
      "Stressing the value of oxygen for future lunar expeditions, Dr Burke estimates that, per day, an astronaut would require the amount of oxygen contained in roughly two or three kilograms of regolith, depending on that astronaut\u2019s fitness and activity levels.",
      "However, a lunar base\u2019s life support systems would likely recycle oxygen breathed out by astronauts. If so, it wouldn\u2019t be necessary to process quite as much regolith just to keep the lunar residents alive.",
      "The real use case for oxygen-extracting technologies, adds Dr Burke, is in providing the oxidiser for rocket fuels, which could enable ambitious space exploration.",
      "Obviously the more resources that can be made on the moon the better.",
      "Sierra Space\u2019s system does require the addition of some carbon, though the firm says it can recycle most of this after each oxygen-producing cycle.",
      "Along with colleagues, Palak Patel, a PhD student at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, came up with an experimental molten regolith electrolysis system, for extracting oxygen and metal from the lunar soil.",
      "\u201cWe\u2019re really looking at it from the standpoint of, \u2018Let\u2019s try to minimise the number of resupply missions\u2019,\u201d she says.",
      "When designing their system, Ms Patel and her colleagues addressed the problem described by Dr Burke: that low gravity could impede the detachment of oxygen bubbles that form on electrodes. To counter this, they used a \u201csonicator\u201d, which blasts the bubbles with sound waves in order to dislodge them.",
      "Ms Patel says that future resource-extracting machines on the moon could derive iron, titanium or lithium from regolith, for example. These materials might help lunar-dwelling astronauts make 3D-printed spare parts for their moon base or replacement components for damaged spacecraft.",
      "The usefulness of lunar regolith does not stop there. Ms Patel notes that, in separate experiments, she has melted simulated regolith into a tough, dark, glass-like material.",
      "She and colleagues worked out how to turn this substance into strong, hollow bricks, which could be useful for building structures on the moon \u2013 an imposing black monolith, say. Why not?",

      "However, Nigel Green, chief executive of global financial advisory firm deVere Group, said the announcement had \"landed with a thud\" among investors and wealthy individuals.",
      "He said the \"vague proposal to adjust the rules offers neither the clarity nor the assurances required to reverse the damage already inflicted\".",

    "story": [
      "The UK banking industry has warned that government plans to crackdown on benefit fraud could leave banks at risk of breaking consumer protection rules.",
      "A new law unveiled on Wednesday would allow the Department for Work and Pensions (DWP) to reclaim money from accounts without a court order.",
      "Ministers argue this will speed up the debt recovery process and help contribute to a wider crackdown on benefits fraud.",
      "But UK Finance, the biggest business group representing British banks, has told the BBC the plans could undermine the banks' own efforts to protect vulnerable account holders.",
      "Benefit cheats could be stripped of driving licences",
      "Warnings over AI use to risk-score benefit claims",
      "The government's announcement on Wednesday is the culmination of years of work by officials in DWP about how to more closely involve banks in benefit fraud crackdowns.",
      "Similar plans drawn up by the previous Conservative government failed to make it through Parliament before last July's general election.",
      "The banking sector is understood to have been quietly lobbying against the plans for more than a year, but this is the first time they have raised concerns publicly.",
      "The intervention could cause a headache for ministers, who've spent months courting the City, in a bid to bring them on side with their plans to boost economic growth.",
      "At the moment, the DWP can recover benefits debt from current claimants through the welfare system itself, whilst it can also deduct money from claimants who are employees through the PAYE system.",
      "It argues the ability to recover money from claimants' bank accounts directly would help reclaim funds from those no longer on benefits or who are self-employed, and ease pressures on the court system.",
      "Under the new legislation, the DWP would be able to compel banks to transfer over benefits debt through \"direct deduction orders\". Banks would be able to charge the claimant a fee to cover their administration costs.",
      "The department would be obliged to consider three months' worth of bank statements from the claimant first, and consider whether a deduction would mean they would suffer \"hardship in meeting essential living expenses\".",
      "But Daniel Cichocki, director in economic crime and policy strategy at UK Finance, said the plans need to be looked at further to ensure they don't \"create risks for vulnerable customers, or conflict with existing regulatory and legal obligations\".",
      "Mr Cichocki said he agreed with the principle of going after fraud, but called on the government to introduce controls to \"prevent fraud and error entering the benefits system in the first place\".",
      "UK Finance, which counts the vast majority of the big retail banks among its members, pointed to the Financial Conduct Authority's (FCA) consumer duty as an area that it believes could be in conflict with the government's plans.",
      "The duty, introduced in 2023, set higher standards for consumer protection and gave banks a specific obligation to protect customers who are vulnerable due to their financial situation.",
      "A bank that breaks those rules can be penalised by the FCA, or the financial ombudsman.",
      "Data sharing concerns",
      "The banking industry is also understood to have concerns over new measures forcing them to hand over account information of claimants where there are indications they \"may have been\" paid benefits incorrectly.",
      "This could include the account holder's name, date of birth and account number, although transaction information would be excluded.",
      "The department can currently only demand such financial information where it has reason to suspect fraud, and only in individual cases.",
      "It argues greater access to banking information in bulk will allow it to catch cases of potential fraud that would otherwise go undetected, eventually saving the taxpayer around \u00a3500m a year once the system is fully rolled out.",
      "According to latest annual figures, overpayments due to fraud amounted to \u00a37.4bn last year, around 2.8% of total welfare spending.",
      "A further \u00a31.6bn (0.6%) was overpaid due to inadvertent errors by claimants, with \u00a30.8bn (0.3%) overpaid because of errors by the DWP.",

      "The DWP says that initially, the only accounts to be flagged would be those showing sustained activity abroad or holding more than \u00a316,000, the usual savings limit for being able to claim Universal Credit.",
      "The new system will initially be piloted by a \"limited number\" of banks and building societies, before being gradually phased in ahead of a full rollout in 2029.",
      "But the exact threshold for when someone's details will be handed over is still unclear - and the government has indicated it wants banks to work with them to establish a \"fully automated\" system.",

      "If a UK clothing manufacturer makes garments mainly from textiles it has sourced from Turkey - which is not in the EU - and sells them into the EU, the firm importing the goods would pay a tariff.",

      "William Bain, head of trade policy at the British Chambers of Commerce, said joining PEM \"would reduce paperwork and costs for many UK firms as it would align rules and regulations on both sides in relation to the sourcing of components and raw materials used in exports\".",

      "Single market treatment for UK food and farm exports would mean \"we would have to have the same rules and we have to upgrade them at the same time, we call it dynamic alignment\", he said.",
      "Dame Emily described the current agreement as \"uneven and difficult\".",
      "\"At the moment the reality is that for reasons of capacity, food coming in from the EU isn't really checked and yet food from Britain is checked a lot going into the EU,\" she said.",

      "Chancellor Rachel Reeves says she is \"optimistic\" on the UK economy despite pressure on government finances after borrowing rose more than expected in December.",
      "Borrowing - the difference between spending and tax revenue - was \u00a317.8bn last month, the highest December level for four years, according to official figures.",
      "Spending on public services, benefits, and debt interest were all up on the year, while an increase in tax receipts was offset by National Insurance cuts made by the previous government.",
      "Recent rises in borrowing costs threaten the government's economic plans, with Reeves under pressure after figures last week showed the UK economy had flatlined.",
      "The government has said economic growth is its top priority in order to improve living standards, but fears over the health of the economy adds to speculation that Reeves could cut spending on public services.",
      "The Chancellor repeated her pledge to go \"further and faster\" to deliver growth as she signalled her intention to back expansions to Heathrow and Gatwick Airports in a bid to boost the economy, despite environmental concerns.",
      "\"We will look at all plans to bring infrastructure, to bring investment to Britain,\" she told the BBC, on her visit at the World Economic Forum in Davos, Switzerland, where investors that own the airports were present.",
      "\"When there are decisions around infrastructure investment, the answer can't always be 'no', and with this government the answer is 'yes',\" Reeves added.",
      "The Treasury is looking at whether to support a third runway at Heathrow and approve a second runway at Gatwick, but such projects would not start for some time.",
      "The potential plans come as figures revealed interest charged on government debt hit \u00a38.3bn, the third-highest December repayments since monthly records began in 1997.",
      "The \u00a317.8bn borrowed by the government last month was much higher than the \u00a314.6bn forecast by the Office for Budget Responsibility, the UK's official forecaster.",
      "Earlier this month interest rates charged on government debt surged in part due to concerns over the UK's economic outlook, but have since fallen back.",
      "How does the government borrow money?",
      "Why are UK borrowing costs rising and what does it mean for me?",
      "UK economy disappoints despite return to growth",
      "Reeves played down any impact the recent market turbulence would have on her meeting her self-imposed financial rules,  which pledge not to borrow to fund day-to-day spending, repeating that they were \"non-negotiable\".",
      "She also said regulators needed to \"regulate for growth\" following the ousting of the chair of the UK's competition watchdog by government ministers on Tuesday.",
      "\"We want regulators to be part of the mission for growth in a way that they haven't perhaps always been in the past,\" she added.",
      "Reeves has previously told businesses that she would not be \"coming back with more borrowing or more taxes\" following her first Budget in October.",
      "But Alex Kerr, UK economist at Capital Economics, said against the backdrop of weak economic growth and high interest rates, \"December's overshoot in borrowing is further disappointing news for the chancellor\".",
      "He added that while UK borrowing costs had fallen back, they were still higher than at the time of the Budget and suggested Reeves \"may need to raise taxes and/or cut spending\" in March in order to meet her own rules.",
      "Danni Hewson, head of financial analysis at AJ Bell, suggested \"only growth\" could offer an alternative to \"reigning in ambitions\".",
      "Business are set to bear the brunt of tax rises coming into effect in April, with hikes in the National Insurance rate and a reduction to the threshold for employers.",
      "Firms have repeatedly warned the extra costs, along with minimum wages rising and business rates relief being reduced, could impact economic growth, with employers expecting to have less cash to give pay rises and create new jobs.",
      "Research released this week by Lloyds Bank, the UK's biggest money lender, suggested business confidence had \"waned further\", with price rises to slow activity this year.",
      "The higher borrowing by the government means, with most of the financial year gone, the difference between what the government has spent and what it earns in taxes is \u00a34bn more than official forecasts.",
      "However, that figure includes lots of estimates which are often revised at a later date.",
      "January's borrowing figure is typically lower than in December due to lots of people submitting self-assessment tax returns, which increases the government's revenue.",
      "Separately, asked if the UK would introduce retaliatory tariffs should the Trump administration levy their own on the UK, she warned not to \"get ahead of ourselves\".",
      "\"No tariffs have been levied on the UK,\" she said. \"And I look forward to working with the Trump administration and the new US Treasury Secretary when he's confirmed shortly.",
      "\"When President Trump was last president of the United States, trade between the UK and the US increased. I've no doubt that that can happen again in the interests of both of our economies.\"",

      "However the platform relies heavily on community moderation, where unpaid individuals known as Redditors decide what is - and isn't - allowed to be published on their own corner of the website.",
      "In many instances, those Redditors have reached a different conclusion, deciding Mr Musk's actions were so offensive that they won't link to content from their subreddits on X, potentially reducing traffic, engagement and - ultimately - revenue.",
      "The biggest subreddits to have enforced the ban include basketball community r/NBA, which has 15 million members, female-focused community r/TwoXChromosomes, which has 14 million members, and American football community r/NFL, which has 12 million members.",
      "It is worth remembering that subreddits are almost always run by fans - it does not mean that the NFL or NBA organisations are taking a stance against Musk.",

      "And those running a group for people in British Columbia said they simply aren't \"doing censorship here\".",
      "Does it matter?",
      "Though there are many subreddits which already disallow posts from social media, those built around professional sports in particular may have a big impact on referrals to X.",
      "That's because sports subreddits generally get a lot of content from links to athletes, analysts and journalists who spend a lot of time posting online.",

      "And gaming subreddits have a similar story, with the top posts on the Animal Crossing and Kingdom Hearts communities both screenshots from X.",
      "But that is not to say the bans will necessarily be permanent - Reddit is known for this sort of community movement to protest against wider issues, which doesn't always work out.",
      "In 2023, thousands of communities \"went dark\" to contest changes to how the platform was being run.",
      "Some of the biggest Reddit communities then began only allowing photos and videos of comedian John Oliver, following comments from disgruntled users.",

      "Sir Keir Starmer said academies had been introduced by the previous Labour government and were \"here to stay\".",
      "He said it was a \"disgrace\" that Tory MPs opposed the bill, which also aims to protect vulnerable children, set up breakfast clubs and limit uniform costs.",
      "The Children's Wellbeing and Schools Bill is a wide-ranging bill which includes measures to create a register of children who are not in school and allow local authorities to intervene if a child's home environment is assessed as unsuitable or unsafe.",

      "On Tuesday evening, the government agreed to amend the wording in the bill. Instead, academies will have to have \"due regard\" to the national pay agreements.",
      "Following PMQs, a Downing Street spokesman said the amendment to the bill was \"a sensible step to clarify our ambition for teachers' pay and conditions\".",
      "\"The amendment makes very clear the government's intention to set a floor on pay but no ceiling so that all state school teachers can rely on the core pay offer,\" he added.",
      "The Confederation of School Trusts welcomed the changes - but said there were still parts of the bill that concerned them, including restrictions on bringing people with specialist subject knowledge (but not a specific formal teaching qualification) into the classroom.",
      "Badenoch told the Commons that the bill implies \"doctors are not sufficiently qualified to teach biology, that Olympic medallists can not teach PE\", and asked why the prime minister was closing routes into teaching.",
      "\"She knows that's not right,\" Sir Keir replied but added that it \"should not be extraordinary\" to suggest that teachers in schools should be qualified.",

      "Sir Keir said his government was committed to academies and repeated his attack on Conservative MPs for voting against a bill which included \"vital protections for children\".",
      "\"The bill benefits children who need the nourishment of a breakfast club, the bill benefits the families that can't afford uniforms, the bill benefits the children who are currently out of school and nobody knows where they are, the bill benefits the children who could be taken out of school by abusers if this bill doesn't go through.\"",
      "He said the opposition leader should \"change her mind\" and back the measures.",
      "The subject of academies is one where the Conservatives are united and keen to defend their record, with one shadow cabinet minister telling the BBC: \"It's one of the few clear success stories we have to tell.\"",
      "Academy schools were first introduced under Sir Tony Blair and enthusiastically expanded by the Conservatives when they came to power in 2010.",
      "So far only one Labour MP - Siobhain McDonagh - has publicly criticised the bill, however it is privately causing significant anxiety among Labour MPs, generally on the right of the party, who are proud of academies.",

      "The screen suddenly freezes. The car she's in is somewhere in the US and the reception has cut out.",
      "Young made her US TV debut on Jimmy Fallon's talk show the night before, which followed a whirlwind trip to Australia, and she'll soon set off on a sold-out European tour. She's talking on Zoom as her manager drives her to the next stop on her schedule.",

      "And she is now a proper pop star. After several years of almost making it - she sang on the 2021 John Lewis advert, was on the BBC Sound of 2022 list and had glowing reviews for her two albums - Messy has given her a bona fide hit.",
      "The song became inescapable at the end of 2024 and completed its climb to the top of the charts on Friday.",
      "The 24-year-old is the first current British artist to have a UK number one since Chase and Status and Stormzy in August, the youngest to do so since Dave in 2022, and the youngest British woman to score a chart-topper since Dua Lipa in 2017.",
      "Her number one came a day after she was nominated for best pop act at the Brit Awards.",
      "\"The response has been amazing and it's been really exciting to see all the love that Messy has been receiving,\" says Young after reconnecting the call.",
      "\"I love the song, it's a song I wrote that's really personal and really important to me. So I'm really happy that it's resonating so much.\"",
      "Messy was released on Young\u2019s second album This Wasn't Meant For You Anyway last May.",
      "Its trajectory was supercharged when superstar US influencers Sofia Richie Grainge and Jake Shane posted a 14-second TikTok clip of themselves dancing to its chorus. Young's song has now been used in 1.3 million videos on the platform - from Kylie Jenner lip-syncing as a dog, to a viral clip of an old woman vaping and holding a pint alongside the caption \"94 and still messy\".",
      "The singer would like to point out that the track's success is not simply down to TikTok, however.",
      "\"That's not necessarily how it blew up. I would like to say that the song was blowing up before TikTok, and it was having its moment elsewhere. A lot of things contributed to the success.",
      "\"The TikTok thing is great. I don't make music for TikTok. I make music for myself and for my fans, but the Sofia Richie thing is just one element of how well it did in every aspect.",
      "\"But yeah, it's been great to see every side of it.\"",
      "Contradictions",
      "The track was indeed starting to gain traction before finding TikTok virality, and has only done so well because it is more than a mere meme.",
      "Its lyrics, about never being good enough for someone whatever you do, have connected deeply with fans. \"I want to be me, is that not allowed?\" she implores.",
      "\"I guess it's because the song speaks to so many people in terms of, I'm talking about the idea that there's two sides of a person, the contradictions,\" Young says.",
      "The song captures how it is \"to basically feel like you're not enough for somebody and also in turn not enough for yourself\".",
      "Amid the craziness of success, there's some relief that she has now reached the next level in her career.",
      "\"I mean, I feel like it's the right time,\" the singer says. \"It's been a minute, but also it does feel like the right time for me.\"",
      "Young has also recently featured on Tyler, the Creator\u2019s well-received album Chromakopia.",
      "Grit and charisma",
      "When it was released, the Observer said Young\u2019s album had \"a winning combination of zingers and vulnerability\", and the Telegraph said it showed \"all of the grit and charisma of a seasoned artist\".",
      "Like Messy, many of her tracks are one-sided conversations - mainly with an unseen, unreasonable and unsuitable man (or woman).",
      "Other songs continue the theme of double-edged romance. Wish You Were Dead is about a relationship that veers between being affectionate and volatile; while in Big Brown Eyes, Young gets weak-kneed when a lukewarm love interest insults her.",
      "Unlike some artists, there's little need to ask Young what her songs are about - the stories are laid out in her raw and razor-sharp lyrics.",
      "But how real are the situations and scenarios about which she sings?",
      "\"Pretty real. As real as it gets, to be honest,\" she replies.",
      "\"I just write from my own experience and they're very real. They're all the things that I've been through, all situations I've had, and all experiences I've had.\"",
      "The honesty of her songwriting sets her apart from many other artists, but she says she knows no other way.",
      "\"I don't think about it. Music is the only place I can be dead honest,\" she says. \"Not that I'm a liar...",
      "\"But I feel like that's my outlet, the place I can be the most honest. I never really think about it. It doesn't feel like a difficult thing to do, or something that feels like I'm baring my soul or anything. It's just I've always done that in my music.\"",
      "The album ends with an equally candid spoken-word outro, in which she says the LP was written to help her accept and love herself, and to realise she doesn't need \"no ugly man (or woman)\".",
      "\"I haven't got there yet but I will,\" she says on the track.",
      "'Different angle' on Brat",
      "Young is managed by two men who separately worked with Amy Winehouse and Adele, and she has something in common with those two artists in her combination of fragility and front.",
      "To that, she adds the conversational tone of Lily Allen and the modern pop sensibility and chaotic energy of Charli XCX.",
      "Young's breakthrough coincided with the reign of Charli's Brat ethos, which she defined as \"a girl who is a little messy, likes to party, maybe says dumb things sometimes, feels herself, and has a breakdown but parties through it\".",
      "Young feels an affinity with that. \"I massively do, and I think it's that thing of empowered women who like to party and be themselves, and that's really important to me,\" she says.",
      "\"I guess I come from a different angle - of a less heightened version of that, I guess. It would be more like, 'I don't really give a [care], but I also really do'. That's what I guess I stand by a little bit more.\"",
      "Bratpop season will stretch further when Young releases her next album later this year. It is nearly finished and will \"dig deeper\" than the last, she says. How much deeper can she really dig?",
      "\"Quite a lot,\" she says. \"There's quite a lot more to say. There's a lot of other topics and things that have happened to me, and things that I've gone through that I want to discuss with people.",
      "\"But also things that are a little bit less about love, and about other things that I've gone through.\"",
      "Now that Messy's cleaned up, we can expect to see more of Young, and her shiny teeth."

    "published": "Sat, 25 Jan 2025 01:46:13 GMT",
    "summary": "The rapper could face up to 24 years in prison if convicted in the Hollywood shooting case.",
    "story": [
      "A$AP Rocky's assault trial began on Friday in Los Angeles, where the rapper is accused of firing a gun at a former friend.",
      "The rapper, whose real name is Rakim Mayers, faces up to 24 years in prison if convicted on two felony assault charges in the 2021 incident near a Hollywood hotel.",
      "In opening statements on Friday, prosecutors described the rapper as the aggressor and claimed he orchestrated a plan to shoot his childhood friend following a disagreement.",
      "The Grammy-nominated hip-hop star, who is also a fashion mogul and the longtime partner of singer Rihanna, has pleaded not guilty and denied the allegations.",
      "The victim, fellow artist and childhood friend Terell Ephron, testified last year that bullets grazed his knuckles when the rapper opened fire in his direction in Hollywood, just one block from the iconic Hollywood Walk of Fame. He said he decided to seek medical treatment at a hospital after flying back to New York.",
      "Authorities say the shooting happened on 6 November in 2021 after a \"heated discussion\" in Hollywood between the rapper and Terell Ephron, who were both part of the A$AP Mob hip-hop collective and have known one another since their time together at a New York high school.",
      "A jury of seven women and five men was selected over the course of three days this week before the opening arguments kicked off on Friday.",
      "Mr Mayers, attending the trial in a grey suit, was joined by some members of his family on Friday, but notably absent was singer Rihanna, who he shares two children with. It's unclear whether she might appear at the trial, but the rapper's attorney told the court this week that Mr Mayers has tried to keep his family away from all of this.",
      "Deputy District Attorney Paul Przelomiec opened the trial on Friday with a detailed presentation of video evidence, describing the case against the rapper as straightforward. \"What will become almost instantly clear is that this is not a complicated case,\" he told the jury.",
      "Mr Mayers, along with two friends and Mr Ephron, met up to talk after they had a disagreement the night before. But the meeting turned violent.",
      "The first video, which was partially obscured, showed a confrontation between two men, with two others stepping in to intervene. One man, identified as Mr Mayers, is seen pulling a gun but not firing. Additional footage from later that night captures two gunshots during a scuffle involving the same group.",
      "\"If you brought a gun, then you should shoot,\" Mr Ephron reportedly told Mr Mayers, according to Przelomiec. Moments later, Mr Mayers is accused of opening fire, allegedly grazing Ephron's knuckle.",
      "\"In his state of mind, he never believed he was going to be shot,\" Przelomiec told the court.",
      "Prosecutors also showed the jury text messages exchanged shortly after the incident between the pair, where Mr Ephron accuses the rap star of trying to kill him.",
      "\"U try killing me,\" he wrote.",
      "Mr. Mayers responded, \"wtf iz ut talking about.\"",
      "The rapper rejected a plea offer ahead of the trial and said the weapon he was accused of firing was a \"prop gun\" incapable of firing real ammunition. The AP news agency reported that this would have meant agreeing to 180 days in prison.",
      "Defence attorney Joe Tacopina on Friday said the gun was a starter pistol used as a prop, something the rapper's security guards advised him to carry to fend off potential attackers. The rapper had been victim of crimes in the past, he said.",
      "Mr Tacopina painted the case as bitter falling out between friends that was wrapped up in money.",
      "\"This case is about one man's jealousy, which lies in green,\" he told the jury. \"This case is all about money, a clear attempt at extortion. Period, end of story.\"",
      "A key point of contention in the case is the police investigation and Mr Ephron's injuries. The rapper's attorneys have focused - and did on Friday - on Mr Ephron taking multiple days to report the incident to police and how authorities found no trace of a shooting.",
      "Authorities who responded to the 2021 shooting did not find any bullet shell casings when surveying the area, but Mr Ephron returned to the scene later and gathered two shell casings he said he found in the area. He brought them when he reported the incident two days later.",
      "The defence said the trial's outcome hinges on Mr Ephron's testimony, noting, \"He's the witness that this case will rise and fall on\".",
      "The trial is expected to last about three weeks, with Mr Ephron expected to take the stand as a key witness.",
      "The trial is happening at a crucial moment for A$AP Rocky's career.",
      "In May, he is set to co-chair the 2025 Met Gala alongside big names like Anna Wintour, British race car driver Lewis Hamilton, singer Pharrell Williams and basketball superstar LeBron James.",
      "Later this summer, he is also set to appear in a film directed by Spike Lee called \"Highest 2 Lowest\" with acting legend Denzel Washington.",
      "The star was previously given a two-year suspended sentence for his role in a brawl in Stockholm in August 2019.",
      "The rapper and two members of his entourage were convicted of kicking and beating a 19-year-old man after an argument. They said they acted in self-defence, but the court rejected their argument.",
      "The case drew worldwide media attention after US president Donald Trump unsuccessfully tried to secure Mr Mayers's release from prison as he awaited trial.",
      "Born in New York, Mr Mayers was one of the biggest break-out stars of the 2010s, earning eight platinum singles in the US including Wild For The Night, Everyday, LSD and A$AP Forever.",

      "The relationships in the film might be intimate and personal, but they're set against a backdrop that is in so many ways epic - not least its running time. It clocks in at over three-and-a-half hours - something that might put off some moviegoers.",
      "But director Brady Corbet believes The Brutalist's length really shouldn't deter audiences.",
      "\"For me, I think that the length of a movie is similar to the length of a book, a double album, a painting with a big canvas.",
      "\"I love small portraits and I love Anselm Kiefer (a German artist known for his large-scale installations). There's a space for both of them, you know. And at the end of the day, especially because the film has an intermission, it's only 100 minutes on each side, so it's not so bad.\"",

      "\"I spend most of my life foraging through scripts, trying to find decent characters to play. That's a huge part of it,\" she explains.",
      "\"I have to find someone who has some kind of spunk, or has some fight in them. Some sense of defiance is so key, so when I read the script it was an absolute no-brainer.",
      "\"I thought this woman is tremendous. But... they are few and far between, for sure. When you get something like this, you just grab it with both hands.\"",
      "In the film, T\u00f3th is hired by rich industrialist Harrison Lee Van Buren to design and build a vast project as a tribute to his late mother. Van Buren, played by Guy Pearce, is a man who is in awe of the architect's talent. A useful parallel, then, for the actor.",
      "\"I suppose so,\" admits the Australian. \"I really admire Adrien and his work. I think he's an extraordinary actor.",
      "\"It was really interesting the way Adrien played his role. He plays a man who has almost more sense of self than Van Buren does, which was a great thing for me to work off because I think Van Buren, even though he admires L\u00e1szl\u00f3, he probably is patronising of him.",
      "\"He probably expects him to be more subservient than he is, so it was a great dynamic between the two of us.\"",
      "On Thursday, the film was nominated for 10 Oscars, including a best-actor nomination for Brody. Even before the Academy Awards shortlists were announced, Brody said how thankful he was for the reception the film had received from awards bodies.",

    "summary": "The song, recorded for inclusion on Turner's hit album Private Dancer, was recently uncovered.",
    "story": [
      "A song recorded for Tina Turner's blockbuster album Private Dancer, that was presumed lost, has been rediscovered and received its first play on BBC Radio 2.",
      "Hot For You, Baby, was cut at Capitol Studios in Hollywood and originally intended to be an album track.",
      "But it was ultimately jettisoned in favour of era-defining pop hits such What's Love Got To Do With It, Better Be Good To Me and the album's title track.",
      "Presumed missing, the master tape was recently rediscovered as her record label compiled a 40th anniversary re-release of Private Dancer.",
      "An up-tempo rocker, full of showboating guitar chords and an extremely 1980s cowbell, Hot For You, Baby is a prime example of Turner's raspy, physical style of soul.",
      "The track was played on the Radio 2 Breakfast Show on Thursday, at 08:50 GMT.",
      "Produced by John Grant, the record executive who masterminded her mid-career comeback, it was written by Australian musicians George Young and Harry Vanda.",
      "It had already been recorded once by Scottish-Australian singer John Paul Young, the voice behind disco classic Love Is In The Air.",
      "However, his version largely flew under the radar when it was released in 1979.",
      "Private Dancer, released in May 1984, launched an unprecedented second act in Tina Turner's career.",
      "She had escaped an abusive marriage to musician Ike Turner at the end of the 1970s, but the divorce left her penniless, living off food stamps and playing ill-conceived cabaret shows to pay her debts.",
      "The music industry had largely written her off - but in England, where pop was in thrall to American R&B, she still had some heavyweight fans.",
      "In 1981, Rod Stewart invited Turner to play with him on Saturday Night Live; and the Rolling Stones asked her to be part of their US tour. More importantly, perhaps, David Bowie told Capitol Records that Turner was his favourite singer.",
      "A landmark album",
      "But the turning point came when she hooked up with British producers Martyn Ware and Ian Craig Marsh, of the band Heaven 17, to record a synth-pop version of  the Temptations' 1970 hit Ball of Confusion.",
      "A huge hit in Europe, its success persuaded Capitol to let her record an album, but they hardly threw their weight behind it.",
      "The budget only paid for two weeks in the studio, and many of the songs Turner recorded were other artists' cast-offs (both Cliff Richard and Bucks Fizz had turned down What's Love Got To Do With It).",
      "But she used her time wisely - recording all but one of Private Dancer's songs in the UK with five different British production teams.",
      "With the country in the grips of new wave and the new romantics, Turner was steered away from raw, fiery soul that first made her famous. But somehow, her electrifying vocals were a perfect fit for the chilly, programmed grooves she was given.",
      "\"Turner seems to completely understand the touch that each of these songs needed,\" wrote Debby Miller, in a contemporaneous review of Private Dancer for Rolling Stone magazine.",
      "In the New York Times, Stephen Holden described the record as \"a landmark, not only in the career of the 45-year-old singer, who has been recording since the late 1950s, but in the evolution of pop-soul music itself\".",

      "The album went on to sell more than 10 million copies, and earned three Grammys, including record of the year for What's Love Got To Do With It.",
      "Turner also performed the song on the live TV broadcast, wowing audiences with her vocals despite fighting a bad case of the flu.",
      "A support slot on Lionel Richie's US tour in 1984 reminded audiences of her ability to tear the roof off any venue she set foot in.",
      "By 1985, Turner was one of the world's biggest acts in an era of stadium superstars like Michael Jackson, Madonna and Prince.",
      "The decision to withhold Hot For You, Baby from the original tracklist of Private Dancer makes sense. It sounds a little cheesy next to the sultry, sophisticated material that eventually populated the record.",
      "But fans will welcome the chance to hear Turner let rip, back in her prime, with a promise to \"love you all night long\".",
      "Mark Goodier, who is currently covering the Radio 2 breakfast show, said: \"To have something new to hear from Tina Turner is a treat for fans of all generations and a reminder of her unique talent.",
      "\"I'm lucky enough to have both interviewed Tina and seen her perform live. She was an outrageously good performer and at the same time a remarkable graceful lady, whose every note was shaped by her incredible life.\"",
      "As well as being released as a single, the track will feature on a new five-disc deluxe edition of Private Dancer, which is due for release in March.",
      "The collection will also feature B-sides, remixes and live tracks, as well as a film of Turner playing Birmingham's NEC Arena in March 1985, featuring guest appearances by David Bowie and Bryan Adams.",
      "Turner died in 2023 at the age of 83. No cause of death was given, but she was known to be struggling with a kidney disease, intestinal cancer and other illnesses."

    "summary": "As the dust settles on the prince's epic legal battle with The Sun, who has come out on top, and what happens now?",
    "story": [
      "Did the hero Prince slay the tabloid dragon? Or to quote one of its most memorable headlines, was it The Sun Wot Won It?",
      "The dust is still settling on the settlement of Prince Harry's epic legal battle against News Group Newspapers.",
      "Had the trial gone ahead, Prince Harry would have alleged he had been the victim of unlawful newsgathering by NGN journalists between 1996 and 2011 - and that its leaders covered up wrongdoing by destroying evidence - something that the company denied. But the eight-week trial didn't happen because the two sides suddenly settled.",
      "He's scored an apology for intrusion by The Sun, including NGN accepting that there was unlawful information gathering by private investigators working for the newspaper.",
      "NGN has not admitted unlawful activity by journalists or editors - and the settlement means a judge won't now have to decide if there was, as the Duke's team alleges, a corporate cover-up of wrongdoing - a claim NGN vehemently denied and said it would fight at trial.",
      "The space between those positions, in which both sides will feel they won something, is now the battleground.",
      "The question is how far, realistically, can a campaign around historical events go? Is this week a reboot of investigations or, in fact, the final chapter?",
      "The main focus of pressure and lobbying will be the police - because campaigners believe Scotland Yard didn't go far enough in its previous investigations, missing opportunities to widen its focus beyond wrongdoing at The News of the World.",
      "'Dossier' being prepared",
      "Speaking to the BBC on Friday, actor Hugh Grant - who said the financial risks forced him to settle, with The Sun's owners last year - said the police's job was not done \"by any means\" - and suing the newspapers was never going to get at the full truth.",
      "So all eyes will be on Lord Tom Watson, the former Labour deputy leader, who NGN admits was placed under surveillance by News of the World journalists in 2009.",
      "The last remaining claimant alongside Prince Harry, he says a dossier will go to the Metropolitan Police.",
      "The Met for its part says there is no active criminal investigation into alleged newspaper wrongdoing.",
      "That statement also means there's no current probe into the separate Mirror Group titles, despite a judge ruling in 2023 that they had used phone hacking to get information on Prince Harry.",
      "So why no investigation?",
      "The police aren't ruling one out, but Sir Mark Rowley, the Met's commissioner, told LBC radio on Friday that they would need to see something \"radically new\".",
      "And that's because Scotland Yard takes the view that it carried out a huge investigation 10 years ago.",
      "Team Harry believe this is profoundly myopic. While some of their planned evidence for the NGN trial had come from the police, his lawyers also obtained new documents from NGN itself under rules for a fair trial.",
      "Could that be new evidence? Let's take the example of the records of the myriad of payments to private investigators.",
      "Team Harry and Watson would have sought to prove at a trial that many were for unlawful activity. On one level you can see that would arguably fit a test of something radically new.",
      "But, in its defence, News Group would have argued that none of this proved journalists or anyone else at the Sun knew information was being unlawfully gathered - far short of a whiff of a criminal enterprise.",
      "The full apology to Prince Harry from Sun owner",
      "Hugh Grant urges police to investigate Sun owners",
      "What this single episode we had been expecting to see at the trial shows is how each allegation against NGN would have been fought rather than conceded. And if the police knock on the company's door with its truncheon, they are likely to face a similarly robust response.",
      "And that's why the thrust of Lord Watson's promised dossier to the police will become important. It will have to say something really big. And in the absence of a court finding - that challenge becomes larger still.",
      "Other bodies could in theory act. Parliament's Culture, Media and Sport Select Committee investigated phone-hacking allegations in 2011. It's likely to face calls to review the evidence of NGN CEO Rebekah Brooks and others - evidence that NGN will stand by because there's been no finding in court of unlawful activity by journalists, editors or executives.",
      "There's also the Information Commissioner's Office. It had a role in the origins of this story, investigating privacy and data breaches by private investigators. The ICO says it has no plans to reopen or review this investigation.",
      "The government has already ruled out launching \"Leveson 2\", the second leg of the public inquiry promised by David Cameron. It was meant to investigate \"unlawful or improper conduct\" across tabloids and whether the police, put simply, had turned a blind eye to it because they had been corrupted by getting too close to journalists who may have been paying them off. But it never happened.",
      "Labour in government won't revisit it because too much time has passed."

    "published": "Thu, 23 Jan 2025 00:06:50 GMT",
    "summary": "Ukrainian stand-up comedians say humour can help people cope and raise money for the war effort.",
    "story": [
      "On 14 October 2023, an unusual event was held in Ukraine's most prestigious venue, Palace Ukraine in Kyiv.",
      "Anton Tymoshenko became the first Ukrainian stand-up comedian to give a solo performance there.",
      "\"I grew up in a village with fewer people than Palace Ukraine can hold,\" he said after the concert. \"So many people had told me: It's not going to happen... stand-up comedy has not reached that level.\"",
      "It has now, to a large extent because of the full-scale invasion launched by Russia.",
      "The invasion turned many Ukrainians away from the previously popular and lavishly promoted Russian acts and triggered a renewed interest in Ukrainian culture.",
      "Key Ukrainian comedians say they are now making jokes to help the public deal with the grim reality of war and also help the army by raising funds.",
      "\"Stand-up comedy is a budget version of psychotherapy,\" Anton Tymoshenko tells the BBC.",
      "\"I like to relieve social tension with my jokes. When that happens, that's the best thing.\"",
      "Another popular performer, Nastya Zukhvala, says Russia's full-scale invasion in February gave stand-up comedy in Ukraine \"a boost,\" albeit for darker reasons.",
      "\"The demand for comedy looks totally natural to me now because comedy supports and unites.",
      "\"It can also make reality look less catastrophic. It is a tool which can help us process this stream of depressing information,\" she tells me.",
      "\"To stay optimistic or even sane, we've got no other choice.\"",
      "So what are the jokes that are making Ukrainians laugh?",
      "This kind of humour is grim, says comedian Hanna Kochehura, but making fun of the danger makes it easier to cope with.",
      "\"It looks even darker from abroad, and it's clear why. Anyone who's in Ukraine knows that there are no safe places here,\" she says.",
      "\"You never know if this air raid is going to be your last. You don't know if a Shahed drone is going to target your house or your family's house.",
      "\"Naturally, all our themes are related to the war. Because it's our life now. Stand-up comedy is a frank genre where comedians speak about their own experiences or thoughts,\" Ms Kochehura says.",
      "Here's an example - a joke from Anton Tymoshenko's performance at Palace Ukraine:",
      "\"I never worried about a nuclear attack because I know it would mean death for rich residents of Kyiv. I live on the outskirts - but the nukes will hit central parts. Before fallout reaches me, it will have to make two changes on the metro.",

    "story": [
      "When Teddy Swims turned up to the  MTV Awards last September, he was nominated for four prizes, including best new artist.",
      "In the event, the combined forces of Chappell Roan and Sabrina Carpenter denied him a single Moon Man trophy \u2013 but the singer left with something much more valuable.",
      "\"I didn't realise until a couple of weeks later, but my partner and I conceived that night,\" he beams.",
      "\"We're due in June and things are great. I think we're gonna crush it.\"",
      "Domestic bliss isn't a quality that fans might associate with Teddy Swims.",
      "His huge breakthrough single Lose Control, and the hit album I've Tried Everything But Therapy, were rooted in dysfunction, addiction and heartbreak.",
      "They were inspired by a toxic, mutually destructive relationship from which he had escaped. In the past, he has described it as a \"really co-dependent lifestyle\" that went from \"bender to bender\" as both sides \"leveraged each other's shame against one another\".",
      "As he sings on a recent single, \"I saved my life when I showed you the door\".",
      "But that was only one chapter in the story of the 32-year-old Georgia native Jaten Dimsdale.",
      "This Friday, he releases a second album, I've Tried Everything But Therapy Part 2, that explains what happened next.",
      "\"I've learned that love doesn't have to be this thing of high highs and low lows \u2013 fighting and pulling teeth just to stay together,\" he says.",
      "\"The first album was a lot of turmoil, and not too much closure. So I wanted to come back and say, 'Here's me on the other side of this, and I'm doing better'.",
      "\"I feel like, as a listener, I would want to hear that there's a way out.\"",
      "His new partner is also a singer-songwriter, Raiche Wright, who he met \"a couple of Thanksgivings ago\" when she came to one of his shows - and the new album dwells in a sort of bewildered bliss.",
      "\"Are you something from a dream or something that I made up?\" he wonders on the slick R&B groove of Are You Real.",
      "Later, on the acoustic guitar ballad If You Ever Change Your Mind, he croons, \"I love you, I love you,\" with a quiet sincerity rarely found in a pop record.",
      "Musically, the album paints from the same palette as before \u2013 a brand of 1960s soul where dusty piano grooves and chugging guitar lines are punched up with a modern pop sheen, and a pinch of rock and roll swagger.",
      "But it's not all hearts and flowers. The sumptuous soul of Black And White makes a plea for tolerance, inspired by the prejudice Dimsdale and his partner \u2013 who has mixed black and white heritage \u2013 have faced.",
      "\"I see people looking disgusted because we're different colours \u2013 especially down South,\" he says.",
      "\"But it's okay to be happy in love with someone of a different colour, or a different size or shape, or the same sex, or whatever it is.",
      "\"Why would you be hating on that? It's such a backwards thing.\"",
      "Dimsdale learned about acceptance the hard way. Born in Conyers, an eastern suburb of Atlanta, his grandfather was a Pentecostal preacher with set views on the world, and family life was hard to navigate.",
      "His parents divorced when he was three and, although both remarried, their new relationships were problematic. His mother, with whom he lived, married an alcoholic who left suddenly when Dinsdale was 18 and never spoke to the family again.",
      "His father, who he saw at weekends, married a woman who developed serious mental health problems, including schizophrenia, and spent long stretches in hospital. His dad ended up raising Dimsdale's step-brothers almost single-handedly.",
      "\"He'd work 18 hours a day, and still get the homework done and still get to the practices, all by himself,\" he says.",
      "\"There's just not enough I can say about how amazing that man truly is.\"",
      "Dimsdale was a late bloomer when it came to music. As a youngster, he was a dedicated footballer, until a friend convinced him to audition for a school production of Damn Yankees.",
      "The musical sparked a love affair with singing. He researched vocal techniques on YouTube, soaking in performances by Stevie Wonder, Michael Jackson and Aretha Franklin.",
      "After graduation, he started playing with local metal bands, adopting the stage name \"Swims\" from internet forum-speak for Someone Who Isn't Me Sometimes. Teddy, meanwhile, is a childhood nickname, based on his affable and cuddly persona.",
      "Old-fashioned success",
      "But it was a cover of Shania Twain's country ballad You're Still The One that earned him his big break.",
      "On YouTube, it's been watched 197 million times. One of those viewers was a talent scout for Warner Bros records, who signed Dimsdale to a record deal on Christmas Eve 2019.",
      "They partnered the musician with professional writers like Julian Bunetta (Sabrina Carpenter, One Direction) and Mikky Ekko (Rihanna, Drake) \u2013 but he also retained his high school band, Freak Feely, who play with him to this day.",
      "After three EPs, and hundreds of sessions, they wrote Lose Control, and Dinsdale instantly \"knew it was going to change my life\".",
      "He was right. With 2.2 billion global streams, it is one of the most successful songs in recent chart history - but finding an audience took time.",
      "There was no viral moment or TikTok trend associated with Lose Control. Instead, Dimsdale \"did it the old-fashioned way\".",
      "\"We showed up and did every damn interview possible,\" he says. \"We went to every office and radio station and shook every hand individually. We stopped everyone on the street, busking.\"",
      "He believes the personal touch beats everything, hands down.",
      "\"People love to see their friend win, so if you go out there and make time for them, it goes a lot further than a playlist coming across your desk, or a little file coming to your email that says, 'Hey, can you push this song?'",
      "\"And that's the old way you work a record, before streaming.\"",
      "Bashfully, he confesses the song made him a millionaire (\"so I can't be too mad at that girl any more, can I?\") but he's learning that making money means spending money.",
      "\"A million dollars goes so fast,\" he says. \"Once you put 66 people on a tour, with all the gear and all the lights, it's right out the door as fast as you get it.",
      "\"Twenty bucks still means what 20 bucks meant to me before, but the amount coming in and out is such a scary thing to look at sometimes.\"",
      "As we speak, he's in rehearsals in Pennsylvania, ahead of his first European arena tour, which includes two nights at Wembley this March.",
      "The stage has just been built for the first time, and he's eager to acquaint himself with all the ramps and video walls. The music\u2026 not so much.",
      "\"I wouldn't say I'm already sick of the songs, but we've been playing them non-stop for two weeks now,\" he says. \"I can't wait 'til people sing along, so I can fall in love with them again.\"",
      "If you've been to a Teddy Swims show, you'll know he lays his heart on the line.",
      "There are countless videos of him sobbing as he performs Some Things I'll Never Know, a song about abandonment and grief. For the upcoming tour, he's playing it back-to-back with a new tear-jerker, Northern Lights, that dives even deeper into heartbreak.",
      "He's going to be a mess - but Dimsdale insists it's a good thing.",
      "\"Every day I try to cry a little bit,\" he says. \"It's just pain leaving the body.",
      "\"And it's a constant reminder that, whatever you were going through, on the other side of it there's happiness.\"",
      "With his bearded and tattooed face, you might not expect such emotional intelligence \u2013 but Dimsdale's model of masculinity wasn't afraid to share his feelings.",
      "\"I'm my daddy's son,\" he says. \"He's just a sensitive man. He'll tell you he loves you, he'll tell you he's proud of you. Man, I'll still sit there, laying in his arms while we're watching TV on the couch.\"",
      "\"He's the most beautiful, humble human being I've ever met. Second to only Jesus Christ.\"",
      "So, the obvious question: Is dad excited to become a grandfather?",
      "\"He's doing backflips,\" laughs the singer.",
      "\"I'm almost scared to have him as a granddad, because I want my kids to think I'm cool, too.\""

    "summary": "The settlement between the prince and the Sun's publisher is a dramatic, high stakes, turnaround.",
    "story": [
      "The settlement between Prince Harry and News Group Newspapers is a dramatic, high stakes, turnaround. But it's courtroom drama without the court.",
      "Prince Harry's team hailed the deal that stopped the trial as a \"monumental victory\", receiving an undisclosed amount of \"substantial damages\" and an \"unequivocal apology\".",
      "They say he's been vindicated - but will there also, deep down, be some mixed feelings about not getting his day in court? Was this really \"slaying dragons\" of the tabloid press, as he'd celebrated after a previous win when he'd given evidence in court against Mirror Group Newspapers?",
      "Co-claimant Lord Tom Watson paid tribute to Prince Harry's tenacity in pursuing this case for so long, praising his \"bravery and astonishing courage\".",
      "While on the opposing side of the scrapped case, NGN says the agreement \"draws a line under the past\" and they reject the claims that would have been made in court about a corporate cover-up.",
      "When NGN has spent \u00a31bn on previous claims, they might think any extra spent on staying out of court was a win for them too.",
      "Why did Prince Harry strike a deal now?",
      "It seems a change from Prince Harry being adamant that this was about \"accountability\".",
      "\"The goal is accountability. It's really that simple,\" Prince Harry told a media event in New York last month, about why he was taking on the Murdoch press.",
      "\"The scale of the cover up is so large that people need to see it for themselves,\" he said.",
      "He was fully aware of the financial risks built into such civil disputes, but seemed determined to press on, not just for himself but for 1,300 claimants who he said had settled but had \"no justice\".",
      "\"Accountability\" was mentioned again in a statement read out on behalf of Prince Harry and Lord Watson.",
      "\"The time for accountability has arrived,\" but it meant in terms of calling on Parliament and the police to pursue what they called the \"unlawful activity now finally admitted\" and \"the perjury and cover ups along the way\".",
      "There was a similar call for a follow-up when Prince Harry won against the Mirror group newspapers, but there has been no imminent sign of action.",
      "Perhaps it shouldn't have been a surprise that there was a deal.",
      "There has always been immense pressure for a settlement, because the curve of civil law bends so strongly in that direction.",
      "Even if a claimant wins a case, they could end up paying the costs of their opponents, if the damages award is less than they have been offered.",
      "The legal costs and damages at stake in this case could have been \u00a310m. That's a big poker hand decision for anyone. Plus the unknown jeopardy of what might happen in the court case and what questions Harry might have faced on the witness stand. He might have had his case ruled out of time or had his claims rejected.",
      "The psychological cards would all have been stacked towards doing a deal. Does everyone have a price? Even when they're seen as the last man standing?",
      "In terms of the amount of damages paid to Prince Harry, or what he might do with the money, that hasn't been made public.",
      "But what Prince Harry's team have seized upon is the skyscraper scale of the apology - seeing it as a \"collapse\" of the NGN's denials.",
      "They might argue that even if he had fought the court battle and won, there wouldn't be any more to be gained.",
      "This has always been a very personal battle for Prince Harry, the battle with the tabloids touching on his childhood as well as his adult life. So it's significant that the apology includes an admission of a \"serious intrusion\" into the \"private life of Diana, Princess of Wales\".",
      "That could mean more to him than any financial deal.",
      "Prince Harry's team also repeated the claim that \"the Sun, the flagship title for Rupert Murdoch's UK media empire, has indeed engaged in illegal practices\".",
      "This references the apology's mention of \"unlawful activities carried out by private investigators working for the Sun\".",
      "NGN's statement emphasises that this applies to the activities of external private investigators, \"not by journalists\" on the Sun.",
      "But it narrows some of the fastidious distancing that there's been between what had happened at the shut down News of the World and the Sun.",
      "While the statement from Prince Harry's team lambasts those presiding over a \"toxic culture\" in parts of the media, past and present, and repeats its claim about a corporate cover-up, these are attack lines from a court case that will now never happen.",
      "NGN rejects the claims of a cover-up and the destruction of evidence. But the overall tone of the response is relief at the end of arguments over old battles, and that this now draws a line under all these disputes over front pages from decades ago.",
      "\"Indeed the judge made it clear in remarks in court at the end of the hearing that these cases are likely to be the last liable to go to trial,\" said NGN.",
      "The bombshell case that was going to see Prince Harry giving evidence against his tabloid tormentors is over before it began. Who, in the end, will be more pleased about that?",
      "Why did Harry and Meghan leave the Royal Family?"

      "Her debut album, released to little fanfare in 2023, has just topped the UK charts for a second time. Next week, she's up for six Grammy awards, including best new artist. And BBC Radio 1 have named her their Sound Of 2025.",

      "The 26-year-old is the first female pop star to achieve mainstream success as an openly queer person, rather than coming out as part of their post-fame narrative.",
      "On a more personal level, she's finally got the financial security to move into a house of her own, and acquire a rescue cat, named Cherub Lou.",
      "\"She's super tiny, her breath smells so bad, and she doesn't have a meow,\" the singer dotes.",
      "If kitten ownership is a benefit of fame, Roan has bristled at the downsides.",
      "She has spoken out against abusive fans, calling out \"creepy behaviour\" from people who harass her in airport queues and \"stalk\" her parents' home. Last September, she went viral for cussing a photographer who'd been shouting abuse at stars on the red carpet of the MTV Awards.",
      "\"I was looking around, and I was like, 'This is what people are OK with all the time? And I'm supposed to act normal? This is not normal. This is crazy',\" she recalls.",
      "The incident made headlines. British tabloids called her outburst the \"tantrum\" of a \"spoiled diva\".",
      "But Roan is unapologetic.",
      "\"I've been responding that way to disrespect my whole life - but now there are cameras on me, and I also happen to be a pop star, and those things don't match. It's like oil and water.\"",
      "Roan says musicians are trained to be obedient. Standing up for yourself is portrayed as whining or ingratitude, and rejecting convention comes at a cost.",
      "\"I think, actually, I'd be more successful if I was OK wearing a muzzle,\" she laughs.",
      "\"If I were to override more of my basic instincts, where my heart is going, 'Stop, stop, stop, you're not OK', I would be bigger.",
      "\"I would be way bigger... And I would still be on tour right now.\"",
      "Indeed, Roan rejected the pressure of extending her 2024 tour to protect her physical and mental health. She credits that resolve to her late grandfather.",
      "\"There's something he said that I think about in every move I make with my career. There are always options.\"",
      "\"So when someone says, 'Do this concert because you'll never get offered that much money ever again', it's like, who cares?",
      "\"If I don't feel like doing this right now, there are always options. There is not a scarcity of opportunity. I think about that all the time.\"",
      "As fans will know by now, Roan was born Kayleigh Rose Amstutz and raised in the Bible Belt town of Willard, Missouri.",
      "The oldest of four children, she aspired to be an actress \u2013 but, for a long time, it seemed her future would be in sport. She ran at state-competition level, and almost went to college for cross-country.",
      "Then she entered a singing contest at the age of 13 and won. Before long, she'd written her first song, about a crush on a Mormon boy who wasn't allowed to date outside his faith.",
      "She took her stage name as a tribute to her grandfather Dennis K Chappell and his favourite song, a Western ballad called The Strawberry Roan.",
      "\"He was very funny and very smart,\" she recalls. \"And I don't think he ever questioned my ability.",
      "\"A lot of people were like, 'You should go completely country', or, 'You should try Christian music'. And he never told me to do anything.",
      "\"He was the only person that was like, 'You don't need a plan B. Just do it'.\"",
      "Drag queen heaven",
      "Eventually, one of her compositions, a gothic ballad called Die Young, caught the attention of Atlantic Records, which signed her at the age of just 17.",
      "Moving to LA, she recorded and released her first EP, School Nights, in 2017. It was a solid but unremarkable affair, steeped in the sounds of Lana Del Rey and Lorde.",
      "Roan only found a sound of her own when a group of gay friends took her to a drag bar.",
      "\"I walked into that club in West Hollywood and it was like heaven,\" she told the BBC last year. \"It was amazing to see all these people who were happy and confident in their bodies.",
      "\"And the go-go dancers! I was enthralled. I couldn't stop watching them. I was like, 'I have to do that'.\"",
      "She didn't become a dancer, but she did write a song imagining what it would be like to be one and how her mother would react. Roan called it Pink Pony Club after a strip bar in her home town.",
      "\"That song changed everything,\" she says. \"It put me in a new category.",
      "\"I never thought I could actually be a 'pop star girl' and Pink Pony forced me into that.\"",
      "Her label disagreed. They refused to release Pink Pony Club for two years. Shortly after they relented, Roan was dropped in a round of pandemic-era cost-cutting.",
      "Bruised but not broken, she went back home and spent the next year serving coffee in a drive-through doughnut shop.",
      "\"It absolutely had a positive impact on me,\" she says. \"You have the knowledge of what it's like to clean a public restroom. That's very important.\"",
      "The period was transformational in other ways. She saved her earnings, had her heart broken by a person \"with pale blue eyes\", moved back to Los Angeles, and gave herself a year to make it.",
      "It might have taken a little longer than that, but she hit the ground running.",
      "During her exile, Roan had stayed in touch with her Pink Pony Club co-writer, Daniel Nigro.",
      "He was also working with another up-and-coming singer called Olivia Rodrigo and, when her career took off, Roan got a courtside seat, supporting Rodrigo on tour and providing backing vocals on her second album, Guts.",
      "More importantly, Nigro used the momentum to sign Roan to his own record label and ensure the release of her debut album in September 2023.",
      "At first, it seemed like Roan's original label had been right. Sales were disappointing and audiences were slow to catch on because her in-your-face queer anthems were out of step with the trend for whispery, confessional pop.",
      "But those songs came to life on stage. Big, fun and designed for audience participation, they're taken to new heights by Roan's powerhouse voice and flamboyant stage persona.",
      "\"A drag queen does not get on stage to calm people down,\" she says. \"A drag queen does not say things to flatter people. A queen makes you blush, you know what I mean? Expect the same energy at my show.\"",
      "Sure enough, it was a live-streamed appearance at last year's Coachella Festival that pushed her into the upper echelons of pop.",
      "Dressed in a PVC crop top that declared \"Eat Me\", she played the packed Gobi tent like a headliner, strutting purposefully across the stage and coaching the audience in the campy choreography for Hot To Go.",
      "Then she stared directly into the camera and dedicated a song to her ex.",
      "\"Bitch I know you're watching\u2026 and all those horrible things happening to you are karma.\"",
      "The clip went viral and, before long, her career did, too.",
      "By the summer, all of her shows had been upgraded. Festivals kept having to move her to bigger stages. When she played Lollapalooza in August, she drew the event's biggest ever daytime crowd.",
      "\"It just takes a decade,\" she says. \"That's what I tell everyone. 'If you're OK with it taking 10 years, then you're good'.\"",
      "As fans discovered her debut album, Roan also released a standalone single - a sarcastic slice of synth-pop called Good Luck Babe, which became her breakout hit.",
      "\"I don't even know if I've ever said this in an interview, but it was originally called Good Luck, Jane,\" she reveals.",
      "\"I wanted it to be about me falling in love with my best friend, and then her being like, 'Ha ha ha, I don't like you back, I like boys.'",
      "\"And it was like, 'OK, well, good luck with that, Jane'.\"",
      "A masterclass in pop storytelling, Good Luck Babe has a proper three-act structure, with a killer pay-off in the middle eight and a chorus you just can't shake.",
      "Still, Roan was shocked by its success.",
      "\"I just threw it out, like, I don't know what this is going to do \u2013 and it carried the whole year!\"",
      "The question, of course, is what the star does next, now that she's the Sound of 2025.",
      "She's already previewed two new songs, The Subway and The Giver, in concert \u2013 but all she will reveal about a second album is that she's \"more reluctant to be sad or dark\".",
      "\"It feels so good to party,\" she explains.",
      "Looking back at the last 12 months, she's philosophical about what it means to be pop's hottest new commodity.",
      "\"A lot of people think fame is the pinnacle of success, because what more could you possibly want than adoration?\"",
      "Roan does admit that the admiration of strangers is more \"addictive\" than she'd expected.",
      "\"Like, I understand why I'm so scared to lose this feeling.",
      "\"It's so scary to think that one day people will not care about you the same way as they do right now - and I think [that idea] lives in women's brains a lot different than men's.\"",
      "Ultimately, she decides, success and failure are \"out of my control\". Instead, she wants to make good choices.",
      "\"If I can look back and say, 'I did not crumble under the weight of expectation, and I did not stand for being abused or blackmailed', [then] at least I stayed true to my heart,\" she says.",
      "\"Like I said before, there are always options.\"",

      "Some online sites are prescribing men a hair loss drug that has potentially risky side effects without consistent safety checks, the BBC has found.",
      "The side effects of finasteride can include suicidal thoughts and impotence, yet some big brand companies will send the pills in the post without seeing or chatting with the customer.",
      "We investigated after hearing stories from men through Your Voice, Your BBC News.",
      "Kyle, who is 26 and from Wakefield, regrets buying the pills online after filling out a 'tick-box' form.",
      "He says his life has been turned upside down by an all-too-quick decision.",
      "Kyle started taking finasteride last spring, after it was recommended to him by a mate who was on it.",
      "He says he did a bit of research beforehand, but buying it online was simple.",
      "\"I just typed it in on Google and it came up with all these online pharmacies,\" Kyle says.",
      "\"It's everywhere. It's so easily accessible.\"",
      "The prescription pills arrived on his doorstep within a week of ordering them.",
      "\"I had no consultation with a doctor. No zoom meeting. I didn't have to send any pictures to them or anything like that to actually make sure I did have male pattern baldness.",
      "\"I started it and, yeah - that was the biggest mistake of my life.\"",
      "Since taking the drug, Kyle says he's been having problems with his sexual, mental and physical health - problems he had never experienced before and which have persisted since he stopped the medication.",
      "\"Life just feels grey. It's, like, castrated my emotions,\" Kyle says.",
      "\"It just stripped everything from me - all my personality and everything. I stopped going out with my mates, stopped playing football and started having all these issues.\"",
      "Finasteride is one of the most common pills for hair loss, taken by tens of thousands of men in the UK. It is only available by private prescription.",
      "It works by stopping testosterone turning into another hormone, called dihydrotestosterone (DHT), that can stop hair growing.",
      "Kyle took it for about six weeks, but stopped after experiencing problems including suicidal thoughts.",
      "In late April 2024 - just weeks after Kyle got his prescription - UK regulators took urgent action over finasteride, saying packs must contain a special safety alert card warning of the small risk of severe side effects including suicidal thoughts and sexual dysfunction.",
      "After being contacted by other men like Kyle through Your Voice, Your BBC News, we asked a male colleague to buy finasteride from three leading online providers to see what the checks now involved.",
      "Online prescriber Hims mentioned the side effects.",
      "Superdrug also offered the option to chat with a doctor - that cost extra.",
      "Only Boots pharmacy asked for a photo of hair loss.",
      "When some packs arrived, none contained the new patient alert card that drug  makers were asked to add.",
      "Embarrassment factor",
      "The Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory agency says manufacturers have been given up to a year to comply, but it might still take longer since older packs will have to be sold before newer ones with the\u00a0advice card begin to appear.",
      "Boots, Hims and Superdrug say online finasteride customers are asked to confirm that they have read and understood the possible risks.",
      "They say until the alert cards are \"rolled out\" and put in packs, users can read the long patient information leaftlet already included with the medicine to learn about side effects.",
      "The Royal Pharmaceutical Society says online prescribing can be very useful for a lot of patients, particularly if they are too embarrassed to visit a doctor. But the checks must be robust.",
      "James Davies, RPS director for England told BBC News: \"It's really important that regardless of whether it's online or face to face, these thorough checks are taking place.",
      "\"That means that a full medical history is taken, there's an opportunity to understand the medication that may be prescribed, the side effects, the risks and the benefits.\"",
      "He said sharing photos of the hair loss with the prescriber and having a video call to discuss all of the issues could be useful.",
      "The British Association of Hair Restoration Surgery (BAHRS) believes patients shouldn't get the drug just by filling out an online form.",
      "Greg Williams, hair transplant surgeon and vice president of BAHRS, says although finsasteride is a good treatment for many, the small chance of serious side effects must be explained and closely monitored.",
      "\"There will be some patients who have risk factors that might make finasteride a risky prescription. I'm not saying it can't be prescribed, but patients need to be appropriately counselled.\"",
      "Europe's drug regulator is doing its own safety review of finasteride which could include a ban.",
      "Nearly a year since first ordering the drug, Kyle says he deeply regrets taking finasteride.",
      "\"It's just a little pill. You take it and don't really think about what it can do to you,\" he says.",
      "\"Every day I beat myself up saying like 'You had a perfect life, you didn't have to risk something over hair'.",
      "\"It was vain of me...but when you get insecure you do stupid things.",
      "\"If I were made aware of what it can do I never would have took it.\""

    "summary": "New weight-loss drugs have broad health benefits but also come with risks, researchers warn.",
    "story": [
      "The first study to assess how weight-loss drugs affect the whole of human health has discovered an \"eye-opening\" impact on the body, researchers say.",
      "The analysis, involving about two million people, linked the drugs to better heart health, fewer infections, a lower risk of drug abuse and fewer cases of dementia.",
      "The US researchers also warned the drugs were \"not without risk\" and seemed to increase joint pain and potentially deadly inflammation in the pancreas.",
      "However, the results need very careful interpretation.",
      "Weight-loss drugs have exploded in popularity - but a full understanding of everything they touch in the body is still coming together.",
      "\"This is new territory,\" said lead researcher Dr Ziyad al-Aly, clinical epidemiologist at Washington University.",
      "Initially, they were a proven treatment for type 2 diabetes. Then, weight loss was noticed as a significant side-effect - and Ozempic and Wegovy became household names.",
      "How do weight loss drugs like Mounjaro and Wegovy work?",
      "The study used data on US veterans with type 2 diabetes, some of whom were given Ozempic or Wegovy and some more standard drugs - to measure their effect on 175 other illnesses.",
      "There appeared to be a significant boon to heart health, with lower levels of heart attacks, stroke, heart failure and high blood pressure, in those taking the new weight-loss drugs.",
      "They also cut the risk of substance abuse (including alcohol, opioids and cannabis) as well as reducing schizophrenia, suicidal thoughts and seizures.",
      "Despite the study being short, and people taking the drugs for only 3.5 years because of how new they are, it reported a 12% reduction in Alzheimer's disease.",
      "There was also less liver cancer, muscle pain and chronic kidney disease as well as a noted reduction in bacterial infections and fever.",
      "On the flip side, people were more likely to have problems in their digestive system. Feeling sick, tummy pain, inflammation in the stomach, diverticulitis (bulges in the intestines that can be painful) and haemorrhoids were more common on Ozempic or Wegovy.",
      "'Definitely eye-opening'",
      "The data, published in the journal Nature Medicine, also showed low blood pressure, including fainting, headaches, disturbed sleep, kidney stones, inflammation in the kidneys and a range of bone or joint pains, including arthritis, became more frequent.",
      "\"It was definitely eye-opening for me to see all these different hits in different organ systems,\" Dr Aly told BBC News.",
      "The explanations for the drugs' seemingly wide-ranging impact are both obvious and mysterious.",
      "Losing excess weight would in turn improve health. For example, lower levels of sleep apnoea \u2013 when breathing stops and starts while slumbering  \u2013 is thought to be down to losing weight around the tongue and throat, which can block the airways.",
      "But the drugs also appear to be directly altering the behaviour of cells and tissues in the body.",
      "Dr Aly said: \"Obesity is bad for the brain. Obesity is bad for mental health. Obesity is bad for the heart. Obesity could be the mother of all ills.\"",
      "Ozempic and Wegovy have the same active ingredient, semaglutide, in different doses, and mimic the hormone glucagon-like peptide-1.",
      "Released by the gut after eating, GLP-1 travels through the blood and sticks to little receptors on the surface of brains cells.",
      "This tells the brain there is food in the stomach and is why people feel less hungry after eating.",
      "However, receptors that respond to GLP-1 are found throughout the body, including in the heart and some parts of the immune system.",
      "\"It is very clear this class of drugs seem to suppress reward mechanisms [in the brain so it] inhibits that urge to seek out alcohol, to seek out tobacco, to seek out gambling,\" Dr Aly said.",
      "Meanwhile, lower levels of inflammation, the alarm bell of the immune system, could have a wide range of health impacts.",
      "'Ozempic babies'",
      "The range of health benefits may strengthen the case for some people using the drugs, Dr Aly said.",
      "\"When you add more benefit, for the people who really are at risk of these conditions, that's an added plus,\" he said.",
      "But for those whose weight is not affecting their health, \"maybe the risk that they're buying themselves is actually much higher than the benefit\".",
      "However, the study has drawbacks that limit its findings.",
      "Most of the veterans were white men, so it did not include any female-specific effects, such as the anecdotal phenomenon of improved fertility and unexpected \"Ozempic babies\".",
      "And there could be reasons why some had been prescribed Ozempic or Weygovy, rather than other drugs, that could provide alternative explanations for some of the findings.",
      "Protective effect",
      "Thorough clinical trials have already proven benefits to heart health - and nausea is a known side-effect - but other findings will need to go through similar rigorous testing.",
      "Alzheimer's starts more than a decade before symptoms appear - but this study suggests just a few years on semaglutide has a protective effect.",
      "Trials are already under way to work out if this effect is real.",
      "\"Such trials will lead us much closer to the truth,\" Prof Naveed Sattar, from the University of Glasgow, said.",
      "\"Fortunately\u2026 several will report out in the next one to four years.\"",
      "And while \"interesting\", he said this latest study's findings were not strong enough to influence how the drugs were prescribed.",
      "Prof Sir Stephen O'Rahilly, from the University of Cambridge, said the study needed to be interpreted \"carefully\" but provided \"useful reassurance\" about the drugs' safety in people with diabetes.",
      "And further studies in other patients were \"awaited with interest\".",
      "The \"most surprising finding\" was the increase in joint pain, since weight loss should reduce pressure on the joints.",
      "But the fact some cells in the immune system had GLP-1 receptors meant the impact of these drugs was \"somewhat unpredictable\" and while some inflammatory disorders may be eased, \"others might conceivably be exacerbated\", Prof O'Rahilly said.",

      "The closure of Strangers' bar, in the House of Commons, while an alleged spiking incident is investigated has thrown the spotlight on Westminster's drinking culture and what goes on in its many watering holes.",
      "You are certainly never far from a bar in the Palace of Westminster.",
      "For centuries, British politics has floated along on a tide of booze. Drink is part of the fabric of the place, but the drinking dens of Parliament are not what you might imagine.",
      "The bars reserved exclusively for MPs and peers \u2013 in the deeper recesses of the ancient building \u2013 such as the Pugin Room or the Members' Smoking Room (which is now non-smoking) may have the feel of a Mayfair gentlemen's club, all leather armchairs and hushed tones.",
      "But the most popular venue on the estate, The Woolsack, is more like a traditional British pub that you would find in any market square or High Street.",
      "Closing bars could risk MPs' safety, says minister",
      "Westminster drinking culture blamed for bad behaviour",
      "Parliament bar closed after alleged spiking incident",
      "Until 2018, it was called the Sports and Social Club but was rebranded and placed under new management after it gained a reputation for drunken brawls and other misdemeanours.",
      "Slightly shabby and old school, with its wood panelling, trophy cabinets and a carpet that has seen better days, it does a roaring trade with a younger, after-work crowd.",
      "This is where researchers, Parliamentary staff and the occasional MP come to talk shop and catch up with gossip.",
      "It is not easy to find, tucked away in a courtyard between loading bays with no sign outside, adding to the clubby sense of exclusivity that must be part of the attraction.",
      "It's open to passholders with a maximum of two guests and taking pictures or filming is strictly prohibited.",
      "The prices are attractive too. You can get a pint of House of Lords lager for \u00a34.30, for example, a pint of San Miguel for \u00a35.25 or a small glass of Sauvignon Blanc for \u00a35.60.",
      "This is pretty cheap for central London. Similar drinks at pubs within easy walking distance of Parliament, such as the Red Lion, the St Stephen's Tavern or the Marquis of Granby would set you back a bit more (according to our extensive research).",
      "The Parliamentary authorities insist drinks on the estate are not directly subsidised - and are \"benchmarked\" against prices in the outside world.",
      "But the Commons catering department, which oversees 27 bars, restaurants and cafes, as well as banqueting services, was subsidised by taxpayers in 2022/23 to the tune of \u00a36.4m, according to the annual accounts.",
      "Until it was closed, Strangers' bar also did a roaring trade, particularly in the summer months when it serves drinks to thirsty punters on the Commons terrace, enjoying spectacular views of the Thames.",
      "It is smaller and has a more upmarket feel than The Woolsack, but has also seen its share of bad behaviour over the years.",
      "When late night sittings were more common, it would be packed with increasingly inebriated MPs and party whips, trying to keep them in line.",
      "Journalists have traditionally headed to Strangers if they want to a catch a word with an MP.",
      "(The Westminster press pack have their own bar and caf\u00e9, Moncrieff's, named after the late, and legendary, Press Association reporter Chris Moncrieff, but few seem to use it.)",
      "Along the corridor from Strangers, you will find function rooms which are another hub of Westminster's social life, playing host to receptions and events most evenings where the (free) booze flows.",
      "Speaking on condition of anonymity, one member of the catering staff tells me that the excitement can sometimes go to guests' heads.",
      "\"I've never seen anyone throw up. I've seen four or five pass out,\" he says.",
      "The majority of MPs are polite and courteous to the staff, he says, but like most things at Westminster, when there is bad behaviour it tends to divide along party lines.",
      "\"The more pretentious Tory MPs will say 'do you know who I am?'. Labour ones are more like 'do you know how important I am?',\" he laughs.",
      "One thing he has noticed is that the new intake of MPs seem to be a less boozy crowd than their predecessors.",
      "Last July's general election saw an unprecedented clear out of MPs, and many of the 350 new MPs are younger, and more likely to have school age children.",
      "One of the new intake, Liberal Democrat Steff Aquarone, 40, thinks Westminster's bar culture is well past its sell by date.",
      "\"This one of the few remaining places where it's still possible to drink at lunchtime in the workplace. Most of the rest of the world of industry has moved on from that.\"",
      "The North Norfolk MP says this is \"problematic\" because \"it creates all sorts of circumstances where behaviours that are not only undesirable but in some cases wholly toxic end up becoming accepted as the price of socialising\".",
      "Commons leader Lucy Powell argued this week that it was safer for MPs and their staff to drink in Westminster's bars, where they are protected by security guards and codes of conduct, than in ordinary London pubs.",
      "Aquarone says he understands Powell's point but, he argues, some people in Parliament need to be protected from colleagues.",
      "\"If I wanted to go for a drink with my team, I could choose anywhere in London where no one would know who we were and no one would know that we were there and that's actually a far more secure way of having a safe night out.\"",
      "One new Labour MP said with many of the new intake their 30s with young children, there may be some drinking on a Monday night when there's no vote until 10pm, but MPs are more aware that they shouldn't be drinking with staff.",
      "The terrace provided a good place to get to know new colleagues last summer and were bonding over booze, but the Labour MPs of old who had a pint at lunchtime are gone, they said.",
      "In fact, some new MPs are pushing for Parliament's bars to be closed at lunchtime, or even shut down altogether, as part of a modernisation programme.",
      "This would not go down well with ordinary Parliamentary staff or many of the 14,500 pass holders with access to the pubs and bars on the estate.",
      "\"Parliament is a unique place, it's like a village, why shouldn't we have a bar? It's the Houses of Parliament, not Ibiza,\" one woman, who has worked in Parliament for nearly three decades, tells me.",

      "\"It's just a place to relax and have a chat with your pals,\" says the woman, as she drains her pint and pulls on her coat.",

    "story": [
      "The MP for Southport, where Axel Rudakubana murdered three young girls, has demanded a review of the killer's minimum 52-year jail sentence, arguing it is \"not severe enough\".",
      "Labour's Patrick Hurley has asked the attorney general to review if the sentence was \"unduly lenient\" claiming it does not \"reflect the crimes committed\".",
      "Rudakubana plead guilty to the murders of Elsie Dot Stancombe, seven, Bebe King, six, and Alice da Silva Aguiar, eight at a dance workshop.",
      "The killings triggered a wave of political outrage, including from Prime Minister Sir Keir Starmer who called the attack, which wounded eight more children, \"one of the most harrowing moments in our country's history\".",

      "'I knew I was running for my life': How the Southport attack unfolded",
      "How red flags over Southport killer were repeatedly missed",
      "In a statement Sir Keir said: \"What happened in Southport was an atrocity and as the judge has stated, this vile offender will likely never be released.\"",
      "But Hurley argued Rudakubana's sentence \"is not severe enough, it is not long enough for the crimes committed\".",
      "The minimum 52-year sentence means Rudakubana cannot be considered for release until he has spent this amount of time in prison.",
      "However, because he acted nine days shy of turning 18, by law he cannot be sentenced to a whole-life order - which would mean he could never be released from jail.",
      "Hurley told BBC Breakfast in \"exceptional circumstances\" judges needed to ability to give \"exceptional sentences\".",
      "He also raised concerns the surviving victims could be \"retraumatised\" if  Rudakubana applied for parole after serving 52 years in prison, even if this was rejected.",
      "Minister John Healey said international law prevented the UK from having a court system which imposed unlimited sentences on under-18s.",
      "However, he told BBC Breakfast: \"I can't see this man ever coming out of prison.",
      "\"I don't want to see this man ever coming out of prison and the judge yesterday when he sentenced him to 52 years was also quite clear \u2013 he does not expect him to come out of prison in the future.\"",
      "Attorney General Lord Hermer and Solicitor General Lucy Rigby now have 28 days to decide if they will refer the sentence to the Court of Appeal.",
      "Critics of the judge's decision would have to convince the Court of Appeal that the sentence - believed to be the second-longest minimum term ever - is not just shorter than they would have wanted, but \"unduly\" so.",
      "Former Attorney General Sir Dominic Grieve said he believed the request was \"hopeless\" as \"the chances are Rudakubana will never be released\".",
      "He told the BBC there had to be \"a cut-off point\" for when a whole life order could be imposed and there was evidence that younger offenders could change in a way that adults did not.",
      "Hurley joined Conservative leader Kemi Badenoch in calling for law change to allow for whole life orders to be imposed on people aged under 18 in some cases.",
      "Badenoch said \"Rudakubana should never be released from prison\" after destroying \"countless lives\" and sowing a \"legacy of mistrust\" across the country.",
      "The Conservatives \"will start to explore\" how to change the law, she said.",
      "Despite the severity of the attack the Crown Prosecution Service (CPS) decided it did not meet the legal definition of terrorism, due to a lack of evidence Rudakubana sought to advance any political, religious, or ideological agenda.",
      "But Badenoch called the attack a \"terrorist\" incident, and called on others to stop \"avoiding these hard truths\".",
      "Leader of Reform UK Nigel Farage demanded the CPS chief resign for failing to class the case as terrorism.",
      "\"This barbaric and senseless attack was clearly both political and ideological,\" Farage said.",
      "\"The British public needs to have confidence in the CPS and our police forces. Tens of millions of British citizens will find it incomprehensible how the CPS decided this was a non-terror incident and maintained that position.\"",
      "Home Secretary Yvette Cooper condemned Rudakubana's attack as \"horrendous, cowardly, and evil\" and said the government had pledged to hold a national inquiry.",
      "Further details would be set out soon, she said, but added \"for today, all our thoughts are with the families enduring this unimaginable pain, and the example of strength and courage they have provided to us all\".",
      "Conservative shadow home secretary Chris Philp backed the inquiry, but accused the government of overseeing an information vacuum after Rudakubana's arrest, which sparked a wave of riots across the UK last summer.",
      "Philp is one of many critics that have accused the CPS and government of withholding key details after the attack, such as Rudakubana's three referrals to anti-extremism programme Prevent, his creation of enough ricin to kill 12,000 people and the extent of his fixation on violence and genocide.",
      "Posting on social media, Philp said: \"The prime minister and CPS could have been more open with the public. This would have avoided misinformation filling the void, and fuelling the riots.",

      "But Leadbeater said she understood the \"passion\" around the debate and vowed to \"continue to work as hard as I can to make sure that the genuine concerns that are there are considered\" as the bill went through Parliament.",
      "In November, MPs backed Leadbeater's bill to legalise assisted dying in England and Wales by 330 to 275 in a free vote - meaning MPs were allowed to vote with their conscience, rather than following party orders.",

    "story": [
      "The UK banking industry has warned that government plans to crackdown on benefit fraud could leave banks at risk of breaking consumer protection rules.",
      "A new law unveiled on Wednesday would allow the Department for Work and Pensions (DWP) to reclaim money from accounts without a court order.",
      "Ministers argue this will speed up the debt recovery process and help contribute to a wider crackdown on benefits fraud.",
      "But UK Finance, the biggest business group representing British banks, has told the BBC the plans could undermine the banks' own efforts to protect vulnerable account holders.",
      "Benefit cheats could be stripped of driving licences",
      "Warnings over AI use to risk-score benefit claims",
      "The government's announcement on Wednesday is the culmination of years of work by officials in DWP about how to more closely involve banks in benefit fraud crackdowns.",
      "Similar plans drawn up by the previous Conservative government failed to make it through Parliament before last July's general election.",
      "The banking sector is understood to have been quietly lobbying against the plans for more than a year, but this is the first time they have raised concerns publicly.",
      "The intervention could cause a headache for ministers, who've spent months courting the City, in a bid to bring them on side with their plans to boost economic growth.",
      "At the moment, the DWP can recover benefits debt from current claimants through the welfare system itself, whilst it can also deduct money from claimants who are employees through the PAYE system.",
      "It argues the ability to recover money from claimants' bank accounts directly would help reclaim funds from those no longer on benefits or who are self-employed, and ease pressures on the court system.",
      "Under the new legislation, the DWP would be able to compel banks to transfer over benefits debt through \"direct deduction orders\". Banks would be able to charge the claimant a fee to cover their administration costs.",
      "The department would be obliged to consider three months' worth of bank statements from the claimant first, and consider whether a deduction would mean they would suffer \"hardship in meeting essential living expenses\".",
      "But Daniel Cichocki, director in economic crime and policy strategy at UK Finance, said the plans need to be looked at further to ensure they don't \"create risks for vulnerable customers, or conflict with existing regulatory and legal obligations\".",
      "Mr Cichocki said he agreed with the principle of going after fraud, but called on the government to introduce controls to \"prevent fraud and error entering the benefits system in the first place\".",
      "UK Finance, which counts the vast majority of the big retail banks among its members, pointed to the Financial Conduct Authority's (FCA) consumer duty as an area that it believes could be in conflict with the government's plans.",
      "The duty, introduced in 2023, set higher standards for consumer protection and gave banks a specific obligation to protect customers who are vulnerable due to their financial situation.",
      "A bank that breaks those rules can be penalised by the FCA, or the financial ombudsman.",
      "Data sharing concerns",
      "The banking industry is also understood to have concerns over new measures forcing them to hand over account information of claimants where there are indications they \"may have been\" paid benefits incorrectly.",

      "The department can currently only demand such financial information where it has reason to suspect fraud, and only in individual cases.",
      "It argues greater access to banking information in bulk will allow it to catch cases of potential fraud that would otherwise go undetected, eventually saving the taxpayer around \u00a3500m a year once the system is fully rolled out.",
      "According to latest annual figures, overpayments due to fraud amounted to \u00a37.4bn last year, around 2.8% of total welfare spending.",
      "A further \u00a31.6bn (0.6%) was overpaid due to inadvertent errors by claimants, with \u00a30.8bn (0.3%) overpaid because of errors by the DWP.",

      "But the exact threshold for when someone's details will be handed over is still unclear - and the government has indicated it wants banks to work with them to establish a \"fully automated\" system.",

    "story": [
      "Deprived children in England will \"pay the price\" of the government's changes to schools, Kemi Badenoch has said as she accused ministers of \"an act of vandalism\".",
      "At Prime Minister's Questions, the Conservative leader argued that the government's Schools Bill would cut pay for teachers in academies, close down routes into teaching and block failing schools from automatically becoming academies.",
      "Sir Keir Starmer said academies had been introduced by the previous Labour government and were \"here to stay\".",
      "He said it was a \"disgrace\" that Tory MPs opposed the bill, which also aims to protect vulnerable children, set up breakfast clubs and limit uniform costs.",
      "The Children's Wellbeing and Schools Bill is a wide-ranging bill which includes measures to create a register of children who are not in school and allow local authorities to intervene if a child's home environment is assessed as unsuitable or unsafe.",

      "She told MPs the government's changes were \"wrecking a cross-party consensus that lasted for decades\".",
      "\"Teachers and parents will be horrified at just how bad this bill is. Even his own MPs may not realise it, but the bill will cut teachers' pay.\"",
      "Sir Keir replied that it was important for schools to have flexibility on pay and that the government had introduced an amendment to the bill \"to achieve that aim\".",
      "Currently, academies, which are independent of local authorities, have the power to decide how much to spend on teachers' salaries.",
      "The original wording of the bill would have changed this but for the last few weeks Education Secretary Bridget Phillipson has repeated the line \"there will be a floor, no ceiling\" on pay.",
      "On Tuesday evening, the government agreed to amend the wording in the bill. Instead, academies will have to have \"due regard\" to the national pay agreements.",
      "Following PMQs, a Downing Street spokesman said the amendment to the bill was \"a sensible step to clarify our ambition for teachers' pay and conditions\".",
      "\"The amendment makes very clear the government's intention to set a floor on pay but no ceiling so that all state school teachers can rely on the core pay offer,\" he added.",
      "The Confederation of School Trusts welcomed the changes - but said there were still parts of the bill that concerned them, including restrictions on bringing people with specialist subject knowledge (but not a specific formal teaching qualification) into the classroom.",
      "Badenoch told the Commons that the bill implies \"doctors are not sufficiently qualified to teach biology, that Olympic medallists can not teach PE\", and asked why the prime minister was closing routes into teaching.",
      "\"She knows that's not right,\" Sir Keir replied but added that it \"should not be extraordinary\" to suggest that teachers in schools should be qualified.",
      "Badenoch also criticised the bill for removing a guarantee that failing schools would automatically be turned into academies.",
      "\"It is an attack on excellence. It is an attack on higher standards. It is an attack on aspiration,\" she said.",
      "Sir Keir said his government was committed to academies and repeated his attack on Conservative MPs for voting against a bill which included \"vital protections for children\".",
      "\"The bill benefits children who need the nourishment of a breakfast club, the bill benefits the families that can't afford uniforms, the bill benefits the children who are currently out of school and nobody knows where they are, the bill benefits the children who could be taken out of school by abusers if this bill doesn't go through.\"",
      "He said the opposition leader should \"change her mind\" and back the measures.",
      "The subject of academies is one where the Conservatives are united and keen to defend their record, with one shadow cabinet minister telling the BBC: \"It's one of the few clear success stories we have to tell.\"",
      "Academy schools were first introduced under Sir Tony Blair and enthusiastically expanded by the Conservatives when they came to power in 2010.",
      "So far only one Labour MP - Siobhain McDonagh - has publicly criticised the bill, however it is privately causing significant anxiety among Labour MPs, generally on the right of the party, who are proud of academies.",
      "These are predominantly MPs who are loyal to the government anyway and would not vote against this legislation, which is expected to become law by spring."

    "published": "Thu, 23 Jan 2025 19:57:06 GMT",
    "summary": "Years of delay and dispute have worn down support for what was once the government's flagship policy.",
    "story": [
      "After years of delay and dispute, the Scottish government has ripped up its plans for a National Care Service.",
      "The plans have gone from the flagship announcement of the parliamentary term and potentially a cornerstone of Nicola Sturgeon's legacy, to a non-statutory advisory board.",
      "Some \u00a330m was spent in the process, amid a series of consultations, legislative redrafts and political rows.",
      "But when the plans were first announced, there was widespread support for the principle of reforming social care. Many were in favour of the idea of ending a \"postcode lottery\" across different areas.",
      "So what happened to bring the National Care Service crashing to earth?",
      "Has it been scrapped?",
      "To be clear, yes.",
      "It might be a bit confusing, given the government says it remains committed to a National Care Service, and that the bill to set it up is still going through parliament.",
      "But care minister Maree Todd has agreed to remove part one of the bill - the part literally titled \"the National Care Service\".",
      "The vision originally set out by Nicola Sturgeon - of a game-changing network of care boards across the country, a mirror for the NHS - is completely gone.",
      "It had already been hugely diluted, stripped back to a national oversight board, amid concerns over costs and a lack of detail in the plans.",
      "All that's left now is a non-statutory advisory board, and widely-supported proposals to strengthen the rights of people living in care homes, known as \"Anne's law\".",
      "While it will no doubt do important work, the government has almost 300 advisory boards currently active - this is not the game-changing innovation of a National Care Service as it has ever been promised.",
      "Delivery problems",
      "The vision of a groundbreaking new care service began its slow-motion crash into harsh reality when the government started trying to construct a legal framework for it.",
      "The legislation laid before parliament was an \"enabling bill\", which set out the broad idea of a care service but left finer details to be filled in by ministers later.",
      "MSPs reacted with alarm, with almost every committee in the parliament questioning how they could properly scrutinise the plans when there was so little substance attached.",
      "The bill was held up repeatedly due to a lack of firm costings attached to the project, with members demanding that fresh financial memorandums be drawn up.",
      "Money quickly became a problem, and the budget for setting up the scheme - projected as \u00a32.2bn over ten years at one point - became an easy target when ministers needed to make cuts.",
      "That inevitably led to delays, with the target delivery date drifting from 2026 to 2029.",
      "And when the plans were stripped back, it made the legislative process even more complicated, requiring massive amendments to the bill already before parliament.",
      "It made it all the easier for people to call for the government to start over from scratch - or indeed to bin the plans and just channel the funding directly to frontline care instead.",
      "Industry concerns",
      "The government was keen to pursue a \"co-design\" process with those who would be closely involved in the running and use of a National Care Service.",
      "The sheer breadth of groups involved in caring underlines the difficulty of reform - there are councils, health boards, \"integrated joint boards\", health and social care partnerships, independent care providers, staff unions, and more.",
      "While there was support for the principle of improving care services in many quarters, some of these groups had concerns about the plans from the very outset - and others grew increasingly alienated as time went by.",
      "The original vision would have shifted responsibility for staffing and the delivery of care to the new care boards - which councils saw as undermining local control of services.",
      "The redrafted plans would have seen councils keep more of that control under a \"shared accountability\" model, but that too ultimately proved unpopular.",
      "The decision of council leaders to walk away from negotiations in September 2024 was really the moment which signalled the end of the road.",
      "It followed on the heels of unions which represent many carers - including Unison - coming out against the proposals.",
      "Without the support of those at the sharp end of actually delivering care, there was just no way that the NCS could become a reality.",
      "Political spats",
      "The collapse of the care service plans has spanned the reigns of three first ministers, each of whom insisted at some point that they were completely committed to delivering on them.",
      "Politics has undoubtedly played a part.",
      "But when it was first announced, there was not a wave of opposition to the idea of a care service at Holyrood.",
      "Indeed a few of the opposition parties remain in favour of the plans in principle - Labour in particular have just run on a manifesto promising to set one up at a UK level.",
      "But positions hardened as the policy process dragged on and concerns over the lack of detail in the bill mounted.",
      "The final straw came when the Greens withdrew their support in October 2024.",
      "That left the SNP completely isolated, with no clear way of building a coalition to get the bill passed.",
      "The government is actually quite keen to stress that there is no route through parliament for the bill, because it spreads the blame around other parties.",
      "But it is fair to reflect that political opposition has grown over time, in parallel with concerns about the proposals across a much wider base."

      "The British-trained barrister, 40, is one of Bangladesh's so-called \"disappeared\". These were critics of Sheikh Hasina, the country's prime minister of more than 20 years, in two terms, until she was deposed last August.",
      "Hasina's regime ruled over the worst violence Bangladesh has seen since its war of independence in 1971 in which hundreds were killed, including at least 90 people while she clung to power on her last day in office.",
      "Controversial in her own right, Hasina is also the aunt of Labour MP Tulip Siddiq - who resigned as Prime Minister Sir Keir Starmer's anti-corruption minister last week after a slew of corruption allegations that she denied.",
      "These included claims Siddiq's family embezzled up to \u00a33.9bn from infrastructure spending in Bangladesh - and that she used properties in London linked to her aunt's allies.",
      "The government's ethics watchdog later found she did not break the ministerial code, but Siddiq resigned anyway.",
      "That isn't necessarily the end of the matter, though.",
      "Questions for Starmer",
      "The episode raises troubling questions about Starmer's judgement and Labour's approach to courting the votes of people of Bangladeshi heritage.",
      "Questions are now swirling over why Labour failed to see this coming, given the party has long known about Siddiq's links to her scandal-hit aunt. It was 2016 when Bin Quasem's case was first raised with her.",
      "He and others among Bangladesh's \"disappeared\" have represented an awkward tension with Siddiq's publicly voiced views on human rights in the years since.",
      "She long campaigned for the release from Iran of her constituent Nazanin Zaghari-Ratcliffe, for example, while showing an apparent comparative indifference in her public statements to the suffering and extrajudicial killings under her aunt's regime in Bangladesh.",
      "Siddiq has also previously appeared alongside her aunt at a meeting with Russian President Vladimir Putin and appeared on BBC television as a spokesperson for the Awami League, the political party Hasina has led since 1981.",
      "Siddiq also thanked Awami League members for helping her election as a Labour MP in 2015. Two pages on her website from 2008 and 2009 setting out her links to the party were later removed.",
      "Yet once in Parliament Siddiq told journalists that she had \"no capability or desire to influence politics in Bangladesh\".",
      "So these links weren't a secret, but perhaps they weren't viewed as a bad thing within Labour, not least since it has shown little sign of distancing itself from the Awami League in recent years.",
      "Then-Labour MP Jim Fitzpatrick told the Commons in 2012 that they were \"sister organisations\", a warmth shared by many of his colleagues.",
      "And Starmer - who entered Parliament in 2015 at the same time as Siddiq in her neighbouring seat - has met Hasina multiple times.",
      "This included in 2022 when the then-Bangladeshi PM was in London for Queen Elizabeth II's funeral, a meeting that Bin Quasem calls \"heartbreaking and shocking\".",
      "A Starmer ally argues it is \"perfectly legitimate\" for him to have met Hasina, and it did not amount to an endorsement of her policies.",
      "The apparent attempts by Labour over the years to keep Bangladesh on side might reflect the political reality here in the UK, especially in parts of the capital city.",
      "\"You can't succeed in east London without understanding the Bangladeshi vote\", one seasoned Labour campaigner explains.",
      "However, those who fail to appreciate the country's divided and volatile politics can end up offending those they are attempting to charm. \"You need to carefully balance what you say and do,\" the campaigner says. \"If you are too overt for one [Bangladeshi] party, you'll get criticised.\"",
      "Analysis by the FT suggests there are at least 17 UK constituencies where the voting-age Bangladeshi population is larger than the Labour majority.",
      "Starmer's Holborn and St Pancras constituency has at least 6,000 adult residents of Bangladeshi origin.",
      "A potential blind spot",
      "Might this mix of warmth and political pragmatism have clouded Starmer's judgement from a potential corruption storm on the horizon when, shortly after winning the election in July, he appointed Siddiq as the Treasury minister responsible for leading Britain's anti-corruption efforts?",
      "\"Starmer has blindspots for his friends and political allies,\" says a Labour source. \"It's not new.\"",
      "Investigative journalist David Bergman, who has been shedding light on Siddiq's connections to Bangladeshi politics for a decade, points out context is everything. \"This was not a major story until Labour got into power, Tulip Siddiq became a minister and the Awami League government fell,\" he says.",

      "How Bangladesh's protests ended  Sheikh Hasina's 15-year reign",
      "He argues someone in the party should have raised concerns many years before. \"There was first a blind spot about Tulip Siddiq's failure to respond to enforced disappearances in Bangladesh,\" Bergman argues.",
      "\"Then there was a blind spot about how tied she was to the UK Awami League.\"",
      "When I put this to one Labour MP, they responded that the UK media, as well as Labour, have had a Bangladesh blind spot.",
      "\"There are some 600,000 people in the British Bangla diaspora\", they say. \"It is a country with the eighth largest population on Earth yet we've not heard a peep [from the UK media] since the events of 5 August.\"",
      "The corruption investigations into Hasina are likely to rumble on for some time, potentially bringing further issues for Starmer's top team to address in the months ahead while Siddiq remains a Labour MP.",
      "For Bin Quasem, the toppling of Hasina's regime saw him abruptly awoken in his cell, bundled into a car and dumped in a ditch, before finally being allowed to return home to his two daughters.",
      "Toddlers when he last saw them in 2016, they are now young women. \"I couldn't really recognise them, and they couldn't recognise me,\" he tells me through tears.",

      "Storing this highly radioactive material - in its current form - is expensive and difficult. It needs to be frequently repackaged, because radiation damages the containers it's kept in. And it's guarded by armed police. All that costs the taxpayer more than \u00a370m per year.",
      "The government has made the decision that the safest - most economically viable solution - is to \"immobilise\" its entire plutonium stockpile.",

      "In many instances, those Redditors have reached a different conclusion, deciding Mr Musk's actions were so offensive that they won't link to content from their subreddits on X, potentially reducing traffic, engagement and - ultimately - revenue.",
      "The biggest subreddits to have enforced the ban include basketball community r/NBA, which has 15 million members, female-focused community r/TwoXChromosomes, which has 14 million members, and American football community r/NFL, which has 12 million members.",
      "It is worth remembering that subreddits are almost always run by fans - it does not mean that the NFL or NBA organisations are taking a stance against Musk.",
      "The BBC has independently verified that at least 100 subreddits have banned X posts.",
      "Of this number, more than 60 have at least 100,000 members.",
      "But the actual number that have instituted the ban will likely be significantly higher by taking into account smaller subreddits with only a few thousand members.",
      "And there are many more communities discussing a potential blacklisting.",
      "Who and why?",
      "The subreddits run by fans of football clubs Liverpool, Celtic and Tottenham Hotspur have all instituted the bans, as have communities for many US sports sides as well as Formula 1.",
      "The subreddits where residents of many cities and countries gather around the world - ranging from New Jersey to South Korea - have also blocked posts to X.",
      "And gamers are also amongst those to bring in the ban for video games including Baldur's Gate 3 and World of Warcraft.",
      "But while the blacklisting may have first started in some of these communities, it is popping up in a variety of places now where people gather to discuss all sorts of topics, ranging from RuPaul's Drag Race to Disneyland and even the military.",
      "While the vast majority of subreddits discussing a ban are in favour of it, there are some that have refused.",
      "The moderators of the Maine community for example say they won't institute a ban so long as \"the state maintain official accounts there\".",
      "And those running a group for people in British Columbia said they simply aren't \"doing censorship here\".",
      "Does it matter?",
      "Though there are many subreddits which already disallow posts from social media, those built around professional sports in particular may have a big impact on referrals to X.",
      "That's because sports subreddits generally get a lot of content from links to athletes, analysts and journalists who spend a lot of time posting online.",
      "For example, the top two most popular posts of all time on the NBA subreddits are screenshots taken from X, while three of the top ten most popular posts of all time on the AEW wrestling subreddit are screenshots from the platform.",
      "And gaming subreddits have a similar story, with the top posts on the Animal Crossing and Kingdom Hearts communities both screenshots from X.",
      "But that is not to say the bans will necessarily be permanent - Reddit is known for this sort of community movement to protest against wider issues, which doesn't always work out.",
      "In 2023, thousands of communities \"went dark\" to contest changes to how the platform was being run.",
      "Some of the biggest Reddit communities then began only allowing photos and videos of comedian John Oliver, following comments from disgruntled users.",
      "But this proved to be short-lived.",
      "Eventually the communities mostly became publicly available again, and Reddit's plan ultimately proved financially beneficial - the platform subsequently successfully listed on the New York Stock Exchange.",

    "published": "Wed, 22 Jan 2025 09:45:45 GMT",
    "summary": "What does Donald Trump's executive order mean for the future of TikTok in the US?",
    "story": [
      "US President Donald Trump has signed an executive order granting TikTok a 75-day extension to comply with a law banning the app if it is not sold.",
      "The social media platform briefly went dark in the US days before Trump took office, after the Supreme Court denied a bid by its Chinese owner ByteDance to overturn the legislation.",
      "TikTok came back online with a short message thanking Trump for his \"efforts\".",
      "Has Trump overturned the TikTok ban?",
      "An executive order is an instruction from the president which has the weight of the law behind it.",
      "But Trump's order does not overturn the ban.",
      "Instead it tells the US attorney general not to enforce the law for now - something experts had expected would be his first move.",
      "That buys time for his administration to, as the order puts it, \"determine the appropriate course of action.\"",
      "Trump has floated the possibility of TikTok becoming a joint venture, telling reporters he was seeking a 50-50 partnership between \"the United States\" and ByteDance, though he did not give any further details on how that might work.",
      "For now though the order creates a situation where the president is directly opposing a ruling made by the Supreme Court, which upheld the law to ban TikTok on 17 January.",
      "It said the ban was \"designed to prevent China - a designated foreign adversary - from leveraging its control over ByteDance to capture the personal data of US TikTok users\".",
      "Technically, even after the 75 days have passed, it would be possible for Trump to allow the law to stand but tell the Department of Justice (DoJ) to continue to ignore it.",
      "The government would be effectively telling Apple and Google they will not be punished for continuing to allow people to download TikTok onto their devices, meaning the law would remain in place but would essentially be redundant.",
      "It is not clear whether the firms would continue to offer the app under these circumstances.",
      "Could TikTok ever be banned in the UK too?",
      "Could Elon Musk, MrBeast or Shark Tank's Kevin O'Leary buy TikTok?",
      "ByteDance has long insisted that its prize asset is not for sale, however could that change with a new president?",
      "When Trump signed the executive order, he said \"every rich person has called me\" to signal their interest in TikTok.",
      "Trump appears to want to find a compromise that complies with the spirit rather than the letter of law, floating the idea of TikTok being jointly owned.",
      "\"What I'm thinking of saying to someone is buy it and give half to the US, half, and we'll give you a permit,\" he said during a press conference about artificial intelligence.",
      "He said he'd met the \"big owners\" of TikTok, adding it was \"worthless\" if it didn't get a permit of the type he had in mind - but would be worth \"a trillion dollars\" if he allowed it to operate in the US.",
      "And he also said he would be open to selling the app to Oracle co-founder Larry Ellison, as well as Elon Musk.",
      "\"I would be, if he wanted to buy it,\" he said.",
      "Previous names linked with buying TikTok include billionaire Frank McCourt and the Canadian businessman Kevin O'Leary - a celebrity investor on Shark Tank, the US version of Dragon's Den.",
      "The biggest YouTuber in the world Jimmy Donaldson - AKA MrBeast - has also claimed he is in the running after a number of investors contacted him following an earlier tweet signalling his interest.",
      "A US search engine called Perplexity AI has also reportedly offered to merge with TikTok.",
      "In March 2024, Trump's former Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin said he wanted to put together a group to buy the app but it is not clear if he is still pursuing this.",
      "What about TikTok's sister apps Lemon8 and CapCut?",
      "TikTok was the only ByteDance app which came back immediately - though only for people who already had the app.",
      "It is still not available to download from Apple and Google's app stores.",
      "Two other apps which remain inaccessible are Lemon8, another social media app which has been compared to Pinterest, and CapCut, a video editing app.",
      "Meanwhile Marvel Snap, a digital card game published by a ByteDance subsidiary, is now available once again after it too went down - which caught even its US-based developer Second Dinner off guard.",
      "What other platforms could TikTok users use instead?",
      "TikTok says it has 170 million US users who spent - on average - 51 minutes per day on the app in 2024.",
      "Experts say rivals such as Instagram Reels and YouTube Shorts could benefit if Trump's efforts to fully restore TikTok don't succeed.",
      "Users bring advertisers - so this could be a big financial boost to those platforms.",
      "\"Chief marketing officers who we've spoken with confirmed that they will divert their media dollars to Meta and Google if they can no longer advertise on TikTok,\" said Kelsey Chickering, an analyst at market research company Forrester.",
      "Other potential winners include Twitch, which made its name by hosting livestreams - a popular feature on TikTok. Twitch is well known particularly to gamers, though its other content is expanding too.",
      "Other Chinese-owned platforms, such as Xiaohongshu - known as RedNote among its US users - have also seen rapid growth in the US and the UK."

    "published": "Fri, 24 Jan 2025 00:02:10 GMT",
    "summary": "Engineers are working on systems that can turn lunar regolith into useful elements like oxygen.",
    "story": [
      "Inside a giant sphere, the engineers pored over their equipment. Before them stood a silvery metal contraption swathed in colourful wires \u2013 a box that they hope will one day make oxygen on the moon.",
      "Once the team vacated the sphere, the experiment began. The box-like machine was now ingesting small quantities of a dusty regolith \u2013 a mixture of dust and sharp grit with a chemical composition mimicking real lunar soil.",
      "Soon, that regolith was gloop. A layer of it heated to temperatures above 1,650C. And, with the addition of some reactants, oxygen-containing molecules began to bubble out.",
      "\u201cWe\u2019ve tested everything we can on Earth now,\u201d says Brant White, a program manager at Sierra Space, a private company. \u201cThe next step is going to the moon.\u201d",
      "Sierra Space\u2019s experiment unfolded at Nasa\u2019s Johnson Space Center this summer. It is far from the only such technology that researchers are working on, as they develop systems that could supply astronauts living on a future lunar base.",
      "Those astronauts will need oxygen to breathe but also to make rocket fuel for spacecraft that might launch from the moon and head to destinations further afield \u2013 including Mars.",
      "Lunar base inhabitants might also require metal and they could even harvest this from the dusty grey debris that litters the lunar surface.",
      "Much depends on whether we can build reactors able to extract such resources effectively or not.",
      "\u201cIt could save billions of dollars from mission costs,\u201d says Mr White as he explains that the alternative \u2013 bringing lots of oxygen and spare metal to the moon from Earth \u2013 would be arduous and expensive.",
      "Luckily, the lunar regolith is full of metal oxides. But while the science of extracting oxygen from metal oxides, for example, is well understood on Earth, doing this on the moon is much harder. Not least because of the conditions.",
      "The huge spherical chamber that hosted Sierra Space\u2019s tests in July and August this year induced a vacuum and also simulated lunar temperatures and pressures.",
      "The company says it has had to improve how the machine works over time so that it can better cope with the extremely jagged, abrasive texture of the regolith itself. \u201cIt gets everywhere, wears out all sorts of mechanisms,\u201d says Mr White.",
      "And the one, crucial, thing that you can\u2019t test on Earth or even in orbit around our planet, is lunar gravity \u2013 which is roughly one sixth that of the Earth. It might not be until 2028 or later that Sierra Space can test its system on the moon, using real regolith in low gravity conditions.",
      "The moon\u2019s gravity could be a real problem for some oxygen-extracting technologies unless engineers design for it, says Paul Burke at Johns Hopkins University.",
      "In April, he and colleagues published a paper detailing the results of computer simulations that showed how a different oxygen-extracting process might be hindered by the moon\u2019s relatively feeble gravitational pull. The process under investigation here was molten regolith electrolysis, which involves using electricity to split lunar minerals containing oxygen, in order to extract the oxygen directly.",
      "The problem is that such technology works by forming bubbles of oxygen on the surface of electrodes deep within the molten regolith itself. \u201cIt is the consistency of, say, honey. It is very, very viscous,\u201d says Dr Burke.",
      "\u201cThose bubbles aren\u2019t going to rise as fast \u2013 and may actually be delayed from detaching from the electrodes.\u201d",
      "There could be ways around this. One could be to vibrate the oxygen-making machine device, which might jiggle the bubbles free.",
      "And extra-smooth electrodes might make it easier for the oxygen bubbles to detach. Dr Burke and his colleagues are now working on ideas like this.",
      "Sierra Space\u2019s technology, a carbothermal process, is different. In their case, when oxygen-containing bubbles form in the regolith, they do so freely, rather than on the surface of an electrode. It means there is less chance of them getting stuck, says Mr White.",
      "Stressing the value of oxygen for future lunar expeditions, Dr Burke estimates that, per day, an astronaut would require the amount of oxygen contained in roughly two or three kilograms of regolith, depending on that astronaut\u2019s fitness and activity levels.",
      "However, a lunar base\u2019s life support systems would likely recycle oxygen breathed out by astronauts. If so, it wouldn\u2019t be necessary to process quite as much regolith just to keep the lunar residents alive.",
      "The real use case for oxygen-extracting technologies, adds Dr Burke, is in providing the oxidiser for rocket fuels, which could enable ambitious space exploration.",
      "Obviously the more resources that can be made on the moon the better.",
      "Sierra Space\u2019s system does require the addition of some carbon, though the firm says it can recycle most of this after each oxygen-producing cycle.",
      "Along with colleagues, Palak Patel, a PhD student at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, came up with an experimental molten regolith electrolysis system, for extracting oxygen and metal from the lunar soil.",
      "\u201cWe\u2019re really looking at it from the standpoint of, \u2018Let\u2019s try to minimise the number of resupply missions\u2019,\u201d she says.",
      "When designing their system, Ms Patel and her colleagues addressed the problem described by Dr Burke: that low gravity could impede the detachment of oxygen bubbles that form on electrodes. To counter this, they used a \u201csonicator\u201d, which blasts the bubbles with sound waves in order to dislodge them.",
      "Ms Patel says that future resource-extracting machines on the moon could derive iron, titanium or lithium from regolith, for example. These materials might help lunar-dwelling astronauts make 3D-printed spare parts for their moon base or replacement components for damaged spacecraft.",
      "The usefulness of lunar regolith does not stop there. Ms Patel notes that, in separate experiments, she has melted simulated regolith into a tough, dark, glass-like material.",
      "She and colleagues worked out how to turn this substance into strong, hollow bricks, which could be useful for building structures on the moon \u2013 an imposing black monolith, say. Why not?",

I will issue an executive order on Monday to extend the period of time before the law's prohibitions take effect, so that we can make a deal to protect our national security.\"",
      "TikTok's parent company, Bytedance, previously ignored a law requiring it to sell its US operations to avoid a ban. The law was upheld by Supreme Court on Friday and went into effect on Sunday.",
      "It is unclear what legal authority Trump will have to delay the implementation of a law that is already in effect. But it expected that his government will not enforce the ban if he issues an executive order.",
      "It's an about-face from his previous position. Trump had backed a TikTok ban, but has more recently professed a \"warm spot\" for the app, touting the billions of views he says his videos attracted on the platform during last year's presidential campaign.",
      "For its part, President Joe Biden's administration had already said that it would not enforce the law in its last hours in office and instead allow the process to play out under the incoming Trump administration.",

      "Under the law passed last April, the US version of the app had to be removed from app stores and web-hosting services if its Chinese owner ByteDance did not sell its US operations.",
      "TikTok had argued before the Supreme Court that the law violated free speech protections for its users in the country.",
      "The law was passed with support from both Republicans and Democrats in Congress and was upheld unanimously by Supreme Court justices earlier this week.",
      "The issue exposes a rift on a key national security issues between the president-elect and members of his own party. His pick for Secretary of State, Marco Rubio, had vocally supported the ban.",
      "\"TikTok extended the Chinese Communist Party's power and influence into our own nation, right under our noses,\" he said last April. But he seemed to defer to the president-elect when a journalist asked if he supported Trump's efforts to restore the ban.",
      "\"If I'm confirmed as secretary of State, I'll work for the president,\" he told Punchbowl media last week.",
      "After Trump intervened on Sunday morning, Senate Intelligence Committee Chair Tom Cotton, a Republican senator from Arkansas, broke with Trump by saying that any company that helps TikTok stay online would be breaking the law.",
      "\"Any company that hosts, distributes, services, or otherwise facilitates communist-controlled TikTok could face hundreds of billions of dollars of ruinous liability under the law, not just from DOJ, but also under securities law, shareholder lawsuits, and state AGs,\" he wrote on social media.",
      "An executive order that goes against the law could be fought in court.",
      "Several states have also sued the platform, opening up the possibility to TikTok being banned by local jurisdictions, even if it is available nationally.",
      "Although the platform went live again on Sunday for existing users, the question of whether third-parties - hosting platforms or app stores like Google or Apple - could support TikTok in the US remains murky, says University of Richmond law professor Carl Tobias. The app had been removed from those stores in anticipation of the ban.",
      "\"It is murky,\" he told the BBC.",
      "In a post on Truth media, Trump promised to shield companies from liability, opening the door to TikTok being available on Apple and Google again.",
      "\"The order will also confirm that there will be no liability for any company that helped keep TikTok from going dark before my order,\" the president-elect said on Truth Social Sunday.",

      "\"Whatever the new president does, doesn't change that reality for these companies,\" Justice Sonia Sotomayor said during the hearings.",
      "\"That's right,\" Prelogar said.",
      "Professor Tobias said that the law does include a provision that would allow the president to postpone the ban for up to 90 days, if he can show that the company is making substantial progress on alleviating national security issues. But, he said, it's not clear whether those conditions have been met.",
      "\"The best thing Trump could do is work with Congress, and not potentially be in violation of the law or have any questions left hanging,\" he said.",

    "story": [
      "President Donald Trump travelled to California on Friday to survey the destruction from deadly wildfires that devastated several communities in the Los Angeles area earlier this month.",
      "The visit, coming at the end of Trump's first week back in office, took place as he continued to denounce the state emergency response being led by Democratic Governor Gavin Newsom - one of Trump's fiercest critics - and worries the president might withhold aid over policies in the liberal state.",
      "Despite the political rivalry, Newsom greeted Trump on the tarmac as he emerged from Air Force One, arriving from North Carolina where he toured damage from Hurricane Helene, which rocked the western part of the state in September.",
      "Trump's visit came as new fires ignited in southern California, and local officials continue to contend with dry and windy weather conditions that favour fire growth.",
      "Speaking to reporters after shaking hands with Newsom, Trump said: \"I appreciate the governor coming out and meeting me\".",
      "\"We want to get it fixed,\" he continued, telling Newsom that aftermath looks \"like you got hit by a bomb\".",
      "Newsom, who Trump has nicknamed \"Newscum\", then thanked Trump for coming to visit, telling him: \"We're going to need your support, we're going to need your help\".",
      "\"You were there for us during Covid, I don't forget that, and I have all the expectations that we'll be able to work together to get this speedy recovery,\" Newsom continued.",
      "Trump then toured the ruins of Pacific Palisades neighbourhood with his wife Melania, and then attended a roundtable discussion with local leaders, including LA Mayor Karen Bass. He vowed to sign an executive order that would pump water from northern parts of the state to the south.",
      "He quarrelled briefly with Mayor Bass after she said that residents must be patient - because clean-up crews need time to clear \"hazardous waste\" such as toxic ash from things like lead, polyaromatic hydrocarbons and asbestos - before they can return to their homes.",
      "\"What's hazardous waste? I mean, you're going to have to define that,\" Trump remarked, adding: \"I just think you have to allow the people to go on their site and start the process tonight.\"",
      "New blazes - named Laguna,  Sepulveda, Gibbel, Gilman and Border 2 - flared up on Thursday in the counties of Los Angeles, San Diego, Ventura and Riverside - all in southern California.",
      "Firefighters have made progress in bringing the 10,000-acre Hughes Fire in Los Angeles under control, containing it by 79% since it broke out on Wednesday, forcing tens of thousands of people to evacuate.",
      "Fires have devastated the US state over the last few weeks, with the Palisades and Eaton fires scorching a combined total of more than 37,000 acres and killing at least 28 people. Multiple neighbourhoods have been levelled, leaving more than 10,000 homes and businesses in ashes.",
      "\"Unfortunately, it's a very sad period, but what makes you feel good is I met so many of the homeowners, and every one of them, a lot of them, and every one of them said to me, they want to rebuild,\" Mr Trump said after flying over by helicopter and touring the ruins on foot.",
      "\"The federal government is standing behind you 100%,\" he told local leaders.",
      "Governor Newsom on Thursday announced a $2.5bn (\u00a32bn) state-level aid package to deal with the fire damage.",
      "Trump has been critical of the response to the California fires, threatening to withhold federal assistance unless the state does not change its water laws and implement laws requiring an ID to vote in elections.",
      "\"After that, I will be the greatest president that California has ever seen,\" Trump said earlier.",
      "California does not usually require ID to vote but does to register to vote.",
      "Newsom's office said in a statement on social media that: \"Conditioning aid for American citizens is wrong\".",
      "Brian Rice, the president of the California Professional Firefighters, told the BBC that he hopes Trump does not deny the state federal aid.",
      "\"The most important focus we have is getting federal aid into California, into these communities where people have lost their lives, their homes,\" he said.",
      "The city is set to host both the 2028 Summer Olympics and Fifa World Cup matches in 2026 - two global events that will thrust the Los Angeles region into the spotlight.",
      "Trump has also been critical of the work done by the Federal Emergency Management Agency (Fema) - which is tasked with responding to such disasters - under the Biden administration.",
      "He has suggested getting rid of the agency and letting US states manage disasters in their jurisdictions.",
      "\"Fema is a very expensive, in my opinion, mostly failed situation,\" Trump told local leaders. \"Each state should take care of their problem and get money from the federal government. It would be so much better.\"",
      "He made similar remarks during a visit to North Carolina, where at least 104 people were killed in a hurricane, claiming that \"Fema was not doing their jobs\" in that state.",
      "He noted that some residents still don't have power or hot water and it was \"totally unacceptable\".",
      "Asked by the BBC whether he would withhold federal aid to California, but not North Carolina, Trump said that the situations in the two states are different.",
      "His response came after he touted the \"big numbers\"  North Carolina had given him when he carried the state in the 2024 presidential election. He later noted that he had won the state in every general election and Republican primary contest in which he had been on the ballot.",
      "Meanwhile, California has consistently voted against Trump in the past three presidential elections by substantial margins.",
      "Los Angeles is under an elevated fire risk area today with brisk winds, according to BBC Weather.",
      "Rain is expected over the weekend in the county,  as well as snow up in the mountains of southern California.",

      "The Israel Defense Forces (IDF) says the building was targeted because it was a Hezbollah \"terrorist command centre\" and it \"eliminated\" a Hezbollah commander. It added that \"the overwhelming majority\" of those killed in the strike were \"confirmed to be terror operatives\".",
      "But a BBC Eye investigation verified the identity of 68 of the 73 people killed in the attack and uncovered evidence suggesting just six were linked to Hezbollah's military wing. None of those we identified appeared to hold a senior rank. The BBC's World Service also found that the other 62 were civilians - 23 of them children.",
      "Among the dead were babies only a few months old, like Nouh Kobeissi in apartment -2B. In apartment -1C, school teacher Abeer Hallak was killed alongside her husband and three sons. Three floors above, Amal Hakawati died along with three generations of her family - her husband, children and two granddaughters.",
      "Ashraf and Julia had always been close, sharing everything with each other. \"She was like a black box, holding all my secrets,\" he says.",
      "On the afternoon of 29 September, the siblings had just returned home from handing out food to families who had fled the fighting. Hundreds of thousands of people in Lebanon had been displaced by the war.",
      "Ashraf was in the shower, and Julia was sitting in the living room with their father, helping him upload a video to social media. Their mother, Janan, was in the kitchen, clearing up.",
      "Then, without warning, they heard a deafening bang. The entire building shook, and a massive cloud of dust and smoke poured into their apartment.",
      "\"I shouted, 'Julia! Julia!,'\" says Ashraf.",
      "\"She replied, 'I'm here.'",
      "\"I looked at my dad, who was struggling to get up from the sofa because of an existing injury to his leg, and saw my mother running toward the front door.\"",
      "Julia's nightmare was playing out in real life.",
      "\"Julia was hyperventilating, crying so hard on the sofa. I was trying to calm her down and told her we needed to get out. Then, there was another attack.\"",
      "Video footage of the strike, shared online and verified by the BBC, reveals four Israeli missiles flying through the air towards the building. Seconds later, the block collapses.",
      "Ashraf, along with many others, was trapped under the rubble. He began calling out, but the only voice he could hear was that of his father, who told him he could still hear Julia and that she was alive. Neither of them could hear Ashraf's mother.",
      "Ashraf sent a voice note to friends in the neighbourhood to alert them. The next few hours were agonising. He could hear rescuers sifting through the debris - and residents wailing as they discovered loved ones dead. \"I just kept thinking, please, God, not Julia. I can't live this life without Julia.\"",
      "Ashraf was finally pulled from the rubble hours later, with only minor injuries.",
      "He discovered his mother had been rescued but died in hospital. Julia had suffocated under the rubble. His father later told him Julia's last words were calls for her brother.",
      "In November, a ceasefire deal was agreed between Israel and Hezbollah with the aim of ending the conflict. The deal gives a 60-day deadline for Israeli forces to withdraw from southern Lebanon and for Hezbollah to withdraw its forces and weapons north of the Litani River. As this 26 January deadline approaches, we sought to find out more about the deadliest single Israeli attack on Lebanon in years.",
      "In the apartment below Julia and Ashraf's, Hawraa and Ali Fares had been hosting family members displaced by the war. Among them was Hawraa's sister Batoul, who, like Julia, had arrived the previous day - with her husband and two young children. They had fled intense bombardment near the Lebanon-Israel border, in areas where Hezbollah has a strong presence.",
      "\"We hesitated about where to go,\" says Batoul. \"And then I told my husband, 'Let's go to Ain El Delb. My sister said their building was safe and that they couldn't hear any bombing nearby.'\"",
      "Batoul's husband Mohammed Fares was killed in the Ain El Delb attack. A pillar fell on Batoul and her children. She says no-one responded to her calls for help. She finally managed to lift it alone, but her four-year-old daughter Hawraa had been fatally crushed. Miraculously, her baby Malak survived.",
      "Three floors below Batoul lived Denise and Moheyaldeen Al-Baba. That Sunday, Denise had invited her brother Hisham over for lunch.",
      "The impact of the strike was brutal, says Hisham.",
      "\"The second missile slammed me to the floor\u2026 the entire wall fell on top of me.\"",
      "He spent seven hours under the rubble.",
      "\"I heard a voice far away. People talking. Screams and\u2026 'Cover her. Remove her. Lift the stone. He's still alive. It's a child. Lift this child.' I mean\u2026 Oh my God. I thought to myself, I'm the last one deep underground. No-one will know about me. I will die here.\"",
      "When Hisham was finally rescued, he found his niece's fiance waiting to hear if she was alive. He lied to him and told him she was fine. They found her body three days later.",
      "Hisham lost four members of his family - his sister, brother-in-law and their two children. He told us he had lost his faith and no longer believes in God.",
      "To find out more about who died, we have analysed Lebanese Health Ministry data, videos, social media posts, as well as speaking to survivors of the attack.",
      "We particularly wanted to interrogate the IDF's response to media - immediately following the attack - that the apartment block had been a Hezbollah command centre. We asked the IDF multiple times what constituted a command centre, but it did not give clarification.",
      "So we began sifting through social media tributes, gravesites, public health records and videos of funerals to determine whether those killed in the attack had any military affiliation with Hezbollah.",
      "We could only find evidence that six of the 68 dead we identified were connected to Hezbollah's military wing.",
      "Hezbollah memorial photos for the six men use the label \"Mujahid\", meaning \"fighter\". Senior figures, by contrast, are referred to as \"Qaid\", meaning \"commander\" - and we found no such labels used by the group to describe those killed.",
      "We asked the IDF whether the six Hezbollah fighters we identified were the intended targets of the strike. It did not respond to this question.",
      "One of the Hezbollah fighters we identified was Batoul's husband, Mohammed Fares. Batoul told us that her husband, like many other men in southern Lebanon, was a reservist for the group, though she added that he had never been paid by Hezbollah, held a formal rank, or participated in combat.",
      "Israel sees Hezbollah as one of its main threats and the group is designated a terrorist organisation by Israel, many Western governments and Gulf Arab states.",
      "But alongside its large, well-armed military wing, Hezbollah is also an influential political party, holding seats in Lebanese parliament. In many parts of the country it is woven into the social fabric, providing a network of social services.",
      "In response to our investigation, the IDF stated: \"The IDF's strikes on military targets are subject to relevant provisions of international law, including taking feasible precautions, and are carried out after an assessment that the expected collateral damage and civilian casualties are not excessive in relation to the military advantage expected from the strike.\"",
      "It had earlier also told the BBC it had executed \"evacuation procedures\" for the strike on Ain El Delb, but everyone we spoke to said they had received no warning.",
      "Watch on YouTube if outside the UK",
      "UN experts have raised concerns about the proportionality and necessity of Israeli air strikes on residential buildings in densely populated areas in Lebanon.",
      "This pattern of targeting entire buildings - resulting in significant civilian casualties - has been a recurring feature of Israel's latest conflict with Hezbollah, which began when the group escalated rocket attacks in response to Israel's war in Gaza.",
      "Between October 2023 and November 2024, Lebanese authorities say more than 3,960 people were killed in Lebanon by Israeli forces, many of them civilians. Over the same time period, Israeli authorities say at least 47 civilians were killed by Hezbollah rockets fired from southern Lebanon. At least 80 Israeli soldiers were also killed fighting in southern Lebanon or as a result of rocket attacks on northern Israel.",
      "The missile strike in Ain El Delb is the deadliest Israeli attack on a building in Lebanon for at least 18 years.",
      "The village remains haunted by its impact. When we visited, more than a month after the strike, a father continued to visit the site every day, hoping for news of his 11-year-old son, whose body had yet to be found.",
      "Ashraf Ramadan, too, returns to sift through the rubble, searching for what remains of the memories his family built over the two decades they lived there.",
      "He shows me the door of his wardrobe, still adorned with pictures of footballers and pop stars he once admired. Then, he pulls a teddy bear from the debris and tells me it was always on his bed.",
      "\"Nothing I find here will make up for the people we lost,\" he says.",

      "Coleman Boyd, who was among those pardoned by Trump on Thursday, said at the annual March for Life rally that Trump should support a national abortion ban, something he has said he would veto if such a law were to be passed by Congress.",
      "\"I'm very thankful that he pardoned us. I think he's done lots of amazing things in the first week. I just think he is bad off on abortion,\" Mr Boyd, 53, told BBC News.",
      "\"I think he is a horrible president when it comes to abortion.\"",
      "Trump addressed the annual gathering in a pre-recorded video message on Friday, in which he vowed to \"stop the radical Democrat push for a federal right to unlimited abortion-on-demand\".",
      "He referred to his role in appointing a conservative-majority Supreme Court which overturned the national right to abortion in 2022.",
      "\"That historic wrong was set right three years ago. I was so proud to be a participant,\" he said.",
      "The March for Life rally has been held in the US capital every year since 1974, a year after abortion was legalised by the Supreme Court in Roe v Wade.",
      "Mr Boyd, who travelled from Nashville to be in Washington after he was pardoned, said that Trump is \"misguided\" in his belief that abortion rights should be decided by individual states.",
      "\"He is way less pro-life than he was back in 2016. But I think absolutely he is a potential ally,\" said Mr Boyd, who believes there all abortion should be banned, including in cases of rape and incest.",
      "Other rally-goers, including a woman named Rosie who spoke to the BBC, praised Trump for his role in overturning Roe v Wade, but said he must do more to make abortion a \"non-option\".",

      "During his campaign against former Vice-President Kamala Harris, Trump treaded lightly on the issue of abortion, an issue that galvanised female voters during the 2022 midterm elections and one that Democrats highlighted with their message of reproduction access rights.",
      "In October, one month before the election, he posted on social media in all-capital letters: \"Everyone knows I would not support a federal abortion ban, under any circumstances, and would, in fact, veto it, because it is up to the states to decide based on the will of the their voters.\"",
      "But many at the rally say he should do more to block first-term abortions, and access to abortion medications which can be purchased online and sent via the mail.",
      "Other prominent Republicans also spoke at the rally, including Vice-President JD Vance, who appeared in person to praise Trump's second term in office as the \"return of the most pro-family, most pro-life American president of our lifetime\".",

      "Warning: This report contains descriptions of violence against children",
      "In his ruling Judge Zani said he was not convinced that the defendant's rights, particularly her concerns about prison conditions and a possible life sentence without parole, would be infringed on by extradition.",
      "\"I am of the firm opinion that the defendant's extradition to the United States of America to face criminal prosecution complies with all of her Convention Rights within the meaning of the Human Rights Act 1998,\" Judge Zani said.",

      "In the days that followed, the third child was moved into foster care and, on Christmas Day, she told her foster carer that Ms Singler had been responsible for the attack and had asked her to lie to police, Mr Smith said.",

      "The police investigation then led to a warrant being issued by Fourth Judicial District Court in El Paso County, Colorado, for Ms Singler's arrest.",
      "Mr Smith said Ms Singler was arrested in the Chelsea area of west London on 30 December.",
      "It is not for the court in London to carry out a criminal trial.",
      "However, in his ruling published on Friday Judge Zani said: \"I note that the defendant, through counsel, has clearly stated that her defence to the charges is a total denial of liability.\""

Speaking to BBC Radio 4's Today programme, he added: \"We should incentivise Putin to say, 'OK, it's time actually to have a ceasefire.'\"",
      "Meanwhile, Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky told the World Economic Forum on Tuesday that at least 200,000 peacekeepers would be needed under any agreement.",

      "Currently, the main Russian exports to the US are phosphate-based fertilisers and platinum.",
      "Speaking to the BBC, Volker said the Russian economy could take \"substantial\" damage if Trump chose to preserve or strengthen the toughest US sanctions so far, which he said were only levied as Trump's predecessor Joe Biden left office. \"Russia really didn't feel as much pressure as they could,\" he commented.",
      "On social media, there was a generally scathing response to Trump's comments from Ukrainians. Many suggested that more sanctions would be a weak reply to Russian aggression. But the biggest question for most is what Putin is actually open to discussing with Ukraine at any peace talks.",

    "story": [
      "A bid to free five elephants from a Colorado zoo has been rejected after a court ruled elephants are not people.",
      "An animal rights group argued Missy, Kimba, Lucky, LouLou and Jambo were effectively imprisoned at the zoo, and had filed to have them moved to an elephant sanctuary.",
      "It tried to bring a habeas corpus claim on behalf of the animals - a legal process which allows a person to challenge their detention in court.",
      "The Colorado Supreme Court said the matter boiled down to \"whether an elephant is a person\" and therefore had the same liberty rights as a human - ultimately deciding that they did not.",
      "It ruled 6-0 in favour of a previous district court decision that said the state's habeas corpus process \"only applies to persons, and not to nonhuman animals\".",
      "This was true \"no matter how cognitively, psychologically, or socially sophisticated they may be,\" State Supreme Court Justice Maria Berkenkotter added in her ruling.",
      "While she said the five elderly African elephants were \"majestic,\" the court ruled the claim could not be brought \"because an elephant is not a person\".",
      "The Nonhuman Rights Project (NRP) petitioned for the elephants to be moved from Cheyenne Mountain Zoo to a \"suitable elephant sanctuary\" in 2023.",
      "The group argued the animals had a right to freedom because they were emotionally complex and intelligent animals.",
      "It claimed the elephants showed signs of \"trauma, brain damage, and chronic stress\" and that they were effectively \"imprisoned\" at the zoo.",
      "Cheyenne Mountain Zoo rejected the claim, arguing the elephants had received remarkable care, and was supported by a district court.",
      "After the Supreme Court ruling, Cheyenne Mountain Zoo called NRP's lawsuit \"frivolous\" and said it had \"wasted\" time and money on the case.",
      "It accused the group of \"abusing court systems to fundraise\" and claimed its goal was \"to manipulate people into donating to their cause by incessantly publicising sensational court cases with relentless calls for supporters to donate\".",

    "published": "Sat, 25 Jan 2025 01:15:34 GMT",
    "summary": "Several potential US buyers have expressed interest in purchasing the social media platform.",
    "story": [
      "Jimmy Donaldson - aka MrBeast - was jubilant as he told his tens of millions of TikTok followers about his bid to buy the platform.",
      "\"I might become you guys' new CEO! I'm super excited!\" Donaldson said from a private jet. He then proceeded to promise $10,000 to five random new followers.",
      "The internet creator's post has been viewed more than 73 million times since Monday. Donaldson said he could not share details about his bid, but promised: \"Just know, it's gonna be crazy.\"",
      "Donaldson is one of multiple suitors who have expressed interest in purchasing TikTok, the wildly popular social media platform that's become the subject of a fast-moving political drama in the United States.",
      "Last year, then-President Joe Biden signed a law that gave TikTok's China-based parent company ByteDance until 19 January to sell the platform or face a ban in the United States.",
      "The legislation addressed concerns about TikTok's links to the Chinese government and worries about the app being a national security risk.",
      "President Donald Trump has floated the possibility of a joint venture.",
      "\"I would like the United States to have a 50% ownership position,\" he said in a Truth Social post on Sunday. \"By doing this, we save TikTok, keep it in good hands and allow it to [stay up].\"",
      "Trump has since signed an executive order that allows the app to stay operational for another 75 days.",
      "Earlier this month, Bloomberg reported that China was considering a TikTok sale to Elon Musk, the world's richest man and a close ally of President Trump,  who already owns the social media platform X.",
      "Musk himself wrote on X this week that while he has long been against a TikTok ban, \"the current situation where TikTok is allowed to operate in America, but X is not allowed to operate in China is unbalanced. Something needs to change\".",
      "At a news conference Tuesday, Trump was asked by a reporter if he would be open to Musk buying the platform.",
      "\"I would be if he wanted to buy it, yes,\" the president replied.",
      "\"I'd like Larry to buy it, too,\" Trump added, referring to Oracle chairman Larry Ellison, a long-time Trump supporter who was on stage with him for a separate announcement.",
      "Oracle is one of TikTok's main server providers, managing many of the data centres where billions of the platform's videos are stored.",
      "Last year, Oracle warned that a TikTok ban could hurt its business. The cloud computing giant was also a leading contender to buy the social media platform in 2020, back when Trump was trying to ban it.",
      "Billionaire investor Frank McCourt has also expressed interest in TikTok, and has been doing media interviews about the prospect for several months.",
      "McCourt has said he wants TikTok to run on technology overseen by the Project Liberty Institute, which he founded. He has been critical of data collection practices of social media companies.",
      "Project Liberty is bidding for TikTok without its proprietary algorithm. McCourt told CNBC this week that Project Liberty is \"not interested in the algorithm or the Chinese technology\" even as he acknowledged that the platform is \"worth less\" without it.",
      "Ultimately, President Trump is likely to have a major role in selecting a US buyer of TikTok.",
      "\"It's going to be a winner that's likely to be politically sympathetic to President Donald Trump,\" said Anupam Chander, a law professor at Georgetown University.",
      "Prof Chander said the 50-50 joint ownership model does not comport with the law's requirements, which might prompt Trump to pressure Congress into revising the law.",
      "For now, the platform's future remains in limbo.",
      "Prof Chander said the Biden administration made an \"unforced error\" by allowing the law to give the president outsized control over who owns TikTok.",
      "\"It was a terrible idea to put the future of a massive information platform into this political maelstrom,\" Prof Chander said."

    "published": "Sat, 25 Jan 2025 01:33:48 GMT",
    "summary": "Amie, a descendant of a Holocaust survivor, meets Cornelia, who is untangling her family's Nazi past.",
    "story": [
      "It doesn't matter how much you prepare for it. It still takes you by surprise. As the great-granddaughter of a woman who was murdered in Auschwitz, I am meeting the granddaughter of a man who drove Jews to their death. I'm lost for words.",
      "I never got to meet my grandfather Ludvig, who survived the Holocaust, or his mother Rachel. They were put onto a cattle cart to the Auschwitz death camp in 1944. Ludvig, who was about 15 at the time, was separated from his mother and sent to another concentration camp. But Rachel was tortured, gassed and murdered.",
      "I grew up hearing so many stories about them, and spending time with other Holocaust survivors in my family in Australia. They were at the forefront of my mind when I found myself in Germany interviewing Cornelia Stieler.",
      "Cornelia's grandfather was the main breadwinner in a household with very little income. He originally worked as a coal miner, but after a near-fatal accident which left him trapped under coal for two days, he decided to do something else. Things turned around when he eventually got a job at Deutsche Reichsbahn as a train driver. Cornelia's mother used to speak of that achievement with pride, saying getting the job was \"the chance of a lifetime\".",
      "At first, he was transporting goods for the war effort. But it soon turned into something more sinister. \"I believe that my grandfather served as a train driver, commuting between the death camps. He stayed in Liegnitz, now Legnica, in a boarding school, so there was a certain separation from the family and between the death camps.\"",
      "Cornelia says that when her grandfather first started the job, he didn't know what it would become. \"I think my grandfather saw a lot of horrible things and didn't know how to get out of this work, didn't know how to deal with it.\"",
      "After training as a family therapist, she delved into her past and tried to understand him better. She tells me she started asking: \"At what point was he a perpetrator? Was he an accessory to perpetrators? When could he have left?\"",
      "At this point, my mouth is dry. My heart is racing. Listening to all of this feels like an out-of-body experience. All I can think about is how her grandfather drove trains into Auschwitz, and that's how my grandfather and great-grandmother ended up there. I'm thinking about all my other relatives - cousins that I know existed but know nothing about - who were murdered in Auschwitz too.",
      "\"If I were any younger, I think I'd feel a strong hate towards you,\" I tell her, fighting back tears. \"But I don't because saying all of those things must have been really difficult to admit.\"",
      "\"Give me your hand,\" Cornelia says, also welling up. \"It's important. Your tears, and my touch, are touching me\u2026 My grandfather was a train driver in Auschwitz. What can I say? Nothing.",
      "\"I can't apologise, it's not possible,\" she adds, implying the crime is too grave. \"My grandfather felt very, very guilty, and he died with his guilt.\" Cornelia thanks me for my openness and says there's a need to fully uncover the history.",
      "Then she says something you might not expect - that some Germans from Sch\u00f6nwald, where her family came from, had reacted angrily to her research. The now Polish town renamed Bojk\u00f3w, some 100km from Krak\u00f3w, hasn\u2019t come to terms with its Nazi past.",
      "Cornelia explains that originally, the town was against the ideology of the Nazi Party, but over time, became consumed by it. Hitler saw Sch\u00f6nwald as a model village - an Aryan village in a land of Slavs. He was hoping that a \"fifth column\" of ethnic Germans there would become a useful aid in the military.",
      "It was the site of the Gleiwitz incident - a false flag incident staged by Nazi Germany in 1939 to justify the invasion of Poland, one of the triggers of World War Two. And in 1945, towards the end of the war, it was the first German village to be attacked by advancing Soviet forces.",
      "But just before that, it was the scene of one of the Nazis' so-called death marches.",
      "As Soviets approached Auschwitz, Hitler's elite guard, the SS, forced around 60,000 prisoners there - mostly Jews - to move further west. Between 19 and 21 January 1945, one of those marches passed through Sch\u00f6nwald. In below freezing temperatures, the prisoners were dressed only in their thin striped uniforms with just wooden shoes on their feet. Those who collapsed from starvation and exhaustion were shot.",
      "Those who survived were put onto open cattle cart trains heading further west, usually to other concentration camps, like Buchenwald. The Nazis wanted to hold onto their slave labour - even at this point, some still believed in an ultimate triumph of the Third Reich.",
      "A local history and religion teacher, Krzysztof Kruszynski, takes me to the main street where the death march passed. People wait to catch their bus outside the main church on Rolnikow Street - known as Bauer-Strasse in German times. He points to ground, and tells me these are the original cobble stones that the prisoners had to walk on.",
      "\"It is a silent witness of the death march,\" he says. \"But the stone cannot talk.\"",
      "This history has been buried until now - partly because Germans from Sch\u00f6nwald were forced to flee after the Soviet attack that came soon after and Poles resettled the village. One German-Polish woman in her 80s, Ruta Kassubek, told me how drunk Soviet soldiers had stormed her family home and murdered her father. But there's another reason: an active suppression of the past.",
      "It didn't surprise me that some Germans had responded negatively to Cornelia's research. Germany prides itself on its Erinnerungskultur, or culture of remembrance: mandatory Holocaust education, museums, memorials. But many see that as the job of state and government. And while they\u2019re happy enough to face the past in the abstract, it's harder to deal with their own family history, says Benjamin Fischer, a former Jewish student leader and political consultant. He calls it the \"deindividualisation of history\".",
      "A study by Bielefeld University found that a third of Germans believed their family members helped save Jews during the Holocaust. That's \"ridiculous\", says Benjamin, and \"statistically impossible\".",
      "On the ground in Bojk\u00f3w, 80 years after the death march, things are changing. Last week, a delegation of Germans, Jews and Poles, including local authorities, schools and emergency services unveiled a new memorial commemorating those who died in the town's death march.",
      "Cornelia and Krzysztof were there. For Cornelia the history is deeply personal. She is convinced that studying and remembering it is key to understanding how society could change so rapidly. And I'm grateful for it. Their work and passion gives me hope in a world of rising antisemitism - as I try to keep the memory of how my family came to be murdered alive.",
      "The people of Sch\u00f6nwald believed their town lay at the pinnacle of high culture and spirituality. But then it \"folded into immorality\", Cornelia says. \"This is a development that we need to understand\u2026 They weren't solely good or evil. People can go into jobs with good intentions but very quickly, [find themselves] on the wrong side.",
      "\"We can't change the past. We can't turn back time. But it's important to talk about this, to remind people of what happened, to remind people of what humans can do to one another.\"",

    "summary": "Throughout the Israeli bombardment, the Civil Defence was responsible for pulling the living and the dead from the rubble.",
    "story": [
      "At some of the many thousands of funerals in Gaza over the past 15 months, mourners have laid a bright orange vest over the body.",
      "The vests are usually well worn and marked by dust, sometimes blood. They belong to the Civil Defence, Gaza's main emergency service.",
      "Throughout the Israeli bombardment, the Civil Defence was responsible for pulling the living and the dead from the rubble. Along with Gaza's ambulance service, the rescue workers have taken on some of the most harrowing work in the strip.",
      "And they have paid a steep price. On the first full day of peace on Monday, the agency said that 99 of its rescue workers had been killed and 319 wounded, some with life-changing injuries.",
      "When the Civil Defence buries its own, where possible the vests of the dead are laid on their bodies.",
      "\"We put the vest there because our colleague sacrified his soul in it,\" said Nooh al-Shaghnobi, a 24-year-old rescue worker, in a phone interview from Gaza City.",
      "\"We hope it will show God that this man did good with his life, that he saved others.\"",
      "Israel killed more than 47,000 Palestinians in Gaza during the conflict - mostly women and children - and wounded more than 111,000, according to the Hamas-run health ministry, whose figures seen reliable by the UN. A recent study published by the Lancet medical journal found that the death toll during the first nine months of the war may have been underestimated by more than 40%.",
      "The fragile ceasefire that came into effect last weekend is holding. But for the rescue workers of the Civil Defence, the next phase of their work is just beginning.",
      "The agency estimates that there are more than 10,000 people buried under the vast sea of rubble across Gaza. The figure is based on information collected throughout the war about who was in each building destroyed by Israel, and who the agency knows to have been recovered already.",
      "In areas that were completely occupied by Israeli forces during the destruction, they do not have detailed information and are relying on residents to help them. In the Tel el-Hawa neighbourhood of Gaza City on Tuesday, rescue worker Al-Shaghnobi found a man with information about the fate of a flattened apartment building.",
      "\"He told us seven dead were recovered, but there was an elderly gentleman, a child and an infant left behind,\" Al-Shaghnobi said.",
      "\"Fortunately there was a privately-owned bulldozer nearby and we were able to excavate the top layer of rubble,\" he said. \"And underneath we found three skeletons that matched the description.\"",
      "Al-Shaghnobi has accrued a large following during the war by sharing his experiences on social media. Though he pixelates some images, others show the horrors he and other young rescue workers have faced.",
      "One video shows him under the rubble, carefully extricating the body of an infant from around the body of another small child, who is alive. Other images he sent to the BBC show the extreme nature of the rescue work.",
      "\"You should become numb as time goes on,\" Al-Shagnobi said, during a shift in Gaza City. \"But I have become worse. I feel more pain, not less. I find it harder to cope. I have seen 50 of my colleagues die in front of me. Who outside of Gaza can imagine this?\"",
      "As the first of the Israeli hostages were released from Gaza last week, in exchange for 90 Palestinians from Israeli jails, Israeli authorities described the extensive psychological support waiting for the returning hostages.",
      "But for those experiencing horrors in Gaza, such support is extremely limited. None of the four rescue workers who spoke to the BBC this week from Gaza said they had been offered counselling.",
      "\"We all need this,\" said Mohammed Lafi, a 25-year-old rescue worker in Gaza City, \"but no one talks about it.\"",
      "Lafi, who has been with the agency for six years, has a wife and infant son at home. \"When I pull the body of a baby from the rubble I scream inside myself if he is the same age as my son. My body shakes.\"",
      "Even if counselling were to be widely available, \"a year of therapy would not be enough for one day of this job,\" said Abdullah al-Majdalawi, a 24-year-old Civil Defence worker who lives with his parents in Gaza City.",
      "Al-Majdalawi said that when he returned to his home between shifts he did small jobs and chores constantly, \"because I have become afraid of my own memories\".",
      "\"I am very solitary now,\" he said. \"I do not really talk to others about what I have seen. But I feel that my whole body is becoming tight, and I need some kind of therapy because things are accumulating.\"",
      "The Civil Defence workers had come to be viewed from the outside as heroes, Al-Majdalawi said. \"But they do not see what is happening inside. Inside I am fighting a war against myself.\"",
      "As the ceasefire began, new images from inside Gaza showed scenes of near-total destruction, particularly in the north of the enclave. Civil Defence spokesman Mahmoud Basal said that the agency hoped to recover the remaining dead from under the rubble within 100 days, but he acknowledged it was a difficult target, because they have virtually no bulldozers and other heavy equipment yet.",
      "The Civil Defence has accused Israel of deliberately targeting and destroying its vehicles and equipment in strikes - an accusation Israel denies. Rescue workers told the BBC they were currently working with simple hand tools like hammers and had few working vehicles. \"We have so little equipment we need another Civil Defence to rescue the Civil Defence,\" Al-Majdalawi said.",
      "A spokesman for the agency said on Friday they had been able to recover just 162 bodies since the ceasefire began nearly a week ago.",
      "The UN aid coordination office OCHA has warned that the recovery of the bodies could take years, owing to the lack of equipment, personnel, and what it estimates is 37 million tonnes of rubble littered with unexploded bombs and dangerous materials like asbestos.",
      "The amount of time that many of the dead also hinders the identification process. At the European Hospital in Khan Younis in the south of Gaza, people were searching for loved ones this week among remains brought to the hospital and laid outside on white sheets. In many cases, the only option was to search for shoes, clothes or other personal effects.",
      "\"I believe I will recognise my son immediately, even if his face has no features and he is only a skeleton,\" said Ali Ashour, a university professor, of his 18-year-old boy Mahjoud.",
      "\"I will recognise him because I am his father and I know him better than a million people,\" he said.",
      "Ashour still harboured hope that Mahjoud might have been taken prisoner, he said, but he planned to search the dead every day until he knew. \"Any time they bring more remains I will come,\" he said. \"And if I see my son I will lift him out from between the other bodies and carry him away.\"",
      "Nisreen Shaaban was searching for her 16-year-old son Moatassem, who she said had left their home in Beit Hanoun for 15 minutes and never returned.",
      "\"I have opened every shroud here looking for the clothes he was wearing, trying to smell his scent,\" she said. She was surrounded by human remains. \"I feel as though I am living in a cemetery,\" she said. \"It is a city of horrors.\"",
      "The Civil Defence agency estimates that nearly 3,000 people may have been incinerated in the bombardment, robbing some families of an end to their search. But there are many more than that who still need to be recovered.",
      "\"These people need to be found and honoured,\" Al-Shaghnobi, the rescue worker, said. \"This work awaits us. All we need is the equipment and we will do it.\"",

    "published": "Fri, 24 Jan 2025 00:02:10 GMT",
    "summary": "Engineers are working on systems that can turn lunar regolith into useful elements like oxygen.",
    "story": [
      "Inside a giant sphere, the engineers pored over their equipment. Before them stood a silvery metal contraption swathed in colourful wires \u2013 a box that they hope will one day make oxygen on the moon.",
      "Once the team vacated the sphere, the experiment began. The box-like machine was now ingesting small quantities of a dusty regolith \u2013 a mixture of dust and sharp grit with a chemical composition mimicking real lunar soil.",
      "Soon, that regolith was gloop. A layer of it heated to temperatures above 1,650C. And, with the addition of some reactants, oxygen-containing molecules began to bubble out.",
      "\u201cWe\u2019ve tested everything we can on Earth now,\u201d says Brant White, a program manager at Sierra Space, a private company. \u201cThe next step is going to the moon.\u201d",
      "Sierra Space\u2019s experiment unfolded at Nasa\u2019s Johnson Space Center this summer. It is far from the only such technology that researchers are working on, as they develop systems that could supply astronauts living on a future lunar base.",
      "Those astronauts will need oxygen to breathe but also to make rocket fuel for spacecraft that might launch from the moon and head to destinations further afield \u2013 including Mars.",
      "Lunar base inhabitants might also require metal and they could even harvest this from the dusty grey debris that litters the lunar surface.",
      "Much depends on whether we can build reactors able to extract such resources effectively or not.",
      "\u201cIt could save billions of dollars from mission costs,\u201d says Mr White as he explains that the alternative \u2013 bringing lots of oxygen and spare metal to the moon from Earth \u2013 would be arduous and expensive.",
      "Luckily, the lunar regolith is full of metal oxides. But while the science of extracting oxygen from metal oxides, for example, is well understood on Earth, doing this on the moon is much harder. Not least because of the conditions.",
      "The huge spherical chamber that hosted Sierra Space\u2019s tests in July and August this year induced a vacuum and also simulated lunar temperatures and pressures.",
      "The company says it has had to improve how the machine works over time so that it can better cope with the extremely jagged, abrasive texture of the regolith itself. \u201cIt gets everywhere, wears out all sorts of mechanisms,\u201d says Mr White.",
      "And the one, crucial, thing that you can\u2019t test on Earth or even in orbit around our planet, is lunar gravity \u2013 which is roughly one sixth that of the Earth. It might not be until 2028 or later that Sierra Space can test its system on the moon, using real regolith in low gravity conditions.",
      "The moon\u2019s gravity could be a real problem for some oxygen-extracting technologies unless engineers design for it, says Paul Burke at Johns Hopkins University.",
      "In April, he and colleagues published a paper detailing the results of computer simulations that showed how a different oxygen-extracting process might be hindered by the moon\u2019s relatively feeble gravitational pull. The process under investigation here was molten regolith electrolysis, which involves using electricity to split lunar minerals containing oxygen, in order to extract the oxygen directly.",
      "The problem is that such technology works by forming bubbles of oxygen on the surface of electrodes deep within the molten regolith itself. \u201cIt is the consistency of, say, honey. It is very, very viscous,\u201d says Dr Burke.",
      "\u201cThose bubbles aren\u2019t going to rise as fast \u2013 and may actually be delayed from detaching from the electrodes.\u201d",
      "There could be ways around this. One could be to vibrate the oxygen-making machine device, which might jiggle the bubbles free.",
      "And extra-smooth electrodes might make it easier for the oxygen bubbles to detach. Dr Burke and his colleagues are now working on ideas like this.",
      "Sierra Space\u2019s technology, a carbothermal process, is different. In their case, when oxygen-containing bubbles form in the regolith, they do so freely, rather than on the surface of an electrode. It means there is less chance of them getting stuck, says Mr White.",
      "Stressing the value of oxygen for future lunar expeditions, Dr Burke estimates that, per day, an astronaut would require the amount of oxygen contained in roughly two or three kilograms of regolith, depending on that astronaut\u2019s fitness and activity levels.",
      "However, a lunar base\u2019s life support systems would likely recycle oxygen breathed out by astronauts. If so, it wouldn\u2019t be necessary to process quite as much regolith just to keep the lunar residents alive.",
      "The real use case for oxygen-extracting technologies, adds Dr Burke, is in providing the oxidiser for rocket fuels, which could enable ambitious space exploration.",
      "Obviously the more resources that can be made on the moon the better.",
      "Sierra Space\u2019s system does require the addition of some carbon, though the firm says it can recycle most of this after each oxygen-producing cycle.",
      "Along with colleagues, Palak Patel, a PhD student at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, came up with an experimental molten regolith electrolysis system, for extracting oxygen and metal from the lunar soil.",
      "\u201cWe\u2019re really looking at it from the standpoint of, \u2018Let\u2019s try to minimise the number of resupply missions\u2019,\u201d she says.",
      "When designing their system, Ms Patel and her colleagues addressed the problem described by Dr Burke: that low gravity could impede the detachment of oxygen bubbles that form on electrodes. To counter this, they used a \u201csonicator\u201d, which blasts the bubbles with sound waves in order to dislodge them.",
      "Ms Patel says that future resource-extracting machines on the moon could derive iron, titanium or lithium from regolith, for example. These materials might help lunar-dwelling astronauts make 3D-printed spare parts for their moon base or replacement components for damaged spacecraft.",
      "The usefulness of lunar regolith does not stop there. Ms Patel notes that, in separate experiments, she has melted simulated regolith into a tough, dark, glass-like material.",
      "She and colleagues worked out how to turn this substance into strong, hollow bricks, which could be useful for building structures on the moon \u2013 an imposing black monolith, say. Why not?",

Often what is recovered is no more than a pile of bones. Israel's high explosive bombs blasted and mangled into pieces many of the dead. The bones and scraps of clothing are placed in white body bags upon which Mr Homs writes the Arabic word \"majhoul\". It means \"unidentified\".",
      "A resident of Rafah, Osama Saleh, went back to his home after the ceasefire and found a skeleton inside. The skull was fractured. Mr Saleh reckons the body lay there for four to five months. \"We are humans with feeling\u2026I can't convey to you how miserable the tragedy is,\" he says.",

The child was kept at the back of the group while the elderly woman and her son looked under the cover of the body bag. They stared for a few seconds and then embraced each other in grief.",

      "One day at the start of the war Aya went to go to the bathroom upstairs at the school and - her family says - she was shot in the chest by an Israeli sniper.

      "The law, which passed in both houses of parliament in June last year before being endorsed by the Thai king in September, is a big step for LGBTQ+ rights.",
      "Thailand remains an outlier in Asia in recognising marriage equality - only Nepal and Taiwan have legalised same-sex unions.",
      "It's one reason why Aki Uryu, who is Japanese, moved to Bangkok to be with her partner. She said life is difficult for the LGBTQ+ community back home: \"In Thailand, I can hold hands with my partner, walk together. No one says anything. It's just different. It feels right.\"",
      "After the two women married on Thursday, Aki said: \"It is like I have started my new life.\"",
      "Watching them celebrate, along with so many other couples in a Bangkok mall, was Mr Zhang, a gay Chinese man who did not want to reveal his first name.",
      "\"We're excited, we're also very jealous,\" he said. \"Thailand is so close to China, but in another sense it's so far away.\"",
      "And yet, even in Thailand, with its famed tolerance towards LGBTQ+ people, activists say it took a sustained campaign to win legal recognition.",
      "A long wait",
      "\"We've been waiting for this day for 18 years - the day everyone can recognise us openly, when we no longer need to be evasive or hide,\" 59-year-old Rungtiwa Thangkanopast, who will marry her partner of 18 years in May, told the BBC earlier this week.",
      "She had been in a marriage, arranged by her family, to a gay man, who later died. She had a daughter, through IVF, but after her husband's death began spending time, and later helping run, one of the first lesbian pubs in Bangkok. Then she met Phanlavee, who's now 45 and goes by her first name only.",
      "On Valentine's Day 2013 the two women went to the Bang Rak district office in central Bangkok to ask to be officially married - a popular place for marriage registration because the name in Thai means \"Love Town\".",
      "This was the time when LGBTQ+ couples began challenging the official view of marriage as an exclusively heterosexual partnership by attempting to get marriage certificates at district offices.",
      "There were around 400 heterosexual couples waiting with them on that day. Rungtiwa and Phanlavee were refused, and the Thai media mocked their effort, using derogatory slang for lesbians.",
      "Still, activists managed to persuade the government to consider changing the marriage laws. A proposed civil partnership bill was put before parliament, offering some official recognition to same-sex couples, but not the same legal rights as heterosexual couples.",
      "A military coup in 2014 which deposed the elected government interrupted the movement. It would be another decade before full marriage equality was approved by parliament, in part because of the rise of young, progressive political parties that championed the cause.",
      "Their message resonated with Thais \u2013 and attitudes too had changed. By this time, same-sex marriage was legalised in many Western countries and same-sex love had become normalised in Thai culture too.",
      "Such was the shift in favour of the law that it was passed last year by a thumping majority of 400 votes to just 10 against. Even in the notoriously conservative senate only four opposed the law.",
      "And couples like Rungtiwa and Phanleeva now have their chance to have their love for each other recognised, without the risk of public derision.",
      "\"With this law comes the legitimacy of our family,\" Rungtiwa says, \"We're no longer viewed as weirdos just because our daughter isn't being raised by heterosexual parents.\"",
      "The new law takes out gender-specific terms like man, woman, husband and wife from 70 sections of the Thai Civil Code covering marriage, and replaces them with neutral terms like individual and spouse.",
      "However, there are still dozens of laws in the Thai legal code which have not yet been made gender-neutral, and there are still obstacles in the way of same-sex couples using surrogacy to have a family.",
      "Parents are still defined under Thai law as a mother and a father. The law also does not yet allow people to use their preferred gender on official documents; they are still stuck with their birth gender. These are areas where activists say they will still need to keep pushing for change.",
      "And it is especially significant for older couples, who have had to ride out the shifts in attitude.",
      "\"I really hope people will put away the old, stereotypical ideas that gay men cannot have true love,\" said Chakkrit \"Ink\" Vadhanavira.",
      "He and his partner Prinn, both in their 40s, have been together for 24 years.",
      "\"The two of us have proved that we genuinely love each other through thick and thin for more than 20 years,\" Chakkrit said. \"We have been ready to take care of each other since our first day together. We are no different from heterosexual couples.\"",
      "While Chakkrit's parents quickly accepted their partnership, it took Prinn's parents seven years before they could do so.",
      "The couple also wanted to share the production business they ran together, and other assets, as a couple, so they asked Prinn's parents to adopt Chakkrit officially, giving him the same family name. Prinn says the new law has brought welcome legal clarity to them.",
      "\"For example, right now when a same sex couple buy something together \u2013 a large item - they cannot share ownership of it,\" said Prinn. \"And one of us passes away, what both of us have earned together cannot be passed on to the other. That's why marriage equality is very significant.\"",
      "Today, said Prinn, both sets of parents treat them as they would just like any other married children.",
      "And when they had relationship problems like any other couple, their parents helped them.",
      "\"My dad even started reading gay magazines to understand me better. It was quite cute to see that.\"",

      "When Zhang Junjie was 17 he decided to protest outside his university about rules made by China's government. Within days he had been admitted to a psychiatric hospital and treated for schizophrenia.",
      "Junjie is one of dozens of people identified by the BBC who were hospitalised after protesting or complaining to the authorities.",
      "Many people we spoke to were given anti-psychotic drugs, and in some cases electroconvulsive therapy (ECT), without their consent.",
      "While there have been reports for decades that hospitalisation is used in China as a way of detaining dissenting citizens without involving the courts, a leading Chinese lawyer has told the BBC that the issue - which legislation sought to resolve - has recently seen a resurgence.",
      "Junjie says he was restrained and beaten by hospital staff before being forced to take medication.",
      "His ordeal began in 2022, after he protested against China's harsh lockdown policies. He says his professors spotted him after just five minutes and contacted his father, who took him back to the family home. He says his father called the police, and the next day - on his 18th birthday - two men drove him to what they claimed was a Covid test centre, but was actually a hospital.",
      "\"The doctors told me I had a very serious mental disease\u2026 Then they tied me to a bed. The nurses and doctors repeatedly told me, because of my views on the party and the government, then I must be mentally ill. It was terrifying,\" he told the BBC World Service. He was there for 12 days.",
      "Junjie believes his father felt forced to hand him over to the authorities because he worked for the local government.",
      "Just over a month after being discharged, Junjie was once again arrested. Defying a fireworks ban at Chinese New Year (a measure brought in to fight air pollution) he had made a video of himself setting them off. Someone uploaded it online and police managed to link it to Junjie.",
      "He was accused of \"picking quarrels and troublemaking\" - a charge frequently used to silence criticism of the Chinese government. Junjie says he was forcibly hospitalised again for more than two months.",
      "After being discharged, Junjie was prescribed anti-psychotic drugs. We have seen the prescription - it was for Aripiprazole, used to treat schizophrenia and bipolar disorder.",
      "\"Taking the medicine made me feel like my brain was quite a mess,\" he says, adding that police would come to his house to check he had taken it.",
      "Fearing a third hospitalisation, Junjie decided to leave China. He told his parents he was returning to university to pack up his room - but, in fact, he fled to New Zealand.",
      "He didn't say goodbye to family or friends.",
      "Junjie is one of 59 people who the BBC has confirmed - either by speaking to them or their relatives, or by going through court documents - have been hospitalised on mental health grounds after protesting or challenging the authorities.",
      "The issue has been acknowledged by China's government - the country's 2013 Mental Health Law aimed to stop this abuse, making it illegal to treat someone who is not mentally unwell. It also explicitly states psychiatric admission must be voluntary unless the patient is a danger to themselves or others.",
      "In fact, the number of people detained in mental health hospitals against their will has recently surged, a leading Chinese lawyer told the BBC World Service. Huang Xuetao, who was involved in drafting the law, blames a weakening of civil society and a lack of checks and balances.",
      "\"I have come across lots of cases like this. The police want power while avoiding responsibility,\" he says. \"Anyone who knows the shortcomings of this system can abuse it.\"",
      "An activist called Jie Lijian told us he had been treated for mental illness without his consent in 2018.",
      "Lijian says he was arrested for attending a protest demanding better pay at a factory. He says police interrogated him for three days before taking him to a psychiatric hospital.",
      "Like Junjie, Lijian says he was prescribed anti-psychotic drugs that impaired his critical thinking.",
      "After a week in the hospital, he says he refused any more medication. After fighting with staff, and being told he was causing trouble, Lijian was sent for ECT - a therapy which involves passing electric currents through a patient's brain.",
      "\"The pain was from head to toe. My whole body felt like it wasn't my own. It was really painful. Electric shock on. Then off. Electric shock on. Then off. I fainted several times. I felt like I was dying,\" he says.",
      "He says he was discharged after 52 days. He now has a part-time job in Los Angeles and is seeking asylum in the US.",
      "People outside the UK can watch the documentary on YouTube.",
      "In 2019, the year after Lijian says he was hospitalised, the Chinese Medical Doctor Association updated its ECT guidelines, stating it should only ever be administered with consent, and under general anaesthetic.",
      "We wanted to find out more about the doctors' involvement in such cases.",
      "Speaking to foreign media such as the BBC without permission could get them into trouble, so our only option was to go undercover.",
      "We booked phone consultations with doctors working at four hospitals which, according to our evidence, are involved with forced hospitalisations.",
      "We used an invented story about a relative who had been hospitalised for posting anti-government comments online, and asked five doctors if they had ever come across cases of patients being sent in by police.",
      "Four confirmed they had.",
      "\"The psychiatric department has a type of admission called 'troublemakers',\" one doctor told us.",
      "Another doctor, from the hospital where Junjie was held, appears to confirm his  story that police continued surveillance of patients once discharged.",
      "\"The police will check up on you at home to make sure you take your medicine. If you don't take it you might break the law again,\" they said.",
      "We approached the hospital in question for comment but it did not respond.",
      "We have been given access to the medical records of democracy activist Song Zaimin, hospitalised for a fifth time last year, which makes it clear how closely political views appear to be tied to a psychiatric diagnosis.",
      "\"Today, he was\u2026  talking a lot, speaking incoherently, and criticising the Communist Party. Therefore, he was sent to our hospital for inpatient treatment by the police, doctors, and his local residents' committee. This was an involuntary hospitalisation,\" it says.",
      "We asked Professor Thomas G Schulze, president-elect of the World Psychiatric Association, to review these notes. He replied:",
      "\"For what is described here, no-one should be involuntarily admitted and treated against his will. It reeks of political abuse.\"",
      "Between 2013 and 2017, more than 200 people reported they had been wrongfully hospitalised by the authorities, according to a group of citizen journalists in China who documented abuses of the Mental Health Law.",
      "Their reporting ended in 2017, because the group's founder was arrested and subsequently jailed.",
      "For victims seeking justice, the legal system appears stacked against them.",
      "A man we are calling Mr Li, who was hospitalised in 2023 after protesting against the local police, tried to take legal action against the authorities for his incarceration.",
      "Unlike Junjie, doctors told Mr Li he wasn't ill but then the police arranged an external psychiatrist to assess him, who diagnosed him with bipolar disorder, and he was held for 45 days.",
      "Once released, he decided to challenge the diagnosis.",
      "\"If I don't sue the police it's like I accept being mentally ill. This will have a big impact on my future and my freedom because police can use it as a reason to lock me up any time,\" he says.",
      "In China, the records of anyone ever diagnosed with a serious mental health disorder could be shared with the police, and even local residents' committees.",
      "But Mr Li was not successful - the courts rejected his appeal.",
      "\"We hear our leaders talking about the rule of law,\" he told us. \"We never dreamed one day we could be locked up in a mental hospital.\"",
      "The BBC has found 112 people listed on the official website for Chinese court decisions who, between 2013 and 2024, attempted to take legal action against police, local governments or hospitals for such treatment.",
      "Some 40% of these plaintiffs had been involved in complaints about the authorities. Only two won their cases.",
      "And the site appears to be censored - five other cases we have investigated are missing from the database.",
      "The issue is that the police enjoy \"considerable discretion\" in dealing with \"troublemakers,\" according to Nicola MacBean from The Rights Practice, a human rights organisation in London.",
      "\"Sending someone to a psychiatric hospital, bypassing procedures, is too easy and too useful a tool for the local authorities.\"",
      "Eyes are now on the fate of vlogger Li Yixue, who accused a police officer of sexual assault. Yixue is said to have recently been hospitalised for a second time after her social media posts talking about the experience went viral. It is reported she is now under surveillance at a hotel.",
      "We put the findings of our investigation to the UK's Chinese embassy. It said last year the Chinese Communist Party \"reaffirmed\" that it must \"improve the mechanisms\" around the law, which it says \"explicitly prohibits unlawful detention and other methods of illegally depriving or restricting citizens' personal freedom\".",

      "\"I grew up in a village with fewer people than Palace Ukraine can hold,\" he said after the concert. \"So many people had told me: It's not going to happen... stand-up comedy has not reached that level.\"",
      "It has now, to a large extent because of the full-scale invasion launched by Russia.",
      "The invasion turned many Ukrainians away from the previously popular and lavishly promoted Russian acts and triggered a renewed interest in Ukrainian culture.",
      "Key Ukrainian comedians say they are now making jokes to help the public deal with the grim reality of war and also help the army by raising funds.",
      "\"Stand-up comedy is a budget version of psychotherapy,\" Anton Tymoshenko tells the BBC.",
      "\"I like to relieve social tension with my jokes. When that happens, that's the best thing.\"",

      "This kind of humour is grim, says comedian Hanna Kochehura, but making fun of the danger makes it easier to cope with.",

      "\"People can laugh at the news,\" Anton tells me.",
      "\"If we're not allowed to use [Western] missiles against targets in Russia  \u2014 yes, that is funny because it is absurd. I build upon this absurd fact, and it becomes funny.",

      "Some survivors have said they did not hear an alarm and experts have told the BBC they would not have expected such a high death toll in a hotel where fire protection systems were working properly.",
      "What went wrong?",
      "The 12-storey hotel at Turkey's popular Kartalkaya ski resort hosts tens of thousands of visitors every year, so Turks understandably want to know how such a terrible tragedy could have happened at the start of a two-week school holiday.",
      "The interior minister said the fire started at 03:27 (00:27 GMT) in the restaurant area on the fourth floor and firefighters arrived within 45 minutes.",
      "Some survivors have described smelling smoke as much as an hour earlier.",
      "Culture and Tourism minister Mehmet Nuri Ersoy said the hotel had a fire competence certificate \"issued by the fire department\".",
      "But that has been challenged by local mayor Tanju Ozcan, who said the fire department had not issued a positive report since 2007.",
      "Some survivors say they heard no alarm, while there have been claims of inadequacies in the hotel's fire extinguishing systems.",
      "\"My wife smelled the fire,\" said Atakan Yelkovan, who said he was staying on the third floor of the hotel.",
      "\"We went down earlier than others. The alarm did not go off... It took about an hour to an hour-and-a-half for the fire brigade to come. In the meantime, the fourth and fifth floors were burning. People on the upper floors were screaming.\"",
      "Some guests on higher floors tried to escape with their bedding and some jumped to their deaths.",
      "Eylem Senturk said the fire alarm did not go off until she was out of the building. Her husband had to jump off the hotel porch because of the smoke: \"We are very lucky to have survived.\"",
      "The BBC has tried to contact the hotel's managers regarding these allegations but has so far received no response.",
      "Eleven people, including the hotel owner, have been detained as part of the Turkish investigation.",
      "Hotel managers have issued a statement saying they mourn the losses and are co-operating fully with the authorities.",
      "Children among hotel fire dead as investigation continuesDozens killed as fire engulfs Turkish ski hotel",
      "Children among hotel fire dead as investigation continues",
      "Dozens killed as fire engulfs Turkish ski hotel",
      "What should have happened?",
      "In such a big building where fire systems are fully operational, experts say fire detectors are expected to respond to a fire within seconds and send an alert to a fire control dashboard.",
      "\"In a good business, there should be someone in charge of this panel 24 hours a day, seven days a week,\" Kazim Beceren, president of the Turkish Fire Protection and Education Foundation, told the BBC.",
      "The death toll is also extremely high, which raises further questions.",
      "\"There will always be fires, but we would not expect so many people to die in this type of building,\" said Prof Sevket Ozgur Atayilmaz, head of the Mechanical Engineering Department at Yildiz Technical University, who has worked on fire safety planning.",
      "\"If the structure is designed correctly for fire, if there are escape routes, and if the smoke is evacuated correctly, it is possible to overcome the fire without loss of life.\"",
      "The interior minister said there were two fire escapes, but there are indications they were not of a good standard.",
      "Were fire safety measures in place?",
      "An official from the Union of Chambers of Turkish Engineers and Architects (TMMOB) in Bolu, Erol Percin, said the way the fire had spread suggested that fire warning, detection and extinguishing systems might not have been present.",
      "He said the building's exterior wooden facade should have been 100% fire-resistant, but that did not appear to be the case.",
      "The head of the Turkish Fire Protection and Education Foundation told the BBC that the size of the fire suggested that \"the fire system either does not exist or was not designed in accordance with the standards\".",
      "There were 238 people staying in the Grand Kartal Hotel at the time.",
      "Kazim Beceren said fire safety systems were designed with the aim of taking three minutes to evacuate each floor - and a facility with more than 200 people could be evacuated in 15 to 30 minutes under ideal conditions.",
      "When an alarm goes off, the person in charge of the fire control dashboard is expected to check the location, according to the head of the Turkish Fire Protection and Education Foundation.",
      "If there is no indication of a false alarm or if a second detector sends a warning, fire alarms are then normally activated throughout the building.",
      "In a properly installed system, people are then directed by announcement to the nearest fire exits, with flashing lights for people who are hearing-impaired or audible warnings for those sleeping.",
      "As fires can spread very quickly, sprinkler systems are seen as highly important for intervention at an early stage.",
      "So too is a back-up power source. According to fire protection regulations, signs pointing to emergency exits and lights showing the paths to these exits have to work for one to three hours, even if there is a power outage.",
      "The engineers' and architects' union in Bolu said in a statement that \"an automatic sprinkler system is mandatory\" in buildings of this size.",
      "\"The photos on the hotel's website show that the automatic sprinkler system, which was supposed to be installed in 2008, was not installed. Because of this failure, the fire spread rapidly and there were casualties.\"",
      "BBC Turkish has not been able to independently confirm the allegations about either the wooden cladding on the building or the hotel's fire extinguishing system.",
      "Who checked the hotel's fire safety?",
      "One of the big questions is whether the hotel's fire systems were properly inspected.",
      "Bolu Mayor Tanju Ozcan said the ministry of tourism was responsible as the hotel was beyond the boundary of his town. Erol Percin agreed.",
      "The mayor said that the last time Bolu's municipality had given a report stating the hotel was fireproof was in 2007, and there had been no such checks since then.",
      "However, Culture and Tourism Mehmet Nuri Ersoy said the hotel did have a fire competence certificate \"issued by the fire department\" and inspections were down to them.",
      "There have also been calls for relatively old structures to come under scrutiny because of changing legislation.",
      "\"Places should stop operating if they  do not comply with current standards, in crowded places such as hotels, residences, nursing homes or kindergartens,\" says Prof Atayilmaz of Yildiz Technical University."

    "title": "Does China 'operate' Panama Canal like Trump says?",
    "published": "Wed, 22 Jan 2025 17:08:58 GMT",
    "summary": "The US president says the US should \"take back\" the famous waterway because China runs it now.",
    "story": [
      "During his inaugural address, President Donald Trump doubled down on his assertion that China runs the Panama Canal.",
      "\"China is operating the Panama Canal and we didn't give it to China. We gave it to Panama and we're taking it back,\" he said.",
      "The 51-mile (82km) Panama Canal cuts across the Central American nation and is the main link between the Atlantic and Pacific oceans.",
      "Up to 14,000 ships use it each year as a shortcut to a journey which, before the canal was built, would have taken them on a lengthy and costly trip around the tip of South America.",
      "What has Trump said about the canal?",
      "The mention of Panama in his inaugural speech is not the first time he has focused on the Central American nation and its transoceanic canal.",
      "On Christmas Day, Trump posted on social media that the \"wonderful soldiers of China\" were \"lovingly, but illegally, operating the Panama Canal\" - a claim which was swiftly denied by officials in Panama City and Beijing.",
      "At the time, Panamanian President Jos\u00e9 Ra\u00fal Mulino described the claim as \"nonsense\", stressing that there was \"absolutely no Chinese interference\" in the canal.",
      "Trump has also threatened to take the canal back by force, citing \"exorbitant\" fees being allegedly charged for US vessels to pass through it - another claim rejected by Panamanian authorities.",
      "Following Trump's inauguration address, President Mulino again stressed that there was \"no presence of any nation in the world that interferes with our administration\" of the Panama Canal.",
      "The strategic waterway, which handles about 5% of global maritime trade volume, is operated by the Panama Canal Authority, an agency of the Panamanian government, not Chinese soldiers.",
      "However, Mr Trump's inaccurate claim reflects the concerns of some US officials over China's significant investments in the canal and its surrounding infrastructure.",
      "What is the history of Panama Canal?",
      "Historically, the US played a pivotal role in the construction and administration of the passage, which links the Atlantic and Pacific oceans.",
      "After a failed attempt by the French to build it, the US secured the rights to undertake the project. The canal's construction was completed in 1914.",
      "It remained under US control until 1977, when then President Jimmy Carter signed a treaty to gradually hand it over to Panama, which Trump has referred to as \"foolish\".",
      "Since 1999, the Panama Canal Authority has held exclusive control over the operations of the waterway.",
      "The treaties signed by both the US and Panama stipulated that it shall remain permanently neutral, but the US reserves the right to defend any threat to the canal's neutrality using military force under this deal.",
      "What is China's role in the operations of the canal?",
      "There is no public evidence to suggest that the Chinese government exercises control over the canal, or its military. However, Chinese companies have a significant presence there.",
      "From October 2023 to September 2024, China accounted for 21.4% of the cargo volume transiting the Panama Canal, making it the second-largest user after the US.",
      "In recent years, China has also invested heavily in ports and terminals near the canal.",
      "Two of the\u202ffive ports\u202fadjacent to the canal, Balboa and Crist\u00f3bal, which sit on the Pacific and Atlantic sides respectively, have been operated by a subsidiary of Hutchison Port Holdings since 1997.",
      "The company is a subsidiary of the publicly listed CK Hutchison Holdings, a Hong Kong-based conglomerate founded by Hong Kong businessman Li Ka-shing.",
      "It has port operations\u202fin 24 countries, including the UK.",
      "Although it is not state-owned by China, says Ryan Berg, director of the  Americas Program at the Centre for Strategic and International Studies, there have been concerns in Washington over how much control Beijing would be able to exert over the company.",
      "A wealth of potentially useful strategic information on ships passing through the waterway flows through these ports.",
      "\"There is an increasing geopolitical tension of economic nature between the US and China,\" Mr Berg says. \"That kind of information regarding cargo would be very useful in the event of a supply chain war.\"",
      "CK Hutchison did not respond to the BBC's request for comment.",
      "The bids to operate those ports faced almost no competition, according to Andrew Thomas, a professor at the University of Akron who has written a book on the canal. \"The US at the time didn't really care about these ports and Hutchison faced no objection,\" he says.",
      "Chinese companies, both private and state-owned, have also strengthened their presence in Panama through billions of dollars in investments, including a cruise terminal and a bridge to be built over the canal.",
      "This \"package of Chinese activities\", as described by Mr Thomas, might have prompted Trump's assertion that the canal is \"owned\" by China, but operation of those ports does not equate to ownership, he stresses.",
      "Beijing has repeatedly said that China's ties with Latin America are characterised by \"equality, mutual benefit, innovation, openness and benefits for the people\".",
      "What are China's broader interests in Panama?",
      "Panama's strategic location means China has been vying to increase its influence in the country for years and expand its footprint on a continent that has traditionally been considered the \"backyard\" of the US.",
      "In 2017, Panama broke diplomatic ties with Taiwan and established formal relations with China \u2013 a huge win for Chinese diplomacy.",
      "Months later, Panama became the first Latin American country to join China's signature Belt and Road Initiative, a trillion-dollar global infrastructure and investment initiative.",
      "The Dominican Republic, El Salvador, Nicaragua, and Honduras followed suit and also severed ties with Taipei in favour of Beijing.",
      "China has slowly expanded its soft power by opening its first Confucius Institute in the country and providing a grant to build a railway. Chinese companies have also sponsored \"media training\" for Panamanian journalists.",

      "In a trembling voice she explains how her home in Omdurman had been raided during Sudan's violent civil war, which erupted in 2023.",
      "The family went to Egypt first before paying traffickers $350 (\u00a3338) to take them to Libya, where they had been told life would be better and they would be able to find jobs in cleaning and hospitality.",
      "But as soon as they crossed the border, Layla says the traffickers held them hostage, beat them and demanded more money.",
      "\"My son needed medical attention after he was hit repeatedly in the face,\" she tells the BBC.",
      "The traffickers released them after three days, without saying why. Layla thought her new life in Libya was starting to get better after the family managed to travel west and she rented a room and started working.",
      "But one day her husband left to look for work and never returned. Then her 19-year-old daughter was raped by a man known to the family through Layla's job.",
      "\"He told my daughter he would rape her younger sister if she spoke about what he did to her,\" Layla says.",
      "She speaks in hushed tones fearing the family will be evicted if their landlady hears about the threats.",
      "Layla says they are now trapped in Libya: they have no money left to pay traffickers to leave and cannot return to war-torn Sudan.",
      "\"We have barely any food,\" she says, adding that her children are not in school. \"My son is afraid to leave the house as other children often beat him and insult him for being black. I feel like I'm going to lose my mind.\"",
      "Millions have fled Sudan since the war between the army and the paramilitary Rapid Support Forces (RSF) erupted in 2023. The two sides had jointly staged a coup in 2021, but a power struggle between their commanders plunged the country into civil war.",
      "More than 12 million people have been forced from their homes, while famine has spread to five areas, with 24.6 million people - about half the population - in urgent need of food aid, experts say.",
      "The UN refugee agency says more than 210,000 Sudanese refugees are now in Libya.",
      "The BBC has spoken to five Sudanese families who initially went to Egypt, where they said they experienced racism and violence, before moving to Libya, believing it would be safer with better job opportunities. We contacted them through a researcher in migration and asylum seeker issues in Libya.",
      "Salma tells the BBC she was already living in Cairo, in Egypt, with her husband and three children when the Sudanese civil war broke out, but as huge numbers of refugees entered the country, conditions for migrants there worsened.",
      "They decided to move to Libya, but what was awaiting them there was a \"living hell\", Salma says.",
      "She describes how, as soon as they crossed the border, they were placed in a warehouse run by traffickers. The men wanted money that had been paid in advance to traffickers on the Egyptian side of the border, but it never arrived.",
      "Her family spent nearly two months in the warehouse. At one point, Salma was separated from her husband and taken to a room for women and children. Here, she says she and her two eldest children were subjected to various forms of brutality because they wanted the money.",
      "\"Their whips left marks on our bodies. They would beat my daughter and put my son's hands in a lit oven while I was watching.",
      "\"Sometimes I wished we would all die together. I could think of no other way out.\"",
      "Salma says her son and daughter were traumatised by the experience and have suffered from incontinence since. She then lowers her voice.",
      "\"They would take me to a separate room, the 'rape room' with different men each time,\" she says. \"I bear the child of one of them.\"",
      "Eventually, she raised some money through a friend in Egypt and the traffickers released the family.",
      "She says a doctor then told her it was too late for an abortion, and when her husband found out she was pregnant he abandoned her and the children, leaving them to sleep rough, eating leftovers from rubbish bins and begging in the street.",
      "They found refuge on a remote farm in north-western Libya for a while, spending whole days with little to no food. They quenched their thirst by drinking contaminated water from a nearby well.",
      "\"It breaks my heart to hear my [older] son saying he is literally dying from hunger,\" Salma says over the phone, as the cries of her baby grow louder in the background.",
      "\"He is so hungry,\" she says, \"but I have nothing, not even enough milk in my breasts to feed him.\"",
      "Jamila, a Sudanese woman in her mid-40s, also believed reports within the Sudanese community that a better life awaited them in Libya.",
      "She fled previous unrest in Sudan's western region of Darfur in 2014 and spent years in Egypt before moving to Libya in late 2023. She says her daughters have been raped repeatedly since then - they were 19 and 20 when it first happened.",
      "\"I sent them for a cleaning job while I was ill; they came back at night covered with dirt and blood - four men raped them until one of them fainted,\" she tells the BBC.",
      "Jamila says she was also raped and held captive for weeks by a man, much younger than her, who had offered her a job cleaning his house.",
      "\"He used to call me a 'disgusting black'. He raped me and said, 'This is what women were made for,'\" she recalls.",
      "\"Even kids here are mean to us, they treat us as beasts and sorcerers, they insult us for being black and African, are they not Africans themselves?\" Jamila says.",
      "When her daughters were raped the first time, Jamila took them to hospital and reported it to police. But when the police officer realised they were refugees, Jamila says he withdrew the report and warned her that she would be jailed if the complaint was officially filed. This was in the west of Libya.",
      "Libya is not a signatory to the 1951 Refugee Convention or the 1967 protocol relating to the Status of Refugees - and considers refugees and asylum-seekers \"illegal migrants\".",
      "The country is divided into two, with each part run by a different government, but the situation is easier for migrants in the east as they can file official complaints without being detained, and access healthcare more easily, according to human rights group Libya Crimes Watch.",
      "While sexual violence is common within unofficial facilities run by traffickers, there is also evidence that abuse is happening in official detention centres in Libya, especially in the west.",
      "Hanaa, a Sudanese woman who works gathering plastic bottles from bins to feed her children, says she was abducted in western Libya and taken to a forest and raped at gunpoint by a group of men.",

      "\"Young men and boys were beaten and forced to completely remove their clothes while I was watching,\" Hanaa tells the BBC.",
      "\"I was there for days. I slept on the bare floor, resting my head on my plastic slippers. They would let me go to the toilet after hours of begging. I was repeatedly beaten on the head.\"",
      "There have been numerous previous reports of migrants from other African countries being abused in Libya. The country is a key stepping stone on the way to Europe, although none of the women the BBC spoke to planned to travel there.",

    "published": "Thu, 23 Jan 2025 03:09:55 GMT",
    "summary": "Thailand is set to legalise same-sex marriage - one of the few places in Asia to do so. Why is it an outlier?",
    "story": [
      "\"It has been a long fight full of tears for us.\"",
      "That is how Ann \"Waaddao\" Chumaporn describes the years that led to this moment \u2013 when hundreds of couples are tying the knot as Thailand legalises same-sex marriage.",
      "And the same question which has been heard throughout the long campaign to get the equal marriage law passed is being asked again: why Thailand? Why nowhere else, aside from Taiwan and Nepal, in Asia?",
      "People think they know the answer. Thailand is famously open to and accepting of lesbian, gay, bisexual and trans people. They have long been visible in all walks of life. Thai people are easy-going about pretty much everything. \"Mai pen rai\" \u2013 no big deal \u2013 is a national catch-phrase. Buddhist beliefs, followed by more than 90% of Thais, don't forbid LGBT lifestyles. Surely, then, equal marriage was inevitable.",
      "Except it wasn't. \"It was not easy,\" says Ms Waaddao, who organises Bangkok Pride March.",
      "The first Pride march in Thailand took place only 25 years ago. Back then it was hard to get approval from the police, and the march was a chaotic, unfocused event. After 2006 only two marches took place until 2022. In 2009 one planned Pride march in Chiang Mai had to be abandoned because of the threat of violence.",
      "\"We were not accepted, by our own families and by society,\" Ms Waaddao adds. \"There were times when we did not think marriage equality would ever happen, but we never gave up.\"",
      "'We did not fight, we negotiated'",
      "For all of Thailand's general tolerance of LGBT people, getting equal rights, including marriage, required a determined campaign to change attitudes in Thai officialdom and society. And attitudes have changed.",
      "When Chakkrit \"Ink\" Vadhanavira started dating his partner in 2001, they were both actors playing leading roles in TV series. At that time homosexuality was still officially described by the Thai Ministry of Health as a mental illness.",
      "Are you in a same sex relationship in Thailand? Get in touch.",
      "Marriage equality eludes Japan's same-sex couples",
      "Why legalising gay sex in India is not a Western idea",
      "\"Back then society could not accept leading male roles being played by a gay man. There was lots of gossip about us in the media, much of it untrue, which really stressed us,\" Mr Chakkrit recalls.",
      "\"We decided then that if we were going to date each other, we had to leave showbiz.\"",
      "They are still together but they have stayed out of the limelight for more than 20 years, running a successful production company.",
      "A lot has changed in that time \u2013 and their industry gets some credit for that.",
      "The way LGBT characters are portrayed in Thai TV dramas, from comical oddities to mainstream roles, made a big difference, according to Tinnaphop Sinsomboonthong, an assistant professor at Thammasat University who self-identifies as queer.",
      "\"Nowadays they represent us as normal characters, like you see in real life,\" he says. \"The kind of LGBTQ+ colleague you might have in the office, or your LGBTQ+ neighbour.  This really helped change perceptions and values in all generations.\"",
      "The so-called Boy Love dramas have helped bring the rest of society round to the idea of not just tolerance, but full acceptance and equal rights for the community.",
      "These romantic television dramas featuring love affairs between beautiful young men have grown enormously in popularity over the past decade, especially during the Covid pandemic.",
      "They are now one of Thailand's most successful cultural exports, with huge audiences in places like China. Series like My School President and Love Sick have got hundreds of millions of views on streaming networks.",
      "At the same time, activists became more focused and united in their bid to get the law changed. The many different LGBT groups came together in the Change 1448 campaign \u2013 1448 is the clause in the Thai Civil Code covering the definition of marriage \u2013 and later under the Rainbow Coalition for Marriage Equality.",
      "They linked up with other groups fighting for greater rights and freedoms in Thailand, and they learned to work with political parties in parliament to persuade them to change their stance on the law.",
      "The resumption of Pride marches in 2022, and getting the government to recognise and promote the appeal of Thailand as an attractive destination for LGBT travellers also helped change public perceptions.",
      "\"We did not fight, we negotiated,\" Mr Tinnaphop says. \"We knew we had to talk to Thai society, and little by little, we shifted attitudes.\"",
      "The right political moment",
      "Getting the equal marriage law through parliament was also helped by political developments in Thailand.",
      "For five years following a coup in 2014, the country was ruled by a conservative military government, which was willing only to consider recognising civil partnerships for LGBT couples, without full rights like inheritance.",
      "But in the 2019 election which returned Thailand to civilian rule, a new, youthful reformist party called Future Forward, which fully supported equal marriage, did unexpectedly well. They won the third-largest share of seats, revealing a growing hunger for change in Thailand.",
      "When a year later Future Forward was dissolved by a controversial court verdict, it set off months of student-led protests calling for sweeping reforms, including curbs to the monarchy's power.",
      "LGBT campaigners were prominent in those protests, giving them greater national prominence. The protests eventually died down, with many of the leaders arrested for questioning the monarchy's role.",
      "But in the 2023 election the successor to Future Forward, calling itself Move Forward, performed even better than in 2019, winning more seats than any other party. Again, it was clear that the desire for change was felt across Thai people of all ages.",
      "Move Forward was blocked from forming a government by conservatives who objected to its call for wholesale political reforms.",
      "But by this time, equal marriage was less contentious. Few opposed it. And passing it gave the unwieldy and unpopular coalition government which had been formed without Move Forward a quick accomplishment with which to please most of the country.",
      "Pioneering move may boost tourism",
      "Thailand, though, is an outlier in Asia. Few other countries in the region are likely to follow suit.",
      "The influence of Islam in Malaysia, Indonesia and Brunei makes the notion of equal marriage a non-starter. LGBT communities there face discrimination and prosecution; in Brunei sex between men carries the death penalty.",
      "In the Philippines, there is growing acceptance of LGBT couples living together openly. But the Roman Catholic Church vehemently opposes same-sex marriage.",
      "In Vietnam, like Thailand, there are no religious or ideological obstacles, but campaigning to change the law, as happened in Thailand, is difficult under a repressive regime.

      "The couple, who rose to stardom on \"The Hills,\" a spin-off of \"Laguna Beach,\" filed the lawsuit Tuesday along with more than 20 other property owners and residents who were affected by the Palisades Fire. The complaint blames Los Angeles and its municipal water department for the water issues that hampered firefighting efforts and says it ultimately led to the damage to their properties.",
      "The Eaton and Palisades fires, ignited by strong winds during one of the region's driest years on record, have killed 28 people and destroyed more than 16,000 structures, Cal Fire says, putting them among the most destructive fires in California history.",

California Gov. Gavin Newsom has called for an independent investigation into the LA water utility over the issues.",
      "The complaint filed by the couple and others mentions that the Santa Ynez Reservoir, which services the Pacific Palisades neighborhood, was offline and had been out of commission since February 2024 while awaiting repairs. The hydrants in the neighborhood were connected to three tanks that held 1 million gallons of water each and went dry within 12 hours, the complaint said, citing Janisse Qui\u00f1ones, the water utility's chief executive and chief engineer.",
      "Without water from the reservoir, firefighters had to primarily rely on the water tanks that weren't designed to fight such a large fire, the complaint said.",
      "The city and water utility didn't immediately respond to emailed requests for comment.",
      "While the repairs to the reservoir were requested in January 2024, the water utility told the Los Angeles Times they wouldn't be completed until April or May 2025.",
      "The lawsuit called the Palisades Fire an \"inescapable and unavoidable consequence\" of the water system operated by the city and water utility.",
      "\"The system necessarily failed, and this failure was a substantial factor in causing Plaintiffs to suffer the losses alleged in this complaint,\" it said.",
      "The plaintiffs cite the principle known as \" inverse condemnation,\" which is the same mechanism that requires utilities to pay for wildfire damages caused by their equipment.",

    "story": [
      "On January 7, as the Palisades Fire exploded, a man interrupted a reporter's live shot. It was Steve Guttenberg, one of the biggest movie stars of the 1980s and '90s. He had been moving cars \u2013 abandoned by people around Pacific Palisades trying to escape the encroaching fire \u2013 so that emergency vehicles could get through.",
      "\"What's happening is, people take their keys with them as if they're in a parking lot. This is not a parking lot,\" he told KTLA. \"If you leave your car behind, leave the key in there so a guy like me can move your car so that these fire trucks can get up there.\"",
      "He can't remember how he got to safety.",
      "Many days later, with much of his hometown reduced to ruins, he was still there to help protect his and his neighbors' homes. He showed me a part of Sunset that had been stacked with cars. \"Yeah, couldn't get through,\" he said. \"So, I was moving some of these cars over there. And then, a lotta these cars just didn't have keys in them. Locked.\"",
      "I asked, \"What is it in you that is compelling you to stay here?\"",
      "\"You know, it's not often in life that you feel like you can make a difference,\" he replied. \"And I really feel like I can make a difference. Like, I'm able bodied, I'm strong, I have a heart, and I care. And this is what I'm supposed to do today.\"",
      "If you know Guttenberg, you know he's a helper. Seven years ago, he put everything on hold to care for someone with whom he was deeply in love: his father.",
      "I noted, \"I'm gonna try to get through this interview without crying because I lost my dad.\"",
      "Guttenberg asked, \"What was your dad's name?\"",
      "\"Douglas.\"",
      "\"Hi, Douglas!\" Guttenberg said. \"You know, when you say a person's name who's passed, they come around. I believe they're not always with you, 'cause they've got other things to do. But Douglas is here, and so is Stanley, my dad.",
      "\"My dad was the greatest,\" he said. \"He was the first man who ever held me, first guy I ever looked in his eyes. And I fell in love with my dad.\"",
      "Guttenberg has written a book about his journey as a caregiver for the man he calls his hero. It's called \"Time to Thank.\" \"My dad and his dad weren't close,\" he said. \"My grandfather was cold. He wasn't a kissing, hugging type of dad to my father. So, my dad was the opposite.\"",
      "A \"kissing and hugging dad\" who worked jobs that weren't exactly touchy-feely. \"He was an Airborne Army Ranger. He was a New York City policeman. He was a power lifter and a weightlifter. And he did handstands for 20 minutes.\"",
      "Guttenberg's dad was a hands-on parent, so it was to Steve's surprise that when he wanted to move to L.A., at only 17, to try to become a movie star, he was allowed to do it. \"My parents gave me $300 and said, 'You got two weeks.' And I got a Kentucky Fried Chicken commercial. And my parents let me stay another two weeks. And I got a little movie [\"The Chicken Chronicles\"]. And I got more commercials. Then, I actually stayed a year, before I quit and went back to school.\"",
      "He wasn't in school for long when Hollywood beckoned him back. \"I was at a party in my suite at Albany State, and got this call from my agent. Everybody was a little \u2026 inebriated!\" he laughed. \"And my agent said, 'I got an audition for you. It was called \"Boys From Brazil.\" And it was gonna be starring Greg Peck and Larry Olivier and James Mason, Uta Hagen.'\"",
      "\"It's hard to turn that down, right?\" I said.",
      "\"Yeah! I asked my dad. My dad said, 'You know, just go down and do the audition. if you get it, you'll decide. And I got the job.\"",
      "Guttenberg says it was Laurence Olivier who taught him humility, but it was his dad who helped him get his big break in a little film about a bunch of misfits joining the police force. \"I told my dad that I had a screen test coming up for this movie, 'Police Academy.' And he said, 'Oh, you should wear my police academy shirt.' I remember going to the screen test, and I was up against another actor who was really talented,. And the director said, 'Hold on here: Did you make that shirt, boy?' And I said, 'No, that's my dad's real police academy shirt.' And half a day later my agent called me and said, 'You got it.' And maybe it was because of that cadet shirt that my dad gave me.\"",
      "Guttenberg would go on to become one of the busiest actors of his generation, with more than 100 films and TV shows under his belt, including \"Diner,\" \"Three Men and a Baby, \"Cocoon,\" and \"Short Circuit.\" All the while his dad was there ready to bring him back to reality, often calling before the rest of L.A. got out of bed. Guttenberg says he never missed that 6:00 a.m. call.\u00a0 \"No, I always had to be home at six o'clock. Even if I got home at 5 to 6:00! I had to answer that phone. He was my anchor.\"",
      "So when his dad was diagnosed with kidney failure while living in Phoenix, Guttenberg got in his car, driving 400 miles every week to care for his father. \"The drive really gave me time to think, and time to thank,\" he said.",
      "Steve and his siblings even become home dialysis techs, but only he couldn't accept the inevitable. \"I gave him a hug. And something didn't sound right. And we had a nurse with us, and the nurse put a stethoscope to him. And she said, 'He's gone.' And I said, 'No!' And I started doing CPR on him. I just couldn't accept it at that moment.\"",
      "Asked when he could finally let him go, Guttenberg replied, \"I probably let him go a year later. It's hard to believe that he's gone. I still think that he's here.\"",
      "\"He is,\" I said. \"Just say his name.\"",
      "\"Stanley!\"",
      "And right now, Guttenberg thinks his father is sending along some helpful advice. \"I feel my dad's around, yeah, I really do. I feel my dad is here with me. And I think he's also saying, 'Steven, enough. Get outta there.'\"",
      "So far, his own home is standing. But Steve Guttenberg says it's time to listen to his dad. \"You know, the truth is, no matter how big your house is, no matter how much money you have, how expensive your car, at the end of it, you're walking down the street with a little suitcase of a few things that you saved, and you're looking for someone to tell you where to go.\"",

      "Nearly $9 million of Kennedy's recent income came from his law firm, Kennedy and Madonna, LLP, now called Madonna and Madonna, LLP. In a letter dated Jan. 21, Kennedy wrote to the U.S. Office of Government Ethics that, if confirmed as HHS Secretary, he would sever ties with the firm and some other income sources to avoid conflicts of interest. His final payment from the firm was in May 2024, he said.",
      "The disclosures also make clear Kennedy still intends to receive legal fees from Wisner Baum, a firm suing the maker of the human papillomavirus (HPV) vaccine Gardasil over its alleged failure to warn consumers about its risks.",
      "\"Upon confirmation, I will retain an interest in contingency fee cases that do not involve claims against the United States and in which the United States is not a party and does not have a direct and substantial interest,\" Kennedy wrote in his disclosure.",

    "story": [
      "Discount store chain Target said Friday that it would join rival Walmart and a number of other prominent American brands in scaling back diversity, equity and inclusion initiatives that have come under attack from conservative activists and, as of this week, the White House.",
      "The Minneapolis-based retailer said the changes to its \"Belonging at the Bullseye\" strategy would include ending a program it established to help Black employees build meaningful careers, improve the experience of Black shoppers and to promote Black-owned businesses following the police killing of George Floyd in 2020.",
      "Target, which operates nearly 2,000 stores nationwide and employs more than 400,000 people, said it already had planned to end the racial program this year. The company said Friday that it also would conclude the diversity, equity and inclusion, or DEI, goals it previously set in three-year cycles.",
      "The goals included hiring and promoting more women and members of racial minority groups, and recruiting more diverse suppliers, including businesses owned by people of color, women, LGBTQ+ people, veterans and people with disabilities.",
      "Target has long been a fierce corporate advocate for the rights of Black and LGBTQ+ people. In a memo to employees, Kiera Fernandez, Target's chief community impact and equity officer, as a \"next chapter\" in a decades-long process to create \"inclusive work and guest environments that welcome all.\"",
      "\"Many years of data, insights, listening and learning have been shaping this next chapter in our strategy,\" Fernandez wrote in the memo, which Target shared Friday. \"And as a retailer that serves millions of consumers every day, we understand the importance of staying in step with the evolving external landscape, now and in the future.\"",
      "There's no doubt the U.S. civil rights landscape has undergone a massive transformation in the five years since much of corporate America adopted DEI goals in response to the Black Lives Matter protests that followed Floyd's death in Minneapolis.",
      "In 2020, Target pledged to give $10 million to social justice initiatives and to rebuild areas of the Twin Cities damaged by riots. At that time, Target leaders said they wanted to increase their Black workforce by 20% over the next three years.",
      "A 2023 U.S. Supreme Court decision that outlawed affirmative action in college admissions emboldened conservative groups to bring or threaten lawsuits targeting corporate initiatives such as employee resource groups and hiring practices that prioritize historically marginalized groups.",
      "Walmart, McDonald's, Ford, Harley-Davison, John Deere and Lowe's are among the well-known consumer brands that reduced or phased out their DEI commitments in recent months.",
      "President Donald Trump this week signaled his administration's agreement with conservatives who argue that policies designed to increase minority representation by considering factors such as race, gender and sexual orientation are unconstitutional.",
      "On his first day in office, Trump signed an executive order aimed at ending DEI programs within the federal government. The order cut funding for so-called DEI initiatives across all agencies in order to \"end DEI inside the federal government,\" according to Trump administration officials.",
      "A memo from the U.S. Office of Personnel Management Tuesday evening called for all federal DEI employees to be placed on leave by Wednesday evening.",
      "Unlike some of the companies retooling or retiring their diversity initiatives, Target's work to build a more inclusive workforce predated 2020, and the company also was long seen as a trailblazer with respect to LGBTQ+ inclusion.",
      "But the employee memo shared Friday said Target no longer would participate in surveys designed to gauge the effectiveness of its actions, including an annual index compiled by the Human Rights Campaign, a national LGBTQ+ rights organization. Target said it would further evaluate corporate partnerships to ensure they're connected directly to business objectives, but declined to share details.",
      "Getting corporations to withdraw from the Human Rights Campaign's Corporate Equality Index and to stop sponsoring Pride activities have been goals of DEI opponents.",
      "Steering clear of a backlash from conservative customers and organizations is something that Target has tried to navigate for a while. As transgender rights became a more prominent issue in 2016, the company declared that \"inclusivity is a core belief at Target\" and said it supported transgender employees and customers using whichever restroom or fitting room \"corresponds with their gender identity.\"",
      "But after some customers threatened to boycott Target stores, the company said that more stores would make available a single-toilet bathroom with a door that could be locked.",
      "In 2023, Target faced an anti-LGBTQ campaign that went viral on social media. The campaign\u00a0threatened employees and there were some instances of damaged products and displays in stores. In response, Target removed certain items that it said caused the most \"volatile\" reaction from opponents.",
      "The company did not stock its stores with Pride Month products in 2024.",

    "summary": "Republican lawmakers are floating a range of ideas to pay for an extension of President Trump's Tax Cuts and Jobs Act.",
    "story": [
      "A key economic priority for President Trump this year is to extend the provisions in his signature Tax Cuts and Jobs Act, a 2017 law that lowered tax rates for most Americans, before they expire at the end of 2025. Now, Republican lawmakers have developed a 50-page laundry list of ideas for how to pay for those planned cuts.",
      "The plan from congressional Republicans,\u00a0published earlier by the New York Times, was confirmed by a person familiar with the document, who noted that it represents a menu of policy options for lawmakers to consider. The document also cites several new tax breaks proposed by Mr. Trump while on the campaign trail last falls, such as eliminating taxes on overtime and tips.",
      "But extending the TCJA's provisions alone could prove costly, with the Congressional Budget Office forecasting a cost of $4.6 trillion over 10 years. Adding new tax breaks, such as Mr. Trump's promise to ditch taxes on overtime pay, could push up the bill even higher at a time when the nation's debt has spiraled to more than $36 trillion.",
      "According to the document, some ideas for funding those tax breaks include eliminating the mortgage home deduction, a popular break for homeowners, and the deductibility of student loan interest. Other methods to drum up more money include an across-the-board 10% import tariff \u2014 essentially, a universal tax on U.S. imports that would be paid by consumers.",
      "The plan also outlines ideas for cutting federal spending, primarily by trimming outlays for social safety net programs such as Medicaid and food stamps. Overall, the document points to a potential tax overhaul that could put more money in the pockets of wealthier \u00a0Americans while cutting assistance for low- and middle-class taxpayers, experts say.",
      "\"If you are extending the tax cuts and enacting tariffs and cutting Medicaid, that will deliver benefits more among higher-income households, and more of a cost will be born by lower-income households,\" Joseph Rosenberg, a senior fellow at the Urban-Brookings Tax Policy Center, a tax-focused think tank, told CBS MoneyWatch.",
      "Adding a blanket 10% tariff could raise $1.9 trillion over the next decade, according to the document shared with Republican lawmakers. But tariffs are largely paid by consumers because companies tend to raise their prices to cover the extra import duties. Mr. Trump's tariffs could add $2,600 a year in costs for the typical U.S. family, according to an August\u00a0analysis\u00a0from the Peterson Institute for International Economics, a nonpartisan think tank focused on economic issues.",

      "Damage caused by Hurricanes Helene and Milton helped push total economic losses from natural disasters in the U.S. to $217.8 billion last year, according to insurance broker Aon PLC. That figure represents an 85.3% increase from 2023, when losses totaled about $117.5 billion. It's also the largest annual tally of economic losses from natural disasters since 2017.",
      "Insured losses, or the portion of economic losses that are covered by insurance, also rose last year. They climbed 36% to $112.7 billion, the most since 2022. In some areas, homes are such great a risk that they're\u00a0too expensive to insure \u2014 if private insurance is even available at all.",
      "Hurricane Helene tore across six southeastern states last fall, costing $75 billion in economic losses, mainly due to inland and coastal flooding. according to Aon. Less than two weeks later, Hurricane Milton made landfall on the west coast of Florida, causing some $25 billion in economic losses.",
      "\"In 2024, one of the big differences is we had significant U.S. hurricane events that happened,\" said Liz Henderson, global head of climate risk advisory at Aon. \"When those events happen, they affect a large area and they affect areas with large values in terms of properties and people and content. So the losses from those events tend to be significantly higher.\"",
      "At least two other hurricanes, several severe \"convective\" storms and a draught contributed to the losses from natural disasters in the U.S. last year.",
      "In addition to the severe storms in the U.S., deadly floods in the Valencia region of Spain and other natural disasters drove worldwide economic losses from natural disasters to $368 billion last year, according to Aon. That's a 7.3% decline from 2023, but about 14% higher than the annual average going back to 2000. Global insured losses, meanwhile, climbed 15.1% to $145 billion.",
      "While it's impossible to predict the timing, location and losses from natural disasters, 2025 is not off to an encouraging start. The devastating wildfires that erupted in Los Angeles County on Jan. 7, killing at least 28 people and destroying more than 14,000 structures, are already projected to be among the costliest natural disasters.",
      "In a separate report last week, Aon estimated that total economic and insured losses for the two largest wildfires \u2014 the Palisades fire and the Eaton blaze burning just outside Los Angeles \u2014 could reach into the lower tens of billions of dollars, likely making them the costliest wildfires in U.S. history.",

    "summary": "Costco's public support of DEI programs contrasts with positions taken in recent months by other big U.S. brands",
    "story": [
      "Costco shareholders voted down a shareholder proposal urging the wholesale club operator to evaluate any risks posed by its diversity, equity and inclusion, or DEI, practices.",
      "According to preliminary results shared by Costco executives at its annual meeting Thursday, more than 98% of shares voted against the proposal.",
      "In a pre-recorded statement which was played at Costco's 2025 annual shareholders meeting on Jan. 23, the shareholder proposing the anti-DEI resolution, The National Center for Public Policy Research, said that \"Diversity, equity and inclusion may sound benign on the surface, but in reality it is weaponized language concealing a radical Marxist agenda.\"",
      "The shareholder continued to say that DEI \"comes at the expense of merit by not hiring and promoting completely, irrespective of race and sex.\"",
      "Prior to the shareholder meeting, Costco's board of directors had voted unanimously to ask investors to reject the motion. The board had said it believes \"our commitment to an enterprise rooted in respect and inclusion is appropriate and necessary. The report requested by this proposal would not provide meaningful additional information.\"",
      "Costco's defense of its DEI practices comes as other large U.S. corporations are shifting away from programs that encourage equality in the workplace for women, minorities and other groups. In recent weeks, companies including\u00a0Meta,\u00a0Ford,\u00a0McDonald's\u00a0and\u00a0Walmart\u00a0have ended their DEI programs, decisions that follow the 2023 Supreme Court decision\u00a0banning affirmative action\u00a0in college admissions, as well as pressure from conservative political activists.",
      "\"Our commitment to inclusion ... does not and has never included quotas or systematic preferences, nor does it mean compromising merit,\" said Tony E. James, Costco's board chair, said at Thursday's meeting. \"The demands of our business and our steadfast commitment to serve our members mean that we cannot afford to do anything but hire and promote the most qualified individuals,\"",
      "The National Center for Public Policy Research, a conservative think tank based in Washington, had earlier submitted a\u00a0proposal\u00a0asking Costco to examine the risks of its DEI program, arguing that such initiatives hold \"litigation, reputational and financial risks to the company, and therefore financial risks to shareholders.\"",
      "The think tank, which has made a similar proposal to Apple, cited the U.S. Supreme Court decision in July 2023 that outlawed affirmative action in college admissions.",
      "Costco: Diversity fosters \"creativity and innovation\"",
      "The directors' message to shareholders details how having diverse employees and suppliers has, in their view, fostered \"creativity and innovation in the merchandise and services that we offer\" and led to greater customer satisfaction among Costco members.",
      "In advance of the meeting, Neil Saunders, managing director of consulting firm GlobalData's retail division, said Costco could be confident the proposal would be rejected.",
      "\"I think people generally have confidence in Costco's management, and there's an attitude of 'Why rock the boat? It's sailing very nicely,'\" Saunders said.",
      "Costco's public stance in support of diversity, equity and inclusion programs contrasts with the positions taken in recent months by other big consumer brands that have backed away from DEI. Last week, more than 30 Walmart shareholders, including Amalgamated Bank and Oxfam America, asked the CEO of the nation's largest retailer to explain the business impact of curbing the company's DEI policies, a move they called \"disheartening.\"",
      "Emboldened by the Supreme Court's decision on affirmative action at colleges and universities, conservative groups have filed lawsuits making similar arguments about corporations, targeting initiatives such as employee resource groups and hiring practices that prioritize historically marginalized groups.",
      "On Monday, Trump signed an executive order aimed at terminating DEI programs within federal agencies. Conservatives have long condemned them, arguing they violate the U.S. Constitution by considering factors such as race, gender and sexual orientation.",
      "The Trump administration's plan includes leveraging the Justice Department and other agencies to probe private companies pursuing training and hiring practices that conservative critics consider discriminatory against people who do not belong to minority groups, such as white men.",
      "Costco's financial performance",
      "As for Costco, the National Center for Public Policy Research alleged that at least 200,000 of the company's 300,000 employees worldwide \"are potentially victims of this type of illegal discrimination because they are white, Asian, male or straight.\" If only a fraction of those employees were to sue Costco, the legal costs could be significant, the center said.",
      "Costco has a chief diversity officer, but the company's executive ranks do not reflect the diversity of its customers. Nearly 81% of the executives Costco had in place last year were white, and 72% of them were men, according to data published on its website. Saunders said members of Costco's management team typically stay a long time given the company's solid and stable financial performance.",
      "The warehouse giant's sales rose 7.5% in its most recent quarter versus the year-earlier period, while net income jumped 13% from a year earlier. Meanwhile, Costco's stock has soared about 36% during the past 12 months, outpacing the S&P 500's 26% gain over the same period.",
      "In other ways, Costco has been a bit of a maverick in the corporate world. It doesn't have an official corporate public relations team, and it hasn't focused on building up online business as much as rivals Walmart and Target.",
      "Apple's support of DEI",
      "The National Center for Public Policy Research intends to present a proposal at Apple's Feb. 25 shareholder meeting that goes beyond what the think tank wants from Costco. The center's resolution asks the tech company to abolish its inclusion and equity department, policies and goals, describing them as \"consistent with, if not more radical than, most corporate DEI programs.",
      "Apple's board wants shareholders to vote down the proposal, saying the company strives \"to create a culture of belonging where everyone can do their best work.\"",
      "JPMorgan CEO Jamie Dimon this week joined the corporate leaders taking a stand in support of the expanded diversity goals some companies added after the 2020 police killing of George Floyd. Dimon defended his bank's DEI policies during an interview with CNBC.",
      "\"We are going to continue to reach out to the Black community, Hispanic community, the LGBT community, the veterans community,\" he said, speaking Wednesday from the World Economic Forum meeting in Davos, Switzerland. \"And wherever I go, red states, blue states, green states, mayors, governors and they said they like what we do.\"",
      "Trump's actions this week increase the potential legal risks for companies that resist the conservative backlash against DEI, according to David Glasgow, executive director of the Meltzer Center for Diversity, Inclusion and Belonging at NYU School of Law. But most big companies will have consulted their lawyers or performed an internal self-audit after the Supreme Court's affirmative action ruling, Glasgow said.",
      "\"So if you are an Apple or another company who's done that, and you're confident in the legality of your existing DEI program, ... I think what you should do right now is stand firm,\" he said.",

    "summary": "President Trump revoked a 1965 rule that prohibited federal contractors from discriminating against employees or job applicants.",
    "story": [
      "Among the flurry of executive orders since his Jan. 20 inauguration, President Donald Trump has taken aim at\u00a0rooting out diversity, equity and inclusion, or DEI, programs within the federal government. But his efforts go beyond DEI, with one recent order rescinding a Civil Rights-era rule that has helped protect millions of workers from discrimination.",
      "Mr. Trump's Jan. 21\u00a0order \u2014 \"Ending illegal discrimination and restoring merit-based opportunity\" \u2014 revokes the\u00a0Equal Employment Opportunity\u00a0rule signed by President Lyndon B. Johnson in 1965. According to the rule, federal contractors, who today employ 3.7 million people, can't discriminate against job applicants or workers on the basis of race, gender and other protected characteristics.",
      "Revoking the 60-year-old rule eliminates a bedrock civil rights protection for American workers, signaling an effort to target workplace issues that go beyond DEI, labor experts say. While DEI is shorthand for programs that encourage equality in the workplace for women, minorities and other groups, the Equal Employment Opportunity rule prohibited federal contractors from engaging in acts of discrimination, such as refusing to hire someone due to their race or paying an employee less because of their gender.",
      "\"It is still stunning to me that he took such an extraordinary step,\" said Fatima Goss Graves, CEO of the National Women's Law Center, a nonprofit advocacy group focused on gender justice. Revoking the rule signals \"he is going after something bigger: the basic and foundational idea that we should be able to work at workplaces without discrimination.\"",
      "She added, \"We agreed to that 60 years ago, and I'll add that people in this country support it, too.\"",
      "What was the Equal Employment Opportunity rule?",
      "The rule required federal contractors to \"take affirmative action\" to ensure that workers aren't discriminated against based on race, color, religion, sex, sexual orientation, gender identity or national origin. This covered everything from hiring to promotions and pay, with the Department of Labor tasked with overseeing and enforcing the rule.",
      "How does revoking the rule impact protections for workers?",
      "It's still illegal under U.S. law for employers to discriminate on the basis of race, gender or other traits, labor experts said.",
      "But rescinding the Equal Employment Opportunity act could have a chilling effect on cases where workers at federal contractors allege they have been treated unfairly, and could impact the Department of Labor's ability to pursue workplace discrimination cases, Josh Boxerman, government affairs manager at the National Employment Law Project, told CBS MoneyWatch.",
      "\"Taking away this set of tools puts workers at a disadvantage,\" he\u00a0added.",
      "Does this have an impact on private employers?",
      "While the Equal Employment Opportunity rule focuses on federal contractors, Mr. Trump's executive orders could spill over to private employers, said Alex Hontos, a partner at law firm Dorsey & Whitney and expert on government contracting.",
      "\"It's not just about government contractors and grantees,\" Hontos said. \"It is clearly a stepwise approach and is going to apply to the private sector. You see that at the back end of the [executive order], where attorneys general have been directed to put a plan together to either call out private-sector companies that are involved in DEI or to actually seek enforcement actions in some way.\"",
      "Even before Mr. Trump's orders banning DEI from federal agencies, corporations, including Meta,\u00a0Ford,\u00a0McDonald's\u00a0and\u00a0Walmart, have been stepping back from these programs. Those decisions followed a 2023 Supreme Court decision\u00a0banning affirmative action\u00a0in college admissions, as well as pressure from conservative political activists.",
      "Why is President Trump banning DEI and revoking the Equal Employment Opportunity rule?",
      "Mr. Trump's aim is to restore what the administration considers to be a merit-based hiring system, according to officials and his executive orders.",
      "\"It is the policy of the United States to protect the civil rights of all Americans and to promote individual initiative, excellence and hard work,' the president wrote in the order to revoke the 1965 rule.",
      "DEI policies, he wrote, have led to \"illegal, pernicious discrimination that has prioritized how people were born instead of what they were capable of doing.\"",
      "Numerous lawsuits have taken aim at DEI programs, with some alleging that the policies discriminate against people who aren't minorities or that they violate some workers' rights to free speech, among other allegations,\u00a0according to New York University's Meltzer Center.",
      "\"The Trump administration isn't getting rid of the concepts of diversity, equity and inclusion as they are typically understood,\" a viewpoint from Erec Smith, research fellow at the Cato Institute and co-founder of Free Black Thought, a nonprofit dedicated to highlighting viewpoint diversity within Black communities.\"He's getting rid of the critical social justice version, which is inherently divisive.\"",
      "What will happen with DEI programs?",
      "DEI programs are being scrubbed from the federal government, according to the Trump administration's directives.",
      "All federal employees in DEI roles were placed on leave by 5 p.m. Eastern time on Wednesday. Agencies were also told to \"take down all outward facing media (websites, social media accounts, etc.) of DEIA [Diversity, Equity, Inclusion and Accessibility] offices\"; cancel upcoming DEI trainings; and terminate contracts with DEI-related contractors by the same time Wednesday.",
      "Meanwhile, Mr. Trump's Jan. 21 executive order requires federal agencies to come up with \"up to nine potential civil compliance investigations\" of publicly traded companies, large nonprofits and other private institutions with DEI programs that \"constitute illegal discrimination or preferences.\"",
      "That part of the executive order \"seems to be an attempt to intimidate the private sector,\" NELP's Boxerman said of the requirement to pursue civil investigations in the private sector. \"This seems to be a clear effort to name and shame companies that are doing the right thing,\" he said.",

Grocery inflation during the height of the coronavirus epidemic reached a\u00a0peak of 13.5% in 2022, while the overall rate of inflation for all products and services topped out at 9.1%.",
      "Although inflation has cooled to an annual rate of 2.9% as of December, prices for food, shelter and many other items remain elevated. Consumers also have found that many common products, from snacks to paper towels, have gotten smaller, a retailing tactic\u00a0known as \"shrinkflation\u00a0aimed at cutting a manufacturer's costs.",
      "In his Jan. 20 inaugural speech, President Trump said he would direct his cabinet \"to marshal the vast powers at their disposal to defeat what was record inflation and rapidly bring down costs and prices.\"",
      "Whether the Trump administration can engineer such a feat remains to be seen, while polls suggest that many Americans are skeptical that prices will return to earth. Economists also warn that Mr. Trump's policies, which could include steep new tariffs on U.S. imports and the deportation millions of undocumented immigrants, could prove inflationary.",
      "Younger Americans worry most",
      "To be sure, the meteoric rise in the cost of food, housing and health care over the past several years has made it hard for many households to make ends meet, let alone save money. Bankrate's survey shows that 73% of Americans said they're saving less for unexpected expenses, compared with 68% in 2024.",
      "\"Though inflation is no longer rising as quickly as it did in recent years, more people this year feel the economy has affected their savings,\" according to the Bankrate report.",
      "Younger Americans tend to have the strongest concerns about their savings. A whopping 80% of Gen Zers worry about being able to cover immediate expenses if they were to suddenly lose their primary source of income, compared with 72% for Millennials and Gen Xers. Some 58% of Baby Boomers say they regularly fret about having enough money put away, a particular concern given that many are already retired.",
      "Borrower nation",
      "Only 41% of Americans said they would be able to tap their savings to cover an unexpected $1,000 expense, according to Bankrate's report. That's down 3% from 2024 and the lowest the percentage since 2021 (39%)",
      "Another 25% said they would use a credit card to pay for a $1,000 bill, 13% said they would turn to a family member for the money and 5% said they would take out a personal loan. In total, about 43% of respondents told Bankrate they would have to borrow money to pay for an emergency expense of $1,000.",
      "That's a concern given consumers collectively owe a record $1.14 trillion in credit card debt, figures from the Federal Reserve Bank of New York\u00a0show. Meanwhile, credit card rates continue to soar, hovering round 24%.",
      "\"The cost of living continues to rise, prompting more individuals and households to turn to credit cards when in a bind,\" Hamrick said. \"They are a terrific tool when used wisely and effectively. But with interest rates still high, we need to avoid a deepening debt burden which could make it more challenging to save.\"",
      "Another 13% of Americans said they would pay for a surprise $1,000 debt by curbing their spending, On a positive note, while 36% of adults said their credit card debt exceeded what they had in emergency savings, Bankrate found that more than half of survey respondents, at 55%, had more emergency savings in 2024 than credit card debt. That's the highest percentage since 2018.",
      "Asked how much they have in emergency savings, 28% of respondents said they had enough to cover six months of expenses; 16% said they had enough to cover three to five months; 29% had enough to cover less than three months' worth of bills; and 27% said they had no emergency savings at all.",
      "Tips for saving now",
      "For people who consider themselves among the roughly one-third of Americans who want to reduce their debt and boost their emergency savings in 2025, Bankrate offers three tips:",
      "Calculate how much you need to save.\u00a0As a general target, experts recommend saving three to six months' worth of expenses in case of emergencies. To figure out how much to put away, add the total amount you spend each month on food, housing, gas and other bills. So if your monthly bills amount to $2,000 a month, you'll need $6,000 in savings to stay afloat in case of an emergency, such as a job loss.",
      "Open a savings account just for emergencies.\u00a0Opening an online savings account, money market account, money market mutual fund or a separate savings account with your existing bank or credit union can help you save for unexpected emergencies.",

    "summary": "The Sackler family will pay the vast majority of the settlement \u2014 a total of $6.5 billion over 15 years.",
    "story": [
      "The Sackler family and Purdue Pharma, the maker of the addictive painkiller oxycontin, have reached a $7.4 billion settlement with a bipartisan coalition of 15 states for fueling the opioid crisis, New York Attorney General Letitia James announced Thursday.",
      "The settlement bars the Sackler family from selling opioids in the U.S. and ends its control of Purdue. This comes seven months after the Supreme Court overturned a prior deal with Purdue that would have given the Sackler family immunity from future opioid lawsuits, a provision that is not part of the new deal.",
      "This is the largest settlement with contributors to the opioid crisis in the U.S. The Sackler family will pay the vast majority of the settlement \u2014 a total of $6.5 billion over 15 years \u2014 while Purdue will pay nearly $900 million up front, if it's approved by the court.",
      "Over half of the settlement will be distributed over the first few years, including almost $3 billion from the Sacklers. The Sacklers will make a $1.5 billion initial payment, adding another $500 million after one year, $500 million after two years and the remaining $400 million after three years.",
      "The funds will go to communities nationwide to support opioid addiction treatment, prevention and recovery programs over the next 15 years.",
      "\"Families throughout New York and across the nation are suffering from the immense pain and loss wrought by the opioid crisis,\" James said in a release announcing the settlement Thursday. \"The Sackler family relentlessly pursued profit at the expense of vulnerable patients and played a critical role in starting and fueling the opioid epidemic. While no amount of money will ever fully repair the damage they caused, this massive influx of funds will bring resources to communities in need so that we can heal.\"",
      "\"The Sacklers' no longer have control of Purdue will never be allowed to sell opioids in the United States again,\" she added.",
      "The deal leaves Purdue in bankruptcy with oversight by a monitor and prevents the company from lobbying or marketing opioids. The states involved in the settlement will appoint a board of trustees to oversee the company and determine its future.",
      "The previous Purdue bankruptcy settlement was struck down by the Supreme Court in June 2024. In a 5-4 decision, the justices said that Sackler family members could not be shielded from liability for civil claims related to the opioid epidemic. The original settlement would have required the Sacklers and Purdue to pay over $4.5 billion.",
      "\"Hundreds of millions of dollars that would have gone to victims was stuck, and we had to go back to square one,\" said Cheryl Juaire, a mother who lost two sons to opioid addiction, at a press conference with James announcing the settlement.",
      "\"Three and a half years ago, in the midst of this case, I lost my second son Sean, also to an overdose. I buried him in the midst of an ongoing mediation,\" she said. \"I truly hope that no one ever has to feel the devastation I have felt in losing two of my three children.\"",
      "Juaire noted that the new deal is \"even more than the original deal\" but emphasized that \"this will only happen if the parties that stood in the way the last time will not do so again.\"",
      "James has secured up to $250 million for New York from the settlement to support opioid treatment and recovery programs. She negotiated the settlement along with attorney generals from California, Colorado, Connecticut, Delaware, Florida, Illinois, Massachusetts, Oregon, Pennsylvania, Tennessee, Texas, Vermont, Virginia, and West Virginia.",

      "Fitbit received numerous reports of the lithium-ion batteries in the watches overheating during 2018, 2019 and continuing into 2020, according to the U.S. Consumer Product Safety Commission (CPSC). In early 2020, Fitbit made an update to address the defect, but continued to hear from people suffering burns and did not report the issue to regulators as legally required.",
      "\"While health-conscious people wore Fitbit Ionic smartwatches to track their fitness, they had no idea that the watches were putting their safety at risk. They didn't know about the hazard because Fitbit said nothing,\" CPSC Commissioner Rich Trumka Jr. said Thursday in a statement.",
      "The CPSC and Fitbit announced a recall of the Ionic smartwatches in March of 2020, saying the company had received 115 reports in the U.S. of the batteries in the devices overheating. Domestic customers reported 78 burn injuries, two involving third-degree burns and four of second-degree burns; another 40 incidents were reported internationally.",

      "Mr. Trump's 2017 trip to Saudi Arabia upended a tradition of U.S. presidents first heading to the United Kingdom as their first trip abroad. It also underscored his administration's close ties to the rulers of the oil-rich Gulf states as his eponymous real estate company has pursued deals across the region as well.",
      "The comments from Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman, reported early Thursday by the state-run Saudi Press Agency, came in a phone call with Mr. Trump.",
      "\"The crown prince affirmed the kingdom's intention to broaden its investments and trade with the United States over the next four years, in the amount of $600 billion, and potentially beyond that,\" the report said.",
      "The readout didn't elaborate on where those investments and trade could be placed. The U.S. in recent years has increasingly pulled away from relying on Saudi oil exports, which were the bedrock of their relationship for decades. Saudi sovereign wealth funds have taken large stakes in American businesses while also looking at sports, as well.",
      "Saudi Arabia does, however, rely predominantly on U.S.-made weapons and defense systems, which could be a part of the investment.",
      "There was no immediate readout from the White House on the call. It also wasn't immediately clear if Mr. Trump's call with the crown prince was his first with a foreign leader since re-entering the White House. However, it was the first such call to be reported.",

    "story": [
      "In one of his first acts after returning to the Oval Office this week, President Trump tasked federal agencies with developing ways to potentially ease prices for U.S. consumers. But experts warn that his administration's crackdown on immigration could both drive up inflation as well as hurt a range of businesses by shrinking the nation's workforce.",
      "\"A reduction in labor supply means upward pressure on wages, which has different sector implications including inflationary pressure, especially for food prices,\" Stephen Brown, deputy chief North America economist with Capital Economics, told CBS MoneyWatch.",
      "David Bier, director of immigration studies at the Cato Institute, a libertarian think tank, said labor shortages stemming from the Trump administration's push to remove undocumented immigrants could curtail the production of some products and services.",
      "\"Ultimately, the main way immigration affects inflation is that if jobs are left open and production is unable to keep up with demand, that's going to lead to higher prices,\" he said.",
      "What sectors depend most on immigrant labor?",
      "According to\u00a0estimates\u00a0from the nonpartisan Center for Migration Studies of New York and other groups, roughly 8.3 million undocumented immigrants work in the U.S, or just over 5% of the country's workforce.",
      "Undocumented immigrants account for about 20% of the agriculture industry's overall workforce, although that figure can rise to roughly half for some speciality farms, according to Capital Economics, which advises large investors.",
      "\"It's the key sector that comes up time and time again,\" Brown said, noting that harvesting delicate fruit is more labor-intensive than, for example, growing cereal crops. That means mass deportations could lead to price hikes in the fruit aisle.",
      "\"The inflationary impact could affect food overall, but particularly fresher fruits, rather than the ingredients in more processed foods,\" he said.",
      "Construction companies, including businesses focused on home renovations and landscaping, have the next highest share of undocumented workers and would also likely face a labor shortage if the government clamps down.",
      "\"With regard to home improvement projects those prices, they might become unaffordable to the point where people feel they can't do them anymore. And the lack of supply will be a big issue there, too,\" Brown said.",
      "Restaurants and food service businesses, which employ large numbers of undocumented workers, could be at particular risk if deportations flare. A shortage of workers would likely force such enterprises, including millions of small eateries around the U.S., to raise their wages to attract new employees. But that would also lead to hikes in menu prices, potentially driving away customers.",
      "\"They don't necessarily have the ability to bid up wages, so it might be that those places just shut down because they don't have the labor,\" Brown said.",
      "\"Removing large numbers of immigrants would drastically reduce the labor force, which could lead to rising wages, but potentially just higher prices for food, building and repairing homes, hotel stays and more things Americans hope to see lower prices for,\" added Julia Gelatt, associate director of the U.S. immigration policy program at the Migration Policy Institute.",
      "That's because there are some jobs where even higher pay generally fails to attract U.S. born workers, like farming. \"Wages might not rise and instead we'd just see a short-term lack of availability of workers for harvesting crops,\" she said.",
      "Bier of the Cato Institute notes that removing undocumented workers could also have a ripple effect on legally employed workers. For example, the construction industry has an estimated 2 million undocumented workers, but their bosses are mostly Americans.",
      "\"A lot of immigrants do jobs that support jobs held by Americans,\" he said.",
      "\"The same thing is true in hospitality. Americans are more likely to be in management and supervisory roles, so if you pull a bunch of workers you're supervising, there will be fewer jobs for those supervisors and you'll see everyone leveling down,\" Bier added. \"The economic effects are going to be much more diffuse than people expect.\"",

    "published": "Wed, 22 Jan 2025 17:56:00 -0500",
    "summary": "The $500 billion Stargate project is projected to create hundreds of thousands of jobs. Here's what's known so far.",
    "story": [
      "When President Trump announced the new $500 billion Stargate AI venture from OpenAI, Softbank and Oracle on Tuesday, he promised it would ensure \"the future of technology\" in the U.S. So far, Wall Street appears to agree, with some analysts speculating about its potential to transform the tech industry.",
      "But the project is also sparking some questions and skepticism, including pointed criticism from one of Mr. Trump's closest advisers, tech billionaire Elon Musk.",
      "\"They don't actually have the money,\" Musk wrote on X, the social media app he owns. \"SoftBank has well under $10B secured. I have that on good authority.\"",
      "OpenAI CEO Sam Altman countered that claim,\u00a0replying to Musk, \"wrong, as you surely know.\"",
      "Whatever the case might be, there are plenty of questions swirling about Stargate, which takes its name from a science-fiction movie and TV show about portals that transport people to other galaxies.",
      "At a White House briefing on Tuesday for the project's announcement, the executives behind the venture described Stargate as an AI project that could also prove to be transformative, albeit via Earth-based tech rather than intergalactic travel.",
      "\"This will help people's lives. This will help solve many, many issues ... with the power of AI,\" said SoftBank CEO Masayoshi Son who joined Mr. Trump at the briefing, along with Altman and Oracle co-founder Larry Ellison.",
      "\"I think this will be the most important project of this era,\" added Altman.",
      "Here's what we know about the project so far.",
      "What is the Stargate project?",
      "Stargate is a venture that has the backing of OpenAI, Oracle and Japanese company Softbank, with the latter promising an initial investment of $100 billion, according to Tuesday's announcement.",
      "The goal, said Son, is to ramp that investment to $500 billion within 4 years, or before the end of Mr. Trump's current term.",
      "Softbank will hold financial responsibility for the project, while OpenAI will oversee the operations, according to a research note from Capital Economics chief economist John Higgins. \"Donald Trump's ringing endorsement of Stargate is another shot in the arm for artificial intelligence (AI) in the early days of his second presidency,\" he noted.",
      "Where will Stargate be located?",
      "Stargate investment will be directed toward constructing data centers to support AI development, according to the announcement.",
      "Already, there are data centers under construction in Texas, with the first one located in Abilene, Oracle's Ellison said at the press conference. The goal is to construct 10 data centers initially, with plans to expand to 20 locations of about half a million square feet each, he added.",
      "Other potential sites for data centers across the nation are also being evaluated, according to a person familiar with the project.",
      "What type of projects will Stargate AI pursue?",
      "The data centers will be used by OpenAI, according to the person familiar with the project.",
      "During the press conference, Ellison highlighted AI's ability to transform health care, saying that the tools provided by OpenAI and Softbank are helping to develop a cancer vaccine.",
      "\"You can do early cancer detection with a blood test, and, using AI to look at the blood test, you can find the cancer that is seriously threatening the person,\" Ellison said. \"Once we gene sequence that gene tumor, you can vaccinate the person against that cancer, and you can make that mRNA vaccine robotically using AI within 48 hours.\"",
      "How many jobs could Stargate create?",
      "Mr. Trump claimed the venture would create \"over 100,000 American jobs almost immediately,\" while OpenAI, in a statement on its website, says Stargate will \"create hundreds of thousands of American jobs.\"",
      "New hires for the project will be situated close to the data center locations, according to the person familiar with the venture. Stargate will hire people for construction, operations and other areas, they said.",
      "What is President Trump's AI policy?",
      "Mr. Trump is signaling a sharp divergence from former President Biden's AI policy. Within hours after returning to the White House, Mr. Trump made a symbolic mark on the future of artificial intelligence by repealing Biden's guardrails for the fast-developing technology.",
      "What will come next from Mr. Trump and how it will diverge from his predecessor's effort to safeguard AI technology remains unclear. The new administration didn't respond to requests for comment about the repealed Biden policy.",
      "Even so, Wall Street interpreted the Stargate project as a sign the Trump administration will encourage investment and growth of the AI sector, especially as a way to bolster the nation's AI capabilities as it competes with China for tech dominance.",
      "\"The key role of Softbank, a Japanese company, in Stargate, highlights how Trump isn't hell-bent on excluding foreign firms from participating in America's quest for dominance in AI \u2013 provided they are headquartered in countries that are close allies of the U.S.,\" Capital Economics' Higgins wrote.",
      "He added, \"The new president seems much less keen than his predecessor on imposing checks and balances on the spread of AI.\"",
      "Why are some skeptical about Stargate?",
      "Aside from Musk, others have raised questions about whether Stargate's investment will actually reach $500 billion, with Higgins of Capital Economics writing, \"Whether that much will ultimately get spent remains to be seen.\"",
      "Musk also has a public feud with OpenAI and Altman, alleging in a lawsuit last year that the company and its CEO violated OpenAI's original mission statement by putting profits over benefiting humanity. After helping found OpenAI in 2015, Musk broke with the company, claiming that the AI firm had veered away from its founding agreement that it would use its technology to benefit the public and that it would open its technology for public use.",

      "Trump ally Steve Bannon, when asked whether Musk had undermined the president on AI, said Wednesday, \"No doubt about it. The president said it's a $500 billion joint venture. Why does Elon Musk criticize the president after he talks about it?\"",
      "Bannon, who was in New York for a pretrial hearing related to an indictment on fraud charges, later said, \"He should not reverse what the president's already talked about.

    "summary": "Elon Musk's DOGE is taking aim at the U.S. penny, pointing out that it costs more to manufacture than it's worth.",
    "story": [
      "Billionaire Elon Musk's Department of Government Efficiency has a new target in its sights for trimming federal spending: the U.S. penny.",
      "In Tuesday X post, Musk's DOGE wrote that the U.S. spends about 3 cents to mint each penny, which, of course, is only valued at 1 cent.",
      "\"The penny costs over 3 cents to make and cost U.S. taxpayers over $179 million in FY2023,\" DOGE wrote. \"The Mint produced over 4.5 billion pennies in FY2023, around 40% of the 11.4 billion coins for circulation produced.\"",
      "In pointing out the penny's costliness, DOGE is taking aim at an issue that has sparked debate for years, although the price of manufacturing the cent has only grown over the past several years. In 2016, for instance, the U.S. was spending about 1.5 cents to mint each penny, or less than half of its current manufacturing cost.",
      "Still, the cent's $179 million in costs represents mere metaphorical pennies when it comes to DOGE's mandate to cut federal spending. President Donald Trump has said DOGE will provide recommendations to \"slash excess regulations, cut wasteful expenditures and restructure federal agencies.\" Musk has said the group will aim to trim $500 billion in annual federal spending.",
      "DOGE co-leader\u00a0Vivek Ramaswamy, recently announced he is leaving the organization,\u00a0posting\u00a0on social media on Jan. 20 that he will be stepping back from the effort to run for Ohio governor.",

      "The penny's rising cost",
      "During the past year, the penny's costs have only continued to rise, with the U.S. Mint's 2024 annual report finding that one cent now costs about 3.7 cents to manufacture and distribute.",
      "Pennies are mostly made of zinc, with a copper overlay to give them their distinctive color. While zinc's price fluctuates from year to year, its cost per metric ton is now double what it was in 2016, according to data from the Federal Reserve Bank of St. Louis.",
      "Federal officials have proposed suspending the penny in prior years, with former Treasury Secretary Jacob Lew pushing the idea in 2015. Some economists have also advocated for dropping the penny from circulation, but there could be a costly downside to ditching the cent, as transactions would be rounded to 5-cent intervals, the Federal Reserve Bank of Richmond said in a 2020 blog post.",
      "\"For a single item or small-value purchase, rounding up or down could represent a significant price change,\" the post noted.",
      "Other nations have ditched their equivalent of the penny, including Canada, which stopped minting its one-cent coin in 2012. One 2018 economic analysis found that Canadian consumers paid about $3.27 million in additional Canadian dollars at grocery stores each year due to prices being rounded higher after the change.",
      "\"On the other hand, there may be additional, hard-to-quantify costs to using pennies that would argue in favor of elimination. Counting pennies to make change takes time, and as the old business adage goes, time is money,\" the Richmond Fed noted.",
      "DOGE might want to set its sights beyond the lowly penny, as it's not the only coin that costs more to mint than it's worth. The U.S. Mint's 2024 annual report noted that it spends about 14 cents to make and distribute each nickel.",

    "story": [
      "President Trump, who while campaigning vowed to end the \"inflation nightmare,\" on Monday signaled his focus on the high cost of living in the U.S. by signing an executive order that requires \"all executive departments and agencies to deliver emergency price relief\" to Americans.",
      "Mr. Trump's Jan. 20 order blames several factors for the pandemic-era inflation surge that has left many households feeling financially pinched, including high federal spending under the Biden administration and costs from new regulations.",
      "\"It is critical to restore purchasing power to the American family and improve our quality of life,\" the executive order states.",
      "To accomplish that, Mr. Trump is ordering the departments and agencies that fall under the executive branch, including the departments of Commerce, Health and Human Services, Labor, and Energy, to take actions that lower prices for everything from housing and health costs to food and fuel.",
      "There's a lot riding on Mr. Trump's mandate given that U.S. voters last fall consistently ranked the economy and inflation as among their top issues. But whether Mr. Trump's order will meaningfully move the needle on inflation is uncertain, some economists say.",
      "\"Trump's cost of living order fails to address the root causes of inflation, namely corporate profiteering and broken supply chains,\" said Lindsay Owens, executive director of the Groundwork Collaborative, a progressive economic think tank. \"This order is a talking point, not a plan.\"",
      "Recent economic\u00a0research from the likes of Ben Bernanke, the former Federal Reserve chairman, has found that spiking prices in 2021 and 2022 stemmed from factors such as supply-chain disruptions and increased commodity prices \u2014 forces that any president, including Mr. Trump, would struggle to control.",
      "The Trump administration didn't immediately return a request for comment.",
      "In the meantime, inflation has cooled dramatically since reaching a 40-year high in June 2022, although the consumer price index remains stubbornly above the Federal Reserve's goal of a 2% annual rate. While prices are rising more slowly, more than 4 in 10 Americans express pessimism about their own economic prospects over the next year due to the ongoing impact of inflation, Bankrate found in a December survey.",
      "Mr. Trump's plan: Deregulation, cheaper housing and more",
      "Mr. Trump's order targeting prices highlights several areas for federal departments to focus on, including reducing the number of federal regulations that Trump administration officials argue has driven up the cost of living for American families.",
      "\"In sum, unprecedented regulatory oppression from the Biden administration is estimated to have imposed almost $50,000 in costs on the average American household,\" the order states.",
      "That refers to an analysis from University of Chicago economist Casey Mulligan, whose research found that the Biden administration's regulations may over time add a total of about $47,000 in added costs per household. Fuel emission rules from the Obama and Biden administrations are also forecast to boost the cost of vehicles by $6,000 each, Mulligan estimated.",
      "But eliminating federal regulations that protect workers and consumers won't lower the cost of living, Owens said. Americans have been struggling with cost-of-living issues for decades, ranging from soaring health care costs to rising housing prices \u2014 trends rooted in structural problems such as a shortage of available housing and the nation's complex for-profit health care system.",
      "To be sure, Mr. Trump nodded to some of those issues in his order, requiring federal departments to \"lower the cost of housing and expand housing supply\" and \"eliminate unnecessary administrative expenses and rent-seeking practices that increase health care costs.\"",
      "While those are ambitious goals, tackling housing costs is notoriously difficult given that new construction is often constrained by state and local laws, from zoning restrictions to environmental regulations \u2014 issues over which the federal government is unlikely to have much leverage.",
      "Lowering medical costs could help American households, which\u00a0spend more on health care than any other developed nation. Yet Mr. Trump also signed an executive order on Jan. 20 that revokes a Biden administration effort to lower prescription costs, which is seemingly at odds with his cost-of-living directive.",
      "Separately, Mr. Trump also signed a separate executive order on Jan. 20 declaring a national energy emergency, part of his administration's plan to ramp up domestic energy production and lower costs.",
      "\"The inflation crisis was caused by massive overspending and escalating energy prices,\" Trump said on Monday. \"And that is why today I will also declare a national energy emergency. We will drill, baby, drill.\"",
      "Mr. Trump is likely to have some convincing to do that he has a recipe for lowering prices. In a recent poll by CBS News, roughly 40% of people said they expected grocery prices to drop under the Trump administration, while 37% thought costs would rise.",
      "Another\u00a0survey, from The Associated Press-NORC Center for Public Affairs Research, revealed less confidence on the direction of prices:\u00a02 in 10 Americans said they are \"extremely\" or \"very\" confident that Mr. Trump will be able to make progress on lowering the cost of groceries, housing or health care this year.",
      "In an\u00a0interview\u00a0with Time Magazine, which named him 2024 Person of the Year, Mr. Trump acknowledged that bringing down food costs will be a difficult challenge.",

    "title": "Trump's DOGE executive order says Musk's efforts will focus on IT",
    "published": "Tue, 21 Jan 2025 17:19:21 -0500",
    "summary": "Trump on Monday signed an executive order to create Elon Musk's DOGE, with a mandate to improve federal IT systems.",
    "story": [
      "President Donald Trump on Monday signed an executive order officially creating the Department of Government Efficiency, the cost-cutting initiative helmed by billionaires Elon Musk and Vivek Ramaswamy. The executive order included fresh details about DOGE's goals and structure, such as a mandate to upgrade the government's IT systems.",
      "Mr. Trump first announced DOGE in November with a statement that said the effort would \"provide advice and guidance from outside of Government.\" The goal, he added in November, would be to provide recommendations to \"slash excess regulations, cut wasteful expenditures and restructure federal agencies.\"",
      "Musk and Ramaswamy wrote in a November Wall Street Journal opinion article that they aimed to cut $500 billion in annual federal costs by targeting \"expenditures that are unauthorized by Congress or being used in ways that Congress never intended.\"",
      "But Mr. Trump's executive order says that DOGE will in fact be housed within the executive branch, rather than operating as an outside advisory committee. The EO also states that an existing White House office called the U.S. Digital Service \u2014 a unit that primarily works on improving government websites and tech \u2014 will be renamed the U.S. DOGE Service.",
      "DOGE's purpose will be to \"implement the President's DOGE Agenda, by modernizing Federal technology and software to maximize governmental efficiency and productivity,\" the EO states.",
      "The executive order doesn't include any details about cutting federal spending, slashing regulations or restructuring federal agencies. To be sure, the lack of a mention in the EO about cost-cutting doesn't mean that DOGE won't also tackle those issues, as well as taking on a mandate to upgrade federal IT systems.",
      "The Trump administration didn't immediately respond to a request for comment.",
      "DOGE lawsuits",
      "The EO comes as DOGE faces multiple lawsuits\u00a0over its structure and efforts so far, with the cases filed shortly after Mr. Trump's inauguration on Monday. The lawsuits claim that because DOGE was operating as a federal advisory committee, it was in violation of a law called the Federal Advisory Committee Act, or FACA.",
      "FACA regulates the functions and transparency of federal advisory committees, requiring them to operate transparently and publicly, as well as include representation from people who could be affected by their operations.",
      "But with Mr. Trump's EO establishing DOGE as a unit within the executive branch, it appears that the effort will not be operating as a federal advisory committee. Democracy Forward, which is representing some of the groups suing DOGE, said the executive order doesn't alter their plans.",
      "\"Our legal team is reviewing yesterday's executive orders. DOGE has been operating secretly and out of compliance with federal law for some time, which yesterday's executive orders could not impact,\" Skye Perryman, CEO of Democracy Forward, said in a statement.",
      "And National Security Counselors, another public service group that is suing DOGE, said that it doesn't \"have any reason to believe that the entity created by the recent executive order is the same animal as the advisory committee we are litigating about.\"",
      "\"The executive order has definitely muddied the waters a bit, but at the end of the day, the deciding factor will be what the new U.S. DOGE Service actually does and how,\" said Kel McClanahan, executive director of National Security Counselors, said on Tuesday. \"It is difficult to imagine the sprawling DOGE written about by Musk and Ramaswamy slamming on its brakes and taking a job modernizing agency IT systems.\"",
      "Ramaswamy leaving DOGE",
      "Meanwhile, DOGE is losing one of its co-leaders, with Ramaswamy posting on social media on Jan. 20 that he is stepping back from the effort. Ramaswamy intends to announce a campaign for Ohio governor as soon as the end of January, CBS News has reported.",
      "\"It was my honor to help support the creation of DOGE. I'm confident that Elon & team will succeed in streamlining government,\" Ramaswamy wrote.",
      "According to Mr. Trump's EO, DOGE will be a \"temporary organization\" that will focus on \"advancing the President's 18-month DOGE agenda.\" The EO says that DOGE will come to an end on July 4, 2026.",
      "On Monday, Trump said DOGE will have about \"about 20 people\" working in its office.",
      "According to the U.S. Digital Service, the unit currently has about 230 employees, with recent work by the unit including assisting the IRS on its new Direct File service, as well as improving the Social Security Administration's website. DOGE says its SSA work is\u00a0projected to save the agency about $285 million over five years in infrastructure expenses.",

      "The White House called the steps necessary to curtail what Mr. Trump and his supporters view as a \"deep state\" who fought his actions during the president's first term.",
      "\"There have been numerous and well-documented cases of career federal employees resisting and undermining the policies and directives of their executive leadership,\" stated one of the executive orders signed by the president on Monday evening. \"Principles of good administration, therefore, necessitate action to restore accountability to the career civil service.\"",
      "Critics view the touted-in-advance policy as an effort to topple the heart of civil service, in which people are hired based on merit and can't be arbitrarily dismissed.",
      "The government jobs included professional employees who work as border patrol officers, meat inspectors and those overseeing clean-air regulations.",
      "Union pushback",
      "The return-to-office directive is expected to face a fight from federal unions, some of which have remote work written into their contract.",

      "Kelly \u2014 whose union represents employees with the Department of Defense, Department of Homeland Security, Department of Veterans Affairs and the Social Security Administration, among other agencies \u2014 also called Mr. Trump's directives \"a blatant attempt to corrupt the federal government by eliminating employees' due process rights so they can be fired for political reasons.\"",
      "The National Treasury Employees Union filed suit against the president's \"Schedule F\" executive order, a directive that makes it easier for the Trump administration to fire career government employees.",

      "NTEU represents workers in 37 federal agencies and offices, including staff at the Internal Revenue Service and the Department of Health and Human Services.",

    "title": "Trump threatens steep tariffs against Canada and Mexico",
    "published": "Tue, 21 Jan 2025 15:51:18 -0500",
    "summary": "President Trump opted against deploying a blanket tariff against U.S. trading partners, but kept the heat on Canada and Mexico.",
    "story": [
      "President Trump is keeping his powder dry, at least for now, in deploying tariffs to advance his administration's push to redefine trade relations with other major economies around the world.",
      "Mr. Trump, who as president-elect said he could move to apply\u00a0sweeping levies\u00a0on foreign imports on his first day in office, stopped short of imposing so-called universal tariffs or directly targeting China, which he had threatened to hit with 60% duties.",
      "Instead, Mr. Trump said Monday that his administration is considering 25% tariffs on Canada and Mexico as soon as Feb. 1 unless they take stronger measures to stop the flow of unauthorized migrants and and illicit drugs flowing into the U.S.",
      "\"We're thinking in terms of 25% on Mexico and Canada, because they're allowing vast numbers of people \u2014 Canada's a very bad abuser also \u2014 vast numbers of people to come in, and fentanyl to come in,\" Mr. Trump said Monday as he signed a range of executive orders on his first day in office addressing the American economy, immigration, energy policy and other areas.",
      "When asked about his plans for blanket tariffs on U.S. imports, Mr. Trump said they remain a possibility, but \"we're not ready for that yet.\" As a candidate during the 2024 presidential campaign, he proposed across-the-board tariffs of 10% to 20% on all U.S. imports.",
      "In his inaugural address Monday, Mr. Trump said that \"instead of taxing our citizens to enrich other countries, we will tariff and tax foreign countries to enrich our citizens,\" although he didn't offer any specifics.",
      "In a\u00a0memorandum\u00a0on Monday, Mr. Trump also called for a review of existing U.S. trade agreements and asked for recommendations on how the U.S. can gain leverage with trading partners.",
      "Said Mr. Trump in the memo: \"I am establishing a robust and reinvigorated trade policy that promotes investment and productivity, enhances our nation's industrial and technological advantages, defends our economic and national security, and \u2014 above all \u2014 benefits American workers, manufacturers, farmers, ranchers, entrepreneurs and businesses.\"",
      "Winding road on trade",
      "Initially, analysts now expect the Trump administration to implement tariffs incrementally. Economists have warned that steep tariffs could boost inflation and slow economic growth. Mr. Trump has long argued that tariffs deployed during his first term didn't boost inflation and that raising costs on foreign imports can help protect U.S. jobs.",
      "\"In short, the road to tariff implementation might be less straightforward than a universal tariff baseline might imply, given the potential for moving targets around scope and scale,\" Morgan Stanley analysts said Monday in a report.",
      "But other experts said they still expect the Trump administration to eventually adopt a universal tariff, noting that the new regime is examining whether to create what it calls an External Revenue Service to collect tariff revenue. That suggest the \"administration intends for some tariffs to be permanent,\" Stephen Brown, deputy chief North America economist with Capital Economics, told investors in a research note.",
      "Retaliation risk",
      "Meanwhile, any actions by the U.S. to subject other countries to new tariffs would likely spur retaliation, experts say. Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau promised a sharp response to any new levies, saying in a news conference in Ottawa on Tuesday that \"everything\" was now on the table,\" according to AFP.",
      "In November, Canadian government official said it was exploring potential retaliatory tariffs on certain U.S. imports after Mr. Trump, then the president-elect, threatened a 25% tariff on all goods from Canada and Mexico.",
      "A 25% U.S. tariff on Canadian imports would likely drive up inflation in Canada and push it into a recession in 2025, according to econmist Michael Davenport Oxford Economics. The country's auto, energy and heavy manufacturing industries, which rely on exports to the U.S., would feel the greatest impact since those sectors also depend on components from American suppliers, he noted.",
      "The U.S. would also feel the impact of a trade war with Canada, according to experts. Universal tariffs on American products would likely cause a \"shallow\" recession in the U.S., according to Oxford.",
      "Canada also supplies roughly 20% of the oil used stateside. As a result, U.S. gas prices could shoot up 30 to 40 cents a gallon, and potentially up to 70 cents, soon after Trump levied tariffs on Canada, Patrick De Haan, head of petroleum analysis at GasBuddy, has told CBS MoneyWatch.",
      "Stephanie Brinley, associate director, AutoIntelligence, at S&P Mobility, expects the Trump administration to eventually put a 10% tariff on all imports from Europe, Japan and other countries besides Canada, China or Mexico. The research firm also forecasts a 30% duty on goods from mainland China.",
      "\"We see these tariffs starting from the second quarter and ramping up over the subsequent four quarters,\" she said Tuesday in a report, noting that countries faced with the new U.S. levies are likely to fire back with their own trade sanctions.",

    "summary": "Donald and Melania Trump launched new cryptocurrencies over the weekend. Some experts are advising investors to be cautious.",
    "story": [
      "President Trump, who has vowed to turn the U.S. into the cryptocurrency capital of the world, got a head start on those plans by debuting new his-and-her meme coins \u2014 \u00a0the $Trump and $Melania coins \u2014 over the weekend. As of Monday afternoon, the day of Mr. Trump's inauguration, the two digital currencies were worth a combined $9.5 billion.",
      "Meme coins, which have no economic or transactional value, are cryptocurrencies linked to internet trends, such as Dogecoin, which was inspired by the image of a shiba inu dog. Dogecoin became a favored cryptocurrency of billionaire Elon Musk, who even named his federal cost-cutting group, the Department of Government Efficiency, after it.",
      "Mr. Trump announced his cryptocurrency on Friday night, writing on social media that the coin celebrates \"everything we stand for: WINNING!\" The meme coin is being marketed with a picture of Trump holding a fist up superimposed over the words \"FIGHT FIGHT FIGHT,\" a reference to Trump's response to an assassination attempt at a political rally in July.",
      "On Sunday, Melania Trump announced her own meme coin with a black-and-white photo of the First Lady smiling and with her hands clasped in front of her face, as if in thanks.",
      "The new meme coins are a way for Mr. Trump to leverage his online popularity, drawing his supporters to the project, noted Joe McCann, CEO of digital assets investment firm Asymmetric. The products, like Mr. Trump's social media company, tend to attract individual investors, rather than large U.S. institutional firms, who buy shares as a way to show support for the president.",
      "\"Meme coins largely represent communities on the internet represented by a financial asset \u2014 they're the tokenization of internet culture,\" McCann told CBS MoneyWatch. \"Donald Trump is arguably the most popular person on the internet, so by launching a meme coin, members of his community can further gain proximity to him.\"",
      "Mr. Trump has sought to monetize his name with numerous commercial ventures, ranging from a licensing deal for non-fungible tokens, or NFTs, that earned him $7.2 million, to a\u00a0$59.99 Bible\u00a0that earned him $300,000 in royalties. He's also recently rolled out Trump-branded sneakers, a \"Fight, Fight, Fight\"-branded perfume and watches.",
      "Here's what to know about the Trump coins.",
      "How much are the Donald and Melania Trump meme coins worth?",
      "As of Monday afternoon, the Trump meme coin had a market cap of $8.3 billion, while Melania Trump's cryptocurrency was valued at $1.2 billion, according to CoinMarketCap.",
      "Mr. Trump's meme coin soared after it debuted, hitting a peak of almost $75 each. But the price has shed about 45% of its value since then, settling at about $40 per coin on Monday afternoon. Still, that represents a surge of more than 400% from its initial price, CoinMarketCap data shows.",
      "Melania Trump's meme coin has had a slightly rockier debut, sinking more than 20% to about $5.40 per coin on Monday.",
      "Are $Trump and $Melania real investments?",
      "The Trump meme coin website says the president's cryptocurrency is meant as an expression of support \u2014 not an investment opportunity.",
      "The Melania site describes the meme coins as \"digital collectibles,\" adding that they \"are not intended to be, or to be the subject of, an investment opportunity, investment contract or security of any type.\"",
      "Investors typically scrutinize balance sheets and income statements when deciding where to allocate their funds, while currency traders will examine economic factors like trade flow and GDP growth when placing their investments. But relying on these traditional measures don't work with meme coins because they aren't tied to an underlying asset or economy, experts note.",
      "\"Attempting to use traditional financial models to value a meme coin will fail miserably,\" McCann noted. \"Business schools don't teach students how to measure culture, virality or communities.\"",
      "Are meme coins risky?",
      "Meme coins are a highly volatile corner of the crypto sector that often start as a joke and have no intrinsic value, although they can surge in price if enough people are willing to buy them. Because of those dynamics, their prices are prone sudden and extreme swings.",
      "\"Meme coins are some of the most volatile assets on earth and should be treated with caution and care,\" McCann said.",
      "The site selling the $Trump coin warned buyers that its price \"may be extremely volatile and you may experience substantial losses in connection with a sale or other disposition of Trump Memes.\"",
      "Meme coins gained popularity in 2021 and 2022, but some inexperienced investors were unprepared for digital currencies' extreme volatility, noted Nigel Green, CEO of wealth management firm deVere Group, in an email. As a result, he's advising investors to be cautious before putting their money into the Trump meme coins.",
      "How can you buy the Trump and Melania meme coins?",
      "The meme coins are available to buy on an app called Moonshot, which allows people to buy meme coins with Apple Pay, credit or debit card, cryptocurrency, or payment apps like PayPal and Venmo.",
      "The Trump meme coin website notes that all transactions \"ARE FINAL AND NON-REFUNDABLE. We shall have no responsibility or liability for any Trump Memes that are lost, misplaced or inaccessible.\"",
      "What is the cryptocurrency industry's view?",
      "Some crypto enthusiasts hailed the Trump meme coin's release, saying it reflects the president's support for an industry that felt unfairly targeted by the Biden administration. Mr. Trump has promised to usher in crypto-friendly regulations and picked crypto backers for key government positions.",
      "For instance, Mr. Trump has nominated cryptocurrency supporter Paul Atkins to head the Securities and Exchange Commission, reinforcing optimism that the new president will deregulate the sector.",
      "Other cryptocurrencies are gaining in value on anticipation that the second Trump administration will benefit the sector. Bitcoin, for instance, soared more than 50% since the November election, surging to a record peak of $109,241 ahead of Mr. Trump's inauguration ceremony.",

    "story": [
      "As California officials sought to tamp down false claims about the devastating wildfires, Gov. Gavin Newsom created \"California Fire Facts,\" a page on his website to counter what he called \"lies\" about the California fires.",
      "Among the claims the governor sought to debunk were some related to his management of the state's firefighting resources and forest management. Many of the claims had been promoted by President Trump, who has criticized Newsom and visited California\u00a0on Friday to survey wildfire damage in Los Angeles County.",
      "CBS News Confirmed checked the governor's \"fact checks\" and found that although many were correct, a few of them omitted crucial context. Here's what we know.",
      "CLAIM: Newsom says he did not cut California's fire budget",
      "Newsom called reports by Fox News and others that California cut its fire budget by $100 million in the months before the fire, \"a ridiculous lie\" \u2014 countering that Cal Fire's personnel and budget have almost doubled since 2019.",
      "While it's true Cal Fire's overall budget has grown significantly since Newsom took office in 2019, he did approve cuts of over $100 million to wildfire-related funding initiatives last year.",
      "In the 2018-2019 fiscal year, Cal Fire received $2.5 billion and had 7,182 personnel, compared to $4.2 billion and 12,511 personnel in the 2024-2025 budget, according to the state's legislative analyst's office. This represents a large increase.",
      "However, in the last fiscal year, wildfire-related funding was cut by over $100 million. These cuts came from reductions to a one-time surplus funding package for several state departments. A proposed budget initially cut $101 million, but the final budget reduced it by $144 million.",
      "Those reductions meant $12 million in cuts for \"home hardening,\" $6 million for Cal Fire's \"forest data program,\" and $5 million for prescribed fires, among many other items.",
      "But it's unlikely most of the cuts would have prevented the L.A. fires, according to two wildfire experts who spoke with CBS News. They said more efforts to do prescribed fires or clear brush in Southern California would likely not have stopped the wildfires in the L.A. area.",
      "Jon Keeley, a senior scientist for the U.S. Geological Survey, said, \"There's very little evidence that prescription burning would ever do anything to stop an event like what we saw this past week. We don't have an unusual accumulation of fuels by and large. But more important than that, our worst fires occur during the Santa Ana wind conditions.\"",
      "Chris Field, a climate scientist at Stanford who has studied controlled burns, agreed: \"The L.A. fires reflect the combination of very strong winds and very dry fuels. It is not likely that fuel reduction would have helped.\"",
      "The governor called claims that California ran out of water and that reservoirs are empty a \"lie,\" adding that reservoirs in Southern California are at record levels.",
      "That's mostly true. State data show all but three of California's major reservoirs are at or above historical average levels.",
      "However, the 117-million-gallon Santa Ynez Reservoir near the Palisades fire was out of service when the fires began. Newsom said he is launching an independent state investigation into the loss of water pressure and unavailability of water from the Santa Ynez Reservoir.",
      "And it's also true that some hydrants in the Pacific Palisades area temporarily ran dry amid intense demand as crews battled the Palisades Fire.",
      "All three 1-million-gallon water tanks in the area ran out of water by 3 a.m. on Jan. 8, reducing water pressure for fire hydrants at higher elevations, officials said.",
      "Los Angeles Fire Department Capt. Erik Scott said officials filled all available water storage tanks before the fires began, but \"extreme demand\" caused the tanks to be refilled at a slower rate.",
      "Fire officials acknowledged the urban system was not set up to fight this scale of wildfire, pulling from so many hydrants at the same time.",
      "In an interview with Fox News host Sean Hannity on Wednesday, President Trump said Newsom \"can release the water that comes from the north\" to help the state fight devastating wildfires, and suggested the federal government should not \"give California anything\" until it changes its water policy.",
      "\"I don't think we should give California anything until they let water flow down,\" Mr. Trump said.",
      "Mr. Trump was repeating a claim he made after the fires broke out, alleging that Newsom had previously \"refused to sign the water restoration declaration\" to allow water from Northern California to flow down into the Los Angeles area and claiming that state officials prioritized a small fish, called a smelt, over residents.",
      "The governor's office responded to the post on social media, saying there was no such declaration and suggesting that it was \"outlandish\" to make a connection between the smelt fish and wildfires.",
      "Mr. Trump is correct that California did block his plan during his first administration to redirect water from the Sacramento-San Joaquin River Delta down to farms and cities further south, after environmental groups opposed the plan due to concerns over endangered salmon and smelt.",
      "But that is not the reason the fire hydrants near Pacific Palisades ran dry. As previously noted, city officials said three 1-million-gallon water tanks that feed the hydrants in the Palisades area ran out of water because there was such high demand that they couldn't refill the tanks fast enough.",
      "And experts told CBS News additional water from another part of the state would not have made a difference to the firefighting response.",
      "\"Plenty of water is flowing into Southern California,\" said Brent Haddad, an environmental studies professor at the University of California. \"The problem is that when city water infrastructure was built decades ago, planners didn't anticipate the conditions brought on by global warming.\"",
      "Mark Gold, a Metropolitan Water District of Southern California board member, noted Southern California has ample water supply but a lack of rain in the region dried out vegetation. Combined with extreme winds, the wildfires spread rapidly.",

    "summary": "Pete Hegseth's nomination once appeared on shaky ground amid allegations that included sexual misconduct and financial mismanagement.",
    "story": [
      "Washington \u2014 The Senate narrowly confirmed Pete Hegseth as the next secretary of defense, approving President Trump's pick to lead the Pentagon after a contentious battle over his nomination.",
      "Hegseth was confirmed in a vote mostly along party lines, with 51 voting in favor and 50 against. Three Republicans broke with their party to oppose his nomination, forcing Vice President JD Vance to cast a tie-breaking vote. At least four Republicans would have had to vote against Hegseth to sink his nomination.",
      "Hegseth's nomination once appeared on shaky ground amid allegations that included sexual misconduct and financial mismanagement. But the former Fox News host struck a defiant tone as support for his confirmation appeared to be in doubt and Mr. Trump stood behind his pick.",
      "Senate Republicans largely dismissed the allegations, including those made in a sworn affidavit made by Hegseth's former sister-in-law that came to light this week. In the affidavit to members of the Senate Armed Services Committee, she alleged that Hegseth caused his second wife to fear for her personal safety and abused alcohol over the course of many years.",
      "But they lost two Republican votes in the confirmation process: Sen. Lisa Murkowski of Alaska and Sen. Susan Collins of Maine. Murkowski said Thursday she was unable to support Hegseth's nomination, citing the numerous allegations and his previous stance on women in combat.",
      "\"These behaviors starkly contrast the values and discipline expected of servicemembers. Men and women in uniform are held accountable for such actions, and they deserve leaders who uphold these same standards,\" she said, also adding that his \"prior roles in his career do not demonstrate to me that he is prepared for such immense responsibility\" of leading the Defense Department.",
      "Shortly after, Collins made a similar announcement. Collins said she was concerned Hegseth lacked the \"experience and perspective necessary to succeed in the job\" and that she was \"not convinced that his position on women serving in combat roles has changed.\"",
      "Sen. Mitch McConnell, a Kentucky Republican, joined them Friday in their opposition, despite voting to advance his nomination a day earlier. McConnell walked onto the Senate floor late Friday and gave a hands down motion as his name was called.",
      "\"Mr. Hegseth has failed, as yet, to demonstrate that he will pass this test. But as he assumes office, the consequences of failure are as high as they have ever been,\" McConnell said in a lengthy and blistering statement after his vote.",
      "Mr. Trump, who was in California surveying wildfire damage, said he was unaware how McConnell voted, but praised Hegseth, saying he's \"going to be a great secretary of defense.\"",
      "Before Vance cast the tie-breaker, he\u00a0wrote,\u00a0\"I thought I was done voting in the senate.\"",
      "During his contentious confirmation hearing last week, Democrats grilled Hegseth about an October 2017 sexual assault allegation, which he has repeatedly denied.",
      "In one of the most heated moments of the hourslong hearing, Democratic Sen. Tim Kaine of Virginia questioned Hegseth about his history of infidelity in his three marriages.",
      "\"Can you so casually cheat on a second wife?\" Kaine said, asking Hegseth about the timing of the allegation of sexual assault that Hegseth claims was a consensual encounter.",
      "\"You've admitted that you had sex at that hotel,\" Kaine said. \"You said it was consensual, isn't that correct? You've admitted it was consensual, and you were still married, and you had just had a child by another woman. How do you explain your judgment?\"",
      "Hegseth who avoided directly answering the question also declined to answer Kaine's question about whether it would be disqualifying if the encounter had been a sexual assault.",
      "Earlier in the hearing, Hegseth called the allegations against him a smear campaign aimed at destroying him.",
      "\"I'm not a perfect person,\" Hegseth said, but he said he had been saved by \"Jesus and Jenny,\" his wife, whom he married in 2019. Earlier this week, it was disclosed that he had paid his accuser a $50,000 settlement.",
      "He also addressed his views on women in combat, saying his previous views that women should not serve in combat roles were driven by concerns about \"standards.\"",
      "Hegseth, who served in Iraq and Afghanistan, joined Fox News in 2014 as a contributor and eventually became co-host of \"Fox & Friends Weekend.\" He left his job at the network after Trump said he intended to nominate him to lead the Department of Defense.",

    "summary": "Pete Hegseth's Senate confirmation vote to be defense secretary is expected to take place Friday night.",
    "story": [
      "Update: Pete Hegseth was confirmed by the Senate Friday night as the new secretary of defense by a slim 51-50 margin, with Vice President JD Vance casting the tiebreaking vote after three Republicans voted against Hegseth's nomination, including Sen. Mitch McConnell. Read the latest here.",
      "Washington \u2014 As the Senate approaches its final confirmation of Pete Hegseth to be defense secretary, Democrats are continuing to raise their concerns about his character and fitness to lead the nation's largest department.",
      "In a 51 to 49 vote Thursday, the Senate advanced Hegseth's nomination, with two Republicans joining all Democrats in opposition. The vote started the clock on up to 30 hours of debate as senators spar over the nominee, while the GOP barrels forward, expecting to finalize his confirmation in a vote late Friday evening.",
      "Soon after Hegseth's nomination was advanced to the full Senate by the Armed Services Committee on a party-line vote, committee members received a sworn affidavit from Hegseth's former sister-in-law, Danielle Hegseth, Tuesday, who claimed that he caused his second wife to fear for her personal safety, even hiding in a closet from him at one point. Danielle Hegseth also said in the affidavit he abused alcohol over the course of many years. Hegseth's attorney has denied the allegations.",
      "Then on Thursday, reports emerged that Hegseth told Sen. Elizabeth Warren, a Massachusetts Democrat on the armed services committee, that he paid $50,000 to a woman who had accused him of sexual assault in 2017, which two sources familiar with the situation confirmed to CBS News. Hegseth's lawyer told CBS News in November that his client\u00a0paid a confidential financial settlement to the\u00a0 woman out of concern that the allegation would lead to his firing as a host at Fox News. Hegseth has denied the allegation.",
      "The new allegations sparked renewed fervor among Democrats, who implored Republicans to reconsider their support for him.",
      "\"This is not the kind of moral character that we want in somebody who's going to lead the men and women of our military,\" Sen. Tammy Duckworth, an Illinois Democrat on the Senate Armed Services Committee told CBS News in an interview. \"I really urge my Republican colleagues to put national security ahead of their loyalty to Donald Trump, and I hope that they will oppose him.\"",
      "On Thursday, two Republican senators known for their willingness to buck their party \u2014 Sens. Lisa Murkowski of Alaska and Susan Collins of Maine \u2014 announced they wouldn't back Hegseth, citing his past behavior, judgment, and experience. But whether others would join them on the final vote remains to be seen. Not every GOP senator who voted to advance Hegseth's nomination for consideration has committed to supporting his confirmation.",
      "Senate Republicans can afford to lose one more vote to get Hegseth's confirmation over the finish line, in which case Vice President JD Vance would be called upon to break a tie in Hegseth's favor.",
      "Republicans expressed confidence in Hegseth's prospects. Sen. Mike Rounds, a South Dakota Republican who also sits on the Senate Armed Services Committee, told CBS News that the new Hegseth affidavit \"doesn't change anything,\" calling it another instance of a \"third party coming in saying something which is directly contradictory to what the individual they've identified has said.\" Sen. Josh Hawley, a Missouri Republican, told reporters earlier Thursday that he'd be surprised if Hegseth isn't confirmed, saying, \"I think he has the votes.\"",
      "Sen. John Barroso, the Republican whip, touted Hegseth's qualifications for the job, while arguing that he had answered \"hard questions with clarity and resolve\" at last week's  and the committee had voted to advance him.",
      "\"Unfortunately that wasn't enough for the Democrats,\" Barrasso said. \"They decided to then run their desperate playbook of distract and delay, so that they could try to search and destroy.\"",
      "Democratic Sen. Richard Blumenthal of Connecticut told reporters Democrats would pursue \"any and every kind of way we can raise these issues about competence and character\" regarding Mr. Trump's most controversial nominees, including Hegseth.",
      "\"I hope at least a few of my Republican colleagues will search deep into their consciences and ask whether this man really should be at the pinnacle of our military defense and have responsibility for the most awesome and important decisions made about our national security,\" Blumenthal said, arguing that a majority would oppose Hegseth if they didn't face pressure from the president.",
      "Danielle Hegseth's affidavit has prompted questions about the background check and briefing process, too. Sen. Jack Reed, the ranking member on the Senate Armed Services Committee, said the testimony in the affidavit was not adequately included in the briefing provided by the Trump transition team. And he said he's been \"extremely disappointed\" in the FBI's investigation. Reed said he was briefed ahead of the hearing and was alarmed that investigators didn't contact critical witnesses and whistleblowers.",
      "The Rhode Island Democrat called it \"unprecedented\" that the FBI has returned to him twice \u2014\u00a0 as recently as Wednesday night \u2014 to provide additional information on Hegseth.",

      "In financial disclosure forms filed with the U.S. Office of Government Ethics, Kennedy reported debts of $610,000 to $1.2 million on his American Express card, up to three mortgages totaling somewhere from $2.25 million to $10.5 million, along with other loans, one of which was as much as $500,000.",
      "Even so, he reported netting more than $11 million over the past two years, and is expected to take in $2 million to $4 million more in book advances for two books with Skyhorse Publishing in New York: \"Unsettled Science\" and \"A Defense for Israel.\"",
      "Nearly $9 million of Kennedy's recent income came from his law firm, Kennedy and Madonna, LLP, now called Madonna and Madonna, LLP. In a letter dated Jan. 21, Kennedy wrote to the U.S. Office of Government Ethics that, if confirmed as HHS Secretary, he would sever ties with the firm and some other income sources to avoid conflicts of interest. His final payment from the firm was in May 2024, he said.",
      "The disclosures also make clear Kennedy still intends to receive legal fees from Wisner Baum, a firm suing the maker of the human papillomavirus (HPV) vaccine Gardasil over its alleged failure to warn consumers about its risks.",
      "\"Upon confirmation, I will retain an interest in contingency fee cases that do not involve claims against the United States and in which the United States is not a party and does not have a direct and substantial interest,\" Kennedy wrote in his disclosure.",
      "His financial disclosure shows he earned $856,559 in referral fees from Wisner.",
      "Kennedy also drew $326,056 in salary and benefits from Children's Health Defense, a nonprofit that has filed lawsuits against federal agencies \u2014 including some he would oversee as secretary \u2014 over vaccine approvals such as COVID-19 shots for children.",

    "story": [
      "A key economic priority for President Trump this year is to extend the provisions in his signature Tax Cuts and Jobs Act, a 2017 law that lowered tax rates for most Americans, before they expire at the end of 2025. Now, Republican lawmakers have developed a 50-page laundry list of ideas for how to pay for those planned cuts.",
      "The plan from congressional Republicans,\u00a0published earlier by the New York Times, was confirmed by a person familiar with the document, who noted that it represents a menu of policy options for lawmakers to consider. The document also cites several new tax breaks proposed by Mr. Trump while on the campaign trail last falls, such as eliminating taxes on overtime and tips.",
      "But extending the TCJA's provisions alone could prove costly, with the Congressional Budget Office forecasting a cost of $4.6 trillion over 10 years. Adding new tax breaks, such as Mr. Trump's promise to ditch taxes on overtime pay, could push up the bill even higher at a time when the nation's debt has spiraled to more than $36 trillion.",
      "According to the document, some ideas for funding those tax breaks include eliminating the mortgage home deduction, a popular break for homeowners, and the deductibility of student loan interest. Other methods to drum up more money include an across-the-board 10% import tariff \u2014 essentially, a universal tax on U.S. imports that would be paid by consumers.",
      "The plan also outlines ideas for cutting federal spending, primarily by trimming outlays for social safety net programs such as Medicaid and food stamps. Overall, the document points to a potential tax overhaul that could put more money in the pockets of wealthier \u00a0Americans while cutting assistance for low- and middle-class taxpayers, experts say.",
      "\"If you are extending the tax cuts and enacting tariffs and cutting Medicaid, that will deliver benefits more among higher-income households, and more of a cost will be born by lower-income households,\" Joseph Rosenberg, a senior fellow at the Urban-Brookings Tax Policy Center, a tax-focused think tank, told CBS MoneyWatch.",
      "Adding a blanket 10% tariff could raise $1.9 trillion over the next decade, according to the document shared with Republican lawmakers. But tariffs are largely paid by consumers because companies tend to raise their prices to cover the extra import duties.

      "\"This is a new effort under this administration,\" one of the officials said.",
      "White House officials didn't immediately respond to questions about what the new email alert system might be used for or why the new system was being implemented this week.",
      "The Washington Post also reported on Friday that similar messages went out at other agencies and departments starting on Thursday. Several people who claim to be government employees reported the email as spam or phishing in two Reddit threads for federal employees. One person in these Reddit threads said the Food and Drug Administration had sent out an email Friday asking employees to stop reporting it, since the message is legitimate.",

      "\"Everyone thought it was spam,\" said the tipster, who asked that the screengrab not be published. \"There was a flurry of messages, 'Is this spam?'\"",
      "Waking up to a suspicious-looking email on Friday morning did little to calm nerves amid a wave of big personnel changes across the federal government this week. President Trump, as promised during his presidential campaign, issued new executive actions and executive orders this week freezing some hiring; temporarily halting the publication of government public health reports; calling for the end of federal diversity, equity and inclusion programs; and reviving a proposed civil service hiring plan from his first administration that critics warn could politicize the historically nonpartisan federal workforce.",

      "OPM officials said leaders of other agencies and departments received advance notice on Thursday of plans to test a new \"Federal Government-Wide Email Communication Test,\" which was also posted on the OPM web site. In some cases, the rank-and-file didn't learn about plans for the email until it arrived, leading to Friday morning's confusion, one of the officials said.",

    "story": [
      "Washington \u2014 President Trump's cascade of executive actions announced soon after he took office has already prompted more than half a dozen legal challenges before the end of his first week. And they're likely just the opening salvos in a series of court battles that will play out as federal agencies begin the work of executing the president's directives.",
      "In the hours and days after his inauguration Monday, Mr. Trump has signed more than 50 executive orders, memorandums and proclamations tackling a wide range of policy issues, from immigration to federal hiring and remote work to energy.",
      "His wave of Day 1 signings wasn't unusual \u2014 his predecessor issued more than a dozen executive actions on his first day in the White House \u2014 and neither are Mr. Trump's unilateral efforts to change policy. But whether his proposals are ultimately implemented by federal agencies in the face of legal challenges remains to be seen.",
      "Already, Mr. Trump's order seeking to end birthright citizenship and prohibiting federal agencies from issuing citizenship documents to children born on U.S. soil to parents in the country illegally or under temporary visas has been the subject of at least four separate lawsuits brought by 22 states and advocacy groups.",
      "A federal judge in Seattle temporarily blocked\u00a0the order's implementation Thursday, in response to a request from a group of four Democrat-led states calling it \"blatantly unconstitutional.\"",
      "Mr. Trump's executive order reinstating a policy from his first term that removes employment protections from career federal workers has been challenged by the National Treasury Employees Union, and his directive establishing the Department of Government Efficiency, or DOGE, is at the center of three separate court fights mounted by nonprofit organizations.",
      "Why the pace of Trump lawsuits will vary",
      "But other groups, many of which mounted court battles during Mr. Trump's first term in office, have so far remained on the sidelines \u2014 for now.",
      "The NAACP Legal Defense Fund said it is examining \"all available options to stop this administration from implementing alarming and dangerous policies like these executive orders, which aim to subvert our equal protection and anti-discrimination laws and would cause great harm to Black people and other people of color.\"",
      "Jonathan Adler, a constitutional law scholar at Case Western Reserve University, said more challenges will likely arise after federal agencies take action to follow the instructions Mr. Trump laid out in his measures.",
      "The executive actions said, \"don't have independent legal force, and the consequences come from the fact that people in the executive branch follow those instructions in taking various actions, and those actions can have consequences.\"",
      "But Mr. Trump's orders cracking down on immigration, which he pledged to do on the campaign trail, are likely to have concrete effects quickly, and will be litigated more swiftly.",
      "\"When we're talking about domestic regulatory policy, it takes a while before the executive order produces the sort of tangible agency action that somebody can sue over, whereas in the context of immigration, trade, foreign affairs, the ability of the president to take actions that have more immediate effects is broader,\" Adler said.",
      "Lambda Legal, which advocates for the civil rights of LGBTQ people, is preparing to pursue litigation targeting Mr. Trump's executive actions, including one that declares the U.S. recognizes two sexes, male and female, and those related to diversity, equity and inclusion efforts.",
      "\"It's really attempting to be a scorched-earth approach to censor language and change the culture with the stroke of a Sharpie, and of course that's directly contrary to the First Amendment and to the Equal Protection Clause,\" said Jennifer Pizer, chief legal officer of Lambda Legal, of Mr. Trump's directives. \"It's an area of enormous concern because it's attempting to reimpose an exclusionary worldview and to make it difficult to provide effective services to minority communities. And that's not acceptable and lawful.\"",
      "During Mr. Trump's first administration, many of his key policy proposals were tied up in the courts, in part because agencies failed to follow the federal law governing the process for issuing regulations. In one instance, the Supreme Court ruled 5-4 that the Department of Homeland Security's 2017 decision to rescind the Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals program violated that law, the Administrative Procedure Act.",
      "With the second Trump administration still in its first opening days, it's too early to tell whether that will recur.",
      "But Pizer said that based on Lambda Legal's experience during Mr. Trump's first term \u2014 with victories stemming from both a failure to follow the legal process for issuing regulations and the constitutionality of his orders \u2014 the organization has \"substantial confidence that much of what this administration appears determined to do will not stand. It's blatantly defying settled law in a range of ways.\"",
      "A shift in how the courts evaluate the policy decisions of federal agencies could also affect the success of Mr. Trump's actions.",
      "Last year, the Supreme Court reversed a 40-year-old decision that gave federal agencies broad regulatory power by requiring courts to defer to an agency's interpretation of laws by Congress if it was reasonable. But it has also been reinforcing the message that Congress must give clear authorization for an agency to decide an issue of major political or economic significance, known as the major questions doctrine.",
      "The Supreme Court applied this legal theory when it blocked President Biden's sweeping student loan forgiveness plan in June 2023 after finding that a 2003 federal law did not authorize the education secretary to cancel nearly $500 billion in student loan debt.",
      "\"Agencies don't have a roving license to just make the world a better place because they think there's a problem,\" Adler said. \"I would be surprised if the court backed away from that under the Trump administration.\"",
      "But he said there are two areas \u2014 both of which are central to Mr. Trump's second-term agenda \u2014 where courts and existing laws are more permissive of the executive branch's exercise of authority: trade and immigration. Immigration laws create a structure where the president can do more unilaterally, Adler said, and Congress has over the years given the executive branch more emergency powers.",
      "\"On traditional domestic policy, I think the overall trend of the court's jurisprudence will constrain the ability of the administration to do things that are particularly dramatic, but trade and immigration will be an exception to that,\" Adler said.",

    "summary": "President Trump revoked a 1965 rule that prohibited federal contractors from discriminating against employees or job applicants.",
    "story": [
      "Among the flurry of executive orders since his Jan. 20 inauguration, President Donald Trump has taken aim at\u00a0rooting out diversity, equity and inclusion, or DEI, programs within the federal government. But his efforts go beyond DEI, with one recent order rescinding a Civil Rights-era rule that has helped protect millions of workers from discrimination.",
      "Mr. Trump's Jan. 21\u00a0order \u2014 \"Ending illegal discrimination and restoring merit-based opportunity\" \u2014 revokes the\u00a0Equal Employment Opportunity\u00a0rule signed by President Lyndon B. Johnson in 1965. According to the rule, federal contractors, who today employ 3.7 million people, can't discriminate against job applicants or workers on the basis of race, gender and other protected characteristics.",
      "Revoking the 60-year-old rule eliminates a bedrock civil rights protection for American workers, signaling an effort to target workplace issues that go beyond DEI, labor experts say. While DEI is shorthand for programs that encourage equality in the workplace for women, minorities and other groups, the Equal Employment Opportunity rule prohibited federal contractors from engaging in acts of discrimination, such as refusing to hire someone due to their race or paying an employee less because of their gender.",
      "\"It is still stunning to me that he took such an extraordinary step,\" said Fatima Goss Graves, CEO of the National Women's Law Center, a nonprofit advocacy group focused on gender justice. Revoking the rule signals \"he is going after something bigger: the basic and foundational idea that we should be able to work at workplaces without discrimination.\"",
      "She added, \"We agreed to that 60 years ago, and I'll add that people in this country support it, too.\"",
      "What was the Equal Employment Opportunity rule?",
      "The rule required federal contractors to \"take affirmative action\" to ensure that workers aren't discriminated against based on race, color, religion, sex, sexual orientation, gender identity or national origin. This covered everything from hiring to promotions and pay, with the Department of Labor tasked with overseeing and enforcing the rule.",
      "How does revoking the rule impact protections for workers?",
      "It's still illegal under U.S. law for employers to discriminate on the basis of race, gender or other traits, labor experts said.",
      "But rescinding the Equal Employment Opportunity act could have a chilling effect on cases where workers at federal contractors allege they have been treated unfairly, and could impact the Department of Labor's ability to pursue workplace discrimination cases, Josh Boxerman, government affairs manager at the National Employment Law Project, told CBS MoneyWatch.",
      "\"Taking away this set of tools puts workers at a disadvantage,\" he\u00a0added.",
      "Does this have an impact on private employers?",
      "While the Equal Employment Opportunity rule focuses on federal contractors, Mr. Trump's executive orders could spill over to private employers, said Alex Hontos, a partner at law firm Dorsey & Whitney and expert on government contracting.",
      "\"It's not just about government contractors and grantees,\" Hontos said. \"It is clearly a stepwise approach and is going to apply to the private sector. You see that at the back end of the [executive order], where attorneys general have been directed to put a plan together to either call out private-sector companies that are involved in DEI or to actually seek enforcement actions in some way.\"",
      "Even before Mr. Trump's orders banning DEI from federal agencies, corporations, including Meta,\u00a0Ford,\u00a0McDonald's\u00a0and\u00a0Walmart, have been stepping back from these programs. Those decisions followed a 2023 Supreme Court decision\u00a0banning affirmative action\u00a0in college admissions, as well as pressure from conservative political activists.",
      "Why is President Trump banning DEI and revoking the Equal Employment Opportunity rule?",
      "Mr. Trump's aim is to restore what the administration considers to be a merit-based hiring system, according to officials and his executive orders.",
      "\"It is the policy of the United States to protect the civil rights of all Americans and to promote individual initiative, excellence and hard work,' the president wrote in the order to revoke the 1965 rule.",
      "DEI policies, he wrote, have led to \"illegal, pernicious discrimination that has prioritized how people were born instead of what they were capable of doing.\"",
      "Numerous lawsuits have taken aim at DEI programs, with some alleging that the policies discriminate against people who aren't minorities or that they violate some workers' rights to free speech, among other allegations,\u00a0according to New York University's Meltzer Center.",
      "\"The Trump administration isn't getting rid of the concepts of diversity, equity and inclusion as they are typically understood,\" a viewpoint from Erec Smith, research fellow at the Cato Institute and co-founder of Free Black Thought, a nonprofit dedicated to highlighting viewpoint diversity within Black communities.\"He's getting rid of the critical social justice version, which is inherently divisive.\"",
      "What will happen with DEI programs?",
      "DEI programs are being scrubbed from the federal government, according to the Trump administration's directives.",
      "All federal employees in DEI roles were placed on leave by 5 p.m. Eastern time on Wednesday. Agencies were also told to \"take down all outward facing media (websites, social media accounts, etc.) of DEIA [Diversity, Equity, Inclusion and Accessibility] offices\"; cancel upcoming DEI trainings; and terminate contracts with DEI-related contractors by the same time Wednesday.",
      "Meanwhile, Mr. Trump's Jan. 21 executive order requires federal agencies to come up with \"up to nine potential civil compliance investigations\" of publicly traded companies, large nonprofits and other private institutions with DEI programs that \"constitute illegal discrimination or preferences.\"",
      "That part of the executive order \"seems to be an attempt to intimidate the private sector,\" NELP's Boxerman said of the requirement to pursue civil investigations in the private sector. \"This seems to be a clear effort to name and shame companies that are doing the right thing,\" he said.",

    "summary": "The far-reaching move empowers federal immigration agencies to target a population of migrants who came to the U.S. with the government's permission.",
    "story": [
      "Washington \u2014 The Trump administration has given federal immigration authorities permission to revoke the legal status of hundreds of thousands of migrants the former Biden White House allowed into the U.S. and seek their deportation, according to an internal Department of Homeland Security memo obtained by CBS News.",
      "The far-reaching move empowers federal immigration agencies, including U.S. Immigration Customs Enforcement, to target a population of migrants who came to the U.S. with the government's permission and who expected to be shielded from deportation, at least temporarily.",
      "Now, ICE officers can arrest, detain and deport \u2014 in some cases, in an expedited fashion \u2014 at least 1.5 million migrants who came to the U.S. in recent years under programs the Biden administration said dissuaded illegal immigration but that the Trump administration now argues were unlawful.",
      "The major policy change was authorized by acting Homeland Security Secretary Benjamine Huffman, who the Trump administration placed in that position pending the confirmation of President Trump's pick to lead the department, South Dakota Gov. Kristi Noem.",
      "In his memo on Thursday, which was first reported by The New York Times, Huffman issued guidance to ICE, Customs and Border Protection and U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services on how to implement two directives he recently issued.",
      "One of Huffman's orders instructed officials to start the process of phasing out Biden administration policies that allowed certain migrants to enter the U.S. through an immigration authority known as parole. The parole authority enables presidents to admit foreigners on humanitarian grounds quickly but the Trump administration argues the Biden administration used it improperly.",
      "The Biden administration used parole to process nearly 1 million migrants at legal crossings along the southern border through a phone app that distributed entry appointments to those waiting in Mexico. The app, known as CBP One, was shut down immediately after Mr. Trump took office.",
      "Parole was also used by the Biden administration to allow more than half a million Cubans, Haitians, Nicaraguans and Venezuelans to fly to the U.S. if they had sponsors in the country willing to financially help them. Like those allowed into the country under the CBP One process, these migrants were made eligible for two-year government work permits through the parole status.",
      "Huffman's second order expanded a fast-track deportation process that allows immigration officials to deport certain migrants, without allowing them to see an immigration judge. The policy, known as expedited removal, has long been limited to areas within 100 miles of U.S. land borders and to migrants who were in the county for fewer than two weeks.",
      "But Huffman expanded expedited removal nationwide and made it applicable to migrants who can't prove they've been in the U.S. for over two years. That decision is already being challenged in federal court by pro-immigrant advocates.",
      "In his latest memo on Thursday, Huffman said immigration authorities, exercising their new powers, should review cases and determine who is eligible to be placed in expedited removal. That process, he said, could include revoking the parole status of an individual, as well as terminating any pending immigration court case, to seek that person's quick removal from the U.S.",
      "Huffman's memo indicated those who are not eligible for expedited removal, because they have been in the U.S. for more than two years, are also at risk of being targeted for deportation.",
      "He said immigration officers should consider placing in deportation proceedings those brought to the U.S. under Biden administration parole programs that will be scrapped, paused or changed under Mr. Trump's directives. Their parole status could be revoked, Huffman suggested, \"in light of any changed legal or factual circumstance.\"",
      "It's unclear if the Trump administration's orders will be used to seek the arrest and deportation of other migrants brought to the U.S. by the Biden administration under the parole authority. They include tens of thousands of Afghans airlifted from Kabul following the U.S. military withdrawal in 2021, as well as 240,000 Ukrainians sponsored by Americans after Russia's invasion of their homeland.",

They will have just 15 days to propose a plan within 15 days to release the JFK files, though the president's nominees for both those roles have not yet been confirmed by the Senate.",
      "The civil rights icon was assassinated in Memphis on April 4, 1968, as he stood on the balcony of the old Lorraine Motel. King, who was 39 years old, was rushed to a hospital, where he died of a bullet wound to the neck, as CBS News anchor Walter Cronkite reported that day.",
      "\"For us, the assassination of our father is a deeply personal family loss that we have endured over the last 56 years. We hope to be provided the opportunity to review the files as a family prior to its public release,\"\u00a0the King family said\u00a0in a statement late Thursday.",
      "Why is Trump releasing the MLK Jr. assassination files?",
      "Mr. Trump said at a rally in Washington, D.C., on the eve of his inauguration that he would make the files public to signal a restoration of \"transparency and accountability to government.\"",

      "On the afternoon of April 4, 1968, Ray rented a room under an assumed name at a Memphis rooming house near the Lorraine Motel. In early May, he was indicted, and an international manhunt ensued. Ray was captured on June 8, 1968, at Heathrow Airport, in London. He was extradited and returned to the U.S. the following month and pleaded guilty, receiving a sentence of 99 years.",
      "There were allegations that the FBI was complicit in King's assassination, too, however, so a select committee conducted its own investigation. The National Archives noted that the committee \"recognized that FBI files were potentially tainted,\" but it never uncovered evidence to show any complicity by the bureau. However, the committee \"did note major deficiencies in the scope and method of the FBI's postassassination investigation,\" the archives said.",
      "The FBI conducted surveillance of King for years, targeting him with a counterintelligence program known as COINTELPRO. The archives noted that a Senate select committee investigated and published a report exposing the \"full scope of the attempt by the FBI to discredit Dr. King.\"",
      "The Justice Department launched a task force to probe the FBI's harassment and investigations of King, as well as his assassination and the criminal investigation. It was also assigned to determine whether those FBI efforts might have had an effect on King's assassination. The task force ultimately concluded that Ray acted along but also found that the FBI's actions involving COINTELPRO's efforts to undermine King should not have been continued and were \"very probably...felonious.\"",
      "What MLK Jr. assassination files have already been released?",

      "The ATF and DEA are conventionally not involved with immigration enforcement, with exceptions related to drug trafficking or firearm violations.

The U.S. Marshals Service routinely assists in immigration-related cases involving federal fugitives, and some work alongside Homeland Security Investigations at the border to thwart transnational criminal organizations, part of DHS' Border Enforcement Security Task Force.",

There are other former officials who continue to face a threat from Iran and are provided U.S.-taxpayer funded security by other agencies. Those individuals include former Secretary of Defense Mark Esper, Ret. Gen. Mark Milley and Frank McKenzie, CENTCOM Gen (Ret.) The Biden administration did not explain why it pulled protection off of former Trump national security adviser Robert O'Brien, who also faced threats.",

When you talk to any firefighter with any sense of history, they are seeing different [fire] behavior that is, in many cases, un-fightable.\"",
      "And Vaillant says the cause is something science has been telling us for decades: the CO2 that our combustion engines keep pumping into the atmosphere. \"We don't feel it; we don't smell it; we don't notice it,\" he said. \"But if you were to take the car engine that brought me here and set it up on the floor here and fired it up, we would go deaf, and then we would die from its emissions.\u00a0 And that's under the hood of every internal combustion engine car. And there are hundreds of millions of them. So, the emissions from fire, these trillions of fires that we make every day, has created this artificially warm climate.\"",

      "Of the exoplanets discovered so far, only a few dozen have been directly imaged, according to\u00a0NASA.

    "summary": "The $500 billion Stargate project is projected to create hundreds of thousands of jobs. Here's what's known so far.",
    "story": [
      "When President Trump announced the new $500 billion Stargate AI venture from OpenAI, Softbank and Oracle on Tuesday, he promised it would ensure \"the future of technology\" in the U.S. So far, Wall Street appears to agree, with some analysts speculating about its potential to transform the tech industry.",
      "But the project is also sparking some questions and skepticism, including pointed criticism from one of Mr. Trump's closest advisers, tech billionaire Elon Musk.",
      "\"They don't actually have the money,\" Musk wrote on X, the social media app he owns. \"SoftBank has well under $10B secured. I have that on good authority.\"",
      "OpenAI CEO Sam Altman countered that claim,\u00a0replying to Musk, \"wrong, as you surely know.\"",
      "Whatever the case might be, there are plenty of questions swirling about Stargate, which takes its name from a science-fiction movie and TV show about portals that transport people to other galaxies.",
      "At a White House briefing on Tuesday for the project's announcement, the executives behind the venture described Stargate as an AI project that could also prove to be transformative, albeit via Earth-based tech rather than intergalactic travel.",
      "\"This will help people's lives. This will help solve many, many issues ... with the power of AI,\" said SoftBank CEO Masayoshi Son who joined Mr. Trump at the briefing, along with Altman and Oracle co-founder Larry Ellison.",
      "\"I think this will be the most important project of this era,\" added Altman.",
      "Here's what we know about the project so far.",
      "What is the Stargate project?",
      "Stargate is a venture that has the backing of OpenAI, Oracle and Japanese company Softbank, with the latter promising an initial investment of $100 billion, according to Tuesday's announcement.",
      "The goal, said Son, is to ramp that investment to $500 billion within 4 years, or before the end of Mr. Trump's current term.",
      "Softbank will hold financial responsibility for the project, while OpenAI will oversee the operations, according to a research note from Capital Economics chief economist John Higgins. \"Donald Trump's ringing endorsement of Stargate is another shot in the arm for artificial intelligence (AI) in the early days of his second presidency,\" he noted.",
      "Where will Stargate be located?",
      "Stargate investment will be directed toward constructing data centers to support AI development, according to the announcement.",
      "Already, there are data centers under construction in Texas, with the first one located in Abilene, Oracle's Ellison said at the press conference. The goal is to construct 10 data centers initially, with plans to expand to 20 locations of about half a million square feet each, he added.",
      "Other potential sites for data centers across the nation are also being evaluated, according to a person familiar with the project.",
      "What type of projects will Stargate AI pursue?",
      "The data centers will be used by OpenAI, according to the person familiar with the project.",
      "During the press conference, Ellison highlighted AI's ability to transform health care, saying that the tools provided by OpenAI and Softbank are helping to develop a cancer vaccine.",
      "\"You can do early cancer detection with a blood test, and, using AI to look at the blood test, you can find the cancer that is seriously threatening the person,\" Ellison said. \"Once we gene sequence that gene tumor, you can vaccinate the person against that cancer, and you can make that mRNA vaccine robotically using AI within 48 hours.\"",
      "How many jobs could Stargate create?",
      "Mr. Trump claimed the venture would create \"over 100,000 American jobs almost immediately,\" while OpenAI, in a statement on its website, says Stargate will \"create hundreds of thousands of American jobs.\"",
      "New hires for the project will be situated close to the data center locations, according to the person familiar with the venture. Stargate will hire people for construction, operations and other areas, they said.",
      "What is President Trump's AI policy?",
      "Mr. Trump is signaling a sharp divergence from former President Biden's AI policy. Within hours after returning to the White House, Mr. Trump made a symbolic mark on the future of artificial intelligence by repealing Biden's guardrails for the fast-developing technology.",
      "What will come next from Mr. Trump and how it will diverge from his predecessor's effort to safeguard AI technology remains unclear. The new administration didn't respond to requests for comment about the repealed Biden policy.",
      "Even so, Wall Street interpreted the Stargate project as a sign the Trump administration will encourage investment and growth of the AI sector, especially as a way to bolster the nation's AI capabilities as it competes with China for tech dominance.",
      "\"The key role of Softbank, a Japanese company, in Stargate, highlights how Trump isn't hell-bent on excluding foreign firms from participating in America's quest for dominance in AI \u2013 provided they are headquartered in countries that are close allies of the U.S.,\" Capital Economics' Higgins wrote.",
      "He added, \"The new president seems much less keen than his predecessor on imposing checks and balances on the spread of AI.\"",
      "Why are some skeptical about Stargate?",
      "Aside from Musk, others have raised questions about whether Stargate's investment will actually reach $500 billion, with Higgins of Capital Economics writing, \"Whether that much will ultimately get spent remains to be seen.\"",
      "Musk also has a public feud with OpenAI and Altman, alleging in a lawsuit last year that the company and its CEO violated OpenAI's original mission statement by putting profits over benefiting humanity. After helping found OpenAI in 2015, Musk broke with the company, claiming that the AI firm had veered away from its founding agreement that it would use its technology to benefit the public and that it would open its technology for public use.",

    "story": [
      "Monterey County supervisors on Tuesday declared a state of emergency in response to last week's major fire at the Vistra lithium battery plant in Moss Landing.",
      "The emergency declaration came during a special meeting where officials gave updates on the fire and ongoing response. While the fire has burned itself out, there are still a lot of questions from local leaders and neighbors about what's next.",
      "\"This was the beginning,\" said Josh Contreras as he showed photos he took of the incident from his houseboat.",
      "The images show a fireball on the horizon, not even a mile away.",
      "\"I walked up the docks, and then I took more photos,\" he said. \"Because you could see the flames, probably almost as tall as the towers that stand here.\"",
      "The fire at the Moss Landing Vistra Power Plant, located about 90 miles south of San Francisco,\u00a0broke out last Thursday afternoon, escalating in the early evening to the point where the incident\u00a0triggered evacuations for about 1,200 Monterey County residents\u00a0in the area and shut down a section of Highway 1 in both directions.",
      "Concerned over the potentially toxic runoff if fire crews turned hoses on the burning lithium batteries, officials instead are allowing the to burn itself out.",
      "Officials\u00a0said the fire was largely out as of late Friday morning\u00a0during a press conference, but it flared up significantly for a few hours that afternoon before dying down again. Officials were eventually able to lift the evacuation orders by early Friday evening. The stretch of Highway 1 near the plant remained closed until Sunday.",
      "Now that the fire is out, he is one of the many people living in the area what lies in the future for the facility.",
      "\"If they do battery packs, they should keep it in more deserted areas,\" Contreras said.",
      "\"This technology is ahead of the government's ability to regulate it,\" Monterey County Supervisor Glenn Church said during the emergency meeting Tuesday. \"And the industry's ability to control it.\"",
      "Supervisors were asking similar questions about the fire. A representative from Vistra said were just getting access to the burned-out lithium battery facility. The incident was enough for Church, who last week likened the fire to a \"Three Mile Island\" event for the emerging industry -- to draw this conclusion:",
      "\"Battery storage is essential for the future. And that's the direction we're going,\" Church noted. \"But -- as I said last night and I've tried to emphasize -- we just can't put that above safety. That's got to be the priority at this point.\"",
      "Church is calling for the Vistra facility to remain closed until an independent investigation can determine the cause of the incident.",
      "\"Unfortunately, we're on a pretty steep learning curve with battery safety still,\" said Dustin Mulvaney, a professor of environmental sciences at San Jose State University. \"And we're still figuring out ways that these batteries catch on fire. We're still figuring out how to best suppress them.\"",
      "Mulvaney  said the Moss Landing facility fire will be a wake-up call for the entire industry, right down to the people who insure the batteries. A lot of people will want to know what went wrong, and where, in a plant that is a hodgepodge of lithium battery technology.",
      "\"That site is actually an example of different ways to design it,\" Mulvaney explained. \"Because it was built in different phases. They took advantage of different opportunities to put things in different places. But this example will cause the industry to reflect on how they built these things. Because they have to be better neighbors to the community.\"",
      "Those who live in the community are reflecting on what it means to have this plant as a neighbor.",
      "\"Yeah. It should be out in the desert,\" said plant neighbor Julie Nieman. \"Somewhere in Nevada, out in the desert where people aren't around. Why would you put it where people live, in this beautiful area by the ocean?\"",
      "With the exception of one closed roadway beside the plant, things in Moss Landing are pretty much back to normal. The parks and beaches have to reopened, though some people have raised additional questions about the impact the fire had on the environment, particularly the sensitive Elkhorn Slough Reserve. The wetlands area is home to a number of endangered sea otters.",

      "Ben said he used to average up to five hours of screen time per day. Once he switched to a flip phone, it went down to about 30 minutes. So, CBS News asked four of Ben's friends, Carson, Ranita, Jamison and Maya \u2014 all 8th graders in New Jersey \u2014 to try flip phones for a week. Maya said her average screen time at the beginning of the week was more than 10 hours, spent mostly watching TV and on Tiktok.",
      "They were curious but skeptical about the experiment. Jamison said he wasn't doing as well as he wanted to in school and thought his phone use could be a \"big factor in that.\" Although Ranita plays three sports, she admitted wasting time on her phone, watching 30 minutes of scrolling turn into an hour without noticing. Carson agreed to participate, but the avid basketball player was nervous. Maya, who loves studying English and just started rowing, was hoping the trial would help her sleep better at night.",
      "The day CBS News sat down with the teens and took their iPhones and iPads and gave them flip phones, the reactions were a mix of laughing, shaking and confusion. They spent time gathered around the kitchen table with Ben teaching them how to use these foreign devices, including learning how to text without a \"modern\" keyboard.",
      "They left with instructions to try and stay in the spirit of the experiment, not using friends or parents phones as crutches \u2014 and of course the promise they'd get their smart devices back in a week.",
      "Carson didn't make it and asked for his phone back within 24 hours, saying he sat staring at the wall until he had basketball practice after school. The others stuck it out, sending in mostly positive reviews in video diaries taken on their parents phones throughout the experiment.",
      "\"I've been sleeping a lot better, a lot less tired during the day,\" Maya said.",
      "Jamison said it was helping him finish his homework faster. Ranita reported that she was frustrated not having her digital wallet and felt other conveniences of her phone were missing.",
      "Screen time linked to anxiety and depression in teens",
      "Experts' concerns about increased screen time are not unfounded. Half of American teenagers aged 12 to 18 had four hours or more of daily screen time during a period between July 2021 and December 2023. Almost 23% had three hours of daily screen time, 17.8% had two hours, 6.1% had one hour, and only 3% had less than one hour, according to a report from the CDC's National Center for Health Statistics.",
      "Teens getting four or more hours of screen time each day were more likely to experience anxiety and depression, the report found.",
      "Living life outside screens",
      "Seven days later, the experiment was over. The teens noticed a difference \u2014 and so did their parents.",
      "\"I talked to my parents a lot more and like I went out a lot more with my friends,\" Jamison said.",
      "Jamison's mom, Amy Lita, said her son had hundreds of messages from group chats when he went back to his smartphone, \"but he thought it was all just nonsense and didn't feel like he missed out.\"",
      "Maya said she learned the importance of living life outside of your screen. Her mom, Lani Padilla, hopes the experience can help them do things differently going forward.",
      "\"I'm hoping it plants a seed to think a little more critically about how she uses her smartphone \u2014 and me, too,\" Padilla said.",
      "Next month will mark a full year for Ben and his flip phone. His friends may not  join him full time, but he believes it's never too late to make a change \u2014 and it doesn't have to be all or nothing.",
      "\"It doesn't have to be something as drastic as completely getting rid of all your social media. I have an Instagram account that I will use on  my computer, but it's more about doing small things that you can bring together to just fix that constant need,\" Ben said.",
      "Ben's mom, Jenn Cohen-Vigder, hopes more parents will take notice.",
      "\"I think if people really listen to what the kids said and take a good hard look, it could cause people to reevaluate how their children use their phones. This is something people should be concerned about,\" she said.",

    "published": "Tue, 21 Jan 2025 17:19:21 -0500",
    "summary": "Trump on Monday signed an executive order to create Elon Musk's DOGE, with a mandate to improve federal IT systems.",
    "story": [
      "President Donald Trump on Monday signed an executive order officially creating the Department of Government Efficiency, the cost-cutting initiative helmed by billionaires Elon Musk and Vivek Ramaswamy. The executive order included fresh details about DOGE's goals and structure, such as a mandate to upgrade the government's IT systems.",
      "Mr. Trump first announced DOGE in November with a statement that said the effort would \"provide advice and guidance from outside of Government.\" The goal, he added in November, would be to provide recommendations to \"slash excess regulations, cut wasteful expenditures and restructure federal agencies.\"",
      "Musk and Ramaswamy wrote in a November Wall Street Journal opinion article that they aimed to cut $500 billion in annual federal costs by targeting \"expenditures that are unauthorized by Congress or being used in ways that Congress never intended.\"",
      "But Mr. Trump's executive order says that DOGE will in fact be housed within the executive branch, rather than operating as an outside advisory committee. The EO also states that an existing White House office called the U.S. Digital Service \u2014 a unit that primarily works on improving government websites and tech \u2014 will be renamed the U.S. DOGE Service.",
      "DOGE's purpose will be to \"implement the President's DOGE Agenda, by modernizing Federal technology and software to maximize governmental efficiency and productivity,\" the EO states.",
      "The executive order doesn't include any details about cutting federal spending, slashing regulations or restructuring federal agencies. To be sure, the lack of a mention in the EO about cost-cutting doesn't mean that DOGE won't also tackle those issues, as well as taking on a mandate to upgrade federal IT systems.",
      "The Trump administration didn't immediately respond to a request for comment.",
      "DOGE lawsuits",
      "The EO comes as DOGE faces multiple lawsuits\u00a0over its structure and efforts so far, with the cases filed shortly after Mr. Trump's inauguration on Monday. The lawsuits claim that because DOGE was operating as a federal advisory committee, it was in violation of a law called the Federal Advisory Committee Act, or FACA.",
      "FACA regulates the functions and transparency of federal advisory committees, requiring them to operate transparently and publicly, as well as include representation from people who could be affected by their operations.",
      "But with Mr. Trump's EO establishing DOGE as a unit within the executive branch, it appears that the effort will not be operating as a federal advisory committee. Democracy Forward, which is representing some of the groups suing DOGE, said the executive order doesn't alter their plans.",
      "\"Our legal team is reviewing yesterday's executive orders. DOGE has been operating secretly and out of compliance with federal law for some time, which yesterday's executive orders could not impact,\" Skye Perryman, CEO of Democracy Forward, said in a statement.",
      "And National Security Counselors, another public service group that is suing DOGE, said that it doesn't \"have any reason to believe that the entity created by the recent executive order is the same animal as the advisory committee we are litigating about.\"",
      "\"The executive order has definitely muddied the waters a bit, but at the end of the day, the deciding factor will be what the new U.S. DOGE Service actually does and how,\" said Kel McClanahan, executive director of National Security Counselors, said on Tuesday. \"It is difficult to imagine the sprawling DOGE written about by Musk and Ramaswamy slamming on its brakes and taking a job modernizing agency IT systems.\"",
      "Ramaswamy leaving DOGE",
      "Meanwhile, DOGE is losing one of its co-leaders, with Ramaswamy posting on social media on Jan. 20 that he is stepping back from the effort. Ramaswamy intends to announce a campaign for Ohio governor as soon as the end of January, CBS News has reported.",
      "\"It was my honor to help support the creation of DOGE. I'm confident that Elon & team will succeed in streamlining government,\" Ramaswamy wrote.",
      "According to Mr. Trump's EO, DOGE will be a \"temporary organization\" that will focus on \"advancing the President's 18-month DOGE agenda.\" The EO says that DOGE will come to an end on July 4, 2026.",
      "On Monday, Trump said DOGE will have about \"about 20 people\" working in its office.",
      "According to the U.S. Digital Service, the unit currently has about 230 employees, with recent work by the unit including assisting the IRS on its new Direct File service, as well as improving the Social Security Administration's website. DOGE says its SSA work is\u00a0projected to save the agency about $285 million over five years in infrastructure expenses.",

      "\"We thank President Trump for providing the necessary clarity and assurance to our service providers that they will face no penalties providing TikTok to over 170 million Americans and allowing over 7 million small businesses to thrive,\" TikTok said in a statement. \"It's a strong stand for the First Amendment and against arbitrary censorship. We will work with President Trump on a long-term solution that keeps TikTok in the United States.\"",

      "TikTok voluntarily shut down service in the U.S. just hours before a Sunday deadline, cutting off access to tens of millions of users after the Supreme Court this week\u00a0upheld a law that effectively banned it over concerns about its ties to China.",
      "The law passed by Congress last year gave TikTok's China-bases parent company ByteDance until Jan. 19 to divest from TikTok or be cut off from U.S. app stores and hosting services. TikTok said a sale wasn't possible and challenged the law in court, but it was rejected by a unanimous Supreme Court on Friday.",
      "Trump on Sunday posted on social media that he would restore TikTok, first writing \"SAVE TIKTOK\" and then vowing to issue an executive order on Monday to extend the period of time before the law takes effect. Further, he said there would be no liability for companies that helped keep TikTok from going dark before the order went into effect.",
      "\"Americans deserve to see our exciting Inauguration on Monday, as well as other events and conversations,\" he wrote.\u00a0 \"I would like the United States to have a 50% ownership position in a joint venture.\u00a0 By doing this, we save TikTok, keep it in good hands and allow it to say up.\u00a0 Without U.S. approval, there is no Tik Tok.\u00a0 With our approval, it is worth hundreds of billions of dollars - maybe trillions.\"",
      "The Supreme Court's decision said the\u00a0divest-or-ban law\u00a0does not violate the free speech rights of TikTok or its 170 million users in the U.S., agreeing with the government's position that the platform could be used by China to collect a vast amount of sensitive information on Americans.",
      "While the Biden administration said enforcement of the law would be left to the incoming Trump administration, the company itself took itself offline shortly before Sunday's midnight deadline.",

But we also want an app that 170 million Americans clearly really enjoy and that we were able to get our message out during the Trump campaign in a very powerful way.\"",
      "TikTok had said Friday it would \"be forced to go dark\" beginning Sunday unless the Biden administration assured service providers that the law would not be enforced. The White House called the appeal \"a stunt\" and said the company should bring up its concerns with the Trump administration.",
      "\"We see no reason for TikTok or other companies to take actions in the next few days before the Trump Administration takes office on Monday,\" White House press secretary Karine Jean-Pierre said.",
      "Internationally on Sunday, the TikTok app remained accessible, and there was no indication for international users that it had gone dark in the U.S. It was still possible to view and interact with American accounts, and there was no obvious official signposting that U.S. users' access had been restricted.",
      "Even if Trump declines to enforce the ban, the law would still be on the books, and companies like Apple and Google could be penalized down the road for violations. Trump told NBC News on Saturday that he was considering an option to extend the deadline for the law to go into effect.",
      "\"The 90-day extension is something that will be most likely done, because it's appropriate,\" he said in the phone interview, adding, \"if I decide to do that, I'll probably announce it on Monday.\"",
      "The law includes a provision that allows for a short-term extension if there is a sale in progress.",
      "During Supreme Court arguments on Jan. 10, Noel Francisco, a lawyer for TikTok, warned that the platform would shut down when the law went into effect, explaining that it would be \"extraordinarily difficult\" for a divestiture to occur under any timeline because the Chinese government opposes a sale of the algorithm that powers the platform by tailoring video recommendations to each user.",
      "\"As I understand it, we go dark,\" Francisco said.",
      "But even if there is an eventual sale that did not include TikTok's algorithm, it would take \"many years\" for a new team of engineers to rebuild it and it would be a \"fundamentally different platform,\" according to Francisco. He said the company's inability to share any user data with ByteDance under the law would cut off American users from viewing content from other parts of the world and vice versa.",
      "The bipartisan law was tucked into a foreign assistance package that swiftly passed Congress and was signed by President Biden last April. TikTok and ByteDance challenged the law the next month, calling it \"an extraordinary and unconstitutional assertion of power\" based on \"speculative and analytically flawed concerns about data security and content manipulation\" that would suppress the speech of millions of Americans.",
      "In a December ruling, a federal appeals court upheld the statute, saying the U.S. government \"acted solely to protect that freedom from a foreign adversary nation and to limit that adversary's ability to gather data on people in the United States.\" The appeals court later denied TikTok's bid to delay the law from taking effect, pending a Supreme Court review.",
      "The Supreme Court moved with extraordinary speed to take up the case after TikTok requested the justices order a temporary pause. The court issued its opinion a week after hearing arguments and two days before the law took effect.",
      "\"There is no doubt that, for more than 170 million Americans, TikTok offers a distinctive and expansive outlet for expression, means of engagement, and source of community. But Congress has determined that divestiture is necessary to address its well-supported national security concerns regarding TikTok's data collection practices and relationship with a foreign adversary,\" the court's opinion said.",
      "The justices cited Congress' finding that companies can be required to turn over data to the Chinese government under Chinese law.",
      "\"The government had good reason to single out TikTok,\" the court said.",
      "Solicitor General Elizabeth Prelogar noted during arguments that there's \"nothing permanent or irrevocable that happens\" on Sunday. The law provides the authority for the restrictions to be lifted on TikTok if there is a sale after the date.",
      "\"Congress expected we might see something like a game of chicken. ByteDance saying, we can't do it, China will never let us do it. But when push comes to shove and these restrictions take effect, I think it will fundamentally change the landscape with respect to what ByteDance is willing to consider,\" Prelogar said.",
      "In a video statement after the Supreme Court issued its decision, TikTok CEO Shou Zi Chew appeared confident that the app would have a future under Trump. He thanked the incoming president for his commitment to finding a solution that would allow TikTok to continue operating in the U.S. \"for years to come.\"",
      "Trump, who tried to ban TikTok during his first term over national security concerns, said Friday that he spoke with Chinese President Xi Jinping about TikTok. A Chinese summary of the call did not mention that it was a topic of discussion.",
      "Barring a sale or Congress overturning the law, there's no long-term certainty about TikTok's future in the U.S. If Trump or a future president declines to enforce the law, companies like Apple and Google could still face steep fines in the future.",

We have laid out our position clearly and straightforwardly: actions to implement this law will fall to the next administration. So TikTok and other companies should take up any concerns with them.\"",
      "Here's what to know about the TikTok ban and how we got here:",
      "Why did Congress want to ban TikTok?",
      "U.S. officials have repeatedly warned that TikTok threatens national security because the Chinese government could use it as a vehicle to spy on Americans or covertly influence the U.S. public by amplifying or suppressing certain content.",
      "The concern is warranted, they said, because Chinese national security laws require organizations to cooperate with intelligence gathering. FBI Director Christopher Wray told House Intelligence Committee members last year that the Chinese government could compromise Americans' devices through the software.",
      "As the House took up the divest-or-ban law in April 2024, Rep. Michael McCaul, a Texas Republican, compared it to a \"spy balloon in Americans' phones.\" Sen. Chris Coons, a Democrat from Delaware, said that lawmakers learned in classified briefings \"how rivers of data are being collected and shared in ways that are not well-aligned with American security interests.\"",
      "\"Why is it a security threat?\" Republican Sen. Josh Hawley of Missouri said Friday. \"If you have TikTok on your phone currently, it can track your whereabouts, it can read your text messages, it can track your keystrokes. It has access to your phone records.\"",
      "If the Chinese government gets its hands on that information, \"it's not just a national security threat, it's a personal security threat,\" Hawley said.",
      "In 2022, TikTok began an initiative known as \"Project Texas\" to safeguard American users' data on servers in the U.S. and ease lawmakers' fears. The Justice Department said the plan was insufficient because it still allowed some U.S. data to flow to China.",
      "Though the divest-or-ban law passed with bipartisan support, some lawmakers have been critical of the measure, agreeing with TikTok that it infringes on Americans' free speech rights.",
      "\"Most of the reasons the government banned it were based on accusations, not proof,\" Republican Sen. Rand Paul of Kentucky said Friday. \"[TikTok has] never been tried and found guilty of sharing information with the communist government.\"",
      "Others have changed their tune as the deadline for a ban neared, including Trump, who tried to ban the app with an executive order during his first term that was struck down in the courts.",
      "\"The irony in all of this is that Donald Trump was the first one to point out there's a problem,\" Sen. Mark Warner of Virginia, the top Democrat on the Senate Intelligence Committee, said Thursday. Warner said the Trump administration \"did a great job of convincing me and overwhelming members of Congress\" about the risks.",
      "TikTok has its day at the Supreme Court",
      "During arguments before the Supreme Court on Jan. 10, TikTok's lawyer did not deny the potential national security risks as the justices appeared critical of the company's legal challenge.",
      "\"I think Congress and the president were concerned that China was accessing information about millions of Americans, tens of millions of Americans, including teenagers, people in their 20s, that they would use that information over time to develop spies, to turn people, to blackmail people, people who a generation from now will be working in the FBI or the CIA or in the State Department,\" Justice Brett Kavanaugh said. \"Is that not a realistic assessment by Congress and the president of the risks here?\"",
      "Noel Francisco, who represented TikTok, responded, \"I'm not disputing the risks. I'm disputing the means that they have chosen.\"",
      "Solicitor General Elizabeth Prelogar asserted that TikTok collects \"unprecedented amounts\" of personal data that would be \"incredibly valuable\" to the Chinese government by giving it \"a powerful tool for harassment, recruitment and espionage.\"",
      "\"For years, the Chinese government has sought to build detailed profiles about Americans, where we live and work, who our friends and coworkers are what our interests are and what our vices are,\" she said, citing major data breaches that the U.S. has attributed to China over the last decade, including the hack of the Office of Personnel Management that compromised the personal information of millions of federal employees.",
      "The Supreme Court's TikTok decision",
      "In defending the law before the Supreme Court, the Justice Department pointed to two main national security justifications: countering China's collection of data from TikTok's 170 million U.S. users and its purported ability to manipulate content on the app to further its geopolitical interests.",

      "According to court documents, Youngblut was driving a vehicle with a German national as the passenger when the U.S. Border Patrol stopped them for an immigration inspection. The citizen of Germany, identified as Felix Baukholt, appeared to have an expired visa in a Department of Homeland Security database.",
      "Shortly after, gunshots were reported at the scene. In a subsequent interview, Border Patrol agents reported that both Youngblut and Baukholt had firearms, court documents said. Youngblut allegedly drew and fired a handgun toward at least one of the agents without warning from the driver's side of the vehicle. Baukholt attempted to draw a firearm.",
      "At least one of the Border Patrol agents fired their service weapon at Youngblut and Baukholt.",

      "According to the complaint, in searches of the vehicle after the shooting, authorities found two guns and additional ammunition, along with \"tactical gear\" \u2014 a ballistic helmet, a night-vision monocular and a tactical belt with a holster. The search also yielded shooting range targets \u2014 some of them used \u2014 and two-way radios.",
      "Authorities had been surveilling Youngblut and Baukholt for nearly a week prior to the shooting, the complaint states, and saw them wearing tactical gear in public on multiple occasions. On Jan. 14, a hotel employee in Vermont called law enforcement to report concerns about a couple \"dressed in all-black tactical style clothing with protective equipment,\" the complaint said. The employee said the woman \u2014 later identified as Youngblut \u2014 was carrying a gun in a holster. Investigators tried to talk to Youngblut and Baukholt after that, but they declined and told authorities they were in the area to look at property to buy.",

    "story": [
      "Washington \u2014 The Senate narrowly confirmed Pete Hegseth as the next secretary of defense, approving President Trump's pick to lead the Pentagon after a contentious battle over his nomination.",
      "Hegseth was confirmed in a vote mostly along party lines, with 51 voting in favor and 50 against. Three Republicans broke with their party to oppose his nomination, forcing Vice President JD Vance to cast a tie-breaking vote. At least four Republicans would have had to vote against Hegseth to sink his nomination.",
      "Hegseth's nomination once appeared on shaky ground amid allegations that included sexual misconduct and financial mismanagement. But the former Fox News host struck a defiant tone as support for his confirmation appeared to be in doubt and Mr. Trump stood behind his pick.",
      "Senate Republicans largely dismissed the allegations, including those made in a sworn affidavit made by Hegseth's former sister-in-law that came to light this week. In the affidavit to members of the Senate Armed Services Committee, she alleged that Hegseth caused his second wife to fear for her personal safety and abused alcohol over the course of many years.",
      "But they lost two Republican votes in the confirmation process: Sen. Lisa Murkowski of Alaska and Sen. Susan Collins of Maine. Murkowski said Thursday she was unable to support Hegseth's nomination, citing the numerous allegations and his previous stance on women in combat.",
      "\"These behaviors starkly contrast the values and discipline expected of servicemembers. Men and women in uniform are held accountable for such actions, and they deserve leaders who uphold these same standards,\" she said, also adding that his \"prior roles in his career do not demonstrate to me that he is prepared for such immense responsibility\" of leading the Defense Department.",
      "Shortly after, Collins made a similar announcement. Collins said she was concerned Hegseth lacked the \"experience and perspective necessary to succeed in the job\" and that she was \"not convinced that his position on women serving in combat roles has changed.\"",
      "Sen. Mitch McConnell, a Kentucky Republican, joined them Friday in their opposition, despite voting to advance his nomination a day earlier. McConnell walked onto the Senate floor late Friday and gave a hands down motion as his name was called.",
      "\"Mr. Hegseth has failed, as yet, to demonstrate that he will pass this test. But as he assumes office, the consequences of failure are as high as they have ever been,\" McConnell said in a lengthy and blistering statement after his vote.",
      "Mr. Trump, who was in California surveying wildfire damage, said he was unaware how McConnell voted, but praised Hegseth, saying he's \"going to be a great secretary of defense.\"",
      "Before Vance cast the tie-breaker, he\u00a0wrote,\u00a0\"I thought I was done voting in the senate.\"",
      "During his contentious confirmation hearing last week, Democrats grilled Hegseth about an October 2017 sexual assault allegation, which he has repeatedly denied.",
      "In one of the most heated moments of the hourslong hearing, Democratic Sen. Tim Kaine of Virginia questioned Hegseth about his history of infidelity in his three marriages.",
      "\"Can you so casually cheat on a second wife?\" Kaine said, asking Hegseth about the timing of the allegation of sexual assault that Hegseth claims was a consensual encounter.",
      "\"You've admitted that you had sex at that hotel,\" Kaine said. \"You said it was consensual, isn't that correct? You've admitted it was consensual, and you were still married, and you had just had a child by another woman. How do you explain your judgment?\"",
      "Hegseth who avoided directly answering the question also declined to answer Kaine's question about whether it would be disqualifying if the encounter had been a sexual assault.",
      "Earlier in the hearing, Hegseth called the allegations against him a smear campaign aimed at destroying him.",
      "\"I'm not a perfect person,\" Hegseth said, but he said he had been saved by \"Jesus and Jenny,\" his wife, whom he married in 2019. Earlier this week, it was disclosed that he had paid his accuser a $50,000 settlement.",
      "He also addressed his views on women in combat, saying his previous views that women should not serve in combat roles were driven by concerns about \"standards.\"",

In a letter dated Jan. 21, Kennedy wrote to the U.S. Office of Government Ethics that, if confirmed as HHS Secretary, he would sever ties with the firm and some other income sources to avoid conflicts of interest. His final payment from the firm was in May 2024, he said.",

    "summary": "Discount store chain Target says it's joining rival Walmart and a number of other prominent American brands in scaling back corporate diversity, equity and inclusion initiatives.",
    "story": [
      "Discount store chain Target said Friday that it would join rival Walmart and a number of other prominent American brands in scaling back diversity, equity and inclusion initiatives that have come under attack from conservative activists and, as of this week, the White House.",
      "The Minneapolis-based retailer said the changes to its \"Belonging at the Bullseye\" strategy would include ending a program it established to help Black employees build meaningful careers, improve the experience of Black shoppers and to promote Black-owned businesses following the police killing of George Floyd in 2020.",
      "Target, which operates nearly 2,000 stores nationwide and employs more than 400,000 people, said it already had planned to end the racial program this year. The company said Friday that it also would conclude the diversity, equity and inclusion, or DEI, goals it previously set in three-year cycles.",
      "The goals included hiring and promoting more women and members of racial minority groups, and recruiting more diverse suppliers, including businesses owned by people of color, women, LGBTQ+ people, veterans and people with disabilities.",
      "Target has long been a fierce corporate advocate for the rights of Black and LGBTQ+ people. In a memo to employees, Kiera Fernandez, Target's chief community impact and equity officer, as a \"next chapter\" in a decades-long process to create \"inclusive work and guest environments that welcome all.\"",
      "\"Many years of data, insights, listening and learning have been shaping this next chapter in our strategy,\" Fernandez wrote in the memo, which Target shared Friday. \"And as a retailer that serves millions of consumers every day, we understand the importance of staying in step with the evolving external landscape, now and in the future.\"",
      "There's no doubt the U.S. civil rights landscape has undergone a massive transformation in the five years since much of corporate America adopted DEI goals in response to the Black Lives Matter protests that followed Floyd's death in Minneapolis.",
      "In 2020, Target pledged to give $10 million to social justice initiatives and to rebuild areas of the Twin Cities damaged by riots. At that time, Target leaders said they wanted to increase their Black workforce by 20% over the next three years.",
      "A 2023 U.S. Supreme Court decision that outlawed affirmative action in college admissions emboldened conservative groups to bring or threaten lawsuits targeting corporate initiatives such as employee resource groups and hiring practices that prioritize historically marginalized groups.",
      "Walmart, McDonald's, Ford, Harley-Davison, John Deere and Lowe's are among the well-known consumer brands that reduced or phased out their DEI commitments in recent months.",
      "President Donald Trump this week signaled his administration's agreement with conservatives who argue that policies designed to increase minority representation by considering factors such as race, gender and sexual orientation are unconstitutional.",
      "On his first day in office, Trump signed an executive order aimed at ending DEI programs within the federal government. The order cut funding for so-called DEI initiatives across all agencies in order to \"end DEI inside the federal government,\" according to Trump administration officials.",
      "A memo from the U.S. Office of Personnel Management Tuesday evening called for all federal DEI employees to be placed on leave by Wednesday evening.",
      "Unlike some of the companies retooling or retiring their diversity initiatives, Target's work to build a more inclusive workforce predated 2020, and the company also was long seen as a trailblazer with respect to LGBTQ+ inclusion.",
      "But the employee memo shared Friday said Target no longer would participate in surveys designed to gauge the effectiveness of its actions, including an annual index compiled by the Human Rights Campaign, a national LGBTQ+ rights organization. Target said it would further evaluate corporate partnerships to ensure they're connected directly to business objectives, but declined to share details.",
      "Getting corporations to withdraw from the Human Rights Campaign's Corporate Equality Index and to stop sponsoring Pride activities have been goals of DEI opponents.",
      "Steering clear of a backlash from conservative customers and organizations is something that Target has tried to navigate for a while. As transgender rights became a more prominent issue in 2016, the company declared that \"inclusivity is a core belief at Target\" and said it supported transgender employees and customers using whichever restroom or fitting room \"corresponds with their gender identity.\"",
      "But after some customers threatened to boycott Target stores, the company said that more stores would make available a single-toilet bathroom with a door that could be locked.",
      "In 2023, Target faced an anti-LGBTQ campaign that went viral on social media. The campaign\u00a0threatened employees and there were some instances of damaged products and displays in stores. In response, Target removed certain items that it said caused the most \"volatile\" reaction from opponents.",
      "The company did not stock its stores with Pride Month products in 2024.",
      "Still, some prominent companies have resisted public pressure to retreat from their diversity plans. On Thursday, Costco shareholders rejected a proposal urging the wholesale club operator to evaluate any risks posed by its diversity, equity and inclusion practices.",
      "According to preliminary results shared by Costco executives, more than 98% of shares voted against the proposal submitted by a conservative think tank based in Washington. Costco's board of directors had recommended a no vote.",

    "published": "Fri, 24 Jan 2025 17:20:09 -0500",
    "summary": "Republican lawmakers are floating a range of ideas to pay for an extension of President Trump's Tax Cuts and Jobs Act.",
    "story": [
      "A key economic priority for President Trump this year is to extend the provisions in his signature Tax Cuts and Jobs Act, a 2017 law that lowered tax rates for most Americans, before they expire at the end of 2025. Now, Republican lawmakers have developed a 50-page laundry list of ideas for how to pay for those planned cuts.",
      "The plan from congressional Republicans,\u00a0published earlier by the New York Times, was confirmed by a person familiar with the document, who noted that it represents a menu of policy options for lawmakers to consider. The document also cites several new tax breaks proposed by Mr. Trump while on the campaign trail last falls, such as eliminating taxes on overtime and tips.",
      "But extending the TCJA's provisions alone could prove costly, with the Congressional Budget Office forecasting a cost of $4.6 trillion over 10 years. Adding new tax breaks, such as Mr. Trump's promise to ditch taxes on overtime pay, could push up the bill even higher at a time when the nation's debt has spiraled to more than $36 trillion.",
      "According to the document, some ideas for funding those tax breaks include eliminating the mortgage home deduction, a popular break for homeowners, and the deductibility of student loan interest. Other methods to drum up more money include an across-the-board 10% import tariff \u2014 essentially, a universal tax on U.S. imports that would be paid by consumers.",
      "The plan also outlines ideas for cutting federal spending, primarily by trimming outlays for social safety net programs such as Medicaid and food stamps. Overall, the document points to a potential tax overhaul that could put more money in the pockets of wealthier \u00a0Americans while cutting assistance for low- and middle-class taxpayers, experts say.",
      "\"If you are extending the tax cuts and enacting tariffs and cutting Medicaid, that will deliver benefits more among higher-income households, and more of a cost will be born by lower-income households,\" Joseph Rosenberg, a senior fellow at the Urban-Brookings Tax Policy Center, a tax-focused think tank, told CBS MoneyWatch.",
      "Adding a blanket 10% tariff could raise $1.9 trillion over the next decade, according to the document shared with Republican lawmakers. But tariffs are largely paid by consumers because companies tend to raise their prices to cover the extra import duties. Mr. Trump's tariffs could add $2,600 a year in costs for the typical U.S. family, according to an August\u00a0analysis\u00a0from the Peterson Institute for International Economics, a nonpartisan think tank focused on economic issues.",
      "Trump administration officials didn't immediately respond to a request for comment.",

The issue has become increasingly unpopular among Republicans and Democrats alike, as rising home values and property taxes across the nation means more homeowners are feeling the pinch from the deduction limit.",
      "\"The SALT cap was effectively one of the biggest pay-fors in the 2017 legislation, and raising it is expensive,\" the Tax Policy Center's Rosenberg said. \"The president recently signaled again that the most likely direction is for the SALT cap to be raised rather than to be eliminated.\"",

      "The Supreme Court said Friday it will hear a case on whether the nation's first publicly funded religious charter school should be allowed to open in Oklahoma.",
      "The justices said they would review an Oklahoma Supreme Court decision invalidating a state board's approval of an application by the Catholic Church in Oklahoma to open a charter school.",
      "The conservative-dominated Supreme Court has issued several decisions in recent years signaling a willingness to allow public funds to flow to religious entities. At the same time, conservative-led states have sought to insert religion into public schools, including Louisiana's requirement that the Ten Commandments be posted in classrooms.",
      "The case probably will be argued in late April and decided by early summer. Justice Amy Coney Barrett is not taking part in the case, but did not explain why.",
      "Last June, Oklahoma's top court held by a 7-1 vote that a taxpayer-funded religious charter school would violate the part of the First Amendment that prohibits government from making any law \"respecting an establishment of religion.\"",
      "The decision followed a 3-2 vote in 2023 by the Statewide Virtual Charter School Board to approve an application by the archdiocese for the St. Isidore of Seville Virtual Charter School. The K-12 online school had planned to start classes for its first 200 students last fall. Part of its mission is to evangelize its students in the Catholic faith.",
      "A group of Oklahoma parents, faith leaders and a public education nonprofit sued to block the school.",
      "\"Under Oklahoma law, a charter school is a public school,\" Justice James Winchester, an appointee of former Republican Gov. Frank Keating, wrote in the court's majority opinion. \"As such, a charter school must be nonsectarian.",
      "\"However, St. Isidore will evangelize the Catholic school curriculum while sponsored by the state.\"",
      "In dissent, Justice Dana Kuehn wrote that excluding St. Isidore from operating a charter school based solely on its religious affiliation would violate a different part of the First Amendment that protects religious freedom.",
      "The case puts Oklahoma's Republican governor, Kevin Stitt, and its Republican attorney general, Gentner Drummond, on opposing sides. Stitt favors the school. Drummond reversed the advice given to the charter school board by his Republican predecessor, warning that the Catholic charter school would in his view violate the Constitution.",

      "In \"Paradise Bronx: The Life and Times of New York's Greatest Borough\" (\u200eFarrar, Straus and Giroux), New Yorker writer Ian Frazier takes readers on a twisty and entertaining tour of the Bronx's rich history, landscape and people.",
      "Read an excerpt below, and\u00a0don't miss Ian Frazier discussing the Bronx with Susie Essman on \"CBS Sunday Morning\" January 26!",
      "\"Paradise Bronx\" by Ian Frazier",

      "The Bronx is a hand reaching down to pull the other boroughs of New York City out of the harbor and the sea. Its fellow boroughs are islands or parts of islands; the Bronx hangs on to Manhattan and Queens and Brooklyn, with Staten Island trailing at the end of the long towrope of the Verrazzano-Narrows Bridge, and keeps the whole business from drifting away on a strong outgoing tide. No water comes between the Bronx (if you leave out its own few islands) and the rest of North America. The Bronx is the continent, and once you're on it you can go for thousands of miles without seeing ocean again. The other boroughs, for their part, cling to the Bronx for dear life. The chafing and strife of this connection have made all the difference to the Bronx.",
      "No other borough has \"the\" in its name. We don't say \"the Staten Island\" or \"the Manhattan\"; for some reason, no island is ever called \"the.\" Only certain more or less continuous geographic features merit a \"the,\" such as \"the Antarctic\" or \"the tropical rainforest.\" Before Europeans had any formal name for what is now the Bronx, they referred to it simply as \"the continent,\" \"the mainland,\" or \"the maine,\" distinguishing it from the ocean they came on and the nearby islands where they'd settled first. Concerning the question of whether to capitalize both words of its modern-day name, the city's daily newspapers are divided. In The New York Times and the Daily News, \"the\" is lowercase: \"the Bronx.\" The Post, however, gives it two caps: \"The Bronx.\" Perhaps the Post has a hidden agenda; the borough is home to the Post's printing plant. In this book I follow the majority and write \"the Bronx.\"",
      "The northernmost part of the Bronx's western border is the Hudson River. Then Manhattan fits up next to the Bronx on its western side for more than half its length, lying approximately north and south. Here, the Harlem River, which is a strait and not a river, and which connects the East River to the Hudson, runs between the two boroughs. Steep hills and bluffs rise above the Harlem River valley. Much of the Bronx is hilly. Stone ridges extend like tendons, knuckles, and fingers from the northern border of the borough southward; these discouraged the construction of east-west roads and make the Bronx difficult to cross from east to west even today. After the Harlem River branches off around one side of Randall's Island, a smaller tidal stream, the Bronx Kill, continues along the borough's southern border. Going along the top of Randall's, the Bronx Kill also flows into the East River, which is part of Long Island Sound, which is part of the Atlantic Ocean. The Bronx's entire eastern border is the East River and the Sound. Thus, the borough has a major river that comes from inland\u2014the Hudson\u2014to its west, and saltwater on its east. Some of the Bronx is rocky and wooded like upstate, and some is oceanfront marsh and beach.",
      "A straight line with a few bureaucratic zigzags marks the Bronx's northern border. That line is also the border of New York City. In general, people in the suburbs to the north of this line are richer than most people in the Bronx. By some measurements, large areas of the Bronx are poorer than anywhere else in the nation. But that assumes a population frozen in time. Everybody has to start somewhere, and the poor parts of the Bronx are often where people start when they have very little. They work, and earn, and in time, with luck, they move upward, and new arrivals take their place. This cycle has tended to wear out some areas of the Bronx.",
      "The Bronx is the part of New York where the city merges into the rest of North America. The process has never gone smoothly.",

    "story": [
      "The Trump administration has directed federal prosecutors to limit enforcement of a federal law safeguarding abortion centers, reproductive health centers and pregnancy resource centers, calling the Biden administration's previous use of longstanding protection \"the prototypical example\" of weaponization of the federal government.",
      "A new Department Justice memo issued Friday and obtained by CBS News focuses on the Justice Department's application of the Freedom of Access to Clinic Entrances or \"FACE\" Act. The law \u2014\u00a0 passed in 1994 \u2014 makes it illegal to harm, threaten or interfere with an individual \"obtaining or providing reproductive health services\" or damage a facility \"because such facility provides reproductive health.\"",
      "The new directive, written by the chief of staff to the attorney general, Chad Mizelle, instructs prosecutors to enforce the law only in \"extraordinary circumstances\" or in instances when death, wherein extreme bodily harm or significant property damage result.",
      "According to the Justice Department memo, future FACE Act violations will mostly be left to state or local law enforcement, with exceptions for federal investigations in cases \"presenting significant aggravating factors.\"",
      "\"Until further notice, no new abortion-related FACE Act actions \u2014 criminal or civil \u2014 will be permitted without authorization from the Assistant Attorney General for the Civil Rights Division,\" Mizelle wrote.",
      "The policy change comes after years of criticism by President Trump and his allies on Capitol Hill, who have argued the FACE Act was disproportionately enforced against anti-abortion activists during the Biden administration.",
      "Following the Supreme Court's decision to overturn Roe v. Wade, the Justice Department under former Attorney General Merrick Garland established a Reproductive Rights Task Force. According to a June 2024 press release, the Justice Department brought at least 25 cases against nearly 60 defendants for violations of the FACE Act during the Biden administration. Individuals were accused of targeting facilities ranging from Planned Parenthood facilities to pregnancy resource centers.",
      "The cases included one in which a defendant admitted to firing BB guns at a California Planned Parenthood facility on 11 different occasions between 2020 and 2021. Another California man pleaded guilty to firebombing a Planned Parenthood building with a Molotov cocktail in 2022.",
      "And in June, three Florida residents pleaded guilty to spraying threatening messages on multiple pregnancy resource centers.",
      "Garland throughout his tenure at the Justice Department defended prosecutors' enforcement of the law, but current Justice Department officials pushed back, alleging in Friday's directive that there was \"not the even-handed administration of Justice.\"",
      "\"More than 100 crisis pregnancy centers, pro-life organizations, and churches were attacked in the immediate aftermath\" of the Supreme Court's decision, Mizelle wrote, arguing some of those cases went uncharged.",
      "The memo was issued on the same day that abortion opponents gathered in Washington, D.C., for the annual March for Life. Vice President J.D. Vance spoke at the rally, and said of Mr. Trump's administration, \"No longer will our government throw pro-life protesters and activists, elderly grandparents or anybody else in prison.\"",
      "On Thursday, Mr. Trump pardoned 10 defendants who were charged with violating the FACE Act after prosecutors said they had formed a blockade at a Washington, D.C., reproductive healthcare center in 2020.",
      "\"They should not have been prosecuted,\" the president said.",
      "The act extends similar protections to places of worship and to individuals \"exercising or seeking to exercise the First Amendment right of religious freedom at a place of religious worship.\"",
      "During her Senate confirmation hearing, Mr. Trump's pick to lead the Justice Department, former Florida Attorney General Pam Bondi, said \"The FACE Act not only protects abortion clinics, but it also protects pregnancy centers, and people going for counseling. The law should be applied evenhandedly.\"",

      "Economic losses from hurricanes and other natural disasters soared in the U.S. last year and were above average globally, reflecting another year of costly severe storms, floods and droughts.",
      "Damage caused by Hurricanes Helene and Milton helped push total economic losses from natural disasters in the U.S. to $217.8 billion last year, according to insurance broker Aon PLC. That figure represents an 85.3% increase from 2023, when losses totaled about $117.5 billion. It's also the largest annual tally of economic losses from natural disasters since 2017.",
      "Insured losses, or the portion of economic losses that are covered by insurance, also rose last year. They climbed 36% to $112.7 billion, the most since 2022. In some areas, homes are such great a risk that they're\u00a0too expensive to insure \u2014 if private insurance is even available at all.",
      "Hurricane Helene tore across six southeastern states last fall, costing $75 billion in economic losses, mainly due to inland and coastal flooding. according to Aon. Less than two weeks later, Hurricane Milton made landfall on the west coast of Florida, causing some $25 billion in economic losses.",
      "\"In 2024, one of the big differences is we had significant U.S. hurricane events that happened,\" said Liz Henderson, global head of climate risk advisory at Aon. \"When those events happen, they affect a large area and they affect areas with large values in terms of properties and people and content. So the losses from those events tend to be significantly higher.\"",
      "At least two other hurricanes, several severe \"convective\" storms and a draught contributed to the losses from natural disasters in the U.S. last year.",
      "In addition to the severe storms in the U.S., deadly floods in the Valencia region of Spain and other natural disasters drove worldwide economic losses from natural disasters to $368 billion last year, according to Aon. That's a 7.3% decline from 2023, but about 14% higher than the annual average going back to 2000. Global insured losses, meanwhile, climbed 15.1% to $145 billion.",
      "While it's impossible to predict the timing, location and losses from natural disasters, 2025 is not off to an encouraging start. The devastating wildfires that erupted in Los Angeles County on Jan. 7, killing at least 28 people and destroying more than 14,000 structures, are already projected to be among the costliest natural disasters.",
      "In a separate report last week, Aon estimated that total economic and insured losses for the two largest wildfires \u2014 the Palisades fire and the Eaton blaze burning just outside Los Angeles \u2014 could reach into the lower tens of billions of dollars, likely making them the costliest wildfires in U.S. history.",
      "Pacific Palisades, the Los Angeles neighborhood that's been\u00a0devastated by the Palisades fire, is emblematic of the insurance nightmare increasingly facing homeowners residing in regions prone to climate disasters.",
      "About 1,600 policies in Pacific Palisades were dropped by State Farm in July, California Department of Insurance spokesman Michael Soller said in a Jan.16\u00a0 email to CBS MoneyWatch. An\u00a0analysis\u00a0of insurance data by CBS News San Francisco last year found that State Farm also dropped more than 2,000 policies in two other Los Angeles ZIP codes, which include the Brentwood, Calabasas, Hidden Hills and Monte Nido neighborhoods.",

    "story": [
      "A new Trump administration plan to send an alert to the federal government's roughly 2.3 million employees from a single email address launched this week and confused at least some of the rank and file, who were concerned it looked suspicious.",
      "The Office of Personnel Management \"is testing a new capability allowing them to send important communications to ALL Federal employees from a single mail address, [hr-at-opm-.gov] If you receive an email from this address, it can be considered trusted,\" according to the message sent Friday.",

      "\"This is a new effort under this administration,\" one of the officials said.",
      "White House officials didn't immediately respond to questions about what the new email alert system might be used for or why the new system was being implemented this week.",
      "The Washington Post also reported on Friday that similar messages went out at other agencies and departments starting on Thursday. Several people who claim to be government employees reported the email as spam or phishing in two Reddit threads for federal employees. One person in these Reddit threads said the Food and Drug Administration had sent out an email Friday asking employees to stop reporting it, since the message is legitimate.",
      "The email seen by CBS News came with a warning from respective departments' information technology offices that the message \"originated from outside the Department\" and its content might not be safe.",
      "\"Everyone thought it was spam,\" said the tipster, who asked that the screengrab not be published. \"There was a flurry of messages, 'Is this spam?'\"",
      "Waking up to a suspicious-looking email on Friday morning did little to calm nerves amid a wave of big personnel changes across the federal government this week. President Trump, as promised during his presidential campaign, issued new executive actions and executive orders this week freezing some hiring; temporarily halting the publication of government public health reports; calling for the end of federal diversity, equity and inclusion programs; and reviving a proposed civil service hiring plan from his first administration that critics warn could politicize the historically nonpartisan federal workforce.",

      "\"They had to send this this week, of all weeks? Really?\" said the person who flagged the email.",
      "OPM officials said leaders of other agencies and departments received advance notice on Thursday of plans to test a new \"Federal Government-Wide Email Communication Test,\" which was also posted on the OPM web site. In some cases, the rank-and-file didn't learn about plans for the email until it arrived, leading to Friday morning's confusion, one of the officials said.",
      "Representatives of the American Federation of Government Employees, one of the largest labor unions representing civilian federal workers, had no immediate comment on the new email system.",

    "summary": "Costco's public support of DEI programs contrasts with positions taken in recent months by other big U.S. brands",
    "story": [
      "Costco shareholders voted down a shareholder proposal urging the wholesale club operator to evaluate any risks posed by its diversity, equity and inclusion, or DEI, practices.",
      "According to preliminary results shared by Costco executives at its annual meeting Thursday, more than 98% of shares voted against the proposal.",
      "In a pre-recorded statement which was played at Costco's 2025 annual shareholders meeting on Jan. 23, the shareholder proposing the anti-DEI resolution, The National Center for Public Policy Research, said that \"Diversity, equity and inclusion may sound benign on the surface, but in reality it is weaponized language concealing a radical Marxist agenda.\"",
      "The shareholder continued to say that DEI \"comes at the expense of merit by not hiring and promoting completely, irrespective of race and sex.\"",
      "Prior to the shareholder meeting, Costco's board of directors had voted unanimously to ask investors to reject the motion. The board had said it believes \"our commitment to an enterprise rooted in respect and inclusion is appropriate and necessary. The report requested by this proposal would not provide meaningful additional information.\"",
      "Costco's defense of its DEI practices comes as other large U.S. corporations are shifting away from programs that encourage equality in the workplace for women, minorities and other groups. In recent weeks, companies including\u00a0Meta,\u00a0Ford,\u00a0McDonald's\u00a0and\u00a0Walmart\u00a0have ended their DEI programs, decisions that follow the 2023 Supreme Court decision\u00a0banning affirmative action\u00a0in college admissions, as well as pressure from conservative political activists.",
      "\"Our commitment to inclusion ... does not and has never included quotas or systematic preferences, nor does it mean compromising merit,\" said Tony E. James, Costco's board chair, said at Thursday's meeting. \"The demands of our business and our steadfast commitment to serve our members mean that we cannot afford to do anything but hire and promote the most qualified individuals,\"",
      "The National Center for Public Policy Research, a conservative think tank based in Washington, had earlier submitted a\u00a0proposal\u00a0asking Costco to examine the risks of its DEI program, arguing that such initiatives hold \"litigation, reputational and financial risks to the company, and therefore financial risks to shareholders.\"",
      "The think tank, which has made a similar proposal to Apple, cited the U.S. Supreme Court decision in July 2023 that outlawed affirmative action in college admissions.",
      "Costco: Diversity fosters \"creativity and innovation\"",
      "The directors' message to shareholders details how having diverse employees and suppliers has, in their view, fostered \"creativity and innovation in the merchandise and services that we offer\" and led to greater customer satisfaction among Costco members.",
      "In advance of the meeting, Neil Saunders, managing director of consulting firm GlobalData's retail division, said Costco could be confident the proposal would be rejected.",
      "\"I think people generally have confidence in Costco's management, and there's an attitude of 'Why rock the boat? It's sailing very nicely,'\" Saunders said.",
      "Costco's public stance in support of diversity, equity and inclusion programs contrasts with the positions taken in recent months by other big consumer brands that have backed away from DEI. Last week, more than 30 Walmart shareholders, including Amalgamated Bank and Oxfam America, asked the CEO of the nation's largest retailer to explain the business impact of curbing the company's DEI policies, a move they called \"disheartening.\"",
      "Emboldened by the Supreme Court's decision on affirmative action at colleges and universities, conservative groups have filed lawsuits making similar arguments about corporations, targeting initiatives such as employee resource groups and hiring practices that prioritize historically marginalized groups.",
      "On Monday, Trump signed an executive order aimed at terminating DEI programs within federal agencies. Conservatives have long condemned them, arguing they violate the U.S. Constitution by considering factors such as race, gender and sexual orientation.",
      "The Trump administration's plan includes leveraging the Justice Department and other agencies to probe private companies pursuing training and hiring practices that conservative critics consider discriminatory against people who do not belong to minority groups, such as white men.",
      "Costco's financial performance",
      "As for Costco, the National Center for Public Policy Research alleged that at least 200,000 of the company's 300,000 employees worldwide \"are potentially victims of this type of illegal discrimination because they are white, Asian, male or straight.\" If only a fraction of those employees were to sue Costco, the legal costs could be significant, the center said.",
      "Costco has a chief diversity officer, but the company's executive ranks do not reflect the diversity of its customers. Nearly 81% of the executives Costco had in place last year were white, and 72% of them were men, according to data published on its website. Saunders said members of Costco's management team typically stay a long time given the company's solid and stable financial performance.",
      "The warehouse giant's sales rose 7.5% in its most recent quarter versus the year-earlier period, while net income jumped 13% from a year earlier. Meanwhile, Costco's stock has soared about 36% during the past 12 months, outpacing the S&P 500's 26% gain over the same period.",
      "In other ways, Costco has been a bit of a maverick in the corporate world. It doesn't have an official corporate public relations team, and it hasn't focused on building up online business as much as rivals Walmart and Target.",
      "Apple's support of DEI",
      "The National Center for Public Policy Research intends to present a proposal at Apple's Feb. 25 shareholder meeting that goes beyond what the think tank wants from Costco. The center's resolution asks the tech company to abolish its inclusion and equity department, policies and goals, describing them as \"consistent with, if not more radical than, most corporate DEI programs.",
      "Apple's board wants shareholders to vote down the proposal, saying the company strives \"to create a culture of belonging where everyone can do their best work.\"",
      "JPMorgan CEO Jamie Dimon this week joined the corporate leaders taking a stand in support of the expanded diversity goals some companies added after the 2020 police killing of George Floyd. Dimon defended his bank's DEI policies during an interview with CNBC.",
      "\"We are going to continue to reach out to the Black community, Hispanic community, the LGBT community, the veterans community,\" he said, speaking Wednesday from the World Economic Forum meeting in Davos, Switzerland. \"And wherever I go, red states, blue states, green states, mayors, governors and they said they like what we do.\"",
      "Trump's actions this week increase the potential legal risks for companies that resist the conservative backlash against DEI, according to David Glasgow, executive director of the Meltzer Center for Diversity, Inclusion and Belonging at NYU School of Law. But most big companies will have consulted their lawyers or performed an internal self-audit after the Supreme Court's affirmative action ruling, Glasgow said.",
      "\"So if you are an Apple or another company who's done that, and you're confident in the legality of your existing DEI program, ... I think what you should do right now is stand firm,\" he said.",

      "Jonathan Adler, a constitutional law scholar at Case Western Reserve University, said more challenges will likely arise after federal agencies take action to follow the instructions Mr. Trump laid out in his measures.",
      "The executive actions said, \"don't have independent legal force, and the consequences come from the fact that people in the executive branch follow those instructions in taking various actions, and those actions can have consequences.\"",
      "But Mr. Trump's orders cracking down on immigration, which he pledged to do on the campaign trail, are likely to have concrete effects quickly, and will be litigated more swiftly.",
      "\"When we're talking about domestic regulatory policy, it takes a while before the executive order produces the sort of tangible agency action that somebody can sue over, whereas in the context of immigration, trade, foreign affairs, the ability of the president to take actions that have more immediate effects is broader,\" Adler said.",
      "Lambda Legal, which advocates for the civil rights of LGBTQ people, is preparing to pursue litigation targeting Mr. Trump's executive actions, including one that declares the U.S. recognizes two sexes, male and female, and those related to diversity, equity and inclusion efforts.",
      "\"It's really attempting to be a scorched-earth approach to censor language and change the culture with the stroke of a Sharpie, and of course that's directly contrary to the First Amendment and to the Equal Protection Clause,\" said Jennifer Pizer, chief legal officer of Lambda Legal, of Mr. Trump's directives. \"It's an area of enormous concern because it's attempting to reimpose an exclusionary worldview and to make it difficult to provide effective services to minority communities. And that's not acceptable and lawful.\"",
      "During Mr. Trump's first administration, many of his key policy proposals were tied up in the courts, in part because agencies failed to follow the federal law governing the process for issuing regulations. In one instance, the Supreme Court ruled 5-4 that the Department of Homeland Security's 2017 decision to rescind the Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals program violated that law, the Administrative Procedure Act.",
      "With the second Trump administration still in its first opening days, it's too early to tell whether that will recur.",
      "But Pizer said that based on Lambda Legal's experience during Mr. Trump's first term \u2014 with victories stemming from both a failure to follow the legal process for issuing regulations and the constitutionality of his orders \u2014 the organization has \"substantial confidence that much of what this administration appears determined to do will not stand. It's blatantly defying settled law in a range of ways.\"",
      "A shift in how the courts evaluate the policy decisions of federal agencies could also affect the success of Mr. Trump's actions.",
      "Last year, the Supreme Court reversed a 40-year-old decision that gave federal agencies broad regulatory power by requiring courts to defer to an agency's interpretation of laws by Congress if it was reasonable. But it has also been reinforcing the message that Congress must give clear authorization for an agency to decide an issue of major political or economic significance, known as the major questions doctrine.",
      "The Supreme Court applied this legal theory when it blocked President Biden's sweeping student loan forgiveness plan in June 2023 after finding that a 2003 federal law did not authorize the education secretary to cancel nearly $500 billion in student loan debt.",
      "\"Agencies don't have a roving license to just make the world a better place because they think there's a problem,\" Adler said. \"I would be surprised if the court backed away from that under the Trump administration.\"",
      "But he said there are two areas \u2014 both of which are central to Mr. Trump's second-term agenda \u2014 where courts and existing laws are more permissive of the executive branch's exercise of authority: trade and immigration. Immigration laws create a structure where the president can do more unilaterally, Adler said, and Congress has over the years given the executive branch more emergency powers.",
      "\"On traditional domestic policy, I think the overall trend of the court's jurisprudence will constrain the ability of the administration to do things that are particularly dramatic, but trade and immigration will be an exception to that,\" Adler said.",

This lesser-known movement, associated with the Catholic Church, encourages its members to live simple lives focused on unity. Members take vows of chastity, poverty, and obedience, choosing to live as a family rather than marrying. Their way of life centers on giving rather than owning.",
      "In the latest installment of the \"CBS Mornings\" series \"The State of Spirituality with Lisa Ling,\"\u00a0 the lives of single men and women who are part of the Focolare Movement were explored. They focus on giving rather than owning.",

      "The women own nothing and only take what is necessary to live. They often receive donated clothes, and the movement owns their home. They say they have chosen to live in a way that reflects how Jesus and his mother Mary lived.",
      "\"We say instead of a culture of having, we live a culture of giving,\" Rauschuber said.",
      "Focolare History",
      "The Focolare Movement, founded by Italian schoolteacher Chiara Lubich in the 1940s, was approved by the Catholic Church in the 1960s. It has since expanded to over 100,000 followers in more than 180 countries. While many followers are Catholic, people of other faiths, including Muslims, Hindus, and Buddhists, also embrace the movement.",
      "Focolare members stress that the movement is not a cult, and that followers can leave at any time. \"In marriage, or any other vocation, there's sacrifice, you're building a family together,\" Rauschuber said. \"So, there's commitments in any choice you make, you know? And it is radical. We agree. It's a very radical choice.\"",
      "The women who live together see themselves as a family. \"For us being a family means to have this love, you know, for one another, to the point of being ready to die for one another, like Jesus did,\" Joung explained.",
      "Working in the world",
      "Unlike priests or nuns, Focolare members work regular jobs while living their lifestyle. The money they earn goes back into the movement and supports those in need. \"It's a choice we make,\" Rauschuber said. \"That money can maybe be used to keep the Focolare house in Syria open because there's a war. Nobody can work. And so, there's a reason why we set for ourselves also like a budget\u2026 because of a bigger goal we have.\"",

      "\"We take turns cooking, we take turns cleaning the house,\" Morse said.",
      "Morse, who was raised Catholic in New York City, says he never aspired to the priesthood but felt a calling to join Focolare as a young man. \"I guess it was the community that really attracted me, not only their presence, but how they lived,\" he said. \"It's a choice, you know, I know that I won't own my own house, my own car, but that gives me more freedom\u2026 to again dedicate myself to God's work and to humanity.\"",
      "Morse's parents were also part of Focolare, and he knew in his 20s that he wanted to follow this path. Although he had relationships in high school and college, his calling to dedicate his life to God was stronger.",
      "\"It has been hard,\" he admitted. \"But it's that strength that God gives us and the strength of the community that really helps us stay firm in our choice.\"",
      "Morse believes he will remain part of Focolare for the rest of his life. \"This is my family. This is what I'm called to,\" he said. \"I'm in it for the long haul.\"",

    "story": [
      "Multiple federal health agencies have stopped releasing some key health information \u2014 including updates on some outbreak investigations \u2014 amid a department-wide communications \"pause\" ordered by the Trump administration, though many other \"mission critical\" updates are still being released, CBS News has learned.",
      "The Department of Health and Human Services \"has issued a pause on mass communications and public appearances that are not directly related to emergencies or critical to preserving health,\" Stefanie Spear, the HHS principal deputy chief of staff, told CBS News in an email. \"This is a short pause to allow the new team to set up a process for review and prioritization.\"",
      "The Food and Drug Administration, a federal agency of the HHS, usually releases updates on probes of outbreaks linked to contaminated food every Wednesday, but the agency did not release them this week. As of the FDA's last update on Jan. 15, authorities were investigating multiple outbreaks of E. coli and Listeria.",
      "Publication of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention's authoritative scientific publication, the Morbidity and Mortality Weekly Report, has also been delayed, health officials said.

    "story": [
      "As\u00a0millions of Americans\u00a0cope with\u00a0severe winter weather\u00a0spread across the country, experts say to watch out for health and safety dangers that go along with frigid temperatures and snow.",
      "\"One of the things we've been seeing in the last couple days is just a lot of falls,\" Dr. Steve Dorsey, assistant medical director at the Cleveland Clinic emergency department, told CBS News, saying to watch out for icy sidewalks and be careful shoveling snow. \"There's clearly an association between the exertion of clearing snow and provoking chest pain or angina.\"",
      "The cold can also weaken our immune system, increasing the risk of contracting colds, COVID, flu and other illnesses around this time of year.",
      "Even people with normal, healthy lungs can experience cold-like symptoms like coughing or shortness of breath in cold weather, Dr. Chidinma Nwakanma of Penn Medicine recently\u00a0told CBS News Philadelphia.",
      "\"The cold air, particularly cold, dry air, can cause your airways to constrict and can be irritable to your airways,\" she said. \"Which is why we recommend that if you are outside for these prolonged periods of time, you're covering your nose, you're covering your mouth, you're warming up the air that your lungs are taking in.\"",
      "Who is at risk for winter health issues?",
      "\"There's a risk for anybody at these extreme temperatures because your body is doing everything it can to maintain its core temperature,\" Nwakanma said.",
      "The young and elderly, however, are even more vulnerable. Children lose heat more quickly than adults due to their size and weight while the elderly have a harder time regulating their body temperature, Dorsey said. This can be due to thinner skin, loss of muscle mass and even medications for blood pressure, which can affect blood flow and temperature.",
      "Frostbite and hypothermia prevention",
      "Hypothermia is when your body's temperature goes below 95 degrees Fahrenheit.",
      "\"At those temperatures, it makes it very hard for the body to do its normal functioning, such as brain function, heart function, lung function,\" Nwakanma said.",
      "Frostbite, when skin or tissue freezes, is another cold weather danger \u2014 and in freezing temperatures, it can happen in minutes, Dorsey said.",
      "Symptoms appear in three stages, according to the Cleveland Clinic:",
      "1. Frostnip: cold, sore and painful feeling",
      "2. Surface frostbite: pins and needles feeling",
      "3. Deep frostbite: numbness",
      "If you experience any of these, Dorsey said to get out of the cold and warm up.",
      "\"The best way to do that, particularly for the fingers or toes would be to run them under warm, not hot, but warm water,\" he said. \"Then it's a matter of taking a look at the skin and seeing is there are their coloration changes? Is there's dustiness at the tips or are there blisters, those are signs of deeper skin injury that need to be seen by a physician promptly.\"",
      "The best way to reduce risk of these issues? Dress appropriately.",

I called my friends and we agreed to come here after the morning prayer and collaborate. After we dug a lot and carried many stones, we found his sweater. We found his green sweater, and I called the family to tell them we found him.\"",

      "Secretary of State Marco Rubio has sent an order to all U.S. diplomatic and consular posts instructing a pause on \"all new obligations of funding, pending a review, for foreign assistance programs funded by or through the Department and USAID.\" The message was in line with the executive order\u00a0President Trump signed on Monday to reevaluate U.S. foreign aid.",
      "The order, which was obtained by CBS News, said that across the U.S. government, \"it is currently impossible to access sufficient information in one place to determine whether the foreign assistance policies and interests supported by appropriations are not duplicated, are effective, and are consistent with President Trump's foreign policy.\"",
      "Rubio's order went on to say that the State Department \"needs a centralized repository from which senior Department, USAID officials, Ambassadors, missions and others can draw sufficiently detailed information from which the Secretary can make judgments.\" It added, \"Further guidance regarding a new or updated repository and mandatory bureau submissions to it will be forthcoming.\"",
      "Under Rubio's order, there is an 85-day deadline for a \"government-wide comprehensive review of all foreign assistance\" to be completed, and, it stated, \"a report shall be produced to the Secretary of State for his consideration and recommendation to the President.\"",
      "The order also appears to impact current existing aid programs, stating, \"For existing foreign assistance awards, contracting officers and grant officers shall immediately issue stop-work orders, consistent with the terms of the relevant award, until such time as the Secretary shall determine, following a review.\"",
      "However, Rubio indicated that U.S. foreign military financing for Israel and Egypt are exempt from the order, as well as emergency food assistance and \"salaries and related administrative expenses, including travel, for U.S. direct hire employees, personal services contractors, and locally employed staff.\" This includes exceptions to the pause approved by the State Department Director of Foreign Assistance Office.",

      "President Trump signed an order Friday reinstating a policy that requires foreign nongovernmental agencies to certify that they don't provide or promote abortion if they receive U.S. federal funds for family planning assistance.",
      "The position, sometimes called the Mexico City Policy and referred to by opponents as the \"global gag rule,\" was first introduced more than 40 years ago. Every Republican president has put it in effect, and\u00a0every Democrat has\u00a0rescinded it.",
      "Eight years ago, the first Trump administration not only brought back the prohibition but also broadened it to include organizations that comply with the rules but give money to others that don't.",
      "Advocates say the policy, coupled with a law that bars U.S. money from paying for abortion around the globe, has a major impact on abortion availability worldwide \u2014 and also blocks aid money from flowing to health organizations for other purposes. They say it hurts reproductive and maternal health care in developing nations by cutting funds to groups that offer critical non-abortion related services, including birth control, nutritional support for infants and HIV/AIDS treatment.",
      "Trump also signed an executive order Friday requiring the enforcement of the Hyde Amendment, which restricts government funding for most abortions.",
      "The amendment was already the law of the land under the Biden administration, but the Trump administration argued \"the previous administration disregarded this established, commonsense policy.\"",
      "March for Life message",
      "The executive actions came on the same day as the annual March for Life in Washington. In the video address to the crowd, Mr. Trump vowed \"we will again stand proudly for families and for life\" in his second term and once again boasted about nominating three Supreme Court justices who helped strike down Roe v.

    "published": "Fri, 24 Jan 2025 13:18:48 -0500",
    "summary": "By withdrawing from the World Health Organization and overhauling aid, Trump's new executive orders endanger Americans and the globe, researchers warn. The move also cedes U.S. power to other nations.",
    "story": [
      "For decades, the United States has held considerable power in determining the direction of global health policies and programs. President Donald Trump issued three executive orders on his first day in office that may signal the end of that era, health policy experts said.",
      "Trump's order\u00a0to withdraw\u00a0from the World Health Organization means the U.S. will probably not be at the table in February when the WHO executive board next convenes. The WHO is shaped by its members: 194 countries that set health priorities and make agreements about how to share critical data, treatments, and vaccines during international emergencies. With the U.S. missing, it would cede power to others.",
      "\"It's just stupid,\" said Kenneth Bernard, a visiting fellow at the Hoover Institution at Stanford University who served as a top biodefense official during the George W. Bush administration. \"Withdrawing from the WHO leaves a gap in global health leadership that will be filled by China,\" he said, \"which is clearly not in America's best interests.\"",
      "Executive orders to withdraw from the WHO and to reassess America's approach to international assistance cite the WHO's \"mishandling of the COVID-19 pandemic\" and say that U.S. aid serves \"to destabilize world peace.\" In action, they echo priorities established in Project 2025's \"Mandate for Leadership,\" a conservative policy blueprint from the Heritage Foundation.",
      "The 922-page report says the U.S. \"must be prepared\" to withdraw from the WHO, citing its \"manifest failure,\" and advises an overhaul to international aid at the State Department. \"The Biden Administration has deformed the agency by treating it as a global platform to pursue overseas a divisive political and cultural agenda that promotes abortion, climate extremism, gender radicalism, and interventions against perceived systemic racism,\" it says.",
      "As one of the world's largest funders of global health \u2014 through both international and national agencies, such as the WHO and the U.S. Agency for International Development \u2014 America's step back may curtail efforts to provide lifesaving health care and combat deadly outbreaks, especially in lower-income countries without the means to do so alone.",
      "\"This not only makes Americans less safe, it makes the citizens of other nations less safe,\" said Tom Bollyky, director of global health at the Council on Foreign Relations.",
      "\"The U.S. cannot wall itself off from transnational health threats,\" he added, referring to policies that block travelers from countries with disease outbreaks. \"Most of the evidence around travel bans indicates that they provide a false sense of security and distract nations from taking the actions they need to take domestically to ensure their safety.\"",
      "Less than 1%",
      "Technically, countries cannot withdraw from the WHO until a year after official notice. But Trump's executive order cites his termination notice from 2020. If Congress or the public pushes back, the administration can argue that more than a year has elapsed.",
      "Trump suspended funds to the WHO in 2020, a measure that doesn't require congressional approval. U.S. contributions to the agency hit a low of $163 million during that first year of COVID, falling behind Germany and the Gates Foundation. Former President Joe Biden restored U.S. membership and payments. In 2023, the country gave the WHO $481 million.",
      "As for 2024, Suerie Moon, a co-director of the global health center at the Geneva Graduate Institute, said the Biden administration paid biennium dues for 2024-25 early, which will cover some of this year's payments.",
      "\"Unfairly onerous payments\" are cited in the executive order as a reason for WHO withdrawal. Countries' dues are a percentage of their gross domestic product, meaning that as the world's richest nation, the United States has generally paid more than other countries.",
      "Funds for the WHO represent about 4% of America's budget for global health, which in turn is less than 0.1% of U.S. federal expenditures each year. At about $3.4 billion, the WHO's entire budget is roughly a third of the budget for the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, which got $9.3 billion in core funding in 2023.",
      "The WHO's funds support programs to prevent and treat polio, tuberculosis, HIV, malaria, measles, and other diseases, especially in countries that struggle to provide health care domestically. The organization also responds to health emergencies in conflict zones, including places where the U.S. government doesn't operate \u2014 in parts of Gaza, Sudan, and the Democratic Republic of the Congo, among others.",
      "In January 2020, the WHO alerted the world to the danger of the COVID outbreak by sounding its highest alarm: a public health emergency of international concern. Over the next two years, it vetted diagnostic tests and potential drugs for COVID, regularly updated the public, and advised countries on steps to keep citizens safe.",
      "Experts have cited missteps at the agency, but numerous analyses show that internal problems account for the United States' having one of the world's highest rates of death due to COVID. \"All nations received the WHO's alert of a public health emergency of international concern on Jan. 30,\" Bollyky said. \"South Korea, Taiwan, and others responded aggressively to that \u2014 the U.S. did not.\"",
      "\"It's a red herring\"",
      "Nonetheless, Trump's executive order accuses the WHO of \"mishandling\" the pandemic and failing \"to adopt urgently needed reforms.\" In fact, the WHO has made some changes through bureaucratic processes that involve input from the countries belonging to it. Last year, for example, the organization passed several amendments to its regulations on health emergencies. These include provisions on transparent reporting and coordinated financing.",
      "\"If the Trump administration tried to push for particular reforms for a year and then they were frustrated, I might find the reform line credible,\" Moon said. \"But to me, it's a red herring.\"",
      "\"I don't buy the explanations,\" Bernard said. \"This is not an issue of money,\" he added. \"There is no rationale to withdraw from the WHO that makes sense, including our problems with China.\"",
      "Trump has accused the WHO of being complicit in China's failure to openly investigate COVID's origin, which he alludes to in the executive order as \"inappropriate political influence.\"",
      "\"The World Health Organization disgracefully covered the tracks of the Chinese Communist Party every single step of the way,\" Trump said in a video posted to social media in 2023.",
      "On multiple occasions, the WHO has called for transparency from China. The agency doesn't have the legal authority to force China, or any other country, to do what it says. This fact also repudiates Trump's warnings that a pandemic treaty under negotiation at the WHO impinges on American sovereignty. Rather, the accord aims to lay out how countries can better cooperate in the next pandemic.",
      "Trump's executive order calls for the U.S. to \"cease negotiations\" on the pandemic agreement. This means the pharmaceutical industry may lose one of its staunchest defenders as discussions move forward.",
      "In the negotiations so far, the U.S. and the European Union have sided with lobbying from the pharmaceutical industry to uphold strict patent rights on drugs and vaccines. They have opposed efforts from middle-income countries in Asia, Africa, and Latin America to include licensing agreements that would allow more companies to produce drugs and vaccines when supplies are short in a crisis. A study published in Nature Medicine estimated that more than a million lives would have been saved had COVID vaccines been available around the world in 2021.",
      "\"Once the U.S. is absent \u2014 for better and for worse \u2014 there will be less pressure on certain positions,\" Moon said. \"In the pandemic agreement negotiations, we may see weakening opposition towards more public-health-oriented approaches to intellectual property.\"",
      "\"This is a moment of geopolitical shift because the U.S. is making itself less relevant,\" said Ayoade Alakija, chair of the Africa Union's Vaccine Delivery Alliance. Alakija said countries in Asia and Africa with emerging economies might now put more money into the WHO, change policies, and set agendas that were previously opposed by the U.S. and European countries that are grappling with the war in Ukraine. \"Power is shifting hands,\" Alakija said. \"Maybe that will give us a more equitable and fairer world in the long term.\"",
      "Echoes of Project 2025",
      "In the near term, however, the WHO is unlikely to recoup its losses entirely, Moon said. Funds from the U.S. typically account for about 15% of its budget. Together with Trump's executive order that pauses international aid for 90 days, a lack of money may keep many people from getting lifesaving treatments for HIV, malaria, and other diseases.",
      "Another loss is the scientific collaboration that occurs via the WHO and at about 70 centers it hosts at U.S. institutions such as Columbia University and Johns Hopkins University. Through these networks, scientists share findings despite political feuds between countries.",
      "A third executive order commands the secretary of state to ensure the department's programs are \"in line with an America First foreign policy.\" It follows on the order to pause international aid while reviewing it for \"consistency with United States foreign policy.\" That order says that U.S. aid has served \"to destabilize world peace by promoting ideas in foreign countries that are directly inverse to harmonious and stable relations.\"",
      "These and executive orders on climate policies track with policy agendas expressed by Project 2025. Although Trump and his new administration have distanced themselves from the Heritage Foundation playbook, CBS News reviewed\u00a0the work histories of the 38 named primary authors and found that at least 28 of them worked in the first Trump administration.",
      "One of its chief architects was Russell Vought, who served as director of the Office of Management and Budget during Trump's first term and has been nominated for it again. Multiple contributors to Project 2025 are from the America First Legal Foundation, a group headed by Trump adviser Stephen Miller that's filed complaints against \"woke corporations.\"",
      "Project 2025 recommends cutting international aid for programs and organizations focused on climate change and reproductive health care, and steering resources toward \"strengthening the fundamentals of free markets,\" lowering taxes, and deregulating businesses as a path to economic stability.",
      "Several experts said the executive orders appear to be about ideological rather than strategic positioning.",
      "The White House did not respond to questions about its executive orders on global health. Regarding the executive order saying U.S. aid serves \"to destabilize world peace,\" a spokesperson at USAID wrote in an email: \"We refer you to the White House.\"",

      "It was a large display of public anger for a city firmly in the grip of the Sinaloa cartel. Culiacan has suffered months of intense violence as two cartel factions have battled for control since the arrests last year in the U.S. of Ismael \"El Mayo\" Zambada.",

      "The Republic of Ireland was under a \"Red Warning\" from its meteorological body\u2014 meaning the public was warned that the storm was \"extremely destructive and dangerous.\"",
      "ESB Networks, the government-run body responsible for most of the Ireland's electrical grid, said Friday morning that over 715,000 homes, farms and businesses had been left without power as a result of the storm. More power outages were expected throughout Friday, ESB said. Northern Ireland Electricity Networks said approximately 240,000 customers were without power in the region by Friday afternoon \u2014 meaning close to one million people were without power across the island.",
      "Scottish Power, an electricity provider in Scotland, said around 15,000 of its customers were without power, according to CBS News partner network BBC News.",
      "More than 230 flights scheduled to depart or arrive at Dublin Airport were cancelled Friday morning as a result of the severe weather, and all public transport was suspended across Ireland as government officials warned the public to remain indoors.",
      "The U.K.'s Met Office said Friday that similar red warning notices were in place in parts of Northern Ireland and Scotland.",
      "Gusts over 90 mph were recorded in Northern Ireland and parts of northern Wales Friday morning as Storm \u00c9owyn shifted toward the United Kingdom. Many trains and other public transport options were locked down in the northern U.K. and there were initial reports of some wind damage to trees and buildings.",
      "\"Storm \u00c9owyn is now bringing very strong winds to parts of the U.K. There is potential for gusts of 100 mph in exposed locations within the Red Warning area,\" Chief U.K. Meteorologist Jason Kelly said in a statement Friday. \"Anyone in these Red and Amber warning areas should listen to advice from local responders and keep up to date with weather warnings for their area.\"",

      "The most severe red warnings in the U.K., indicating a possible threat to life, covered Northern Ireland and the far north of England and south and central Scotland, but the amber warning area, which indicates likely disruption to travel and a possible risk of flying debris, covered a much wider area, extending south to Manchester and Liverpool.",
      "Storm \u00c9owyn (pronounced AY-oh-win) became what is known as a bomb cyclone between Thursday and Friday, according to CBS News' partners at the Weather Channel. The storm has its origins in the recent U.S. Gulf Coast winter storm.",
      "\"Jet stream energy that helped produce historic snowfall on the U.S. Gulf Coast Tuesday triggered the development of low pressure off the southeastern U.S. coast. From there, that low has rapidly intensified over the North Atlantic and spread into Ireland and the U.K. as an intense 'bomb cyclone,'\" the Weather Channel said.",
      "A bomb cyclone, also known as bombogenesis, is described by the U.S. National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration as a fast-developing storm that occurs when atmospheric pressure drops at least 24 millibars over a 24-hour period. The pressure associated with Storm \u00c9owyn dropped by about 50 millibars as it neared the western Irish coast, according to the British weather service.",

    "published": "Fri, 24 Jan 2025 08:14:08 -0500",
    "summary": "The chief prosecutor of the U.N.'s International Criminal Court is seeking an arrest warrant for the Taliban chief for suspected crimes against humanity.",
    "story": [
      "The chief prosecutor of the United Nations' International Criminal Court announced Thursday that he was seeking arrest warrants for the two most senior leaders of Afghanistan's ruling Taliban regime for crimes against humanity over the group's treatment of women and girls.",
      "Prosecutor Karim Khan said that after a thorough investigation and review of evidence, his office found \"reasonable grounds to believe\" that Taliban Supreme Leader Haibatullah Akhundzada and the group's Chief Justice Abdul Hakim Haqqani bear \"criminal responsibility for the crime against humanity of persecution on gender grounds,\" under the treaty that founded the ICC, known as the Rome Statute.",
      "Khan said his office had concluded that both men are \"criminally responsible for persecuting Afghan girls and women, as well as persons whom the Taliban perceived as not conforming with their ideological expectations of gender identity or expression, and persons whom the Taliban perceived as allies of girls and women.\"",
      "The statement said the alleged crimes were committed between \"at least\" from the Taliban's retaking of control over Afghanistan in August 2021 \"until the present day,\" all across the country.",
      "\"This ongoing persecution entails numerous severe deprivations of victims' fundamental rights, contrary to international law, including the right to physical integrity and autonomy, to free movement and free expression, to education, to private and family life, and to free assembly,\" said Khan.",
      "In a statement posted on social media Friday, the Taliban's Foreign Ministry dismissed the request for ICC warrants as a move \"devoid of just legal basis, duplicitous in nature and politically motivated.,\" adding that it was \"unfortunate that such baseless allegations are being levelled against the honorable leaders of the Islamic Emirate.\"",
      "The ministry said the ICC, \"should end attempts of imposing a specific interpretation of human rights on the entire world while disregarding the religious & national values of peoples of the world.\"",
      "Since regaining control of Afghanistan, the Taliban has imposed a long list of harsh laws targeting women and girls. The measures have seen women pushed out of public life and drawn condemnation from much of the international community, including allegations of gender-based apartheid.",
      "Under the pretext of Islamic Sharia law, the measures have deprived girls and women of formal education from the age of 12, the right to visit public parks or travel alone, or even to meet with a doctor unless accompanied by a male chaperone.",
      "Last month, the Taliban imposed a ban on women training to become midwives and nurses \u2014 another devastating blow in a country that already has one of the highest maternal mortality rates in the world. According to data from the World Bank, 620 women die for every 100,000 live births in Afghanistan due to pregnancy-related complications.",
      "Akhundzada recently ordered that windows in homes overlooking spaces used by women, such as kitchens, courtyards or water wells, be covered.",
      "Elizabeth Evenson, International Justice Program Director at the New York-based",
      "organization Human Rights Watch, said in a statement Thursday that she hoped the request for ICC warrants against the senior Taliban figures would put the group's \"systematic exclusion of women and girls from public life and targeting of LGBT people back on the international community's radar.\"",
      "Evenson said the Taliban's gender-based repression had \"accelerated with complete impunity\" since the summer of 2021, and that \"with no justice in sight in Afghanistan, the warrant requests offer an essential pathway to a measure of accountability.\"",
      "She also called on the ICC prosecutor to revisit his decision \"to deprioritize investigation of abuses by the forces of the former Afghan government and U.S. personnel\" who were based in the country for two decades. The probe into the actions of U.S. troops was launched by Khan's predecessor.",
      "Khan said the request for international arrest warrants highlights the ICC's commitment to holding those responsible for gender-based crimes accountable, with more arrests and warrant fillings for other senior Taliban members expected to follow as the court's investigation into the situation in Afghanistan continues.",
      "\"The judges of the International Criminal Court will now determine whether these applications for arrest warrants establish reasonable grounds to believe that the named individuals committed the alleged crimes. If the judges issue the warrants, my Office will work closely with the Registrar in all efforts to arrest the individuals,\" Khan said, adding that, \"as in all situations, I request States Parties to fully cooperate with the Court and help it in enforcing any judicial order.\"",
      "While the ICC has the power to issue arrest warrants \u2014 and has done so recently for both Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, the country's former defense chief and a senior Hamas leader \u2014 it does not have any means of independently enforcing such warrants.",
      "It is down to individual countries that are signatories to the court's founding treaty to decide whether to take wanted individuals into custody on ICC warrants, as and when they enter those country's territories.",
      "The United States is not a signatory to the Rome Statute, and is thus not obligated to detain anyone on an ICC warrant.",
      "Even if the ICC does issue warrants for Akhundzada or other Taliban leaders, it is highly unlikely that they would try to visit any country where they could risk arrest. Virtually the entire world has declined to acknowledge the Taliban as Afghanistan's legitimate government in the wake of their reassertion of control over the country.",
      "Khan himself has faced accusations that he tried for more than a year to coerce a female aide into a sexual relationship and groped her against her will. He has categorically denied the allegations, saying there was \"no truth to suggestions of misconduct.\" ICC officials have said the claims may have been made as part of an Israeli intelligence smear campaign.",

    "story": [
      "Astronomers discovered supersonic winds on a giant gas planet located over 500 light-years from Earth.",
      "In a study released Tuesday in Astronomy & Astrophysics astronomers who have been studying weather on the planet since 2016 said findings show this \"is the fastest wind ever measured in a jetstream that goes around a planet.\"",
      "\"This is something we haven't seen before,\" said Lisa Nortmann, a scientist at the University of G\u00f6ttingen, Germany, and lead author of the study.",
      "The team said they mapped the weather on the planet WASP-127b using the\u00a0CRIRES+ instrument\u00a0\u2014 which consists of both a spectrograph and an adaptive optics system \u2014 on the European Southern Observatory's Very Large Telescope.",
      "Findings showed WASP-127b, which is slightly larger than Jupiter but has only a fraction of its mass, had jet winds move at nearly six times the speed at which the planet rotates. In comparison, the fastest wind ever measured in the solar system was found on Neptune, moving at only 0.5 km per second, scientists said.",
      "The team mapped a surprisingly complex weather system on the planet by tracking the speed of molecules \u2014 they observed a double peak, indicating that one side of the atmosphere is moving towards us and the other away from us at high speed. This indicates that there is a powerful wind current going around the planet.",
      "Researchers concluded that powerful jetstream winds around the equator would explain this unexpected result, and shows the planet has complex weather systems like Earth and other planets in our solar system.",
      "\"Understanding the dynamics of these exoplanets helps us explore mechanisms such as heat redistribution and chemical processes, improving our understanding of planet formation and potentially shedding light on the origins of our own Solar System,\" says David Cont from the Ludwig Maximilian University of Munich, Germany, and a co-author of the paper.",
      "Of the exoplanets discovered so far, only a few dozen have been directly imaged, according to\u00a0NASA. Scientists hope that further research will reveal if the young planets formed at their current location or migrated from somewhere else \u2014 and how they might interact with each other.",

    "summary": "Secretary of State Marco Rubio will likely travel to Central America in the first week of February, a source familiar with the planning said.",
    "story": [
      "Secretary of State Marco Rubio is preparing to travel to Panama, Costa Rica, Guatemala and other Central American countries, State Department spokesperson Tammy Bruce confirmed to CBS News.",
      "The trip, expected to be his first overseas as the top U.S. envoy, will include a stop in Panama to meet with leaders there as President Trump is calling for the U.S. to retake operational control of the Panama Canal. His stops in other Central American counties are likely to focus on establishing formal agreements with those countries to take back nationals deported from the U.S. as part of new Trump administration immigration policy that is expected to result in a significant uptick in deportations. Several Latin American governments, including Guatemala, have signaled they are open to establish new agreements.",
      "Rubio's confirmation this week as the first Latino Secretary of State has been closely tracked across the hemisphere by governments intrigued by his ascension and eager to earn more attention from American officials, especially its top diplomat with a personal connection to the region and a long work history of public criticism towards communist and socialist governments.",
      "One person familiar with the planning, granted anonymity to speak candidly about ongoing planning, said Rubio \"is probably coming not next week but the first week of February.\"",
      "The government of Panama has not announced any expected visit but its president has issued sharply-worded statements ahead of and on Inauguration Day refuting President Trump's claim that China is now controlling the Panama Canal. He vowed the key transit point would stay under Panamanian control and the U.S. would not retake it.",
      "The trip to Panama comes as Mr. Trump said in his inaugural address that former President Jimmy Carter, who died on Dec. 29 at the age of 100, \"foolishly\" returned control of the Canal to Panama.",
      "\"We have been treated very badly from this foolish gift that should have never been made,\" Mr. Trump said. \"And Panama's promise to us has been broken. The purpose of our deal and the spirit of our treaty has been totally violated. American ships are being severely overcharged and not treated fairly in any way, shape or form, and that includes the United States Navy. And above all, China is operating the Panama Canal. And we didn't give it to China, we gave it to Panama, and we're taking it back.\"",
      "In addition to the Panama comments, migration from Central America is a high priority for the Trump administration and Mr. Trump has already signed executive actions laying down the groundwork for his large-scale deportation plan and designating cartels and gangs as terrorist groups.",
      "National security adviser Mike Waltz\u00a0said on \"Face the Nation with Margaret Brennan\" on Sunday that the Trump administration will be \"going after criminal gangs that are terrorizing our cities,\" specifically citing MS-13 and Tren De Aragua.

    "summary": "Axel Rudakubana, who killed three girls at a dance class, will likely \"never be released\" from prison, a judge said Thursday.",
    "story": [
      "A teenager who stabbed three young girls to death at a Taylor Swift-themed dance class in England was sentenced Thursday to more than 50 years in prison for what a judge called \"the most extreme, shocking and exceptionally serious crime.\"",
      "Judge Julian Goose said 18-year-old Axel Rudakubana \"wanted to try and carry out mass murder of innocent, happy young girls.\"",
      "Goose said that he couldn't impose a sentence of life without parole, because Rudakubana was under 18 when he committed the crime.",
      "But the judge said he must serve 52 years, minus the six months he's been in custody, before being considered for parole, and \"it is likely he will never be released.\"",
      "Rudakubana was 17 when he attacked the children in the seaside town of Southport in July, killing Alice Da Silva Aguiar, 9, Elsie Dot Stancombe, 7, and Bebe King, 6. He wounded eight other girls, ranging in age from 7 to 13, along with teacher Leanne Lucas and John Hayes, a local businessman who intervened.",
      "The attack shocked the country and set off both street violence and soul-searching. The government has announced a public inquiry into how the system failed to stop the killer, who had been referred to the authorities multiple times over his obsession with violence.",
      "Rudakubana faced three counts of murder, 10 of attempted murder and additional charges of possessing a knife, the poison ricin and an al-Qaida manual. He unexpectedly changed his plea to guilty on all charges on Monday.",
      "But he wasn't in court to hear sentence passed on Thursday.",
      "Hours earlier he had been led into the dock at Liverpool Crown Court in northwest England, dressed in a gray prison tracksuit. But as prosecutors began outlining the evidence, Rudakubana interrupted by shouting that he felt ill and wanted to see a paramedic.",
      "Goose ordered the accused to be removed when he continued shouting. A person in the courtroom shouted \"Coward!\" as Rudakubana was taken out.",
      "The hearing continued without him.",
      "Prosecutor Deanna Heer described how the attack occurred on the first day of summer vacation when 26 little girls were \"gathered around the tables making bracelets and singing along to Taylor Swift songs.\"",
      "Rudakubana, armed with a large knife, intruded and began stabbing the girls and their teacher.",
      "The court was shown video of the suspect arriving at the Hart Space venue in a taxi and entering the building. Within seconds, screams erupted and children ran outside in panic, some of them wounded. One girl made it to the doorway, but was pulled back inside by the attacker. She was stabbed 32 times but survived.",
      "Gasps and sobs could be heard in court as the videos played.",
      "Heer said two of the dead children \"suffered particularly horrific injuries which are difficult to explain as anything other than sadistic in nature.\" One of the dead girls had 122 injuries, while another suffered 85 wounds.",
      "The prosecutor said Rudakubana had \"a longstanding obsession with violence, killing, genocide.\"",
      "\"His only purpose was to kill. And he targeted the youngest and most vulnerable in society,\" she said, as relatives of the victims watched on in the courtroom.",
      "Heer said that when he was taken to a police station, Rudakubana was heard to say: \"It's a good thing those children are dead, I'm so glad, I'm so happy.\"",
      "The killings triggered days of anti-immigrant violence across the country after far-right activists seized on incorrect reports that the attacker was an asylum-seeker who had recently arrived in the U.K. Some suggested the crime was a jihadi attack, and alleged that police and the government were withholding information.",
      "Rudakubana was born in Cardiff, Wales, to Christian parents from Rwanda, and investigators haven't been able to pin down his motivation. Police found documents about subjects including Nazi Germany, the Rwandan genocide and car bombs on his devices.",
      "In the years before the attack, he had been reported to multiple authorities over his violent interests and actions. All of the agencies failed to spot the danger he posed.",
      "In 2019, he phoned a children's advice line to ask \"What should I do if I want to kill somebody?\" He said he had taken a knife to school because he wanted to kill someone who was bullying him. Two months later, he attacked a fellow student with a hockey stick and was convicted of assault.",
      "Prosecutors said Rudakubana was referred three times to the government's anti-extremism program, Prevent, when he was 13 and 14 \u2014 once after researching school shootings in class, then for uploading pictures of Libyan leader Moammar Gadhafi to Instagram and for researching a London terror attack.",
      "But they concluded his crimes should not be classed as terrorism because Rudakubana had no discernable political or religious cause. Heer said \"his purpose was the commission of mass murder, not for a particular end, but as an end in itself.\"",
      "Prime Minister Keir Starmer said this week the country must face up to a \"new threat\" from violent individuals whose mix of motivations test the traditional definition of terrorism.",
      "\"After one of the most harrowing moments in our country's history, we owe it to these innocent young girls and all those affected to deliver the change that they deserve,\" Starmer said after the sentencing.",
      "Several relatives and survivors read emotional statements in court, describing how the attack had shattered their lives.",
      "Lucas, 36, who ran the dance class, said that \"the trauma of being both a victim and a witness has been horrendous.\"",
      "\"I cannot give myself compassion or accept praise, as how can I live knowing I survived when children died?\" she said.",
      "A 14-year-old survivor, who can't be named because of a court order, said that while she was physically recovering. \"we will all have to live with the mental pain from that day forever.\"",
      "\"I hope you spend the rest of your life knowing that we think you're a coward,\" she said.",
      "The prosecutor read out a statement from the parents of Alice Da Silva Aguiar, who said their daughter's killing had \"shattered our souls.\"",
      "\"We used to cook for three. Now we only cook for two. It doesn't seem right,\" they said. \"Alice was our purpose for living, so what do we do now?\"",

    "summary": "Israel says troops fired on masked gunmen in Gaza, but it remains committed to the ceasefire as it continues a new offensive in the West Bank.",
    "story": [
      "Tel Aviv \u2014\u00a0Testing the bounds of a fragile ceasefire in its fifth day, Israel's military said Thursday that forces had opened fire in the southern Gaza Strip on masked, armed suspects who posed a threat to their safety. The Israel Defense Forces, in a statement, reported incidents east of the southern Gaza city of Rafah, and in the area of the Kerem Shalom border crossing, through which aid trucks have been delivering more food, water and medical supplies since the ceasefire took effect.",
      "The IDF said it had killed one militant with the Islamic Jihad group and that while Israel remained \"determined to fully maintain the terms of the [ceasefire] agreement in order to return the hostages,\" it was also \"prepared for any scenario and will continue to take all necessary actions to thwart any immediate threat to IDF soldiers.\"",
      "There was no immediate response to the incident from Gaza's Hamas rulers.",
      "Hours before the IDF confirmed the operation in southern Gaza, newly-sworn-in U.S. Secretary of State Marco Rubio called Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and told the Israeli leader that \"maintaining the United States' steadfast support for Israel is a top priority for President Trump,\" according to a readout of the call.",
      "Rubio made a series of calls to foreign ministers around the world, but Netanyahu was the first head of state he spoke with, according to readouts provided by the State Department. The two men also discussed freeing the remaining 94 Israeli hostages still held in Gaza, of whom seven are Israeli-Americans, and addressing threats from Iran, though the State Department offered no specifics.",
      "Gaza's Hamas-run Health Ministry has not reported any new deaths since the ceasefire took hold, but the official toll has continued to rise as rescue and recovery teams, and ordinary citizens, find more bodies and, in some cases, piles of bones, in the rubble of the devastated Palestinian enclave.",
      "The ministry said that, as of Thursday, its tally showed more than 47,200 people had been killed during the war that was sparked by Hamas' Oct. 7, 2023 terrorist attack on Israel, which saw militants kill approximately 1,200 people and kidnap 251 others. In Gaza, the remains of more than 160 people have been recovered since the ceasefire began on Sunday, the ministry said.",
      "Thousands more bodies are still believed to be under collapsed buildings in the enclave, which was home to some 2.3 million people before the war. The media office of Gaza's Hamas-run administration said Thursday that about 14,000 people remained missing.",
      "Faster recovery efforts, along with the distribution of aid, have been hampered due to a lack of functioning heavy equipment in the strip and its decimated infrastructure, according to rescue workers and aid agencies.",
      "As of Wednesday, the U.N. said 808 trucks carrying humanitarian aid, including food, fuel and medical supplies, had entered the strip since the ceasefire took effect. But the ceasefire and hostage release agreement negotiated by the U.S., Qatar and Egypt called for 600 trucks to enter the territory every day.",
      "Hamas has said it will release four more hostages \u2014 Israeli women \u2014 on Saturday. The initial exchange on Sunday saw three captives set free in exchange for about 90 Palestinian prisoners, who were let out of an Israeli prison in the occupied West Bank. Israel is expected to free 200 more Palestinian detainees in the next exchange this weekend.",
      "Meanwhile, a \"large-scale\" military offensive launched by the IDF in the West Bank earlier this week continued overnight, focused in and around the sprawling Jenin refugee camp in the north of the Palestinian territory.",
      "The IDF says it has killed two men in the \"Iron Wall\" operation who were linked to the Hamas-allied Islamic Jihad group, claiming the men shot and killed three Israelis in a bus attack two weeks ago in the West Bank.",
      "The Palestinian Health Ministry in the West Bank, which is not controlled by Hamas like Gaza, said Wednesday that 10 Palestinians had been killed amid the IDF's new operation.",
      "\"Iron Wall\" has been a major show of force by the IDF in Jenin, an area of the West Bank long considered by Israel to be a stronghold of Iranian-backed militant groups. Since the ceasefire in Gaza took effect, the IDF has redirected its focus \u2014 and firepower \u2014 to the West Bank.",
      "One of President Trump's many initial moves as he began his second term this week was to withdraw Biden-era sanctions imposed on Israeli settlers deemed a threat to security in the West Bank.",
      "Domestically, for Prime Minister Netanyahu, the West Bank offensive may be aimed at least partly at placating a segment of his support base \u2014 including far-right members of his own cabinet \u2014 who have been infuriated by the ceasefire deal with Hamas.",
      "Israel's former National Security Minister, the right-wing nationalist Itamar Ben-Gvir, resigned in protest over the deal, saying it was giving in to terror.",
      "If the country's Finance Minister, Bezalel Smotrich, another far-right cabinet member, were to resign, then Netanyahu's fragile coalition government would fall apart. Early national elections would then have to be called in the country, which could imperil Netanyahu's own long grip on political power.",

      "Dubai, United Arab Emirates \u2014 Saudi Arabia's crown prince said Thursday the kingdom wants to invest $600 billion in the United States over the next four years, comments that came after President Trump put a price tag on returning to the kingdom as his first foreign trip.",
      "Mr. Trump's 2017 trip to Saudi Arabia upended a tradition of U.S. presidents first heading to the United Kingdom as their first trip abroad. It also underscored his administration's close ties to the rulers of the oil-rich Gulf states as his eponymous real estate company has pursued deals across the region as well.",
      "The comments from Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman, reported early Thursday by the state-run Saudi Press Agency, came in a phone call with Mr. Trump.",
      "\"The crown prince affirmed the kingdom's intention to broaden its investments and trade with the United States over the next four years, in the amount of $600 billion, and potentially beyond that,\" the report said.",
      "The readout didn't elaborate on where those investments and trade could be placed. The U.S. in recent years has increasingly pulled away from relying on Saudi oil exports, which were the bedrock of their relationship for decades. Saudi sovereign wealth funds have taken large stakes in American businesses while also looking at sports, as well.",
      "Saudi Arabia does, however, rely predominantly on U.S.-made weapons and defense systems, which could be a part of the investment.",
      "There was no immediate readout from the White House on the call. It also wasn't immediately clear if Mr. Trump's call with the crown prince was his first with a foreign leader since re-entering the White House. However, it was the first such call to be reported.",
      "The crown prince, the de facto ruler of the oil-rich kingdom, also spoke with U.S. Secretary of State Marco Rubio early Thursday.",
      "On Monday after his inauguration, Mr. Trump talked about possibly heading to the kingdom again as his first foreign trip, as he did in 2017.",
      "\"The first foreign trip typically has been with the U.K. but ... I did it with Saudi Arabia last time because they agreed to buy $450 billion worth of our products,\" Mr. Trump told journalists in the Oval Office. \"If Saudi Arabia wanted to buy another $450 billion or $500 - we'll up it for all the inflation - I think I'd probably go.\"",
      "The 2017 visit to the kingdom set in motion a yearslong boycott of Qatar by four Arab nations, including the kingdom.",
      "Mr. Trump maintained close relations with Saudi Arabia, even after Prince Mohammed was implicated in the 2018 killing and dismemberment of Washington Post columnist Jamal Khashoggi in Istanbul. The kingdom also had been talking for years with the Biden administration about a wider deal to recognize Israel in exchange for U.S. defense protections and other support.",
      "The $600 billion pledge, which dwarves the gross domestic product of many nations, also comes as the kingdom faces budgetary pressures of its own. Global oil prices remain depressed years after the height of the coronavirus pandemic, affecting the kingdom's revenues.",
      "Meanwhile, Prince Mohammed also wants to continue his $500 billion project at NEOM, a new city in Saudi Arabia's western desert on the Red Sea. It also will need to build tens of billions of dollars' worth of new stadiums and infrastructure ahead of hosting the 2034 FIFA World Cup.",

      "Since the fires, which have killed nearly 30 people and forced tens of thousands to flee their homes, broke out earlier this month, Trump has repeatedly criticized Newsom's handling of the immense crisis.

      "\"The senate campaign loan is 100% owed to Treasurer Fleming, personally,\" Fleming's campaign noted. \"With regard to placement, Sen Cassidy ran against a weak Republican and a politically-wounded Democrat who had voted for Obamacare among other things. And, he had the backing of the entire Republican Party.\"",
      "\"Treasurer Fleming ran in an open seat against 23 opponents of all parties, some of whom divided his political base geographically as well as ideologically,\" the statement continued. \"Sen. John Kennedy ultimately won Fleming's senate race as he was also the Louisiana State Treasurer and had run for the Senate before as Fleming is currently. What truly matters at this time is that Senator Cassidy voted to convict President Trump in the second impeachment trial during Trump's first term. Had Trump been convicted, it would have foreclosed any possibility to reelect Trump leading to either a second Biden term or a Kamala Harris Presidency.\"",

      "Let\u2019s take a deeper look at five smartphone rules they use that you can, too.",
      "1. Restart your phone once a week",
      "It\u2019s dead simple and absolutely worth doing. Turn off your phone, wait 10 seconds, then turn it back on. This works to combat zero-click exploits where a hacker can get in simply by sending you the right code.",
      "Heads up: A restart won\u2019t work for other types of malware. If your phone becomes infected,\u00a0you\u2019ll need to do a full factory reset.",
      "2. Disable Bluetooth when you don\u2019t need it",
      "Bluetooth works similarly to Wi-Fi and cellular networks but performs simpler tasks at shorter ranges. You don\u2019t need a cellular signal or network connection to use Bluetooth, and it doesn\u2019t use data. And like any other connection, it\u2019s not 100% safe.",

      "In spaces like the airport or coffee shop, hackers can use them to install malware or steal your data. Now, actual cases of juice jacking are rare in the U.S. but it\u2019s still a real threat. They happen through USB connections, so if a kiosk has actual power outlets to charge your phone using your own adapter, you\u2019re good to go.",

      "Just because a public Wi-Fi network pops up and asks if you want to join doesn\u2019t mean it\u2019s legitimate. If you\u2019re at a coffee shop or hotel, ask an employee for the specific name of their Wi-Fi network. Scammers will sometimes create networks called \"Coffee Shop\" or \"Hotel Guest\" to make you believe you\u2019re connecting to the real thing when, actually, you\u2019re not.",

      "In \"hot-miking\" attacks, hackers activate your microphone without you knowing it so they can listen into your conversations.

If your PC is in safe mode and no longer experiences the restart loop, this means that the default Windows 11 settings and drivers aren't causing the issue.

This is one of the leading causes of a Windows 11 PC getting stuck in a restart loop. If you've noticed your desktop giving off a lot more heat than usual or a laptop feeling hot to the touch, chances are you have an overheating issue.",
      "A computer's CPU and GPU generate the most heat, so I recommend monitoring those hardware pieces to see if they are overheating.

However, there's a multitude of free-to-use apps that manufacturers have developed to measure your CPU temperature, including Core Temp, HWMonitor or Open Hardware Monitor.",
      "When you open one of these monitoring tools, you'll be able to view your PC's stats, including CPU and GPU temperatures and loads. If your CPU or GPU is running too hot, try cleaning the components to remove dust. For custom-built desktops, adding more exhaust fans to the case can improve airflow and cooling.

In addition to causing shut-offs and restart loops, a faulty power supply can also cause a blue screen of death error. In severe cases, you might even smell a burning scent or witness smoke coming from your PC's power supply exhaust vent. If you use a laptop with PSU issues, you cannot send your computer to a repair shop or the manufacturer for repair.",
      "Desktop PC owners have it a bit easier, assuming they have a pre-built PC that can be altered easily. If you do have a desktop, turn off and unplug your computer before going into the case to investigate if dust build-up is affecting your PSU.

      "An issue with your Windows 11 system files may be causing your PC to constantly restart. If you think a corrupted system file is why your PC keeps restarting, there's a quick and easy fix you can do within the Windows Powershell. The System File Checker (SFC) is a built-in tool that will scan your Windows system files for corruption or any other changes. If a system file has been modified, it will automatically replace the file with the correct version. Here's how to run the SFC command:",

      "If there's no problem with your Windows system files, after the scan, you'll see a message that says, \"Windows Resource Protection did not find any integrity violations.\" If you instead see a message saying, \"Windows Resource Protection found corrupt files but was unable to fix some of them,\" you should try running SFC again but in safe mode.",
      "Fix #8 - Check for RAM issues in the command prompt",
      "Your PC might be restarting itself because it doesn't have access to enough random access memory (RAM). Windows 11 may become unstable without enough RAM in your computer, causing the OS to randomly reboot. You can use the built-in Memory Diagnostics Tool in Windows 11 to check your computer for issues related to RAM. Here's what you need to do:",
      "Press the Windows Key\u00a0and RType mdsched.exe in the text boxClick OKSelect Restart Now and Check for Problems",

      "Kurt's key takeaways",
      "These are the best fixes for a computer that is constantly restarting. While you can perform these fixes at home, it might be your best bet to send your computer to a repair shop or back to the manufacturer if you continue having an issue with your Windows 11 PC being stuck in a restart loop after these fixes. It also may be time to invest in a new laptop if you are experiencing a system slowdown and random restarting on your Windows 11 PC, but I would recommend trying to fix the problem first before buying a new machine.",

      "Two of those reassigned, one senior DOJ official said, were Corey Amundson, who had been head of the public integrity section, and George Toscas, who had been deputy assistant attorney general in the national security division.",
      "It was not previously known that Amundson had been reassigned. The public integrity section prosecutes political corruption and played a role in both DOJ criminal cases against the former president.",
      "NBC News had previously reported that Toscas had been removed from his job.\u00a0He played a key role in pushing for the 2022 search of Mar-a-Lago for classified documents that Donald Trump, then a former president, had declined to return to the National Archives.",

      "The memo ordered the department\u2019s civil division to examine ways to take legal action against cities with so-called sanctuary laws that forbid local officials from cooperating with federal immigration enforcement. The memo also ordered prosecutors to investigate for potential prosecution any state or local officials who resist or fail to comply with the enforcement of federal immigration law.",

      "The ever-expansive actor, producer, director and artist plays the role of Rebekah, the family matriarch. Liu, 56, said the film, from director Steven Soderbergh and in theaters Friday, uses horror in an unexpected way to tell the story of unspoken family dynamics.",
      "The movie features a young family who bought a 100-year-old suburban house from a real estate agent played by Julia Fox. There, family issues begin to unfold in a claustrophobic setting, depicted from the point of view of a mysterious spirit presence. The movie uses horror to touch on lesser-discussed family issues like child favoritism or communication breakdowns within marriages.",
      "\u201cThe backdrop is a reality of a family dynamic and how this entity interacts or sees this family,\u201d Liu told NBC News. \u201cWhen people are in their own worlds, they don\u2019t know how bad it sounds and how dysfunctional it can be until you see it from another perspective.\u201d",
      "The film doesn\u2019t tie up loose ends and leaves audiences hanging, which she said horror is uniquely poised to do.",
      "\u201cHorror is a very specific genre that doesn\u2019t necessarily need to be a tangible person or entity like Jason [from \u2018Friday the 13th\u2019], like things people imagined in the past,\u201d Liu said. \u201cThis movie has a lot of suspense and when I watched it, it seemed like a thriller because things are unfolding and unraveling for the audience as they are watching it. It becomes a mystery that keeps people on the edge of their seats.\u201d",
      "The first-person point of view of the ghostly presence was captured by Soderbergh as he crept around the set in his martial arts slippers, cloth shoes, following the actors with a handheld camera.",
      "As a director herself on TV episodes of \u201cElementary,\u201d \u201cLuke Cage\u201d and \u201cAmerican Born Chinese,\u201d Liu said she was inspired by her experience working with Soderbergh as he brought his ideas to life in new and innovative ways.",
      "\u201cSteven is willing to try different genres and ways of filming,\u201d she said. \u201cIt takes courage because when you are somebody who is well-established and has a huge following of people, you don\u2019t want to disappoint them, but in order to grow as an artist, you have to take big chances, whether it works or not.\u201d",
      "After three decades in the movie industry, Liu continues to break new ground and is still pointed to as a prominent figure for Asian American representation in Hollywood.",
      "Born and raised in Queens, New York, Liu said she always knew she wanted to be an actor, but she didn\u2019t see herself represented. She took the leap anyway.",
      "Starting her acting career in the early \u201890s, Liu had a number of smaller roles on TV shows and movies before landing her breakthrough role in the comedy-drama \u201cAlly McBeal.\u201d In the following years, Liu hit superstardom with big roles in \u201cCharlie\u2019s Angels\u201d and Quentin Tarantino\u2019s \u201cKill Bill.\u201d",
      "The actor became the second Asian American woman to receive a star on the Hollywood Walk of Fame, after Anna May Wong in the 1960s, and the first Asian American woman to host \u201cSaturday Night Live,\u201d in 2000.",
      "Liu said her continued success as an actor through the decades can be credited to her willingness to take risks and reinvent herself.",
      "\u201cGoing into the acting business is a giant risk, that\u2019s what it is,\u201d Liu said. \u201cIt doesn\u2019t stop; it\u2019s not like you take one risk and you make it to the other side of the bridge.\u201d"

      "The announcement comes alongside a broad surge in AI investment, with President Donald Trump announcing earlier this week the launch of Project Stargate \u2014 an AI infrastructure joint venture with OpenAI, Oracle and Softbank \u2014 which aims to form a new company that could include investments of up to $500 billion over the next four years.",
      "That project has caught the eye of other top tech executives, including SpaceX and Tesla CEO Elon Musk, who found himself in a feud with OpenAI CEO Sam Altman after responding to an X post announcing the venture that \u201cthey don\u2019t actually have the money.\u201d",
      "AI technology has been a hot topic for many tech companies, with the rising popularity of AI models from companies like OpenAI, Meta and Anthropic. Nvidia, a company that makes graphics processing units, or GPUs \u2014 specialized computer chips that are used to train AI models \u2014 had one of the highest market capitalizations in 2024 and is currently valued at around $3.6 trillion.",
      "Trump also signed an executive order Thursday that aims to further the development of AI technology in the U.S., with a stated goal of removing policies that act as \u201cbarriers to American AI innovation\u201d and developing \u201cAI systems that are free from ideological bias or engineered social agendas.\u201d",
      "In Friday\u2019s announcement, Zuckerberg said he expects that \u201cMeta AI will be the leading assistant serving more than 1 billion people\u201d and that \u201cLlama 4 will become the leading state of the art model.\u201d",
      "With the addition of the data center, he said, the company is set to end the year with more than 1.3 million GPUs. Last January, Zuckerberg said Meta would be purchasing 350,000 H100 graphics cards from Nvidia, a deal worth billions of dollars.",
      "Zuckerberg had mentioned the data center project last month in an Instagram Reel announcing the release of Meta\u2019s Llama 3.3 model, noting that the center would be used to build \u201cfuture versions of Llama.\u201d The project will be built in Richland Parish, a rural area in northeast Louisiana with a population of roughly 19,000 people, according to census data."

    "published": "Fri, 24 Jan 2025 21:36:37 GMT",
    "summary": "The Supreme Court agreed to hear a bid by Oklahoma officials to approve the nation's first publicly-funded religious charter school.",
    "story": [
      "WASHINGTON \u2014 In a sign that the barrier between church and state could be further weakened, the Supreme Court on Friday agreed to hear a bid by Oklahoma officials to approve the nation\u2019s first publicly funded religious charter school.",
      "The court, which has a 6-3 conservative majority that consistently backs religious claims, will hear a dispute over the proposed St. Isidore of Seville Catholic Virtual School, which would serve students online throughout the state while maintaining its remit to promote the Catholic faith.",
      "The justices will review an Oklahoma Supreme Court ruling that said the proposal violated both the state and federal constitutions.",
      "The brief court order noted that conservative Justice Amy Coney Barrett, who would normally be a potential key vote in such a case, will not participate. The court did not say why.",
      "Barrett was previously a professor at Notre Dame Law School. and still has ties there. Its religious liberty law clinic is representing the school.",
      "The U.S. Constitution\u2019s First Amendment prohibits the government establishment of religion. But what over time became widely known as the separation of church and state irks some, especially conservative Christians, who believe there should be greater expressions of faith in public life.",
      "The school was first proposed in early 2023 by the Archdiocese of Oklahoma City and the Diocese of Tulsa. The plan is backed by Gov. Kevin Stitt, but opposed by the state\u2019s attorney general, Gentner Drummond, who has argued it is unconstitutional. Both are Republicans.",
      "The Oklahoma Statewide Charter School Board approved the application in June 2023 despite concerns about the school\u2019s religious nature.",
      "Drummond immediately took legal action, asking the Oklahoma Supreme Court to intervene and declare the plan unlawful.",
      "He has pointed out in court filings that the state constitution explicitly requires public schools to be \u201cfree from sectarian control\u201d and that no public money should ever be used to support religious institutions.",
      "The state board and the school argue that in preventing the school from participating in a state program, Oklahoma is inhibiting the free exercise of religion under a separate provision of the First Amendment.",
      "The board is represented by Alliance Defending Freedom, a conservative Christian legal group.",
      "Among the questions raised by the case is whether a privately run school that contracts with the state is a \u201cstate actor,\u201d meaning it is effectively an arm of the government.",
      "In June, the Oklahoma Supreme Court ruled that the plan was unconstitutional, embracing Drummond\u2019s arguments.",
      "\u201cUnder both state and federal, the state is not authorized to establish or fund St. Isidore,\u201d the court held.",
      "It also found that by participating in the state program, the school \u201cwill be acting as a surrogate of a state\u201d and is therefore a state actor.",
      "The U.S. Supreme Court has in several recent cases chipped away at the separation of church and state.",
      "In one series of three related cases, the court opened the door to taxpayer money being funneled to religious entities, including schools, in certain circumstances.",
      "The conservative justices have also signaled that government officials have sometimes gone too far in seeking to avoid the appearance of endorsing religion under the First Amendment\u2019s establishment clause. In doing so, officials have threatened free exercise rights, the court has found.",
      "In one 2022 case, the court ruled in favor of a public high school football coach who was suspended for leading Christian prayers with players on the field after games. The same year, the court faulted the city of Boston for barring a Christian group from flying a flag at City Hall under a program open to groups of all types across the city."

    "story": [
      "For more than two years, Sherita Harris has been waiting for someone to be held responsible for a bullet that struck her in the head while she rode in the passenger seat of a car in Jackson, Mississippi.",
      "On Friday, the mother of five finally got a sign.",
      "The Mississippi Attorney General\u2019s Office announced that two state police officers have been charged in the shooting, which left her with a partially paralyzed face, permanent memory loss and damaged sight and hearing.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s been so long, I thought they forgot and were going to sweep it under the rug,\u201d Harris, 40, said, her speech halting and slurred from the gunshot wound. \u201cIt brings me a little joy.\u201d",
      "Mississippi Capitol Police Officer Michael Rhinewalt and former officer Jeffery Walker were each indicted by a state grand jury on aggravated assault charges, accused of shooting Harris \u201cunder circumstances manifesting extreme indifference to the value of human life.\u201d Rhinewalt and Walker were also accused of shooting at Harris\u2019 friend, who was driving. The officers have said they opened fire after the friend, Sinatra Jordan, shot at them during a chase, which Jordan denies.",
      "The indictments were handed down in December; the state Attorney General\u2019s Office announced them Friday afternoon.",
      "Lawyer Scott Gilbert, who is representing Rhinewalt, said in an email that the officer \u201cacted appropriately when he returned fire after being shot at by the suspect\u201d and was confident he would \u201cbe vindicated at trial.\u201d",
      "Walker\u2019s lawyer, Francis Springer, said in an email that Walker \u201cmaintains his innocence, but must not make any comments before trial.\u201d Walker is also facing federal civil rights charges alleging that he beat a motorist during an arrest in July 2022, a month before Harris\u2019 shooting. He has pleaded not guilty in that case.",
      "Justin Smith, who is representing Harris in a $3 million lawsuit against Mississippi authorities, said he did not expect the news because the state Attorney General\u2019s Office rarely charges police officers in shootings.",
      "\u201cI\u2019m just shocked and surprised the AG\u2019s office took the initiative and they are indicting the officers,\u201d Smith said.",
      "The state Attorney General\u2019s Office said in a statement that it would not comment on the case because it is in \u201cactive litigation.\u201d",
      "Sean Tindell, the commissioner of the state Department of Public Safety, which oversees the Capitol Police, said in a statement that Rhinewalt had been placed on unpaid leave pending an internal hearing. Walker, he said, left the Capitol Police in July 2023.",
      "Since Harris' Aug. 14, 2022, shooting, the Department of Public Safety has created an internal affairs division to independently handle complaints against officers, Tindell said. Capitol Police officers now wear body cameras; Walker and Rhinewalt were not wearing cameras at the time of Harris' shooting.",
      "Harris has no recollection of getting shot. The last thing she remembers is her friend, Jordan, saying the police were pulling them over. She woke up in a hospital three days later, face torn apart.",
      "The officers, both new hires at the Capitol Police as part of a crackdown on crime in Jackson,\u00a0said Jordan led them on a chase through downtown after fleeing a traffic stop. Walker testified in a September 2022 hearing that he and Rhinewalt opened fire on the car after Jordan fired at them first. Walker described a rolling gun battle that ended in a residential neighborhood. Walker said he saw objects thrown from the car during the chase but that the items had not been found. Their patrol car was not hit by bullets, he said.",
      "Jordan, who has been held in jail since the incident while awaiting trial on charges of fleeing and aggravated assault on police officers, disputed Walker\u2019s account of how the chase started, the route it took and where shots were fired. In letters and interviews, Jordan has said he didn\u2019t have a gun and did not throw anything from the car. He also said officers beat him up, which was corroborated by a witness interviewed by NBC News. He and his lawyers could not be reached for comment Friday.",
      "After the chase ended and Jordan was arrested, officers searched the car and found no gun, Walker testified. But they did find Harris suffering from a gunshot wound.",
      "The witness previously told NBC News that she heard one of the officers exclaim, \u201cOh my God, oh my God\u201d after discovering Harris.",
      "Harris said she required surgeries to remove a bullet and repair her left eye and ear. The left side of her face remains partly paralyzed, and she struggles to chew food. She said suffers from\u00a0 depression and PTSD. She gets by with the help of a caregiver and rarely leaves home.",
      "The indictments, Harris said, brought her a bit of relief from her pain."

      "The 24-hour flood watch alerts cover the still-active Palisades Fire, which has burned 23,448 acres and is 79% contained, and Eaton Fire, which has burned 14,021 acres and is 95% contained, starting at 4 p.m. Sunday.",
      "The National Weather Service said the possibility of mudslides inspired the watches, which indicate conditions for flooding are favorable but not imminent. Federal forecasters said the probability of significant flooding and debris flow is 10% to 20%.",

Travel disruption was possible, the office said.",
      "Even the mountains of urban Los Angeles and San Diego counties could see snow accumulation of 14 inches and 8 inches, respectively. The forecast comes as the Border 2 fire in San Diego County had burned 6,273 acres since Thursday, with 10% containment Friday evening.",
      "The weather service office in San Diego said on Jan. 10 only .14 inches of rain had fallen since the start of the water year Oct. 1, representing the driest winter so far since 1860, when officials started recording weather data.",

    "published": "Sat, 25 Jan 2025 00:44:48 GMT",
    "summary": "WASHINGTON \u2014 Federal prosecutors in the now-disbanded Capitol Siege Section of the D.C. U.S. attorney's office spent much of the last four years prosecuting cases against Jan. 6 rioters.",
    "story": [
      "WASHINGTON \u2014 Federal prosecutors in the now-disbanded Capitol Siege Section of the D.C. U.S. attorney's office spent much of the last four years prosecuting cases against Jan. 6 rioters. Suddenly, a single signature erased the end results \u2014 though not the public record \u2014 of that work.",
      "Three prosecutors who worked in the section described the week to NBC News, with one calling it the worst of their professional lives. It started with President Donald Trump\u2019s signing of the pardons. Soon, prosecutors were dismissing the active cases that remained and putting aside evidence they hoped would have led to more charges.",
      "And the week ended, on Friday, with acting U.S. Attorney Ed Martin \u2014 an advocate for Capitol rioters who appeared with Trump at fundraisers for Jan. 6 defendants \u2014 filing a motion to remove remaining conditions imposed on members of the far-right Oath Keepers militia, whose ability to visit Washington was still restricted by a judicial order after Trump commuted their sentences.",
      "Ashley Akers, who worked on Jan. 6 cases and left the Justice Department on Friday, called the pardons \u201cshocking\u201d and said she had a \u201cguttural\u201d reaction to having to file motions to dismiss cases when she felt she had evidence beyond a reasonable doubt that showed assaults against law enforcement. Many in the office had developed close relationships with the police officers who were injured on Jan. 6, 2021, which had kept them dedicated to the work.",
      "\u201cIt really undermines not only the sacrifices that all these officers made, but the experiences that they went through,\u201d said Akers, who spoke to NBC News after she turned in her computers and left the department. \u201cThe public record \u2014 which is very clear and borne out in hundreds of trials \u2014 has shown that these officers are victims.\u201d",
      "The prosecutors acknowledged that while the Constitution gives the president extraordinary pardon power, they still found it extremely difficult to file the motions, under orders from new bosses, dismissing cases they had brought.",
      "\u201cIt goes against every instinct that I have,\u201d one federal prosecutor previously assigned to the Capitol Siege Section told NBC News. This person is still working for the Justice Department and spoke anonymously because their employment would be in jeopardy if they spoke on the record.",
      "\u201cWhen you are a prosecutor, state or federal, you pursue the case based on the evidence and based on the law, not based on any political consideration. And to be told that you have to dismiss this case with overwhelming evidence is torturous,\u201d the prosecutor continued.",
      "Akers decided to leave the Justice Department after Trump named former Rep. Matt Gaetz as his initial pick for attorney general. She said it was \u201cincredibly sad\u201d that her career as a federal prosecutor was coming to an end with the pardons of violent rioters she helped convict.",
      "Some prosecutors decided to leave even before Trump was elected. Jason Manning, a former federal prosecutor who worked on Jan. 6 cases, left the Justice Department over the summer, joining Vice President Kamala Harris\u2019 campaign. He said he hadn\u2019t previously been a really political person, but he heard Trump\u2019s pledges to pardon Jan. 6 offenders on the campaign trail and he knew the Justice Department\u2019s work against rioters would \u201cgrind to a halt\u201d if Trump was elected.",
      "\u201cThe idea that all of this could be wiped away with this over with the stroke of the pen made me think, personally, that it was more important to me to participate in the election in a way that would try to prevent that outcome, even if that meant giving up this job that I loved,\u201d Manning said.",
      "The prosecutors were always aware that Trump\u2019s election might mean that he could try to erase their work, and they also knew there were ways his administration could target those who held pro-Trump rioters accountable under the law.",
      "\u201cWe joined this mission because we believed in the defense of democracy. But we all stayed for the officers, who were brutally assaulted that day, repeatedly,\u201d said the federal prosecutor still working at the Justice Department. \u201cIf they want to retaliate against me for doing that, fine.\u201d",
      "Former Jan. 6 defendant Steve Baker \u2014 a libertarian writer who entered the Capitol during the attack, licensed his footage to media outlets, and then became a reporter for Glenn Beck\u2019s outlet, The Blaze \u2014 told NBC News that he believed that federal prosecutors\u2019 cases against misdemeanor defendants, and what he sees as overreach against other nonviolent participants, gave the right leverage in the battle over the story of Jan. 6.",
      "\u201cI can guarantee you this, I would bet a year\u2019s salary on this,\u201d Baker said. \u201cHad the DOJ focused on the violent offenders only, we would have never heard the word \u2018pardon\u2019 in a campaign promise from President Trump.\u201d",
      "Baker, who went to pick up his guns from a friend\u2019s home once a judge dismissed his case Thursday, shares at least one strong belief with many Jan. 6 prosecutors: that Elon Musk\u2019s purchase of Twitter helped create a much different media environment around the events of the Capitol riot.",
      "\u201cI don\u2019t discount Elon\u2019s purchase of Twitter at all as being a key to it,\u201d Baker said. \u201cYou win battles on the battlefield, and propaganda is part of it\u2026 I think that that certainly benefited the balancing out of the narrative.\u201d",
      "Multiple Jan. 6 prosecutors told NBC News that Twitter, now X, was a key component to the Capitol investigation, noting that it was where online sleuths who assisted the FBI first organized. They also noticed, with frustration, that the evidence they were presenting in court wasn\u2019t having an impact on the public dialogue later on, with some commenting that members of the public who stopped by hearings would see hours of footage they\u2019d never viewed before and be shocked by what they saw.",
      "Some of the evidence did come out through media requests, including one revealing video NBC News obtained through the media coalition after it was introduced as evidence. It shows Rep. Troy Nehls, R-Texas, telling rioters they \u201cought to be ashamed,\u201d and that he, a former sheriff, had never seen anything like this during his decades in law enforcement.",
      "\u201cI\u2019ve been in law enforcement in Texas for 30 years, and I\u2019ve never had people act this way,\u201d Nehls said in the video. \u201cI\u2019m ashamed!\u201d",
      "Nehls has since downplayed the attack, writing a book called \u201cThe Big Fraud: What Democrats Don\u2019t Want You to Know about January 6, the 2020 Election, and a Whole Lot Else.\u201d",
      "Manning said that the contemporaneous evidence showing what Nehls actually thought at the time is a powerful piece of the historical record that lives on despite the cases and the convictions disappearing.",
      "\u201cHe made quite clear exactly what he thought of the rioters and what they were doing that day,\u201d Manning told me. \u201cHis position has changed over time, but that video captures what he actually thought in the moment, how he actually experienced Jan. 6, and that\u2019s part of the record. That\u2019s why I emphasize the record stands. And building this record was tremendously important.\u201d",
      "Prosecutors and some of the judges involved in the cases seem to agree on that point.",
      "\u201cWhen others in the public eye are not willing to risk their own power or popularity by calling out lies when they hear them,\u201d U.S. District Judge Amy Berman Jackson wrote in a case order this week, \u201cthe record of the proceedings in this courthouse will be available to those who seek the truth.\u201d"

Many DoD social media accounts had already gone quiet by the time the memo went out.",

      "Late deliveries of new aircraft from\u00a0Boeing\u00a0and Airbus, air traffic constraints and financial pressures have limited airlines\u2019 ability to expand flights, which has pushed fares higher.

Not only did it have the highest opening of any theatrical Broadway adaptation, but it is also now the highest-grossing film based on a Broadway musical, according to data from Comscore.",
      "The question for Universal ahead of the release of part two \u2014 \u201cWicked: For Good,\u201d due out in November \u2014 is how to keep its biggest fans engaged without alienating its more casual audiences.",
      "Marketing experts told CNBC that pent-up demand for the movie, combined with the first film\u2019s success, makes promoting its follow-up much easier.",
      "\u2033[Generating] close to $500 million is an amazing feat for that film,\u201d said Mike Polydoros, CEO at cinematic marketing agency PaperAirplane Media. \u201cThey have all these fans who have seen the movie over and over again and came to the sing-alongs. They\u2019ve marked their calendars for the second part of the movie.",
      "\u201cSo, the marketing of it is more about keeping that group engaged and keeping them [informed] \u2026 and giving them just enough nuggets without oversaturating,\u201d Polydoros said.",
      "Universal already has one thing working in its favor: When it launches the marketing campaign for \u201cWicked: For Good,\u201d it will be able to add best picture Academy Award nominee to its franchise promotions.",
      "On Thursday,\u00a0the studio snared 10 nominations\u00a0for \u201cWicked,\u201d including for lead actress, supporting actress, film editing, sound, score, production design, costume, visual effects and makeup and hairstyling.",
      "A yellow brick road map",
      "The overall marketing plan for \u201cWicked: For Good\u201d is expected to be similar to the playbook used for \u201cWicked\u201d with a few alterations to keep it fresh and avoid oversaturating audiences.",
      "Universal jumpstarted the first film\u2019s advertising strategy with a teaser trailer that ran during the Super Bowl in February. The nearly 90-second spot gave fans their first glimpse of Oz, as well as Cynthia Erivo\u2019s triumphant battle cry from \u201cDefying Gravity,\u201d the closing number of the first act of the Broadway musical.",
      "\u201cThere wasn\u2019t a debate,\u201d Michael Moses, Universal\u2019s chief marketing officer,\u00a0told Variety back in November. \u201cWhen you\u2019re working on materials, you always have those kinds of conversations. But if there\u2019s a single sound associated with \u2018Wicked,\u2019 it\u2019s certainly that end to \u2018Defying Gravity.\u2019 \u2026 Ending that spot with it felt assured and inescapably the right call.\u201d",
      "The Super Bowl ad spot was followed up by another teaser trailer at the annual CinemaCon in Las Vegas in April and a quick appearance from Elphaba (Erivo) and Glinda (Ariana Grande). The co-stars attended the Met Gala in New York City a month later, walking the red carpet together and closing out the evening with a surprise performance. Then, in July, the pair were spotted at the Paris Olympics, which was televised by NBC.",
      "\u201cOur filmmakers and our talent were very accessible throughout this process,\u201d said Dave O\u2019Connor, president of franchise management and brand strategy at Universal. \u201cMany of them participated in various parts of our campaign, from the straight marketing that we did for the film, but also with our partnerships and some of the unique opportunities that our company brought to the table. So I think that was also something that felt organic and authentic to the process.\u201d",
      "Universal peppered audiences with different iterations of the film\u2019s trailer and teaser videos throughout the summer, leading into its big marketing push \u2014\u00a0more than 400 corporate brand partnerships.\u00a0Retail stores were flooded with pink and green merchandise, from apparel, accessories, footwear, beauty and costumes to home decor, toys and even one-of-a-kind cars. The collections ranged in price, allowing consumers to choose from affordable and luxury options to show off their love of all things \u201cWicked.\u201d",
      "\u201cI get asked a lot, \u2018What is the state of exhibition?\u2018\u201d said Brandon Jones, president and chief marketing officer of FilmFrog. \u201cAnd I think that \u2018Wicked\u2019 is the perfect example of this. The state of exhibition is, and has always been, to influence culture.\u201d",
      "With nine months before the release of \u201cWicked: For Good,\u201d Universal will look to repeat the success of the first film\u2019s marketing campaign, but with some variation.",
      "\u201cI think our intent would not be to replicate, but certainly to evolve and to continue to do incredible work and find the right balance of partnerships that can innovate and really match the heart of the next film,\u201d O\u2019Connor said.",
      "A 'Wicked' cinematic experience",
      "Like \u201cWicked,\u201d \u201cWicked: For Good\u201d arrives the weekend before Thanksgiving. This gives the film breathing room for a solid opening weekend before Disney drops its traditional animated release the day before the holiday. This year, it will be \u201cZootopia 2.\u201d",
      "\u201cWicked: For Good\u201d will then be able to capitalize on school vacations and family gatherings to fuel a strong second week of ticket sales \u2014 the\u00a0same strategy employed for \u201cWicked\u201d\u00a0amid the surprise release of Disney\u2019s \u201cMoana 2\u201d on the Thanksgiving holiday last year.",
      "Cinemas will also look to capitalize on the prior success of \u201cWicked\u201d when promoting \u201cWicked: For Good.\u201d While Universal will provide creative assets such as trailers, standees and other digital and physical materials, theaters big and small will look for ways to lure audiences to their locations with special collectible popcorn buckets and unique food and drink options.",
      "\u201cUntil, really, the last [decade], exhibitors just relied on studios to do most of the marketing and that really started to change around 2016 or 2017,\u201d said Jones. \u201cBecause the relationship between the film and the moviegoer is actually managed by exhibitors. Because you don\u2019t buy your ticket for \u2018Wicked\u2019 from Universal. You buy it from your local movie theater.\u201d",
      "Jones noted that the quick release of \u201cWicked: For Good,\u201d almost exactly one year after \u201cWicked,\u201d allows movie theaters to engage with guests more acutely.",
      "Using ticket sales data, cinemas can market on a one-to-one basis during the 12-month period between releases to not only promote the second film, but also entice moviegoers to return for other in-theater programming that is similar to \u201cWicked.\u201d",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s one thing to market the movie, it\u2019s another thing to market the experience of going to the movies,\u201d Jones added.",
      "Disclosure: Comcast is the parent company of NBCUniversal and CNBC. NBCUniversal is the distributor of \u201cWicked\u201d and owns NBC Sports and NBC Olympics. NBC Olympics is the U.S. broadcast rights holder to all Summer and Winter Games through 2032.",

      "Spending on AmEx cards jumped 8% year over year in the fourth quarter after slowing from a 7% growth rate early in the year to 6% during the second and third quarters, according to the firm\u2019s\u00a0earnings\u00a0presentation.",
      "While the year-end pickup was seen across all customer segments and geographies, it was especially fueled by millennials and Gen Z users, where transaction volumes jumped 16%, up from 12% in the third quarter.",
      "Older groups were more restrained with their cards. Gen X customers spent 7% more in the fourth quarter, while baby boomers saw billings rise just 4%.",
      "\u201cWe had very strong growth from Gen Z and millennials, and that 2 percentage point acceleration gives us a lot of optimism for 2025,\u201d Le Caillec said.",
      "Elevated transaction levels have continued into the first three weeks of this year, he added.",
      "Younger Americans are said to spend more on experiences rather than goods, and that is reflected in the results from AmEx, which along with rival card issuer\u00a0JPMorgan Chase, dominate the market for high-end credit cards.",
      "Travel and entertainment billings rose 11% in the quarter, compared with 8% for good and services. The boost in travel came from airline spending, which rose 13%, with spending for business class and first class airfares up 19%, according to Le Caillec.",
      "AmEx shares fell more than 2% in midday trading Friday after the company\u00a0reported\u00a0earnings and revenue that were roughly in line with analysts\u2019 expectations. Shares of the New York-based company have been on a tear over the past year, hitting a 52-week high on Thursday.",
      "\u201cWe are encouraged by accelerating billings growth as we believe it will be a key factor for Amex to meet its aspirational target of at least 10% revenue growth,\u201d William Blair analysts led by Cristopher Kennedy wrote Friday in a research note. \u201cWe remain buyers on any pullback.\u201d",

The officers have said they opened fire after the friend, Sinatra Jordan, shot at them during a chase, which Jordan denies.",

      "Since Harris' Aug. 14, 2022, shooting, the Department of Public Safety has created an internal affairs division to independently handle complaints against officers, Tindell said. Capitol Police officers now wear body cameras; Walker and Rhinewalt were not wearing cameras at the time of Harris' shooting.",
      "Harris has no recollection of getting shot. The last thing she remembers is her friend, Jordan, saying the police were pulling them over. She woke up in a hospital three days later, face torn apart.",
      "The officers, both new hires at the Capitol Police as part of a crackdown on crime in Jackson,\u00a0said Jordan led them on a chase through downtown after fleeing a traffic stop. Walker testified in a September 2022 hearing that he and Rhinewalt opened fire on the car after Jordan fired at them first. Walker described a rolling gun battle that ended in a residential neighborhood. Walker said he saw objects thrown from the car during the chase but that the items had not been found. Their patrol car was not hit by bullets, he said.",
      "Jordan, who has been held in jail since the incident while awaiting trial on charges of fleeing and aggravated assault on police officers, disputed Walker\u2019s account of how the chase started, the route it took and where shots were fired. In letters and interviews, Jordan has said he didn\u2019t have a gun and did not throw anything from the car. He also said officers beat him up, which was corroborated by a witness interviewed by NBC News. He and his lawyers could not be reached for comment Friday.",
      "After the chase ended and Jordan was arrested, officers searched the car and found no gun, Walker testified. But they did find Harris suffering from a gunshot wound.",
      "The witness previously told NBC News that she heard one of the officers exclaim, \u201cOh my God, oh my God\u201d after discovering Harris.",
      "Harris said she required surgeries to remove a bullet and repair her left eye and ear. The left side of her face remains partly paralyzed, and she struggles to chew food. She said suffers from\u00a0 depression and PTSD. She gets by with the help of a caregiver and rarely leaves home.",
      "The indictments, Harris said, brought her a bit of relief from her pain."

If there\u2019s anything that I\u2019ve learned in the past 20 years, it\u2019s that mental health affects everybody\u2019s lives across party lines,\u201d the singer began. \u201cI reached out to the last administration, spoke with the surgeon general about the mental health crisis that\u2019s facing our nation.

Detailing how Violet was able to survive in the world of dragons and war, relying on her wits and ability to find alternate paths to success, allowed Yarros to draw parallels to how she lives day-to-day.",
      "\u201cIt was cathartic to say, \u2018Hey, you can have a saddle. You can still be a rider. You just have to do it a little differently,\u2019\u201d she tells TODAY.com. \u201cI can do everything that other writers can. I just have to do it differently. My legs have to be up for POTS flares. I have to support underneath my knees so that my joints don\u2019t, you know, go all wonky on me.",

      "Some readers say Violet has offered representation for those who experience chronic illness. And it's difficult to overstate just how many readers of Yarros' series there are.",
      "\"Fourth Wing,\" which came out in April 2023, propelled Yarros to the New York Times bestseller list. As of this writing, \"Fourth Wing\" is No. 1 on the combined print and e-book fiction list, and it's been on the list for 78 weeks. (Its sequel, \"Iron Flame,\" comes in at No. 3, with 52 weeks on the list.) On social media, specifically its bookish corners, \"Onyx Storm\" has been the talk of the town, with creators posting detailed recaps of the first two books, fervent theories and most importantly, their excitement to return to the world of Navarre.",
      "Yarros is on top of the book world. But before our interview, I'm met with immediate friendliness, an offer to sign my copy of her book and even passing self-deprecating jokes. (\"Defeated by a microphone,\" she jokes as she works to attach a mic to her shirt for the interview.)",

      "When it comes time to actually write the books, Yarros says she sometimes alters course from her outline. For example, Violet facing the Gauntlet, a vertical obstacle course that riders must complete before they have a chance to bond with a dragon, was not initially part of her plan.",
      "\u201cI was like, \u2018You know, they really need to prove themselves.\u2019 They really need to do something that\u2019s like, \u2018This is how I can ride a dragon,\u2019\u201d she says. \u201cI just drew the Gauntlet, and suddenly it was \u2014 I was writing it.\u201d",
      "The world of the \"Empyrean\" series is expansive, and only growing with each subsequent book. While \"Fourth Wing\" was primarily set at Basgiath War College, its twisty ending saw Violet's understanding of her continent flipped on its head. She's since encountered new lands, populations and mythical creatures.",

      "But for the sake of organization, she keeps everyone in check via a detailed guide to the world.",
      "\"I keep an extensive bible that tells you who the character is, who their dragon is, what their signet is, what has happened to them, what their body looks like, where their scars are, everything like that,\" Yarros says. \"I keep it all meticulously, jot it down so that my editors don\u2019t, you know, come after me with spatulas.\"",
      "The complicated love interests of the 'Empyrean'",
      "With dragons, signets (essentially, special powers) and war, the \"Empyrean\" series is filled with fantasy elements. But the books are also known for their high-stakes romance and steamy scenes.",
      "Violet's main love interest is Xaden, a rebellion leader with a tendency to keep secrets. Their story has taken a classic enemies-to-lovers arc. Fans swoon over Xaden's intense love, but his at-times questionable decisions make him the series' de facto \"bad boy.\"  With plenty of story ahead, there's a lot of room for things to change.",
      "(Warning: Major spoilers from \"Fourth Wing\" and \"Iron Flame\" ahead.)",
      "The end of \"Iron Flame\" marked a major turning point for Violet and Xaden. In a last ditch effort to save Violet, Xaden turned venin, meaning he gave up part of his soul for power.",
      "Up until this point, the venin had been cast as the series' big bad, the ultimate evil as they suck humans dry of their power. With \"Onyx Storm,\" Yarros faced the challenge of her popular \"bad boy\" actually going evil.",
      "\u201cI think as people, sometimes we see other people, and we think they are the epitome of evil, but no one takes a look to see how they get there and what drives someone to their motivations,\u201d she says. \u201cAnd I think the love of power often corrupts people. And in \u2018Fourth Wing,\u2019 it\u2019s taking a power that turns you venin. So really it\u2019s, yes, he\u2019s turning there, but he did it for such a righteous purpose, and sometimes that still turns us into monsters.\u201d",
      "Yarros says what \u201creally fascinates\u201d her is \u201cknowing where our limitations are as people.\u201d",
      "\"You've been given this gift, but can you wield it for good?\" she says. \"And if not, can you maintain your sanity and your morality?\u201d",
      "\"Iron Flame\" also introduced the potential redemption of Dain Aetos, a more controversial character. When readers first meet Dain, he's Violet\u2019s childhood best friend and a potential love interest. But over the course of the first book, Dain and Violet grow distant, and he eventually betrays her, choosing his life of rule-following over Violet.",

And I think especially when you take 20-year-old kids and you put them in a war college designed to beat the humanity out of them, and she\u2019s seeing him after his first year. So, he makes mistakes.\u201d",
      "Some of those mistakes? Insisting Violet sneak out of the Riders Quadrant for her own safety, using his power to read her memories without her knowledge and reporting what he saw.",
      "\u201cAs someone with chronic illness, we all have someone who tells us to sit down, and, 'You can\u2019t do that, and, 'Be careful.' And that person is not evil. That person is just overprotective, and (Dain) is,\" Yarros says.",
      "\u201cHis biggest mistake is that when his best friend stops speaking to him, he violates her boundaries,\u201d she adds. \u201cBut so does Xaden, and no one seems to give Xaden quite the wrap they give Dain.\u201d",
      "In \"Iron Flame,\" Dain surprises Violet (and some readers) when he rescues her from an interrogation, going against the leadership he had demonstrated ultimate loyalty to.",
      "But Yarros always planned for that twist.",
      "\u201cI already knew when I was writing \u2018Fourth Wing\u2019 and what was happening to Dain, where Dain would go in \u2018Iron Flame,\u2019 and where that scene in the interrogation chamber was going,\u201d she says. \u201cWhen you read the interrogation scene, it reads both ways. So, it reads as though he\u2019s going to kill her, but it also reads as though he\u2019s saying, \u2018If you just trusted me last year, none of this would have happened.\u2019\u201d",
      "Writing 'Onyx Storm' and what's next",
      "Before the \"Empyrean\" series, Yarros had mainly written romances, such as 2019's \"The Last Letter\" and \"Full Measures\" in 2014.",
      "When she started writing \"Fourth Wing,\" she says she was at a point in her life where she felt unwilling to accept accommodations or limitations. She wanted to cram in 12 to 15 hours worth of writing a day, despite her body saying she shouldn't. Writing Violet's adaptation encouraged her to follow suit.",
      "\"It was me kind of talking to myself about what I needed to do to slow down, to protect my own body,\" she says. \"And I think I\u2019m finally starting to listen to it two-and-a-half years later.\"",
      "While \"Fourth Wing\" and \"Iron Flame\" published just seven months apart, \"Onyx Storm\" didn't hit shelves until about 14 months after the second book. Yarros needed a break \u2014\u00a0part of which she spent writing another book.",
      "Yarros says she felt she needed to prove to herself she could write another book, so she went back to her roots and drafted a contemporary romance called \"Variation,\" which published in October 2024.",
      "It was me kind of talking to myself about what I needed to do to slow down, to protect my own body. And I think I\u2019m finally starting to listen to it two-and-a-half years later.\u201d",

      "In keeping with tradition, each host had no idea what jokes the other had written for them until they had to read them live on air. This time, though, Johansson was watching live backstage at Studio 8H.",
      "\"Oh gosh, are we reliving the joke swap?\" Johansson told Jenna Bush Hager on TODAY on Jan. 24 while serving as guest co-host of Jenna & Friends. \"It\u2019s wrong. It\u2019s just wrong, you guys. It got so vulgar.\"",
      "During the segment, Jost could barely contain his laughter as he read the start of Che's lines.",
      "\"My boo, Scarlett Johansson, is so genuinely worried. Hey boo, y'all know Scarlett just celebrated her 40th birthday, which means I'm about to get up out of there!\" Jost read on \"SNL\" before cracking up.",
      "Johansson was asked by \"SNL\" in advance if she wanted to be a part of the bit, and she said she agreed under certain terms.",
      "\"I said, 'I don't want to get canceled or divorced,'\" Johansson said on TODAY. \"Those are my boundaries. And they said, 'OK fine, what if we just tape you listening to the jokes?' I said, 'OK, that seems fine, tame-ish.'\"",
      "It turned out not to be so tame-ish, as one joke involved Johansson's genitalia.",
      "\"Honestly Jenna, I felt like it was 'To Catch a Predator' when the lights kind of came on me and suddenly there was a whole audience, and I was there with, thankfully, a very stiff cocktail,\" Johansson said of her reaction.",
      "\"The jokes got \u2014 they were so vulgar,\" she said. \"That's genuine shock.\"",
      "Jost also affirmed earlier this week that his wife was not acting when she gave that reaction.",
      "\"Scarlett was genuinely so shocked,\" Jost told Jimmy Fallon on \"The Tonight Show\" Jan. 20. \"I was obviously surprised by everything, but they gave her a heads-up.\"",
      "Even for an \"SNL\" regular like Johansson, who has hosted the show six times and made multiple other appearances, Che's lines, as read by Jost, were an eye opener.",
      "\"Emma Stone, who was also there because we were doing a five-timers thing for Martin Short, turned to me and she went, 'That was not OK. That was not OK,'\" Johansson said. \"My heart was racing. My eyes were watering. My hands were like this (shaking). It was surreal.\"",
      "During the \"SNL\" segment, Che also had to read jokes written by Jost.",
      "\"(Jost) writes also for Michael Che, but I honestly feel like Michael is trying to get us permanently removed, I don't know,\" Johansson joked. \"He has a vendetta against us. Michael, why?! What'd I do to you, Michael?\"",
      "Jenna suggested a way that Johansson can get her revenge. She invited Johansson to return on Jenna & Friends with Che as a guest, and they can do a teleprompter swap.",
      "\"I'm all for that,\" Johansson said."

Egglesfield had previously been treated twice for testicular cancer, according to City of Hope.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s not the hand that you\u2019ve been dealt because you can\u2019t change that. It\u2019s how you play the cards that counts,\u201d Egglesfield wrote in the caption of his post, saying he found the quote from an interview he did when he was 25. \"It has served me well throughout my life including recently.\"",
      "He said the beginning of 2025 hasn't been the easiest, but it has been \"another opportunity to decide who I choose to be in the face of uncertainty and challenges in my most recent cancer diagnosis.\"",
      "\"Thankfully, we caught my prostate cancer early and after a year of doing a lot of research and talking to quite a few health care professionals, I elected to be proactive and have surgery,\" he said.",
      "The actor shared a photo of what appeared to be several scars on his abdomen, and he thanked his medical team for helping him during \"this scary time.\"",
      "\"Hopefully this is a reminder to everyone that you\u2019re not alone with whatever you\u2019re facing and that it\u2019s important to advocate for yourself and your health which includes checkups, seeking information and asking for help when you need it!\" he said.",

      "A prostate-specific antigen (PSA) test is a blood test that measures the levels of a protein that is produced by prostate cells, according to City of Hope. An elevated PSA level may be a warning sign of cancer.",
      "Symptoms of prostate cancer include trouble urinating, decreased force in the stream of urine, blood in the urine, blood in the semen, bone pain, losing weight without trying and erectile dysfunction, according to Mayo Clinic.",
      "In a follow-up post on Jan. 23, Egglesfield wrote \"things are on track\" and he's feeling positive after surgery, but added, \"I go through these phases where I\u2019m feeling good and then other phases where this is all so overwhelming.\"",
      "\"I keep having to remind myself that it\u2019s okay to feel what I\u2019m feeling and to let it be, knowing that this is part of the healing and that without it, healing can be stunted,\" he wrote.",
      "Egglesfield, whose credits also include TV's \"Rizzoli & Isles\" and \"The Client List\" and the film \"Something Borrowed,\" was first diagnosed with testicular cancer in 2006, months after starting his breakout role as Josh Madden on \"All My Children.\"",
      "\"It was the most uncertain, unsettling and scary time in my life,\" he told Jejune Magazine in 2019. \"I was diagnosed at 33, had surgery, radiation treatment then subsequent checkups every three months for a year, at which point they found another tumor, which required another surgery. For five years after that second surgery, I had to go for constant checkups which included chest X-rays, blood tests, and CT scans, to check for further tumor growths.\"",
      "According to Mayo Clinic, symptoms of testicular cancer can include a lump or swelling in either testicle, a feeling of heaviness in the scrotum, a dull ache in the lower belly or groin, sudden swelling in the scrotum, pain or discomfort in a testicle or the scrotum, enlargement or tenderness of the breast tissue, and back pain.",
      "\"I always say I never wish cancer on anyone, but I am grateful for the experience because it forced me to have to develop character, courage, patience and hope on a whole new level,\" he told Jejune Magazine. \"It also made me realize that I had not accomplished what I had set out to do in the world, and that if I made it through the experience that I would not let anything stop me in attaining what I\u2019m committed to, which is continuing to build a successful acting career and to make a big positive impact in the world.\""

Her co-star Jamie Lee Curtis also failed to pick up a nomination.",

That couldn't sway voters, though, who didn't reward her with an Academy Award nomination.",

      "Meanwhile, the terrorists, led by Markus (Michael Malarkey), disguise themselves as HVAC workers and carry 14 canisters of the K.X. chemical weapon that Rose was forced to create into the UN building.",
      "Markus and his men then kill two officers and change into their uniforms. Rose, who is helping Mosely identify the terrorists, spots Markus and alerts the police that he has now changed into a UNDSS (United Nations Department of Safety and Security) uniform.",
      "Markus escapes the building and takes the 15th canister with him while the others are concealed on the roof. Police find the 14 other cases of K.X. and work to remove them while Markus visits Sloane, the girlfriend of his cousin Tom\u00e1s, and tries to trick her into helping him escape the U.S.",
      "As Peter and Rose search for Markus, he reveals to her that he broke into the UN and made a deal with Jacob to find her. They go to Sloane\u2019s apartment and she uses the universal distress signal to hint that Markus is in the room with her. Peter enters the room to find Markus holding a knife to Sloane\u2019s throat as Rose runs into an HVAC worker. She realizes that Markus put the final K.X. canister in the apartment building\u2019s air conditioning unit.",
      "Peter shoots and kills Markus before he and Rose rush to evacuate everyone from the building in just six minutes. They find sulfuric acid and ethanol and mix it together to start a fire. The blaze ignites just in time to automatically close the vents and stop the K.X. from spreading.",
      "Peter then tells Rose that he has to turn himself into Catherine. He takes her hand and says, \u201cAs long as I\u2019m a Night Agent, people are going to try to use you to get to me. Because they know that your safety, that you, mean everything to me. And as long as you come searching for me, you\u2019ll be at risk.\u201d",
      "She says she is tired of running and agrees with him. \u201cI just want a normal life,\u201d she replies.",
      "He asks her to promise she won\u2019t wait to hear from him and that she won\u2019t try to come find him. He asks her to forget about him. Peter then surrenders to Catherine and is later interrogated by her and Mosely.",
      "Where do all the \u2018Night Agent\u2019 characters end up at the end Season 2?",
      "Jacob is shown arriving at a political campaign event. He meets with presidential nominee Governor Hagan, who is revealed to be the man at the start of the episode that he'd met eight years ago. Jacob reminds Hagan he works for him and hands the governor the information Peter had stolen.",
      "Elsewhere, Noor (Arienne Mandi) and her mom are granted asylum, given social security numbers and handed a check to compensate for the death of Noor's brother. Noor is later shown working at a library, adapting to her new life. Rose visits her and they have lunch. Rose shares that she returned to California and is focusing on her new life without Peter. She says it is better to not know where he is when suddenly she, Noor and others get alerts on their phones.",
      "Catherine meets Peter and releases him from his cell. As they walk, she informs him that over the past two weeks the other presidential nominee, Patrick Knox, withdrew from the race just two weeks before the election. The media discovered that Know spearheaded the development of K.X. years ago thanks to the information Peter stole. Catherine says Peter aided and abetted the swinging of a presidential election and now the new president will be under Jacob\u2019s thumb.",
      "They go to the White House and Catherine shares that years ago she was asked to find a mole in the Pentagon which led her to Peter\u2019s father. She says his father spent the rest of his life trying to atone for being a traitor and that Peter now has that opportunity. She presents him with a new mission: figure out how Hagan and Jacob are connected.",
      "To do so, she says that Peter needs to act as a double agent and do whatever Jacob asks. She explains that the mission is \u201ctop secret\u201d and separate from Night Action, so no one will know about it. If Peter agrees, they will wipe his record clean.",
      "He swiftly accepts and stares at the White House, awaiting Jacob\u2019s call.\u00a0Enter: Season 3 of \"The Night Agent.\"",

      "\u201cEmilia Perez\u201d is quickly becoming an awards show favorite, raking in four Golden Globee wins and 13 Oscar nominations \u2014 plus SAG Award nods, too.",
      "The sweeping Spanish-language operatic musical defies easy categorization, as star Karla Sof\u00eda Gasc\u00f3n told Netflix\u2019s Tudum blog in January.",
      "\u201cYou have an action movie that\u2019s not an action movie, a drama that\u2019s not a drama, a comedy that\u2019s not a comedy,\u201d she said.",
      "Gasc\u00f3n plays dual roles in the gritty film: first, that of Juan \u201cManitas\u201d Del Monte, a murderous Mexican gang leader who dreams of living openly as a woman.",
      "The cartel kingpin recruits a lawyer, Rita (Zoe Salda\u00f1a), to help her fake her own death and secretly obtain gender-affirming care \u2014 and at last, her new, authentic self, Emilia P\u00e9rez, is born.",
      "However, Emilia cannot completely escape her violent origins, and when her wife, Jessi (Selena Gomez) comes back into the picture, past and present collide in tragic ways.",
      "Some critics and filmmakers have raved about the Spanish-language musical, with Variety calling the movie \u201cdazzling\u201d and director Michael Mann calling it a \u201ccontemporary masterpiece.\u201d",
      "However, many viewers have criticized the movie for its lack of cultural authenticity.",
      "Some have asked why the movie, which is helmed by a French director, Jacques Audiard, was not filmed in Mexico despite being set there, and features no Mexican leads. Per the Hollywood Reporter, most of the movie was filmed on a sound stage in Paris, save for five days of exterior shots in Mexico. Others have criticized the language skills of Gomez, who is not fluent in Spanish.",
      "And the movie\u2019s approach to transgender representation is considered, by some, \u201ca step backward,\u201d as GLAAD put it.",
      "Keep reading to learn more about some of the controversies surrounding \u201cEmilia P\u00e9rez.\u201d",
      "The director says he \u2018didn\u2019t study much\u2019 about Mexico while making the film",
      "Some viewers have questioned why the film was directed by Jacques Audiard, who is French and doesn\u2019t speak Spanish, he confirmed to the New York Times.",
      "Audiard also faced criticism when he said did not do much research on Mexico while making the film.",
      "\u201cHow much did you have to study Mexico to be able to make this film?\u201d an interviewer asks him in a clip making the rounds on social media.",
      "\u201cI didn\u2019t study much,\u201d Audiard says through a translator, according to a translation by NBC News. \u201cWhat I had to understand, I knew,\u201d he says in French.",
      "\u201cEmilia P\u00e9rez\u201d won four Golden Globes on Jan. 5, including two best picture awards in the musical/comedy and non-English language categories, which sparked controversy online.",
      "\u201cFrenchman \u2014 who speaks no Spanish or English \u2014 wins award for France for a film in Spanish, based in Mexico but filmed in France, about a Mexican cartel leader,\u201d Mexican American journalist Tom\u00e1s Mier wrote on X the day after the Golden Globes.",
      "Mexican actor and singer Mauricio Mart\u00ednez also criticized Audiard\u2019s self-admitted lack of research about Mexico for the film, and slammed the movie in an X post for \u201cportraying a Mexico full of stereotypes, ignorance (and) lack of respect.\u201d",
      "Film critic Ana Iribe also took issue with the movie\u2019s lack of research and the way it portrayed violence in Mexico.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s the lack of info that makes it insensitive: we don\u2019t want a white French director to portray the violence we have to face every day,\u201d she wrote on X. \u201cI\u2019m not opposed to foreign artists making films about other countries, as long as they have good research, and EMILIA P\u00c9REZ didn\u2019t have that.\u201d",
      "The movie is set in Mexico but most of the cast is not Mexican",
      "While \u201cEmilia P\u00e9rez\u201d takes place in Mexico, the film\u2019s leads are not Mexican.",
      "Karla Sof\u00eda Gasc\u00f3n, who plays Emilia, is from Spain, Zoe Salda\u00f1a, who plays Rita, is from the U.S. with Dominican and Puerto Rican ancestry, and Selena Gomez is from the U.S. with Mexican and Italian heritage.",
      "In one notable exception, supporting cast member Adriana Paz, who plays Emilia\u2019s lover, Epifan\u00eda, is from Mexico.",
      "Paz defended the movie in an interview with IndieWire.",
      "\u201cI\u2019ve heard people saying it\u2019s offensive to Mexico. I really want to know why, because I didn\u2019t feel that way. And I have questioned some people that I trust, not just as artists but as people, and they don\u2019t feel that way, so I am trying to understand,\u201d Paz said, adding that she feels the movie\u2019s director is a \u201cgenius.\u201d",
      "In November, casting director Carla Hool said during a SAG-AFTRA panel she and her team \u201cdid a big search\u201d for actors across Mexico, the United States, Spain and \u201call Latin America\u201d but did not find any Mexican actors suitable for the main roles.",
      "\u201cWe wanted to keep it really authentic but at the end of the day, the best actors who embodied these characters are the ones that are right here,\u201d she said, gesturing to Gasc\u00f3n, Gomez and Salda\u00f1a on the panel beside her. \u201cSo we had to figure out how to adjust authenticity \u2026 with the accents, and them not necessarily being native Mexican.\u201d",
      "The lack of Mexican stars in the movie was met with criticism on social media.",
      "One X user called the film \u201cridiculous\u201d and said it was a \u201cEuropean movie with hollywood stars that pretend to be mexican, with harmful stereotypes.\u201d",
      "Another X user criticized the movie\u2019s lack of Mexican stars and called the film \u201ca parody, a mockery of Mexico.\u201d",
      "Mexican director and cinematographer Rodrigo Prieto also questioned why the film did not include more Mexican people behind the camera.",
      "\u201cWhy not hire a Mexican production designer, costume designer, or at least some consultants?\u201d he said in a November Deadline interview. \u201cYes, they had dialogue coaches but I was offended that such a story was portrayed in a way that felt so inauthentic.\u201d",
      "He also said the film included mistakes that could have been avoided if more Mexican people were involved in the production.",
      "\u201cYou would never have a jail sign that read \u2018C\u00e1rcel,\u2019\u201d he said of a sign shown on a building in the movie. \u201cIt would be \u2018Penitenciaria.\u2019 It\u2019s just the details, and that shows me that nobody that knew was involved. And it didn\u2019t even matter. That was very troubling to me.\u201d",
      "Selena Gomez\u2019s Spanish-language acting has been criticized",
      "Controversy arose over Selena Gomez\u2019s Spanish language skills in \u201cEmilia P\u00e9rez.\u201d\u00a0Gomez\u2019s character is Mexican and grew up in the U.S., with family there.",
      "Mexican actor and comedian Eugenio Derbez made headlines in December when he called Gomez\u2019s Spanish \u201cindefensible\u201d in a clip from the \u201cHablando de Cine Con\u201d podcast shared on TikTok.",
      "\u201cI feel like she doesn\u2019t know what she\u2019s saying,\u201d host Gaby Meza also said on the podcast. \u201cIf she doesn\u2019t know what she\u2019s saying, she can\u2019t give her acting any nuance.\u201d",
      "Gomez responded to these criticisms in a comment on the TikTok post.",
      "\u201cI understand where you are coming from..I\u2019m sorry I did the best I could with the time I was given,\u201d she wrote.",
      "Amid backlash, Derbez then issued an apology to the \u201cOnly Murders in the Building\u201d star.",
      "\u201cDear Selena, I truly apologize for my careless comments \u2014 they are indefensible and go against everything I stand for,\u201d he wrote on TikTok. \u201cAs Latinos, we should always support one another. There\u2019s no excuse. I was wrong, and I deeply admire your career and your heart.\u201d",
      "Gomez grew up speaking Spanish but \u201clost\u201d the language when she started taking mainly English-speaking acting jobs at age 7, she told NPR in November.",
      "She said in an interview at the Cannes Film Festival that she is \u201cnot as happy with what I feel like I could have done in Spanish,\u201d but said she hoped \u201cit doesn\u2019t hinder my performance.\u201d",
      "Some people have defended Gomez\u2019s use of Spanish in the film.",
      "Annie Abbott, a professor of Spanish at the University of Illinois, argued that the criticism of Gomez mirrors the judgment sometimes experienced by heritage speakers \u2014 i.e., people with a Latino cultural and familial background who are not formally fluent in Spanish \u2014 from native Spanish speakers.",
      "\u201cGomez is critiqued for experiencing the typical challenges of heritage speakers while being held to native speaker standards \u2014 a no-win situation that a rapidly growing number of Americans can relate to,\u201d Abbott wrote in a recent opinion piece for The Fulcrum.",
      "A 2023 study from the Pew Research Center found that 24% of U.S. Latino adults say they carry on a conversation in Spanish \u201ca little or not at all.\u201d",
      "According to the study, 54% of U.S. Latinos who say that only speak a little Spanish \u201csay another Hispanic person has made them feel bad for it.\u201d",
      "However, one commenter on X responding to Abbott argued that the issue wasn\u2019t with Gomez\u2019s language ability or identity, but with the fact that her Spanish skills did not match the demands of her role in \u201cEmilia P\u00e9rez.\u201d",
      "\u201cThe author misses the point completely. This has nothing to do with racism. Selena Gomez should be proud of her Spanish,\u201d the X user wrote. \u201cBut her accent doesn\u2019t match the character that she plays in the movie. And that\u2019s very distracting for viewers who know exactly how Mexicans speak.\u201d",
      "Director Audiard has addressed issues with the actors\u2019 varying Spanish accents in the movie.",
      "\u201cThroughout the shoot we had problems, for instance, with Selena\u2019s accent in Spanish. She is Texan. Karla Sof\u00eda Gasc\u00f3n speaks Castilian Spanish. She\u2019s from Madrid,\u201d he told The New York Times in November. \u201cGiven that I don\u2019t speak Spanish, the nuances of the Mexican accent versus the Castilian were lost on me. We had all these problems with accents, but we fixed them in the edit. We did a lot of dubbing.\u201d",
      "Some argue the movie perpetuates harmful trans stereotypes",
      "Some viewers have criticized the movie\u2019s depiction of trans people and the trans experience.",
      "GLAAD, the LGBTQ advocacy group formerly known as the Gay & Lesbian Alliance Against Defamation, called \u201cEmilia P\u00e9rez\u201d a \u201cstep backward for trans representation\u201d and said the film \u201crecycles the trans stereotypes, tropes, and clich\u00e9s of the not-so-distant past.\u201d",
      "Some critics say the film perpetuates the harmful narrative that transitioning is a form of lying. Emilia keeps her past a secret from her wife, posing as Manitas\u2019 aunt.",
      "\u201cIts protagonist\u2019s transition is seen as duplicitous and dishonest, an act of manipulation through which she continues her selfish attempts to control those that she abandoned,\u201d Mattie Lucas wrote in a November review for Trans | Cendental Cinema.",
      "\u201cNot only is her transition portrayed as more of a disguise to evade the authorities, it\u2019s an act of continued selfishness that ends up destroying not only her own life, but the lives of those she loves,\u201d Lucas added.",
      "Film critic Juan Barquin called the movie \u201ca regressive picture masquerading as progressive\u201d and criticized the way masculinity and femininity were portrayed in the film.",
      "\u201cAny time Emilia \u2018reverts\u2019 to her \u2018old ways,\u2019 Gascon lowers her vocal register as if to equate masculinity with evil and femininity with good,\u201d Barquin wrote for Little White Lies magazine.",
      "Reviewer David Opie echoed this criticism, pointing to a scene when Emilia throws her wife Jessi onto a bed \u201cand threatens her using the same low, masculine voice she used pre-surgery.\u201d",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s as if the so-called \u2018evil\u2019 in Emilia is a separate entity, the \u2018man\u2019 she was raised to be, rather than her being the same person going through a transitional journey,\u201d Opie wrote for Yahoo! Movies.",
      "Several critics and viewers, including Barquin, also took issue with one line from the movie in which Emilia describes herself as \u201chalf male, half female.\u201d",
      "Some transgender commentators shared counterpoints to these arguments and defended the film\u2019s representation of its trans protagonist.",
      "Journalist and critic Mey Rude, who is trans, rejected the argument that Emilia uses a \u201cmale voice\u201d in moments of anger.",
      "\u201cShe simply is a woman with a lower register, and when she gets angry, it shows,\u201d Rude wrote in a piece for Out Magazine. \u201cIf you listen to the scenes where Gasc\u00f3n is playing the character as Manitas, you can clearly hear a difference in the voice she uses in the fight scene with Gomez.\u201d",
      "Rude also argues that the film does not lean into \u201charmful trans tropes about trans women being deceptive or liars.\u201d",
      "\u201cEmilia isn\u2019t a liar because she\u2019s trans, she\u2019s a liar because she\u2019s a bad person and she\u2019s in many ways, afraid,\u201d she wrote. \u201cThe movie shows that if you live a lie, whether you\u2019re trans or not, your lies will catch up with you.\u201d",
      "Writer Julie River, who is trans, argues in a piece for Out Front magazine that Emilia is portrayed sensitively as a \u201cmorally complex\u201d character who makes \u201ca desperate attempt to atone for her sins in her former life.\u201d",
      "River also argues that Emilia hides her transition not because the movie is painting trans people as duplicitous, but because as a cartel leader, Emilia \u201cwas hardly surrounded by people who were easy to come out to or who were likely to accept her transition.\u201d",
      "\u201cI may be amongst the minority in the LGBTQ+ community doing this, but I\u2019ll be applauding it for every award it wins,\u201d River wrote.",
      "Gasc\u00f3n herself has pushed back at people calling her \u201cEmilia P\u00e9rez\u201d character transphobic.",
      "\u201cThere are some that say, \u2018I want to see LGBTQ or trans characters outdoing what people do in real life,\u2019 but we do bad things too ... I don\u2019t understand the criticism about the representation of portraying Emilia P\u00e9rez this way,\u201d she told Vanity Fair in January. \u201cThe reality is that the trans experience is not the same for everybody \u2014 my trans experience is different from somebody else\u2019s.\u201d",
      "\u201cIf you don\u2019t like it, go and make your own movie,\u201d Gasc\u00f3n also said. \u201cGo create the representation you want to see for your community.\u201d"

Each person then had to lie down in a coffin and await their fate.

      "Karina Ariev, Danielle Gilboa, Naama Levy and Liri Albag will be transferred into Israeli custody in exchange for Palestinian prisoners, Abu Obeida, the spokesperson for Hamas' military wing, the Al-Qassam Brigades, said in a Telegram post.",
      "All four hostages are alive, Basem Naim, a senior Hamas official, told NBC News in a separate statement.",
      "He added that 200 prisoners would be released, including 120 sentenced to life and 80 who had been handed long sentences. He did not any provide further details.",
      "Israel has not confirmed the names of those set to be released, but if successful, it will be the second such exchange as part of a complex ceasefire deal between Israel and Hamas, which came into effect last Sunday and signaled a pause in 15 months of bitter fighting and Israeli aerial bombardment in Gaza.",
      "As part of the truce, which saw the first people released on both sides last Sunday, Hamas will release one civilian hostage for every 30 Palestinians held in Israeli custody and one female Israeli soldier for 50 detainees heading the other way.",
      "In a sign of the fluidity and fragility of the negotiations, Hamas said Monday that it would next release hostages held in Gaza on Saturday,\u00a0after one of its officials had initially suggested they would be released a day later than expected.",
      "The release last Sunday of the first three Israeli hostages and 90 Palestinian prisoners, all women and children, faced a last-minute delay, with the Israeli government saying they had not been provided with the names of the hostages due to be released.",
      "The first three Israeli hostages released were Romi Gonen, Doron Steinbrecher and Emily Damari, a dual British citizen. Hamas has said it plans to release 33 hostages over six weeks while Israeli forces will gradually withdraw from the Gaza Strip.",
      "Fighting in Gaza\u00a0began Oct. 7, 2023, when the Hamas carried out a terrorist attack on Israel in which 1,200 people were killed and around 250 taken hostage. Israel then launched an air and land assault on Gaza,\u00a0killing more than 47,000 people, most of them civilians, according to health officials in the enclave.",

      "For three months prior to Hamas\u2019 terrorist attack, Karina Ariev, 20, had warned her family of impending war, her sister Sasha Ariev, told the Christian Broadcasting Company, days after her sister was taken.",
      "\u201cThey knew something, the girls who were the eyes of the country,\u201d Sasha Ariev said, adding that her sister called her on the morning of the Hamas attack. Sasha Ariev said her sibling told her that she could hear shooting and screaming in the background and received a message from her sister telling her \u201cthe terrorists are here.\u201d",
      "Footage circulated on the day Ariev was kidnapped showed her in a Jeep, her face bloodied and her hands tied together. In January last year, Hamas released a video showing that she was still alive.",

      "Orly Gilboa said she heard from Daniella Gilboa on the morning of the attack but did not understand that the explosions her daughter described were inside her base. She only fully appreciated the danger her daughter was in after she received a message reading \u201cpray for me.\u201d",
      "During the first night after she was taken, when the mother said she was unable to identify her daughter in any footage and she feared the worst. The following day, Daniella Gilboa\u2019s younger sister Noam Gilboa identified her in videos that were widely circulated, recognizing her from her ponytail and pajamas.",
      "According to Shira Albag, her daughter Liri Albag, 19, enjoyed traveling and taking photographs. Speaking at a public event last autumn, Shira Albag told the audience that \u201cwe are all living in the shadow of the kidnapping.\u201d",

    "summary": "Her marriage had been deteriorating for decades \u2014 marred, she said, by health problems and threats of violence.",
    "story": [
      "Her marriage had been deteriorating for decades\u00a0\u2014\u00a0marred, she said, by health problems and threats of violence. But when the woman filed for divorce, French courts deemed her at fault for refusing to have sex with her husband.",
      "The case ignited a debate about attitudes toward consent and women\u2019s rights in France, which advocates said highlighted the need for legal reform around nonconsensual sex within a marriage.",
      "On Thursday, the 69-year-old French woman, known by her initials, H.W., won her appeal in Europe\u2019s top human rights court, which unanimously sided with her, saying that refusal to engage in sexual relations could not be considered grounds for fault in divorce.",
      "\u201cThe very existence of such a marital obligation ran counter to sexual freedom,\u201d including the right to bodily autonomy and the government\u2019s obligation to prevent sexual and domestic violence, the European Court of Human Rights said in its ruling.",
      "\u201cThis victory is for all women who, like me, find themselves confronted with aberrant and unjust judicial decisions, calling into question their body integrity and their right to privacy,\u201d the woman said in a statement Thursday.",
      "H.W. and her husband were married in 1984; they subsequently had four children. After ceasing sexual relations, she petitioned for divorce in 2012.",
      "In 2019, a French appeals court in Versailles cited her refusal to have sex as evidence that she was solely at fault for the divorce. When she appealed the decision to the Court of Cassation, France's highest court, her bid was dismissed without any explanation.",
      "Under French law, \u201cdivorce pour faute\u201d or fault-based divorce can allow the aggrieved spouse to claim damages and compensation, financial or otherwise, from the spouse at fault.",
      "The battle dragged on for more than a decade, as successive French courts upheld the ruling. When H.W. exhausted all legal avenues in France, she brought her case to the European Court of Human Rights in 2021, arguing that the French court's decision was an unjust intrusion into her private life and a violation of her physical integrity.",
      "The European Court of Human Rights, based in Strasbourg, France, adjudicates human rights violations by 46 member states of the Council of Europe, a body older than the European Union and its predecessor, the European Economic Community.",
      "The international court Thursday said it could not identify \u201cany reason capable of justifying this interference by the public authorities in the area of sexuality.\u201d It emphasized that under French law, the idea of \u201cmarital duties\u201d had ignored the issue of consent in sexual relations.",
      "H.W.'s lawyer Lilia Mhissen celebrated the legal victory, saying she hoped the decision would mark \u201ca turning point in the fight for women\u2019s rights in France.\"",
      "\u201cThis decision marks the abolition of the marital duty and the archaic, canonical vision of the family,\u201d she said in a statement.",
      "Mhissen added that \u201cit is now imperative that France ... take concrete measures to eradicate this rape culture and promote a true culture of consent and mutual respect.\u201d",
      "In response to the ECHR\u2019s ruling, French Justice Minister Gerald Darmanin told reporters Thursday, \u201cObviously, we will go in the direction of history and we will adapt our law.\u201d",
      "For many, the ruling brought back into the spotlight the landmark verdict in the case of Gis\u00e8le Pelicot, whose ex-husband, Dominique P\u00e9licot, was convicted of drugging her and arranging for dozens of men to rape her over a decade.",
      "Following that historic trial, the French Parliament released a report recommending that the concept of nonconsent should be included in the legal definition of rape. It reiterated that consent must be freely given and can be withdrawn at any time.",
      "While some women\u2019s rights advocates welcomed the ECHR\u2019s ruling in H.W.'s case, others said it highlighted the need for urgent legal reform to ensure protection against sexual violence in the marital context.",
      "Anne-C\u00e9cile Mailfert, president of the Women\u2019s Foundation, praised the work of women\u2019s organizations in advocating for legal reform, but said it was \u201ca long road towards the liberation of women towards the free use of their bodies.\u201d",
      "\u201cI welcome the decision of the ECHR in the face of an unfair and anachronistic decision by the Court of Appeal,\u201d French Equality Minister Aurore Berg\u00e9 wrote in a post on X.",
      "\u201cNo woman belongs to her husband. Women are free. Free or not to have sexual relations,\u201d she added."

    "summary": "Experts dispute President Donald Trump\u2019s claims that the Panama Canal is controlled by China and overcharging U.S. ships.",
    "story": [
      "A quarter-century after the U.S. handed control of the Panama Canal to Panama, President Donald Trump wants to take it back.",
      "Early this month, Trump suggested he would consider using military force to regain control of the canal from Panama, one of the U.S.'s closest allies in Latin America, describing it as \u201cvital\u201d for national security.",
      "But his gripe is more with U.S. rival China, which he says is \u201coperating\u201d a critical waterway that serves as a transit point for almost 5% of the world's maritime trade.",
      "\u201cWe didn\u2019t give it to China,\u201d Trump said Monday during his inaugural address. \u201cWe gave it to Panama, and we\u2019re taking it back.\u201d",
      "Panama strongly rebuked Trump\u2019s comments, with President Jos\u00e9 Ra\u00fal Mulino saying the canal \u201cis and will continue to be Panama\u2019s.\u201d",
      "Mulino also rejected Trump\u2019s claim that China controls the canal.",
      "\u201cThere is no presence of any nation in the world that interferes with our administration,\u201d he said Monday in a statement in Spanish.",
      "China said it agreed with the Panamanian president, saying the canal \u201cis not under the direct or indirect control of any power.\u201d\u201cChina does not participate in the management or operation of the canal and has never interfered in matters related to it,\u201d Foreign Ministry spokesperson Mao Ning said at a regular briefing in Beijing on Wednesday. \u201cWe have always respected Panama\u2019s sovereignty over the canal and recognized it as a permanently neutral international waterway.\u201d",
      "The neutrality of the nearly 50-mile canal, through which nearly 15,000 ships transit each year, is enshrined in Panama\u2019s Constitution and is enforced by the autonomous Panama Canal Authority.",
      "\u201cThat\u2019s what has made the Panama Canal so successful, and why it\u2019s still one of the main commercial arteries of the world \u2014 because of this neutrality,\u201d said Beatriz Garc\u00eda Nice, a Latin America program associate at the Wilson Center, a nonpartisan research organization in Washington.",
      "The United States began building the canal in 1904, the year after Panama gained independence from Colombia with U.S. support. The project was completed in 1914 as part of efforts to cut the transit time for U.S. commercial and military ships that previously had to go all the way to the tip of South America just to get from one U.S. coast to the other.",
      "By the mid-20th century, control of the canal had become a source of tension between the U.S. and Panama, erupting into anti-American riots in 1964 that resulted in the deaths of four U.S. soldiers and more than 20 Panamanians.",
      "On Dec. 31, 1999, the U.S. relinquished control of the canal to Panama under a treaty negotiated by President Jimmy Carter and ratified by the Senate in 1978 in what Trump has called \u201ca terrible mistake.\u201d The U.S. retained the permanent right to defend the canal against any threat to its neutrality.",
      "Several international companies that now manage ports along the canal, including the Seattle-based SSA Marine, which operates a cargo terminal on the Atlantic side, won their rights in bidding processes that were described as fair and nondiscriminatory by U.S. officials at the time.\u00a0In 1997, Hutchison Ports, a private company based in the Chinese territory of Hong Kong that manages 53 ports around the world, won the rights to manage two ports \u2014 Balboa on the Pacific side and Crist\u00f3bal on the Atlantic side.",
      "The Trump administration argues that China could use those ports to turn the Panama Canal into a \u201cchoke point\u201d against the U.S.",
      "\u201cIf these companies control both ends of that canal in a time of conflict, and the Chinese tell them, \u2018Shut it down and don\u2019t let the U.S. go through there,\u2019 we\u2019ve got a big, big problem,\u201d Secretary of State Marco Rubio said last week during his Senate confirmation hearing, \u201ca big economic problem and a big national security and defense problem.\u201d",
      "Though at opposite ends of the canal, the ports are not gateways to the waterway \u2014 ships do not have to pass through them to enter the canal. Instead, the ports mostly serve as places to handle cargo.",
      "\u201cIt would take an act of war, effectively, for the Chinese to shut it down,\u201d said Christopher Sabatini, a senior research fellow for Latin America at Chatham House, a London-based think tank. \u201cYou can\u2019t ask a port company to shut down a canal.\u201d",
      "Trump also claimed that the U.S. has been \u201covercharged\u201d for its ships to sail through the canal, saying that Panama was in \u201cviolation\u201d of the treaty.\u201cAmerican ships are being severely overcharged and not treated fairly in any way, shape or form. And that includes the United States Navy,\u201d he said in the inaugural address.",
      "Because the waterway, which is fed by a freshwater lake, is seeing its water levels decrease because of a warming climate, the Panama Canal Authority has limited the number of ships that can pass through daily and raised fees for all ships regardless of the country they belong to.",
      "\u201cThe fees have been raised across the board in a professional, transparent manner, nothing less, nothing more,\u201d Sabatini said. \u201cIt is simply like any different toll that is managed professionally and independently.\u201d",
      "Sabatini and Nice say the growing accusations could hurt U.S. relations with Panama, where China has been making inroads.",
      "\u201cWhat this is doing is questioning even further if the United States is a reliable partner, especially in face of the Chinese influence that is already in the region,\u201d Nice said.",
      "As for Trump\u2019s threat to use military force to retake the canal, Sabatini said such a drastic action would require Senate approval.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s an international treaty, it was approved by the U.S. Senate,\u201d he said. \u201cThis is not something that the executive can unilaterally decide to revoke.\u201d",
      "Still, the Panama Canal Authority has launched an audit of Hutchison Ports, which Nice said was an attempt to placate Washington.",
      "\u201cThey are trying to not confront one of your biggest allies and are saying, \u2018If this is going to help and sort of bring down the temperature, then we will do it,\u2019\u201d she said.",
      "Hutchison Ports said it was fully cooperating with the audit and remained committed \u201cto excellence and ethics in each of our operations,\u201d Bloomberg News reported, citing a statement. The company did not respond to an NBC News request for comment.",
      "Trump also vastly overstated the number of Americans killed during construction of the canal, saying 38,000 lives were lost. About 5,600 out of 56,000 workers are believed to have died from injury or disease during the U.S. phase of construction, according to the Panama Canal Authority, most of whom were from the Caribbean.",
      "For many Panamanians, the canal\u2019s independence is a matter of pride.",
      "\u201cThe Canal was not a concession from anyone. It was the result of generational struggles that culminated in 1999,\u201d President Mulino said. \u201cSince then until now, for 25 years, without interruption, we have managed and expanded it responsibly to serve the world and its commerce, including the United States.\u201d"

    "summary": "From tariffs and the Middle East to the climate crisis and world health, here's the global reaction to President Trump\u2019s first policy moves of his second term.",
    "story": [
      "In a freewheeling Inauguration Day of speeches, casual remarks and formal balls, President Donald Trump wasted no time trying to shape the world in his unmistakable image.",
      "Unlike four years ago, when his term began in a flurry of unpreparedness, this time Trump let fly with a series of actions and statements that seek to scrub many of former President Joe Biden\u2019s decisions and replace them with Trump's own stark imprimatur.",
      "From tariffs, TikTok and the Middle East to the climate crisis and world health, here are the headlines of Trump\u2019s foreign policy moves during the first 24 hours of a term set to last 1,461 days \u2014 and how the world reacted.",
      "Russia",
      "The president previously claimed he would end the Russia-Ukraine war within 24 hours of taking office. \u201cThis is only half a day. I have another half a day left,\u201d he said Monday.",
      "That idea sparked alarm in Europe, which worries that Trump could force Ukraine into a negotiation that favors Russian President Vladimir Putin. Trump has more recently stretched this timeline to as long as six months, which some have taken as a signal of support for Ukraine.",
      "On Monday, Trump appeared to criticize Putin \u2014 one of the authoritarian leaders he has spoken warmly about in the past, saying he is \u201cnot doing so well.\u201d",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s not making him look very good,\u201d Trump said of how the war is going for Putin, adding that he was \u201cdestroying Russia by not making a deal.\u201d",
      "When asked Tuesday about Trump\u2019s comments, Russian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov said that \u201cwe respect the choice of the American people\u201d and that \u201cTrump has also repeatedly given reason to say that they also respect the choice of the Russian people.\u201d",
      "Middle East",
      "On the nascent ceasefire between Israel and Hamas, something his team helped broker, the president said he was \u201cnot confident\u201d that the truce would last, adding: \u201cThat\u2019s not our war. It\u2019s their war.\u201d",
      "U.S. officials credit Trump's Middle East peace envoy, Steve Witkoff,\u00a0with helping get that deal over the line.",
      "On Gaza \u2014 where Israeli airstrikes have displaced most of the population and killed more than 46,000 people, according to local authorities \u2014 he hinted at his real estate background.",
      "\u201cGaza is like a massive demolition site. That place has really got to be rebuilt in a different way,\u201d he said, adding that \u201cit\u2019s a phenomenal location on the sea, best weather. ... Some beautiful things could be done with it.\u201d",
      "Trump also rescinded Biden\u2019s sanctions on Israel settlers in the occupied West Bank, who have been accused of violence against Palestinians.",
      "The president\u2019s first term was characterized by a succession of pro-Israel moves, including moving the U.S. embassy to Jerusalem and ditching the Iran nuclear deal. The 2020 Abraham Accords, establishing relations between Israel and several Middle Eastern and North African countries, was perhaps the first Trump administration\u2019s biggest foreign policy achievement.",
      "North Korea",
      "In South Korea, there was palpable nervousness after Trump referred to North Korea as a \u201cnuclear power.\u201d",
      "U.S. officials have long refrained from using the phrase as it could signal recognition of North Korea as a nuclear-armed state. South Korea said Tuesday that North Korea \u201ccan never be recognized\u201d as such.",
      "Among the norm-busting sagas of the president's first term was his nuclear brinkmanship with North Korean dictator Kim Jong Un. The two traded personal insults and nuclear threats, before Trump told  the world that \"we fell in love.\"",
      "China",
      "While campaigning in 2024, Trump suggested he could slap a 60% tariff on all Chinese goods, risking a rerun of the Beijing trade war he fought during his first term.",
      "Now he suggests these tariffs could be used to force through a deal in which the U.S. acquires half of the social media platform TikTok. An executive order Trump signed Monday postponed for 75 days a Biden law that requires the Chinese tech giant ByteDance to sell its stake in TikTok or see the platform banned in the U.S.",
      "\u201cThe U.S. should be entitled to get half of TikTok,\u201d Trump told reporters. Asked about ByteDance\u2019s close ties with the Chinese government, he said he \u201ccould see a deal\u201d in which the U.S. \u201cpolices it a little \u2014 maybe a lot.\u201d",
      "Trump also reiterated his comments about the Panama Canal and \u201ctaking it back,\u201d claiming the key waterway was being controlled by China.",
      "Chinese Foreign Ministry spokesperson Mao Ning told a news briefing Tuesday that Beijing was \u201cwilling to work with the new U.S. administration, adhering to the principles of mutual respect, peaceful coexistence\u201d \u2014 perhaps hinting at past clashes.",
      "Europe's far right",
      "While U.S. inaugurations have historically been largely domestic affairs, figures on the global political right \u2014 including some on its extreme hard-right populist fringes \u2014 were invited to Washington on Monday.",
      "Among them were lawmakers from Alternative for Germany, a far-right nationalist party under surveillance by Berlin for suspected extremism that Trump ally Elon Musk has recently championed.",
      "Italy\u2019s staunch anti-immigration Prime Minister Giorgia Meloni also attended.",
      "Hungary's populist prime minister, Viktor Orban, a longtime Trump ally, said Trump's inauguration would aid the far-right's political assault on the European Union's mainstream.",
      "\u201cSo the great attack can start,\" he said at an event in Budapest. \"Hereby I launch the second phase of the offensive that aims to occupy Brussels.\u201d",
      "He is an arch antagonist of European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen, who offered her own assessment.",
      "\u201cWe have entered a new era of harsh geostrategic competition,\u201d she said in a speech at the World Economic Forum in Davos, Switzerland. \u201cBreaking the bonds in the global economy is in no one\u2019s interest.\u201d",
      "During his first term, Trump alarmed European leaders by suggesting he might not defend them against Russia unless they paid more toward defense. He reiterated his latest demand Monday for those countries to contribute 5% of their gross domestic products toward defense, more than double NATO's recommendation.",
      "He has also unnerved Denmark by suggesting he might take its autonomous territory of Greenland by force.",
      "Climate change",
      "As expected, one of Trump\u2019s first executive orders was to leave the 2016 Paris climate change accord, in which countries agreed to limit post-industrial temperature rises to 1.5 to 2 degrees Celsius (2.7 to 3.6 degrees Fahrenheit).",
      "This will put the United States alongside Yemen, Iran and Libya as nonsignatories to the deal, which Trump said was a \u201crip-off\u201d but experts say is still humanity\u2019s best hope at limiting catastrophe.",
      "Earlier this month, the Biden administration announced a ban \u2014 which would require an act of Congress to reverse \u2014 on new offshore oil and gas drilling along most of the U.S. coastline.",
      "Even so, the Paris agreement does not \"reflect our country\u2019s values,\u201d the White House said, with Trump instead promising to \"drill, baby, drill.\u201d",
      "The WHO",
      "It was likewise anticipated that Trump would junk Washington\u2019s role in the World Health Organization. He has alleged that the global health body aided Chinese government efforts to \u201cmislead the world\u201d over Covid \u2014 something both the WHO and Beijing deny.",
      "The U.S. is by far the WHO\u2019s biggest financial backer, providing 18% of its $6.8 billion budget. Signing an executive order to leave the WHO, Trump said that China\u2019s lower contribution but higher population \u201cseems a little unfair to me.\u201d",
      "Experts say that leaving the organization could undermine worldwide programs to tackle diseases such as tuberculosis and HIV/AIDS."

      "Two Guatemala-bound Air Force C-17s, carrying about 80 people apiece, flew deportees out of the U.S. Thursday night, the sources said. The third flight, slotted for Mexico, never took off.",
      "It was not immediately clear why Mexico blocked the flight, but tensions between the U.S. and Mexico, neighbors and longtime allies, have risen since President Donald Trump won the November election. Trump has threatened to slap 25% across-the-board tariffs on Mexico in retaliation for migrants crossing the border the countries share. But he has not yet put them in effect.",

      "A White House official, however, did not clarify whether they were military, commercial or private flights.",
      "Mexican President Claudia Sheinbaum's government has said it opposes Trump taking \"unilateral\" action to implement restrictive immigration standards \u2014 including the reinstatement of a \"remain in Mexico\" policy that forces migrants to stay in that country while they await adjudication of asylum claims. Flying deportees into a foreign country requires the cooperation of that nation's government.",
      "In a statement, Mexico's Ministry of Foreign Affairs did not go into detail on why the U.S. plane was not allowed to land in the country.",
      "\u201cMexico has a very good relationship with the United States government and we cooperate with respect for our sovereignty on a wide range of issues, including migration,\" the statement read. \"When it comes to repatriations, we will always welcome the arrival of Mexicans to our territory with open arms. Mexico embraces you.\u201d",
      "On Friday, Guatemala received three flights from the U.S. with Guatemalan nationals who had been sent back to their home country. A spokesperson for the Guatemalan Migration Institute told NBC News that two of Friday's flights were on military aircraft and the other was on a non-military plane. The total number of Guatemalans who arrived in Guatemala City from the three flights was about 265.",
      "The military deportation flights are part of a broader Trump administration crackdown on illegal immigration that has been set in motion with executive orders signed in his first week in office. During his campaign, he vowed to stop illegal immigration into the U.S. and pursue a campaign of mass deportation of undocumented immigrants already living in the country.",
      "In addition to the flights, he has enlisted the military to beef up its presence on the border with an additional 1,500 troops."

      "When Robert F. Kennedy Jr. visited in June 2019, Samoa was on the brink of crisis.",
      "The government had suspended measles vaccinations the year before after an improperly prepared vaccine killed two babies. Though the vaccinations resumed months later, many parents weren\u2019t convinced that the shots were safe, leaving thousands of their smallest children unprotected against a highly contagious disease as it was resurging across the globe.",

      "The last time Belarus staged a presidential election in 2020, authoritarian leader Alexander Lukashenko was declared the winner with 80% of the vote. That triggered cries of fraud, months of protests and a harsh crackdown with thousands of arrests.",
      "Not wanting to risk such unrest again by those opposing his three decades of iron-fisted rule, Lukashenko advanced the timing of the 2025 election \u2014 from the warmth of August to frigid January, when demonstrators are less likely to fill the streets.",
      "With many of his political opponents either jailed or exiled abroad, the 70-year-old Lukashenko is back on the ballot, and when the election concludes on Sunday, he is all but certain to add a seventh term as the only leader most people in post-Soviet Belarus have ever known.",
      "Here\u2019s what to know about Belarus, its election and its relationship with Russia:",
      "\u2018Europe\u2019s last dictator\u2019 and his reliance on Russia",
      "Belarus was part of the Soviet Union until its collapse in 1991. The Slavic nation of 9 million people is sandwiched between Russia and Ukraine, Latvia, Lithuania and Poland, the latter three all NATO members. It was overrun by Nazi Germany in World War II.",
      "It\u2019s been closely allied with Moscow and Russian President Vladimir Putin \u2014 himself in power for a quarter century.",
      "Lukashenko, a former state farm director, was first elected in 1994, riding public anger over a catastrophic plunge in living standards after chaotic and painful free-market reforms. He promised to combat corruption.",
      "Throughout his rule, he\u2019s relied on subsidies and political support from Russia, allowing it to use Belarusian territory to invade Ukraine in 2022 and later agreeing to host some of Russia\u2019s tactical nuclear weapons.",
      "Lukashenko was dubbed \u201cEurope\u2019s last dictator\u201d early in his tenure, and he has lived up to that nickname, harshly silencing dissent and extending his rule through elections that the West has called neither free nor fair.",
      "An open admirer of the Soviet Union, he has restored Soviet-style controls on the economy, discouraged use of the Belarusian language in favor of Russian, and pushed for abandoning the country\u2019s red-and-white national flag in favor of one similar to what it used as a Soviet republic.",
      "Belarus\u2019 top security agency kept its fearsome Soviet-era name of the KGB, and it\u2019s the only country in Europe to keep the death penalty, with executions carried out with a gunshot to the back of the head.",
      "Flirtation with the West, repression at home",
      "As he bargained with the Kremlin over the years for more subsidies, Lukashenko periodically tried to appease the West by easing repressions. Such flirtations ended after he unleashed a violent suppression of dissent after the 2020 election.",
      "That election to his sixth term was widely seen at home and abroad as rigged, and it sparked months of massive protests, the largest ever seen in Belarus.",
      "Authorities responded with a sweeping crackdown in which over 65,000 people were arrested, thousands were beaten by police and hundreds of independent media outlets and nongovernmental organizations were closed and outlawed, drawing Western sanctions.",
      "Leading opposition figures have either been imprisoned or fled the country. Human rights activists say Belarus holds about 1,300 political prisoners, including Nobel Peace Prize laureate Ales Bialiatski, the founder of the country\u2019s top rights group, Viasna.",
      "Lukashenko\u2019s maneuvers before the election",
      "Although Lukashenko\u2019s current term doesn\u2019t expire until summer, the election was moved up in what officials said would allow him \u201cto exercise his powers at the initial stage of strategic planning.\u201d",
      "Belarusian political analyst Valery Karbalevich gave a different reason, saying \u201cThere won\u2019t be mass protests in freezing January,\u201d he said.",
      "In other maneuvering, Lukashenko has pardoned 250 people described as political prisoners by rights activists.",
      "The pardons, however, come amid heightened repressions aimed at uprooting any remaining signs of dissent. Hundreds have been arrested in raids that targeted relatives and friends of political prisoners. Other arrests include participants in online chats organized by residents of apartment buildings in various cities.",
      "Unlike the 2020 election, Lukashenko faces only token challengers, with other opposition candidates rejected for the ballot by the Central Election Commission. The election began with early voting Tuesday and concludes Sunday.",
      "\u201cThe politicians who once dared to challenge Lukashenko are now literally rotting in prison in torture conditions, there has been no contact with them for over a year, and some of them are in very poor health,\u201d said Viasna representative Pavel Sapelka.",
      "Opposition leader-in-exile Sviatlana Tsikhanouskaya, who challenged Lukashenko in the 2020 election and was forced to flee the country afterward, says the latest vote is a farce and urged Belarusians to vote against every candidate.

      "SEOUL, South Korea \u2014 South Korea\u2019s military said Friday it suspects North Korea is preparing to send additional troops to Russia after its soldiers fighting in the Ukraine war suffered heavy casualties.",
      "South Korea\u2019s Joint Chiefs of Staff also assessed in a report distributed to journalists that North Korea is continuing its preparations to test-fire an intercontinental ballistic missile intended to reach the United States.",
      "President Donald Trump\u2019s return to the White House may brighten Pyongyang\u2019s prospects for high-level diplomacy with Washington, as he met North Korean leader Kim Jong Un three times during his first term. Many experts say Kim most likely thinks his evolving nuclear program and expanding military cooperation with Russian President Vladimir Putin could give him greater leverage than during his 2018-19 summits with Trump.",
      "North Korea has been supplying a vast amount of artillery and other conventional weapons to Russia, and last October it sent about 10,000-12,000 troops to Russia as well, according to U.S., South Korean and Ukraine intelligence. Seoul, Washington and others worry Russia could in return transfer to North Korea sophisticated weapons technologies that can enhance its nuclear program.",
      "North Korean soldiers are considered to be highly disciplined and well trained, but their lack of combat experience and unfamiliarity with the largely flat plains that make up most battlefields in the Russian-Ukraine war have made them easy targets for drone and artillery strikes.",
      "South Korea\u2019s spy agency said this month that it assessed about 300 North Korean soldiers had died and 2,700 others had been injured. Earlier in January, Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy put the number of killed or wounded North Koreans at 4,000, though U.S. estimates were lower at around 1,200.",
      "The South Korean Joint Chiefs of Staff said that North Korea is believed to be accelerating preparations to send more troops to Russia, without saying how it reached the assessment.",
      "Deepening military ties between North Korea and Russia could embolden Kim over his dealings with the U.S. and South Korea.

But many experts say Kim may eventually want to sit down for talks with Trump if he thinks the U.S. president could make concessions.",
      "Their previous talks collapsed after Trump rejected Kim\u2019s offer to dismantle his main nuclear complex, a limited denuclearization step, in return for extensive sanctions relief. Kim has since sharply increased the pace of weapons tests to expand an arsenal of nuclear missiles targeting the U.S. and South Korea.",
      "In South Korea, there are concerns that Trump might give up the goal of complete denuclearization of North Korea and focus on eliminating its long-range missile program that poses a direct threat to the U.S., while leaving its nuclear attack capabilities against South Korea intact.",
      "During a Fox News interview broadcast Thursday, Trump called Kim \u201ca smart guy\u201d and \u201cnot a religious zealot.\u201d Asked whether he will reach out to Kim again, Trump replied that \u201cI will, yeah.\u201d",
      "On Monday, Trump called North Korea \u201ca nuclear power\u201d as he boasted of his personal ties with Kim. That created a stir in South Korea, as Washington, Seoul and their partners have long avoided describing North Korea as a nuclear state out of worries that it could be seen as accepting its pursuit of nuclear weapons in violation of U.N. Security Council resolutions.",
      "\u201cI was very friendly with him. He liked me. I liked him,\u201d Trump said during a press availability at the Oval Office after his inauguration. \u201cNow he is a nuclear power. But we got along. I think he\u2019ll be happy to see I\u2019m coming back.\u201d",
      "Jeon Ha Gyu, a spokesperson for the South Korean Defense Ministry, told reporters Tuesday that efforts to achieve North Korea\u2019s denuclearization must be continued as a prerequisite to realize lasting peace not only on the Korean Peninsula but also in the world. South Korea\u2019s Foreign Ministry also said it will closely coordinate with the Trump administration to achieve North Korea\u2019s denuclearization.",
      "North Korea hasn\u2019t responded to Trump\u2019s comments. A state media report Friday on the closely watched two-day parliament meeting in Pyongyang this week did not say whether Kim attended it, and the report made no mention of the U.S., South Korea, Russia or other foreign policy issues."

    "story": [
      "Panama\u2019s control of the canal that bears its name should not be returned to the United States despite President Donald Trump\u2019s calls of \u201cwe\u2019re taking it back,\u201d Panamanians say.",
      "Although most people thought the matter was closed when Panama officially took control of canal operations from the United States in 1999, the issue reared its head during his campaign when he suggested the engineering marvel that connects the Atlantic and Pacific oceans was being run by China and should return to U.S. control.",
      "Trump repeated that claim in his inaugural speech this week, saying, \u201cChina is operating the Panama Canal,\u201d and \u201cwe\u2019re taking it back.\u201d Secretary of State Marco Rubio will visit Panama during a Latin American and Caribbean tour that starts late next week.",
      "Speaking at the World Economic Forum in Davos, Switzerland, Panama\u2019s President Jose Raul Mulino dismissed the notion as he and other Panamanian leaders tried to gain international support this week for keeping the canal under their nation\u2019s authority.",
      "Among those leaders is Jorge Luis Quijano, a former canal administrator, who insists Panama is running the waterway, not China. He also disputed Trump\u2019s complaint that U.S. ships pay more to pass through the canal than other countries.",
      "\u201cA ship with a Panamanian flag pays as much as an American-flagged ship,\u201d Quijano said, adding that rates are based on a vessel\u2019s size, and large container ships may pay as much as $1.2 million to pass through the 51-mile waterway that cuts through the Isthmus of Panama.",
      "Quijano said he started working at the canal in 1975 after graduating as an engineer from Lamar University in Beaumont, Texas, when the United States still controlled it. He said Americans were the supervisors when he started, but Panamanians eventually became the managers and \u201cthe Americans retired.\u201d",
      "\u201cI saw the whole movie,\u201d Quijano said jokingly about witnessing the transition over the 44 years he worked at the canal, eventually becoming vice president of operations and leading a reconstruction effort that expanded the channel\u2019s capacity in 2016.",
      "Humberto Arcia, 72, who lived two miles from the canal in the Chorrillo neighborhood as a child, said he will never forget the price Panamanians paid for the right to run the canal in their own country.",
      "The Hay-Bunau-Varilla treaty signed in 1903 gave the United States the right to build and manage the Panama Canal. Construction began in 1904 after a failed attempt by a French construction team to build the ambitious passage.",
      "The massive project took the lives of more than 5,000 construction workers, 350 of them U.S. citizens, by the time it was completed in 1914. Most of the workers were from Caribbean nations.",
      "Panama\u2019s relationship with the United States was marked by riots and demonstrations opposing\u00a0American involvement in the Central American nation\u2019s affairs and control over the canal.",
      "In 1964, anti-American riots broke out in Panama because the Panamanian flag was not allowed to fly next to the U.S. flag at Balboa High School in the U.S.-controlled Canal Zone that was attended by American students, according to the U.S. National Archives. The Canal Zone was a 10-mile concession of the United States where canal employees and their families lived.",
      "The protests escalated and students from multiple high schools outside the Canal Zone marched to its entrance, where at least 20 people were killed in clashes with the U.S. military, National Guard and Canal Zone Police during three days of riots. The protests are commemorated each year on Jan. 9, a national holiday, known as the Day of Martyrs.",
      "Arcia, a retired banker and attorney, remembers hearing relatives of the students talk about their loss when he lived near the Canal. \u201cTheir suffering changed the lives of their families forever,\u201d he said.",
      "The riots were a turning point in Panama\u2019s history, but it wasn\u2019t until 1977 that President Jimmy Carter and the Panamanian military leader Omar Torrijos signed the Torrijos-Carter Treaty that would eventually lead to Panamanian oversight.",
      "The Panama Canal Authority assumed full control on Dec. 31, 1999.",
      "U.S. historian David McCullough wrote in his book \u201cThe Path Between the Seas\u201d: \u201cThe fifty miles between the oceans were among the hardest ever won by human effort and ingenuity, and no statistics on tonnage or tolls can begin to convey the grandeur of what was accomplished. Primarily the canal is an expression of that old and noble desire to bridge the divide, to bring people together. It is a work of civilization.\u201d",
      "The Panama Canal was designated one of the seven wonders of the modern world in 1994.",
      "Today, the canal is one of the United States\u2019 most important trade routes and the top revenue source for Panama. The canal generates yearly revenues above $5 billion to the country\u2019s coffers, according to the U.S. State Department.",
      "The ships that pass through generate income, but the canal also attracts businesses that create jobs in industries such as logistics, insurance and banking, according to the Panama Canal Authority (ACP).",
      "Panamanians said the canal is part of their national identity.",
      "Panamanian business consultant Marjorie Miller said her great-grandfather, John Miller, moved to Panama from Jamaica to work at the canal. U.S. Census Bureau records show he lived in the American labor camp known as the Red Tank with other canal workers.",
      "\u201cI always knew how important the canal was to our country because of my ancestors,\u201d she said. \u201cThe Panama Canal is Panama. It is our greatest asset.\u201d",
      "Miller said she is frustrated by comments posted by Panamanians on social media about how the United States could probably do a better job running the canal than Panama.",
      "\u201cThe comments come from ignorance,\u201d she said, adding that many younger people in her country lack the historical knowledge to understand the importance of the canal for Panama.",
      "Miller also said that Trump\u2019s comments about China\u2019s involvement in the canal\u2019s operations may have arisen because Panama broke diplomatic relations with Taiwan in 2017 and established ties with China instead.",
      "\u201cWe were friends one day, and now we are hearing, \u2018We want your canal,\u2019\u201d she said. \u201cThat\u2019s a big change when the U.S. is our greatest trading partner.\u201d",

Never ever has China interfered. We respect Panama\u2019s sovereignty over the Canal and recognize it as a permanently neutral international waterway.\u201d",
      "Quijano, the former vice president of operations, said he doubts the United States could easily run the canal because it takes 12 years of training for an engineer to learn the complicated system of locks and water elevators that route giant ships through the canal.",
      "\u201cIf he thinks he is going to take it back and then we are going to run it for him, the answer is no,\u201d he said. \u201cAll of us just need to respect the treaties and the sovereignty of nations.\u201d",

      "President Donald Trump\u2019s threats aimed at strong-arming Moscow into ending its war in Ukraine have been badly received by some politicians and nationalists in Russia who say his tactics bode ill for a deal.",
      "Trump said on Wednesday he would likely impose new sanctions, taxes and tariffs on Russia, whose economy he said was failing, and on Moscow\u2019s allies, unless President Vladimir Putin struck a deal with him \u201csoon\u201d to end the conflict.",
      "In an apparent attempt to balance his threat with a compliment, Trump spoke of the need to never forget that Russia had helped the United States win World War II and incorrectly stated that the then Soviet Union had lost 60 million people in that conflict as opposed to the 26.6 million people estimated by the Russian authorities.",
      "Putin and Trump have yet to speak by phone since his inauguration and, with ties with the new administration at an early stage, the Kremlin played down Trump\u2019s threat, saying it \u201cdid not see any particularly new elements here.\u201d",
      "\u201cWe carefully record all the nuances. We remain ready for dialogue, President Putin has repeatedly spoken about this \u2014 for equal dialogue, for mutually respectful dialogue,\u201d Kremlin spokesperson Dmitry Peskov told reporters.",
      "Peskov took issue though with Trump\u2019s statement on World War II, saying it was the Soviet Union which had made the biggest contribution to victory over Nazi Germany. He also pointed out Trump\u2019s mistake on the number of war dead.",
      "Others spoke more plainly, saying that what they cast as Trump\u2019s heavy-handed attitude towards Russia made a peace deal less likely.",
      "Konstantin Kosachyov, deputy chairman of Russia\u2019s upper house of parliament, noted that Trump had not made any demands on Ukraine in the same post on Truth Social.",
      "\u201cIt confirms that his level of understanding of the causes, current state and prospects for resolving the Ukrainian crisis is approximately at the same level as his understanding of the course and outcome of World War II,\u201d Kosachyov said in a statement. \u201cThat is to say, lower than the skirting board, which cannot but be a cause for regret and concern.\u201d",
      "Influential war bloggers, read by millions of Russians and licensed by the authorities, expressed outrage.",
      "One of them, Voenkor Kotonok, said Trump\u2019s statement was \u201cinsulting, arrogant and self-satisfied.\u201d Another, war correspondent Alexander Kots, speculated that the Middle East ceasefire had given Trump a misplaced sense of omnipotence.",
      "\u201cRussia is not the Gaza Strip. And starting a dialogue with ultimatums is not the most far-sighted move on the part of a leader claiming to be a peacemaker. Moscow will never agree to any deals dictated by blackmail and threats,\u201d Kots wrote.",
      "Sergei Markov, a former Kremlin adviser, said Trump\u2019s actions so far suggested he would not be able to bring peace to Ukraine, while Vladimir Solovyov, a high-profile state media talk show host, said Trump\u2019s threats proved he was an enemy.",

    "published": "Thu, 23 Jan 2025 12:23:58 GMT",
    "summary": "Jenin residents reported constant gunfire and explosions between Israeli forces and Hamas militants. Ten people were killed earlier this week.",
    "story": [
      "Israel\u2019s defense minister said on Wednesday forces were applying lessons learned in Gaza as a major operation continued in\u00a0Jenin, which the military said was aimed at countering Iranian-backed militant groups in the volatile West Bank city.",
      "A military spokesperson declined to give details but said the operation was \u201crelatively similar\u201d to but in a smaller area than one\u00a0last August, in which hundreds of Israeli troops backed by drones and helicopters raided\u00a0Jenin\u00a0and other flashpoint cities in the occupied West Bank.",
      "It was the third major incursion by the Israeli army in less than two years into\u00a0Jenin, a longtime major stronghold of\u00a0militant groups\u00a0including Hamas and Islamic Jihad, which said its forces were fighting Israeli troops.",
      "Residents reported constant gunfire and explosions and Palestinian health services reported at least four wounded, after 10 people were killed a day earlier.",
      "Israeli military spokesperson Nadav Shoshani said the militants\u2019 increasing use of roadside bombs and other improvised explosive devices were a particular focus of the operation, which included armored bulldozers to tear up roads in the refugee camp adjacent to the city.",
      "As the operation continued, many Palestinians left their homes in the camp, a crowded township for descendants of Palestinians who fled or were driven from their homes in the 1948 war around Israel\u2019s creation.",
      "\u201cThank God, we were at home, we went out and asked an ambulance to take us out,\u201d said a woman who gave her name as Um Mohammad.",
      "Before the raid, which came two weeks after a\u00a0shooting attack\u00a0blamed by Israel on gunmen from\u00a0Jenin, roadblocks and checkpoints had been thrown up across the West Bank in an effort to slow down movement across the territory.",
      "As the raid began, Palestinian Authority (PA) security forces pulled out after having conducted a weeks-long operation to try to reassert control over the refugee camp, dominated by Palestinian factions that are hostile to the PA, which exercises limited governance in parts of the West Bank.",
      "The operation came just two days after the\u00a0launch of a ceasefire deal in Gaza\u00a0and exchange of hostages for Palestinian prisoners held in Israeli jails, with Israeli troops pulling back from their positions in many areas of the enclave.",
      "On Wednesday, the military said troops in several areas in Gaza engaged a number of armed suspects it said posed a threat and fired warning shots at masked individuals who approached them. It called on Palestinians to avoid approaching troops.",
      "\u201cThe IDF is determined to fully maintain the terms of the agreement in order to return the hostages,\u201d it said in a statement, adding that it was prepared for any scenario and would take \u201call necessary actions\u201d to overcome threats.",
      "Defense Minister Israel Katz said the\u00a0Jenin\u00a0raid marked a shift in the military\u2019s security plan in the West Bank and was \u201cthe first lesson from the method of repeated raids in Gaza.\u201d",
      "\u201cWe will not allow the arms of the Iranian regime and radical Sunni Islam to endanger the lives of [Israeli] settlers [in the West Bank] and establish a terrorist front east of the state of Israel,\u201d he said in a statement.",
      "Israel\u2019s campaign in Gaza, following the Oct. 7, 2023, attack on Israel by bands of Hamas-led gunmen, has left much of the coastal enclave in ruins after 15 months of bombardment. The military has said it has refined its urban warfare tactics in light of its experience in Gaza, but Shoshani declined to provide details of how such lessons were being applied in\u00a0Jenin.",
      "Israel considers Palestinian militant groups such as Hamas and Islamic Jihad that are\u00a0backed by Iran\u00a0as part of a multifront war waged by an axis that includes Hezbollah in southern Lebanon and the Houthis in Yemen.",
      "Newly installed U.S. President\u00a0Donald Trump\u00a0has appointed a string of senior officials with close ties to the settler movement, and his return to the White House has been welcomed by hardline pro-settler ministers who have pledged to expand settlement building in the West Bank.",
      "Around 700,000 Israeli settlers live among 2.7 million Palestinians in the West Bank and East Jerusalem, land Israel seized in the 1967 Middle East war. Most countries deem Israel\u2019s settlements on territory taken in war to be illegal. Israel disputes this, citing historical and biblical ties to the land."
