      "Yura Borisov does not have a flashy entrance in \u201cAnora.\u201d His character Igor isn\u2019t even introduced until the movie\u2019s nearly halfway through. He\u2019s just the hired muscle, quietly observing and reacting to the quickly devolving situation around him. And yet you can\u2019t take your eyes off of this stranger.",
      "Up until that point it\u2019s been the Mikey Madison show, a chronicle of her character Ani\u2019s whirlwind romance with the spendy, wild son of a Russian oligarch. Igor arrives at the turning point, the end of the honeymoon and the beginning of a swift descent into a chaotic, all-night manhunt. And soon he establishes himself not just as an intriguing outsider, but the soul of the film: The henchman with a heart.",
      "It\u2019s a performance that has caught many off guard: An introduction to a fresh face with an undeniable star quality that has earned him nominations from the Oscars, the Screen Actors Guild and the BAFTAs. But Borisov, 32, is only a newcomer in some parts of the world. Already a star in Russia, Borisov broke through on the international scene in the Cannes title \u201cCompartment No. 6\u201d as the uncouth miner sharing a cramped room with a Finnish student on a long train ride through Russia.",
      "That was the performance that made filmmaker Sean Baker take note and give him a call about participating in what would become \u201cAnora.\u201d Baker has described his secret weapon, who quickly becomes the beating heart and soul of the film, as the \u201cRussian Ryan Gosling.\" Borisov is flattered, but also little confused by the comparison.",
      "\u201cI love Ryan Gosling and very interested to work with him one day. I\u2019ve seen his films. He plays very, very cool. But I don\u2019t know what he means,\u201d Borisov laughed. \u201cLet\u2019s ask Sean.\u201d",
      "Baker, for his part, knew he had a ringer in Borisov but doesn\u2019t show his hand from the top. He strings the audience along, letting them feel like they\u2019re discovering something too. The 28-minute real-time home invasion scene where we meet Igor was actually Borisov\u2019s first to film. It was rehearsed and discussed in detail before the cameras started rolling. In all, it took about eight days to film and three months to edit.",
      "\u201cWe discussed everything trying to find the balance humor and scares and drama and comedy because it\u2019s important for this scene to,\" Borisov said. \u201cBut for me I\u2019m just thinking about a real person named Igor and a real person named Anora.\u201d",
      "He and Baker spoke a lot about Igor\u2019s past, his story, his dreams and his clothes. The white Nike sneakers as contrast to Igor\u2019s all black outfit, he thought, were particularly poignant \u2014 a symbol of Igor\u2019s soul. He liked that his director would ask him if he thought Igor might do this or that instead of just telling him to do something.",
      "But Borisov is not the kind of actor who thinks that he has much interesting to say or explain about his performance. If he could, he said, he\u2019d be a writer. For him, it\u2019s the work that does the talking.",
      "\u201cThe most important is what do you feel when you see the film,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s not so important what we were discussing.\u201d",
      "The week that Borisov spoke to the AP was the week \u201cAnora\u201d had emerged as the frontrunner in an awards race that had previously been wide open. The supporting actor category however, competitive as it may be with nominees like Edward Norton, Guy Pearce and Jeremy Strong, has been considered Kieran Culkin\u2019s to lose for some time now. But it\u2019s still significant: Borisov is the first Russian actor to get an Oscar nomination since Mikhail Baryshnikov\u2019s nod in 1977 for \u201cThe Turning Point.\u201d",
      "\u201cI\u2019m happy that it means something for a lot of people and that\u2019s why it means a lot for me,\u201d he said. \u201cPeople could feel some hope maybe inside them, maybe proud inside them, you know? \u201c",
      "It\u2019s been a wild ride since Cannes and the end is now in sight. Soon he\u2019d be leaving for London, to attend the BAFTAs, and in two weeks Los Angeles for the Oscars. The accolades and nominations have been exciting, though the impulse to keep the conversations going with all the interesting people he\u2019s met along the way has led to more than few late nights.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s kind of a crazy, crazy time,\u201d he said.",
      "It\u2019s too early for him to talk publicly about how much the raised profile has impacted his career, but, he teased \u201clife is changing.\u201d And if he\u2019s being completely honest, he\u2019s happiest about simply getting to spend more time with the people he made the film with.",
      "\u201cMaybe it looks like kind of stupid because you could say that \u2018man, it\u2019s awards, it\u2019s big opportunities for you, why are you talking about spend time with your friends?\u2019\u201d Borisov said. \u201cMaybe it\u2019s kind of stupid, but for me, it\u2019s still important to spend this time with them together. Because without this stuff, we will go to live our life separately. And it will be one day, of course, and I\u2019m kind of sad about this but it just will come. Now we\u2019re still together and I\u2019m happy about this.\u201d",

      "\u201cCaptain America: Brave New World\u201d infused some blockbuster cash into the North American box office, bringing in $88.5 million in ticket sales over the weekend, according to studio estimates Sunday. The Walt Disney Co. release is by far the biggest opener of 2025 and the company predicts it will hit $100 million domestically and $192.4 globally by the end of Monday's Presidents' Day holiday.",
      "It\u2019s Marvel's first major release since \u201cDeadpool & Wolverine\u201dbroke records last summer and re-energized a Marvel fanbase that some worried was weakening after the poor showing for \u201cThe Marvels.\u201d",
      "Playing in 4,105 locations in the U.S. and Canada, \u201cBrave New World\u201d is also a major transition for the \u201cCaptain America\u201d brand: Anointing Anthony Mackie\u2019s Sam Wilson as the new Cap, officially taking over from Chris Evans, who played the character for almost a decade. Harrison Ford co-stars as the U.S. President who transforms into the Red Hulk.",
      "But \u201cBrave New World,\u201d directed by Julius Onah, had a bit of a handicap going into the weekend: Poor reviews, though superhero movies can soar without the stamp of approval from critics. The film is currently sitting at 51% \u201crotten\u201d on Rotten Tomatoes. It's not the worst in the Marvel Cinematic Universe \u2014 \u201cEternals\u201d has a 47% rating and \u201cAnt-Man and The Wasp: Quantumania\u201d has a 46% \u2014 but the latest film is definitely on the very low end of the spectrum.",

      "Audiences were more generous in their opinions. The \u201cverified audience score\u201d from Rotten Tomatoes was 80% and its CinemaScore was a B-. Exit polls showed that men made up 63% of the opening weekend audience.",
      "The bar for biggest opening of the year wasn\u2019t terribly high: \u201cDog Man\u201d held the title for two weeks with its $36 million launch.",
      "And \u201cBrave New World's\u201d showing is the middle range for an MCU film. Not accounting for inflation, it sits between \u201cGuardians of the Galaxy\u201d and \u201cThor: The Dark World.\u201d",
      "It also cost significantly less than many of the big budget Marvel movies, with a reported production price tag of $180 million, excluding the millions spent on marketing and promotion.",
      "After only one Marvel movie in 2024, \u201cBrave New World\u201d is the first of three major theatrical releases set for 2025. It is to be followed by \u201cThunderbolts(asterisk)\u201d in May and \u201cThe Fantastic Four: First Steps\u201d in July.",
      "\u201cThe superhero genre has taken a hit over the past few years, but audiences still have a huge interest in seeing them on the big screen,\u201d said Paul Dergarabedian, the senior media analyst for Comscore.",
      "Second place at this week's box office went to \u201cPaddington in Peru,\u201d the third installment in the beloved franchise, which finally opened in North America this weekend. Released by Sony, it earned an estimated $13 million and should hit $16 million by Monday. The StudioCanal film opened in the United Kingdom in early November 2024 and went into the weekend with $104 million from its international run.",
      "Dougal Wilson took over directing duties for Paul King for this film, which also recast Emily Mortimer as Mrs. Brown, originally played by Sally Hawkins. The other main cast, including Ben Whishaw as Paddinton's voice, remained intact.",

Or Ryan Gosling\u2019s wink at Emma Stone last year that had internet shippers in a tizzy?",

      "The Associated Press is here to help those without a BritBox subscription with a rundown of the best and most memorable moments of the night, where \u201cAnora\u201d did not sweep (though Mikey Madison did triumph over best actress front-runner Demi Moore), \u201cConclave\u201d won big and \u201cEmilia P\u00e9rez\u201d proved it\u2019s still a contender.",
      "Host David Tennant got the ceremony off to an amusing start with a pre-recorded bit where various actors give him a little pep talk, appearing in his dressing room mirror \u2014 including fellow Scot Brian Cox, who kicked off a rousing rendition of The Proclaimers song \u201cI\u2019m Gonna Be (500 Miles).\u201d Tennant took over and brought the anthem into the room, where Selena Gomez seemed genuinely surprised when he tapped her shoulder and inserted her name into the song. There were the celebrity participants of course, James McAvoy, Camila Cabello and Colman Domingo among them. But even some not \u201cin the show\u201d sang along happily as well, Saoirse Ronan and Jack Lowden included. Others, like Adrien Brody and Demi Moore, did not seem to be part of the chorus.",
      "No presenter wants a John Travolta \u201cAdele Dazeem\u201d moment or, worse, a Faye Dunaway \u201cLa La Land\u201d flap, and you could see the wheels turning in Gomez\u2019s head as she looked at the card for the debut by a British writer, director or producer award. \u201cI don\u2019t know how to say,\u201d she said quietly from stage, looking at her co-star and co-presenter, Zoe Salda\u00f1a, before looking further down on the card. \u201cOh, \u2018Kneecap,\u2019\u201d she said, quietly adding, \u201cRich\u201d and simply avoiding the writer-director\u2019s last name, Peppiatt.",
      "Jesse Eisenberg started off his best screenplay win for \u201cA Real Pain\u201d with some signature, self-deprecating jokes about how neither he, his wife nor the person who sat him thought he was going to win. The audience laughed loudly when he said that\u2019s why his wife didn\u2019t attend the ceremony. But he quickly turned sincere, offering a touching tribute to his wife, Anna Strout, whom he credited with helping him learn about the world around him. \u201cYou\u2019ve put every worthwhile thought into my head over the last 20 years,\u201d Eisenberg said. \u201cI love you so much.\u201d",

Or maybe she was just really overwhelmed to win the best supporting actress BAFTA. Regardless, she let her emotions show in a teary and intense speech, in which she poked fun at her own inability to do a good British accent, shouted out her makeup artist as her closest confidant and made a case for the film.",
      "\u201cFilms are supposed to change hearts and challenge minds, and I hope, I hope that \u2018Emilia P\u00e9rez\u2019 did something like this,\u201d she said. \u201cVoices need to be heard, just not my English accent. Bye, guys.\u201d",
      "In memoriam segments don\u2019t need to be flashy. All you need is a thoughtful reel, Jeff Goldblum and a piano, it turns out. He played \u201cAs Time Goes By.\u201d",

Gordon, now vice chairman at Hendrick Motorsports, won the Daytona 500 on Sunday with team owner Rick Hendrick and driver William Byron. Gordon and Cruise have remained friendly \u2014 Cruise showed up at a 2015 NASCAR banquet to honor the retiring Gordon \u2014 which could boost the prospect of Gordon and Hendrick Motorsports' involvement in a sequel.",
      "\"He seems to like to tease it, so I don\u2019t know,\" Gordon said Sunday night. \u201cWe\u2019ll see what happens. If that doesn\u2019t happen, I feel pretty confident there\u2019s a project out there that will get NASCAR back on the big screen, if not just a really cool docuseries or something beyond even what we\u2019re already seeing right now.\u201d",
      "The movie ultimately introduced NASCAR to a wider audience that had very limited exposure to stock-car racing before that summer. There had been racing movies before \u2014 think \u201cThunder Road,\u201d \u201cGrand Prix,\u201d \u201cStroker Ace,\u201d or even \u201cSmokey and the Bandit\u201d \u2014 but none that had depicted NASCAR in such a mainstream style.",
      "\u201cHard to imagine how you pull that off today because they actually had race cars with cameras in the race, and the cameras were big,\u201d Gordon said. \u201cCameras have gotten a lot smaller so maybe you could pull it off, but how do you do it and make it realistic and really authentic?\u201d",
      "NASCAR has seen more swings and misses than checkered flags when it comes to its portrayal on the big or small screen since \u201cDays of Thunder.\u201d For every \u201cTalladega Nights,\u201d there are 10 more bombs such as comedian Kevin James' ill-fated Netflix\u2019s comedy series, \u201c The Crew.\" Gordon said he was encouraged that better days are ahead for NASCAR in the entertainment industry.",
      "\u201cI am seeing just a lot more momentum in projects like coming through NASCAR and coming to Hendrick Motorsports and just more interest,\u201d he said. \u201cSo that\u2019s good, right? It talks a lot about where the sport is at, where it\u2019s heading, the amazing crowd that was here all weekend, not just today, new TV partners.\u201d",

    "story": [
      "The discovery of hundreds of unmarked graves at an Indian residential school in Canada in 2021 was just the catalyst for \u201cSugarcane.\"",
      "The discovery of hundreds of unmarked graves at an Indian residential school in Canada in 2021 was just the catalyst for \u201cSugarcane.\u201d",
      "Julian Brave NoiseCat and Emily Kassie, the filmmakers behind the Oscar-nominated documentary, spent years investigating the truth behind just one of the institutions. \u201cSugarcane,\u201d now streaming on Hulu, paints a horrifying picture of the systemic abuses inflicted by the state-funded school and exposes for the first time a pattern of infanticide and babies born to Indigenous girls and fathered by priests.",
      "In the year since it debuted at the Sundance Film Festival, \u201cSugarcane\u201d has screened at the White House, for Canadian Parliament and for over a dozen indigenous communities in North America, sparking a grassroots movement and reckoning to find the truth about the other schools. It also marks the first time that an Indigenous North American filmmaker has received an Oscar nomination.",
      "From the 19th century until the 1970s, more than 150,000 First Nations children were required to attend state-funded Christian schools as part of a program to assimilate them into Canadian society. They were forced to convert to Christianity and not allowed to speak their native languages. Many were beaten and verbally abused, and up to 6,000 are said to have died. Nearly three-quarters of the 130 residential schools were run by Roman Catholic missionary congregations",
      "Canada\u2019s residential schools were based on similar facilities in the United States, where Catholic and Protestant denominations operated more than 150 boarding schools between the 19th and 20th centuries, according to researchers, that also were home to rampant abuse.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s too often that we look everywhere else in the world to horrors and abuses happening, and that\u2019s important, but Native issues are rarely the issue of the day, and we believe that they deserve to be,\u201d Kassie said. \u201cThis story is the genocide that happened across North America, and we\u2019ve never grappled with it. Native people have rarely been the focal point of that kind of countrywide dialogue. We hope that \u2019Sugarcane\u201d helps to change that.\u201d",
      "As an investigative journalist and documentarian, Kassie had spent a decade making films about human rights abuses all over the world, from Afghanistan to Niger, but she\u2019d never turned her lens to her own country. When the news broke about the unmarked graves, she felt drawn to the story and reached out to NoiseCat to see if he\u2019d want to help. They became friends as cub reporters in New York who just happened to share neighboring desks.",
      "\u201cIn the years since, Julian had gone on to become an incredible writer and thinker and journalist focusing on indigenous life in North America. It felt like the natural fit,\u201d she said.",
      "While he was mulling it over, she went looking for a group to focus on and landed on St. Joseph\u2019s Mission near the Sugarcane Reservation of Williams Lake in British Columbia. Unbeknownst to her, that was the school NoiseCat's family attended. He\u2019d heard stories about his father being born nearby and found in a dumpster. Over the course of making the film they\u2019d discover that he was actually born in a dormitory and found in the school\u2019s incinerator.",
      "\u201cIt was a process for me to ultimately decide to tell the story in a personal and familial way,\u201d said NoiseCat, who during the making of the film lived with his father for the first time since he was around 6 years old.",
      "\u201cIt became very clear that he had these unaddressed questions from his birth and upbringing, and that I was in a position to help him ask those questions and in so doing, to address some of my own enduring pains and complications from his abandonment of me,\u201d NoiseCat said. \u201cThe big thing, though, was going to the Vatican with the late Chief Rick Gilbert and witnessing his incredible bravery.\u201d",
      "\u201cWe\u2019ve just been incredibly fortunate that this film has had real impact,\u201d NoiseCat said. \u201cI was really scared that telling such a personal and sometimes painful story might be a harmful thing. But really, thankfully, it\u2019s been a healing thing, not just for my family and our participants, but for Indian Country more broadly.\u201d",
      "Over the last year as the film has played at various festivals and for Indigenous communities on reservations, Kassie said that more survivors have been coming forward with their stories.",
      "In October, former President Joe Biden also formally apologized to Native Americans for the \u201csin\u201d of a government-run boarding school system that for decades forcibly separated children from their parents, calling it a \u201cblot on American history.\"",
      "\u201cThis is the origin story of North America,\u201d Kassie said. \u201cIt\u2019s the story of how the land was taken by separating six generations of kids, indigenous kids from their families... (and) most people don\u2019t know.\u201d",
      "Kassie noted that while \u201cSugarcane\u201d is inspiring conversations within communities, it comes at a political moment where governments are not actively supporting continued investigation and accountability.",
      "In a film industry with deep roots in the Western genre and problematic, racist depictions of Native Americans as impediments to westward expansion, authentic representation of indigenous stories on screen is still in the early days. In 97 years of the Oscars, no Native American person has ever won a competitive acting prize. Lily Gladstone, who is an executive producer on \u201cSugarcane,\u201d was passed over last year for best actress.",
      "When the Oscar nomination came through for \u201cSugarcane,\u201d they made sure they had their facts right before touting its own historic nature: NoiseCat was indeed the first indigenous North American filmmaker to get one.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s really special,\u201d he said. \u201cAnd at the same time, it\u2019s kind of shocking.\u201d",
      "\u201cWe hope the film shows that there\u2019s still so much about this foundational story in North America that needs to be known and therefore needs to be investigated,\u201d NoiseCat said. \u201cThis film should be seen not as an ending, but a beginning to a real grappling with this story.\u201d",
      "He added: \"More broadly, there are so many painful, important, beautiful and sometimes even triumphant stories that come from Native people that come from Indian Country. It\u2019s my hope that more Native stories and storytellers and films get recognized moving forward and get made.\u201d",
      "If \u201cSugarcane\u201d is named the winner at the Oscars on March 2, NoiseCat promised it will be an acceptance speech to watch.",
      "\u201cWe will make it a moment,\u201d NoiseCat said. \u201cIf we win, I\u2019m going to get up there, I\u2019m going to say something, and we\u2019re going to do it well too.\u201d",

      "Kris Bowers embraced a new challenge with his first animated film, turning his signature storytelling through music into an Oscar-nominated masterpiece",
      "LOS ANGELES -- LOS ANGELES (AP) \u2014 Kris Bowers embraced a new challenge with his first animated film, turning his signature storytelling through music into an Oscar-nominated masterpiece.",
      "Bowers\u2019 work on \u201c The Wild Robot \u201d continues to solidify his place as one of Hollywood\u2019s most sought-after composers, earning him a nomination for best original score. His score complements the film\u2019s stunning visuals and emotional depth, capturing the journey of Roz, an out-of-place robot striving to connect with animals who struggle to understand it.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s about being really clear with each story, understanding what the emotions is and what\u2019s stirring inside of me,\u201d said Bowers, 35, a Grammy and Emmy-nominated composer who won an Academy Award for the short documentary \u201cThe Last Repair Shop.\u201d He\u2019s also worked on Oscar-winning films such as \u201cKing Richard\u201d and \u201c Green Book.\u201d",
      "For \u201cThe Wild Robot,\u201d Bowers first studied the early black-and-white sketches, where he uncovered his emotions toward the characters, before capturing those feelings at his piano, crafting a musical narrative filled with heart. Bowers said tapping into his emotions has never come easily, but he found inspiration in his journey as a father, watching his wife sacrifice her body during pregnancy, to help craft sounds that capture the essence of parenthood.",
      "In a recent interview with The Associated Press, Bowers reflects on what the Oscar nomination means to him, the challenges of composing for animated films, the lasting influence of five-time Oscar winner John Williams and why Kobe Bryant \u2019s advice continues to resonate with him.",
      "The Oscars will air March 2.",
      "____",
      "BOWERS: It means a lot. As a kid, that's how I found a lot of composers. I was looking at that (Oscar noms) list. I would look at who's nominated then go listen to those scores, so it became a way to expand my collection of CDs. It means something to be a part of this history. No matter what happens in my career from here on out, somebody's going to look at this year's list and see my name. To be nominated, you are chosen by the music branch of the academy ... filled with composers who I've been a fan of since I was a kid. ... It makes me feel like I've done something meaningful.",
      "BOWERS: Yeah, he was the master of memorable melody. If there's a piece of score in a move that you can sing, it's probably John Williams. One thing I took from him is that he came up in a time of composers who were storytellers and made sure the music was also developing the story. When those themes come back at the most pivotal point in the movie, we feel something emotional. I remember for \u201cThe Wild Robot,\u201d I studied the last 30 minutes of \u201cStar Wars: Episode IV - A New Hope,\u201d primarily because the last 20-30 minutes of \u201cThe Wild Robot\u201d is all action. I thought, \u201cHow did John Williams approach this?\" Because \u201cStar Wars\u201d was so iconic with its themes.",
      "BOWERS: The only moment was when I played the main theme. I was kind of just wanting to see if it triggered that complexity. I do this often with my wife where I\u2019ll have a theme that I\u2019m playing it and ask her \u201cWhat does this remind of, or what does this make you feel? I remember when I played her that sequence, which was a work in progress, and she got emotional. She cried watching just that three-minute sequence, having no idea of what the movie was about. I felt like I was on the right track. ... It\u2019s reminding her of all the complex emotions she feels as a mom. I struck a nerve in a way that could be valuable.",
      "BOWERS: It\u2019s definitely more challenging. If you talk to any composer, they\u2019ll talk about the fact that animation is its own challenge. Most animated films have almost wall-to-wall music where music kind of doesn\u2019t ever stop. Whereas, a lot of live action, you can sit for five minutes and not have any music and be OK.",

      "LOS ANGELES -- The Golden State Warriors are known for their electrifying plays and superstar Stephen Curry, but now the team is pioneering a fresh gameplan: blending sports and entertainment in a way no NBA franchise has before.",
      "As the first and only NBA team with its own record label, Golden State Entertainment, the Warriors are expanding their reach with \u201cFor the Soil,\u201d a new album released this week. The project featuring the Bay Area\u2019s top music artists \u2014 from E-40, Too Short, Saweetie, G-Eazy, Goapele, LaRussell and Larry June \u2014 arrives just in time for the league's All-Star Game weekend in San Francisco.",
      "\u201cA basketball team with a record label is unheard of until now, which is a testament to the Warriors and the Bay,\u201d said P-Lo, a Filipino-American rapper who produced \u201cFor the Soil,\u201d a collaborative release between Golden State Entertainment and EMPIRE, a distribution and publishing company. He will perform live during an NBA All-Star tipoff party on Thursday at Thrive City, a 11-acre community gathering space surrounding the Chase Center.",
      "\u201cThis is about innovation, bringing a new idea to the table,\u201d said P-Lo, a lifelong Warriors fan who has worked with artists such as Yo Gotti, Saweetie and Kehlani. He's no stranger to the franchise, riding his convertible car as part of the Warriors championship parade, celebrating the team's title in 2022.",
      "\u201cWe're here to break barriers while I'm trying to process it all,\" he added. \"I'm grateful for this opportunity.\u201d",
      "Warriors guard Gary Payton II said he plans on listening to the album.",
      "\u201cFor me, to be the first team to have a music company, or production company, it\u2019s kinda cool,\u201d Payton said. \u201cP-Lo is running it, and getting it done. I know there\u2019s a lot of talented Bay Area artists behind it, so it\u2019s something to look forward to and be excited about.\u201d",
      "P-Lo played a key role in bringing together the Bay Area\u2019s top artists, contributing to all nine tracks on the album. He began the process late last summer, collaborating with local talent to craft a well-rounded project.",
      "\u201cP-Lo can produce, rap and bring all these artists who are like family to him,\u201d said David Kelly, an executive with the Warriors. He spearheaded the launch of Golden State Entertainment in 2022 before the team won the championship that year.",
      "Several NBA teams have partnered with artists over the years: Drake as the Toronto Raptors\u2019 global ambassador, Jay-Z as a former minority owner of the Brooklyn Nets, and the Miami Heat collaborating with DJ Khaled, who performed at games. The Atlanta Hawks have also embraced their city\u2019s rap scene, working with T.I., 2 Chainz, and Quavo.",
      "But an NBA team with its own record label and entertainment division? That\u2019s where Kelly saw an opportunity for the Warriors to break new ground. He said creating a label, intersecting hip-hop and basketball made sense.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s just kind of authentic and natural to the culture,\u201d said Kelly, who joined the organization in 2011 and currently is the chief business officer of Golden State Entertainment. \u201cIt seems like a lot of times people try to force them apart or mesh them together that don\u2019t make sense. But if you grew up a part of both, they naturally intertwine.\u201d",
      "Kelly first pitched the idea of the Warriors having a record label to then-president Rick Welts before bringing it to the team\u2019s owner, Joe Lacob, and co-executive chairman Peter Guber. He said the Warriors' leadership embraced his vision, and he hopes more pro teams will follow suit.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s seeing the culture being presented in a way that\u2019s true and reflective on a grand international scale,\u201d said Kelly, a former Chicago-based rapper, whose stage name was Capital D. \u201cHopefully this is the first of many for Golden State and the culture.\u201d",

      "Lawyers will give their closing arguments at the trial of rapper A$AP Rocky, who is accused of two felony counts of assault with a semi-automatic firearm",
      "LOS ANGELES -- There's one essential difference between arguments at rapper A$AP Rocky 's trial: Prosecutors will say Thursday that the hip-hop star fired two shots at a former friend from a handgun, while defense lawyers will say he fired blanks from a gun that wasn't real.",
      "Jurors should begin deliberations by the afternoon on two felony counts of assault with a semiautomatic firearm for the 2021 shooting. If they convict Rocky of both, he could get up to 24 years in prison.",
      "The Grammy-nominated music star, fashion mogul and actor is the longtime partner of singing superstar Rihanna, with whom he has two toddler sons. She may appear in court for closing arguments after showing up sporadically \u2014 most recently last week, when they left the courthouse together for the first time, walking arm-in-arm.",
      "Testimony at the trial ended Tuesday, when Rocky and his lawyers told a judge he would not take the stand.",
      "The prosecution's case rests largely on the credibility of the man Rocky is alleged to have fired on. A$AP Relli, whose legal name is Terell Ephron, became friends with Rocky, born Rakim Mayers, in high school in New York, where both were members of a crew of creative types called the A$AP Mob.",
      "Their friendship continued after Rocky first gained global fame with a pair of No. 1 albums in 2012 and 2013, but by Nov. 6, 2021 their bond had become a beef.",
      "They met up outside a Hollywood hotel, and scuffled as soon as they saw each other. In a second confrontation moments later, Rocky fired the shots. Relli said his knuckles were grazed by one of them. The fights were partially captured on surveillance videos that are not clear enough for easy interpretation.",
      "A$AP Twelvyy, another member of the crew who was with Rocky, testified that Relli had been the aggressor, and that Rocky fired the shots as a warning to stop him from attacking another member of their crew.",
      "Twelvyy testified that Rocky fired blanks from a starter pistol that the rapper had been carrying for security since a music video shoot months earlier, and that everyone involved in the incident knew it. Rocky's tour manager also testified that he carried the phony gun.",
      "Neither gun was found or presented as evidence.",
      "Police who searched the area after a report of a shooting found no physical evidence, but Relli himself went to a police department two days later with two shell casings he said he'd picked up after returning to the scene.",
      "In closing arguments, the defense will contend that video evidence and text messages can't be trusted, nor can Relli. He also filed a civil suit in the case, and Rocky's attorneys will cast him as a jealous opportunist out for the money of a former friend who became famous. Relli vowed to do just that in text messages and in phone calls recorded by a mutual friend who gave the recordings to Rocky. Relli said in his testimony that the calls were faked.",
      "The prosecution will argue that Relli is justly seeking money after a genuine wrong was done to him. They point out that Relli's communications around the incident tell a consistent story \u2014 and never does he mention making anything up or knowing Rocky carried a prop gun. Prosecutors are likely to argue that the whole idea of the starter pistol \u2014 which only fires blanks \u2014 is a preposterous lie coordinated by Rocky's inner circle.",
      "In one of a series of arguments between lawyers that grew so nasty and personal during the trial that the judge began threatening fines, Deputy District Attorney John Lewin called the prop gun argument \u201cgarbage.\u201d",

      "For the first time in recent history, the percentage of top-grossing films featuring female protagonists equaled the percentage of films with male protagonists, according to a pair of annual studies released Tuesday",
      "NEW YORK -- For the first time in recent history, the percentage of top-grossing films featuring female protagonists equaled the percentage of films with male protagonists, according to a pair of annual studies released Tuesday.",
      "Movies like \u201cWicked,\"\u201cInside Out 2\" and \u201cThe Substance\u201d lifted Hollywood's theatrical releases to gender parity in leading roles in 2024. Of the 100 top domestic grossing films in 2024, 42% had female protagonists, and 42% had male protagonists, according to a report issued by the Center for the Study of Women in Television and Film at San Diego State University.",
      "The USC Annenberg Inclusion Initiative, which also released its annual study Tuesday, found that 54% of the top 100 films at the box office in 2024 featured girls and women as protagonists. That's a massive jump from just the year prior, when 30% of films featured women in lead roles. In 2007, when the USC annual study began, that figure was just 20%.",
      "\"This is the first time we can say that gender equality has been reached in top-grossing films,\u201d Stacy L. Smith, founder of the Annenberg Inclusion Initiative, said in a statement.",
      "\u201cIn 2024, three of the top five films had a girl or woman in a leading role, as did five of the top 10 films \u2014 including the number one film of the year, Disney\u2019s \u2018Inside Out 2,\u2019\" added Smith. \"We have always known that female-identified leads would make money. This is not the result of an economic awakening but is due to a number of different constituencies and efforts \u2014 at advocacy groups, at studios, through DEI initiatives \u2014 to assert the need for equality on screen.\u201d",
      "Other metrics suggested the gains in leading roles masked still-endemic disparity throughout Hollywood. The percentage of female characters in speaking roles increased from 35% to 37% in 2024, according to the San Diego State study. Major female characters rose from 38% in 2023 to 39% in 2024.",
      "\u201cFilms such as \u2018The Substance\u2019 pushed back hard against a culture that considers women disposable,\u201d Lauzen stated. \u201cWhile the number of films with female protagonists rose to a historic high in 2024 after a dismally lean 2023, the percentages of women in the more stable categories of major and speaking roles reflected only minor gains.\u201d",
      "Universal Studios, which is led by Donna Langley, was the studio with the best record for female representation. In 2024, 66.7% of Universal releases centered on girls and women, according to the Annenberg Inclusion Initiative.",
      "Neither study captures the large number of films released directly on streaming platforms or films that fall outside the top 100 movies in theaters. But for decades, those top box-office films have offered a snapshot of a film industry that has long failed to come close to reflecting the demographics of American society.",
      "That remains the case for underrepresented racial or ethnic groups, who account for roughly 42% of the U.S. population.",
      "In the top 2024 films in 2024, 25% included an underrepresented lead or co-lead, according to Annenberg. In those 25 movies, the lead or co-leads were 38.% Black, 15.4% Asian or Asian American and 3.9% Hispanic.",
      "That was a substantial decrease from 2023, when 37 leads or co-leads were people of color.",
      "\u201cThe progress we saw for female-identified leads was not matched by the findings for underrepresented leads,\u201d said Smith. \u201cThis downturn signifies a lack of investment in storytelling that reflects the audience as a whole. The reality is that audiences want to see stories about women and people of color \u2014 studios and filmmakers do not have to choose between the two.\u201d"

      "At 100 years old, the Goodyear Blimp is an ageless star in the sky",
      "DAYTONA BEACH, Fla. -- Flying a few hundred feet above the streets and shores of Daytona Beach, the Goodyear Blimp draws a crowd.",
      "Onlookers stare and point. Drivers pull over for better looks, snapping pictures, recording videos and trying to line up the perfect selfie. For some, it\u2019s nostalgic. For others, it\u2019s a glimpse at a larger-than-life advertising icon.",
      "At 100 years old, the blimp is an ageless star in the sky. And the 246-foot-long airship will be in the background of the Daytona 500 on Sunday \u2014 roughly 1,500 feet above Daytona International Speedway, actually \u2014 to celebrate its latest and greatest anniversary tour.",
      "Even though remote camera technologies \u2014 drones, mostly \u2014 are improving regularly and changing the landscape of aerial footage, the blimp continues to carve out a niche. At Daytona, with the usual 40-car field racing around a 2\u00bd-mile superspeedway, views from the blimp aptly provide the scope of the event.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s great to show the pack racing,\u201d Fox Sports director Artie Kempner said, adding that he expected to use aerial shots from the blimp about 50 times during Sunday\u2019s race.",
      "The Goodyear Blimp has been a regular at major sporting events since flying above the 1955 Rose Bowl. A few years later, it became a service vehicle for television coverage while simultaneously functioning as a highly visible advertising platform. It\u2019s been at every Daytona 500 since 1962.",
      "During that streak, blimps have undergone wholesale changes and improved dramatically: steering technology, safety innovations, high-definition cameras, gyro-stabilized aerial views and much quieter rides thanks to relocated engines and propellers.",
      "Nowadays, riding on the blimp isn\u2019t much different from traveling on a small plane. The 12-seater comes with reclining seats, tray tables, seatbelts, a safety briefing and a bathroom with amazing views. A few windows serve as the only air conditioning onboard. The blimp offers a smooth ride even at top speed, creeping along at 73 mph \u2014 well below the cars pushing 200 mph on the track.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s an iconic symbol for our nation, a floating piece of Americana,\u201d blimp pilot Jensen Kervern said. \u201cThere\u2019s nothing like it in the world.\u201d",
      "The blimp has covered more than 2,500 events and taken more than 500,000 passengers for rides, according to Goodyear. Former President Ronald Reagan might be the most famous passenger, and rapper Ice Cube raised the blimp\u2019s street cred when he included a line about it in his 1992 song titled \u201cIt Was A Good Day.\u201d",
      "But not just anyone can climb aboard. Rides are invitation only even though phones at blimp headquarters \u2014 the three U.S.-based airships are housed in California, Florida and Ohio \u2014 ring off the hook with people inquiring about buying a ride.",
      "As part of the blimp\u2019s 100-year anniversary celebration, however, Goodyear is giving three U.S. residents a chance to join the exclusive club and win a ride. The sweepstakes will provide each winner a certificate for two to fly on the blimp. The prize also includes $3,000 for travel expenses to one of Goodyear\u2019s airship hangars.",
      "It would be a once-in-a-lifetime experience, no doubt.",
      "The blimp flies low enough to spot pods of dolphins or flotillas of sea turtles in the Atlantic Ocean. The view over Daytona International Speedway is equally stunning, with the ability to see every inch of the famed track while watching (and hearing) race cars turning laps.",
      "Already in 2025, the Goodyear fleet has flown over the Rose Bowl, the Orange Bowl, the Pro Bowl and Pebble Beach. Its upcoming schedule includes the Academy Awards, Coachella and WrestleMania.",
      "But will the blimp survive another 100 years?",
      "Drone imagery and resolution continue to improve along with maneuverability, stability and flight longevity. And where drones can be flown by one person, the Goodyear Blimp crew at Daytona tops 20 staffers.",
      "But given the blimp\u2019s longevity, adaptability and celebrity, no one should bet against it sticking around for generations to come.",
      "\u201cDespite changes in technology and our environment, people still get so excited to see the blimp,\" Kervern said. \u201cIt's just an iconic symbol for our nation.\u201d",

      "A federal appeals court has upheld singer R. Kelly's racketeering convictions and a 30-year prison sentence, finding he exploited his fame for over a quarter century to sexually abuse girls and young women",
      "NEW YORK -- R. Kelly\u2019s racketeering and sex trafficking convictions, along with a 30-year prison sentence, were upheld Wednesday by a federal appeals court that concluded the singer exploited his fame for over a quarter century to sexually abuse girls and young women.",
      "The 2nd U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals in Manhattan ruled Wednesday after hearing arguments last March.",
      "The Grammy-winning, multiplatinum-selling R&B songwriter was convicted in 2021 in Brooklyn federal court of multiple charges, including racketeering and sex trafficking.",
      "Attorney Jennifer Bonjean, representing R. Kelly, said in a statement that she believed the Supreme Court will agree to hear an appeal. She called the 2nd Circuit ruling \u201cunprecedented,\" saying it gives prosecutors limitless discretion to apply the racketeering law \u201cto situations absurdly remote\u201d from the statute's intent.",
      "Last year, the high court declined to hear an appeal of a 20-year sentence Kelly received after he was convicted in 2022 of child sex charges including charges of producing images of child sexual abuse in Chicago.",
      "The 2nd Circuit rejected Kelly's arguments that the trial evidence was inadequate, the constitutionality of some state laws used against him were questionable, four jurors were biased, the trial judge made some improper rulings and a racketeering charge more commonly used in organized crime cases was improper.",
      "\u201cEnabled by a constellation of managers, assistants, and other staff for over twenty-five years, Kelly exploited his fame to lure girls and young women into his grasp,\u201d the appeals court said, noting members of his entourage helped introduce him to underage girls.",
      "\u201cEvidence at trial showed that he would isolate them from friends and family, control nearly every aspect of their lives, and abuse them verbally, physically, and sexually,\u201d the three-judge panel said.",
      "The appeals court said it was \u201cneither arbitrary nor irrational\u201d that several accusers were permitted to testify at trial that Kelly gave them herpes without disclosing he had an STD, and it was not unduly prejudicial or cumulative that seven witnesses who were not yet adults when Kelly began to abuse them were allowed to testify.",
      "\u201cNone of the testimony was more inflammatory than the charged acts,\u201d the appeals court said.",
      "The 2nd Circuit also said it was not unfairly prejudicial for the trial judge to let jurors view graphic videos. The videos, the appeals court said, \u201cwere properly admitted to show the means and methods of the enterprise, including the level of control and dominance Kelly had over his victims.\u201d",
      "Bonjean, in her statement on R. Kelly's behalf, also cited a partial dissent in which one 2nd Circuit judge, Richard J. Sullivan, concurred with what he described as the majority's \u201cexcellent opinion,\u201d but dissented in part over a restitution award given one victim for a lifetime supply of a suppressive regime of herpes medication. The award was based on the cost of the brand-name drug when a generic drug is available.",
      "\u201cThis was not restitution. This was an effort by the government to unfairly enrich government witnesses for their testimony,\u201d Bonjean said.",
      "Kelly, born Robert Sylvester Kelly, is known for work including the 1996 hit \u201cI Believe I Can Fly\u201d and the cult classic \u201cTrapped in the Closet,\u201d a multipart tale of sexual betrayal and intrigue.",
      "Kelly sold millions of albums and remained in demand even after allegations about his abuse of young girls began circulating publicly in the 1990s. He was acquitted of child sexual abuse image charges in Chicago in 2008, but a second trial in Chicago in 2022 ended with his conviction on charges of producing images of child sexual abuse and enticing girls for sex.",
      "Widespread outrage over Kelly\u2019s sexual misconduct did not emerge until the #MeToo reckoning, reaching a crescendo after the release of the documentary \u201cSurviving R. Kelly.\u201d",

      "Sean \u2018Diddy\u2019 Combs is suing NBC Universal over a documentary that he says falsely accuses him of being a serial murderer who had sex with underage girls as he awaits trial on federal sex trafficking charges",
      "NEW YORK -- NEW YORK (AP) \u2014 Sean \u2018Diddy\u2019 Combs is suing NBC Universal over a documentary that he says falsely accuses him of being a serial murderer who had sex with underage girls as he awaits trial on federal sex trafficking charges.",
      "The lawsuit filed Wednesday in New York state court says the documentary, \u201c Diddy: Making of a Bad Boy,\u201d included statements that NBC Universal either knew were false or published with reckless disregard for the truth in order to defame the founder of Bad Boy Records.",
      "\u201cIndeed, the entire premise of the Documentary assumes that Mr. Combs has committed numerous heinous crimes, including serial murder, rape of minors, and sex trafficking of minors, and attempts to crudely psychologize him,\u201d the complaint reads. \u201cIt maliciously and baselessly jumps to the conclusion that Mr. Combs is a \u2018monster\u2019 and \u2018an embodiment of Lucifer\u2019 with \u2018a lot of similarities\u2019 to Jeffrey Epstein.\u201d",
      "Spokespersons for NBC Universal and the entertainment company that produced the documentary, which is also named in the suit, didn\u2019t immediately respond to emails seeking comment. The documentary premiered last month on Peacock TV, the network\u2019s streaming service.",
      "\u201cFrom his childhood to becoming a mogul, this raw look at Sean Combs\u2019 journey through exclusive footage and candid interviews explores his rise, controversies and the man behind the music,\u201d a description of the documentary on Peacock\u2019s website reads.",
      "Combs, who is seeking no less than $100 million in damages, has been in Brooklyn federal prison since his September arrest on racketeering conspiracy and sex trafficking charges.",
      "Federal prosecutors say he used his wealth and influence to coerce female victims and male sex workers into drug-fueled, dayslong sexual performances known as \u201cFreak Offs.\u201d",
      "They say Combs used blackmail and violence to intimidate and threaten his victims in a pattern of abuse that goes back to the early 2000s.",
      "Combs has pleaded not guilty to the charges. His trial is slated to start in May.",
      "Erica Wolff, an attorney for Combs, said NBC and the other entities named in the suit \u201cmaliciously and recklessly broadcast outrageous lies\u201d in order to \u201cline their own pockets\u201d by driving viewership to the documentary.",
      "\u201cIn making and broadcasting these falsehoods, among others, Defendants seek only to capitalize on the public\u2019s appetite for scandal without any regard for the truth and at the expense of Mr. Combs\u2019s right to a fair trial,\u201d she said in a statement. \u201cMr. Combs brings this lawsuit to hold Defendants accountable for the extraordinary damage their reckless statements have caused.\u201d",
      "Combs\u2019 lawsuit says the documentary \u201cfalsely, recklessly, and maliciously\u201d accuses him of murdering Kimberly Porter, Christopher Wallace and Dwight Arrington Myers, among other notable names.",
      "Porter, a model who had been Combs\u2019 longtime girlfriend and the mother of some of his children, died in 2008 at the age of 47 from complications from pneumonia.",
      "Wallace, the rapper known as The Notorious B.I.G., was killed in 1997 in a still-unsolved drive-by shooting in Los Angeles at age 24.",
      "Myers, the rapper known as \u201cHeavy D,\u201d died from a pulmonary embolism in 2011 at the age of 44.",
      "\u201cIt shamelessly advances conspiracy theories that lack any foundation in reality, repeatedly insinuating that Mr. Combs is a serial killer because it cannot be a \u2018coincidence\u2019 that multiple people in Mr. Combs\u2019s orbit have died,\u201d the complaint reads.",
      "Elsewhere, the complaint says the documentary delved into claims Combs had sex with underage girls, citing as evidence a civil complaint that's been \u201cthoroughly discredited.\u201d Combs\u2019 lawyers say the women referenced in that complaint have since confirmed they were adults at the time.",

      "",
      "\"This is a huge, huge issue,\" said Matthew Smeltzer, a managing partner of Capstone Recruiting Advisors, a company that helps hospitals, physician practices, and other employers find and hire doctors. \"It probably hits small towns the hardest, just because most people would prefer to live in a midsize or large community.\"",
      "",
      "In this challenging environment, Havana leaders are hoping that want ads and rent-free perks will make their small town stand out and persuade a doctor to practice here.",
      "",

      "",
      "\"Everything you would imagine a Hallmark movie to be is kind of where we live,\" Wilkerson said. \"It's people who still care and look out for each other, and neighbors are actually friends.\"",
      "",
      "Offering generous incentives was how town leaders got Newberry to practice in Havana in 1993. The town gave Newberry an initial deal similar to the one it's offering now, and later began providing him about $15,000 a year in financial support.",

      "",

      "Still, there is a silver lining. Smeltzer said young physicians are placing a high value on work-life balance and meaningful relationships with their patients  --  qualities that may give an edge to a small-town, independent practice.",

      "In the rural villages of South Africa, U.S. President Donald Trump\u2019s sudden freeze on foreign aid impacts hundreds of thousands of HIV patients",
      "UMZIMKHULU, South Africa -- At a rural village in South Africa's KwaZulu-Natal province, unemployed 19-year-old Nozuko Majola is trying to figure out if she has enough money for the one-hour ride to collect her much-needed HIV medication, usually delivered to her home that can't be easily reached due to rough, untarred roads.",
      "Majola is one of millions of patients in South Africa affected by U.S. President Donald Trump\u2019s global foreign aid freeze, raising worries about HIV patients defaulting on treatment, infection rates going up and eventually a rise in deaths.",
      "In 2024, think tank Human Sciences Research Council released figures showing that Majola's province recorded the second-highest HIV prevalence in the country, at 16%, with at least 1,300 young people estimated to contract the disease every week.",
      "KwaZulu-Natal also had the highest number of people living with HIV in South Africa in 2022, about 1,980,000. The country counts more than 7.5 million people infected with the virus that causes AIDS \u2014 more than any other nation.",
      "There are 5.5 million South Africans receiving antiretroviral treatment, whose funding is now in question after Trump suspended the President\u2019s Emergency Plan for AIDS Relief, or PEPFAR. It contributes more than $400 million a year to South Africa's HIV programs and nongovernmental organizations, about 17% of the total funding, according to the Health Ministry.",
      "Globally, PEPFAR is credited with saving at least 26 million lives since its inception in 2003, according to the U.N. AIDS agency.",
      "Last week, a federal judge ordered the Trump administration to temporarily lift the funding freeze, while the U.S. Embassy in South Africa said PEPFAR projects would resume under a limited waiver. However, aid groups dealing with HIV have already shuttered with closure notices hanging at the entrances and PEPFAR-branded vehicles standing idle, with patients diverted to struggling health facilities.",
      "Most of the PEPFAR funding is channeled through non-governmental organizations, which run programs that compliment health care services provided by the government.",
      "For Majola and other HIV patients in the Umzimkhulu region, where unemployment is rife and most people rely on subsistence farming and government welfare grants, the aid freeze has disrupted their lives.",
      "\u201cThings will be tough around here, and a lot of people will default on their treatment because we really struggle with transport,\" she said. \u201cThe mobile clinics hardly come here.\u201d",
      "The freeze has hurt various groups that can no longer provide treatment, causing an influx of patients to already overstretched public facilities. Along with the medication, these programs also allowed health personnel to test HIV patients in far-flung villages, which has been a lifeline for many, especially those afraid to visit public facilities due to the social stigma attached to HIV.",
      "In addition, nearly 15,000 health workers whose salaries are funded through PEPFAR are left wondering if they have lost their livelihoods.",
      "About an hour away in the district of Umgungundlovu, which the think tank says has the highest number of HIV cases in South Africa, HIV counselors gathered in a small office discussing how best to assist patients like Majola. A manager at a nearby health clinic wondered how to handle the administrative work that is piling up after PEPFAR-funded workers withdrew.",
      "\u201cPeople who were doing administration and data capturing, whose salaries were funded by PEPFAR, have left. We are a small facility and we cannot handle such a workload,\u201d said the manager, who spoke on condition of anonymity because they were not authorized to speak to the press.",
      "Nozuko Ngcaweni has been on HIV treatment for about 30 years. One of her children was also infected and died at age 17. She said the aid suspension already impacted her community and many missed their treatment.",
      "\u201cNot long ago, we said by 2030, we want to see an HIV-free generation. But if things remain as is, we will not achieve that. We will have to deal with deaths,\u201d she said.",
      "Mzamo Zondi, a provincial manager of the Treatment Action Campaign, which advocates for access to HIV treatment for the poor, has been monitoring the impact of the aid freeze in Umgungudlovu.",
      "\"Our response (to HIV) is likely to falter as we struggle to stop newly infected cases,\" he said. \u201cThis is a matter of life and death.\u201d",

      "More adults have sought insight on whether they have autism in the last decade",
      "ATLANTA -- Natasha Nelson, a 35-year old entrepreneur in Stone Mountain, Georgia, didn't have an innate sense of social norms. She didn't know why people meeting for the first time would choose to engage in small talk instead of deep conversations, or why people like to make their beds.",
      "Then, a few years ago, she was diagnosed with autism, just after her youngest daughter received the same.",
      "\u201cIf your life has always felt like it was in chaos and you don\u2019t feel comfortable and you don\u2019t feel like you thrive and you just feel like you\u2019re constantly surviving and going from one thing to the next, what you got to lose?\u201d Nelson said, encouraging people to seek a diagnosis.",
      "Common signs of autism include trouble with social communication and a fixation on certain routines or topics \u2014 Nelson says \u201cpeople have become my special interest now\u201d \u2014 and may go unnoticed during someone\u2019s childhood.",
      "But it can be costly and difficult to obtain an autism diagnosis later in life due to a shortage of medical professionals trained to work specifically with adults. Here's more information on what you should know about adult autism diagnoses.",
      "Autism spectrum disorder is a range of intellectual, language and social difficulties, like rigidly following routines, having fixed or obsessive interests and struggling to hold eye contact or understand nonverbal communication. Autism is typically diagnosed during childhood, and the American Academy of Pediatrics recommends all children be screened as early as 18 months.",
      "More adults have sought insight on their own neurodiversity in the last decade \u2014 often after their children are diagnosed or after seeing social media posts. A study published last year in JAMA Network Open showed a 452% increase in autism diagnoses among adults age 26 to 34 from 2011 to 2022.",
      "Some traits of autism can go unnoticed until adulthood, when there are new social demands. Others may have learned how to hide certain behaviors, known as masking.",
      "\u201cAdults have learned to compensate over time,\u201d said Whitney Ence, a psychologist at the University of California San Francisco who works with autistic adults. \u201cThey may have learned like \u2018I can\u2019t display that in public, and so I do that in private.\u2019\"",
      "There's also an overlap of symptoms between various disorders like ADHD and OCD that can complicate an autism diagnosis due to difficulties with nonverbal social cues or executive functions like attention span, working memory and problem-solving.",
      "Symptoms present differently for everyone, and many of the traits are common for people without autism, like enjoying routines or enjoying going down rabbit holes of information.",
      "But to meet the diagnostic definition of autism, the symptoms must cause significant impairment, said Dr. Arthur Westover, a psychiatrist who specializes in autism at the University of Texas Southwestern Medical Center.",
      "\u201cWe\u2019re human beings in general. We like routines ... just having a bit of pleasure and feeling better with routines does not mean you\u2019re autistic,\" Westover said. \"It goes a little bit deeper than that.\u201d",
      "Russell Lehmann, 34, has lived with his autism diagnosis for more than 20 years. The motivational speaker has routines that he describes as both comfortable and stressful. Eating the same food and buying the same groceries, he said, brings him comfort. But if he skips going to the gym for an hour and a half every day, he becomes overwhelmed with feelings of depression and failure.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s like no gym, no day,\u201d he said. \u201c... My routine is an incredibly existential burden, because every night I go to bed knowing I have to do a routine I do not like simply to function.\u201d",
      "While there are various online screening tools, autism is a complex diagnosis, so experts recommend talking to your primary care physician for a psychiatry referral.",
      "That psychiatrist might want to interview people who were present in your early childhood, like family and friends, who can attest to symptoms being present at that time.",
      "Some psychiatrists may refer you to a psychologist, who can give you a standardized diagnostic autism test or will use their own clinical judgement. There is no brain scan or blood test for autism.",
      "Getting an autism diagnosis as an adult can be costly and take some time. Westover said there's a major shortage of specialists who work with autistic adults. Nelson's diagnosis took three years and she paid more than $3,000 out-of-pocket.",
      "Ence also suggests that you ask yourself a few questions when considering getting a professional diagnosis, and to know that you may run into a waitlist: \u201cWhat is leading me down this pathway to think that I need a professional diagnosis? Do I need access to services? Are there services I don\u2019t have available to me?\u201d",

      "Abortions are set to resume in Missouri after a judge blocked regulations that had restricted providers even after voters approved enshrining abortion rights into the state\u2019s constitution",
      "KANSAS CITY, Mo. -- Abortions are set to resume in Missouri after a judge blocked regulations that had restricted providers even after voters approved enshrining abortion rights into the state\u2019s constitution.",
      "Friday's ruling came after a Kansas City judge ruled last year that abortions were now legal in the state but kept certain regulations on the books while a lawsuit by abortion-rights advocates played out.",
      "One regulation required abortion facilities to be licensed by the Missouri Department of Health and Senior Services. Planned Parenthood said most of its facilities could not comply with some of the licensing rules, including \u201cmedically irrelevant\u201d size requirements for hallways, rooms and doors.",
      "Planned Parenthood argued that the licensing law required providers to give \u201cmedically unnecessary and invasive\u201d pelvic exams to anyone receiving an abortion, including medication abortions, according to court documents. The plaintiffs also said some of the regulations on Planned Parenthood centers were so strict, \u201cmost health centers or doctors\u2019 office simply do not meet\u201d them.",
      "Jackson County Circuit Judge Jerri Zhang said in her ruling that the licensing requirement is \u201cfacially discriminatory because it does not treat services provided in abortion facilities the same as other types of similarly situated health care, including miscarriage care.\u201d",
      "Voters approved the measure adding abortion rights to the constitution in November. That amendment did not legalize abortion in the state outright but instead required judges to reconsider laws that had almost completely banned the procedure.",
      "Margot Riphagen, president and CEO of Planned Parenthood Great Rivers, said the group is working quickly to start providing the procedure again in the coming days.",
      "\u201cToday\u2019s decision affirms what we\u2019ve already long known \u2014 the state\u2019s abortion facility licensing requirements were not about patient safety, but rather another politically motivated barrier to prevent patients seeking abortion from getting the care they need,\u201d she said in a statement.",
      "The ruling is a temporary order pending the outcome of the lawsuit by abortion-rights advocates.",
      "Planned Parenthood and other advocates sued to overturn Missouri\u2019s near-total abortion ban almost immediately after voters amended the constitution to protect reproductive rights. Republican Attorney General Andrew Bailey is fighting the lawsuit.",
      "There was no immediate response to a voice message seeking comment from a spokesperson for the attorney general.",
      "Mallory Schwarz, executive director of Abortion Action Missouri, said clinic partners are ready to start providing abortions as soon as next week.",
      "\u201cWith this change the landscape for Missourians and the entire Midwest region will be transformed, as patients will have greater access to abortion care than they have had in years,\u201d she said in a statement.",
      "Missouri is one of five states where voters approved ballot measures in 2024 to enshrining abortion rights in their constitutions. Nevada voters also approved an amendment but will need to pass it again in 2026 for it to take effect.",
      "Another measure banning discrimination on the basis of \u201cpregnancy outcomes\u201d prevailed in New York.",
      "Missouri\u2019s constitutional amendment allows lawmakers to restrict abortion after viability with exceptions to \u201cprotect the life or physical or mental health of the pregnant person.\u201d",
      "The term \u201cviability\u201d is used by health care providers to describe whether a pregnancy is expected to continue developing normally or whether a fetus might survive outside the uterus. While there is no defined time frame, doctors say it is generally sometime after the 21st week of pregnancy.",

      "Texas Department of State Health Services data shows there were 49 cases of measles in Texas in 1996. In 2013, there were 27 cases reported after a person who traveled to Asia returned and interacted with a vaccine-hesitant community, the state reported.",

Up to 9 out of 10 people who are susceptible will get the virus if exposed, according to the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. Before the vaccine was introduced in 1963, the U.S. saw some 3 million to 4 million cases per year. Now, it\u2019s usually fewer than 200 in a normal year.",

      "Arsenal manager Mikel Arteta believes the accumulation of long-term injuries experienced by some clubs is an \u201caccident waiting to happen\u201d because of the increased demands on players in a busy soccer calendar",
      "LONDON -- Arsenal manager Mikel Arteta believes the accumulation of long-term injuries experienced by some clubs is an \u201caccident waiting to happen\u201d because of the increased demands on players in a congested soccer calendar.",
      "Arteta said he felt a \u201cbig pain in the tummy\u201d after seeing Kai Havertz pick up a serious hamstring injury at the end of a light training session in Dubai that will rule the Germany forward out for the rest of the season.",
      "It further stretches Arsenal\u2019s resources up front, with Gabriel Jesus having ruptured his ACL, winger Bukayo Saka having not played since December because of a hamstring issue and another wide player, Gabriel Martinelli, set to miss the next month also with a hamstring injury.",
      "Two more games per team were added to the first stage of this season's Champions League, while Arsenal also went deep in the English League Cup \u2014 it was eliminated by Newcastle in the two-legged semifinals \u2014 and is in a title race with Liverpool in the Premier League.",
      "An expanded and revamped Club World Cup, which takes place in the United States at the end of the season and lasts a month, also extends the schedule for many teams, though not Arsenal this year. Some players have openly complained that it is detrimental to their performance and health and the busy match schedule is facing legal challenges and the possibility of strike action.",
      "For Arteta, it\u2019s no surprise to see injury rates soar at Arsenal because of the extra load on players and what he perceives to be an increased intensity in modern-day soccer.",
      "\u201cYou cannot prove it and the evidence we can provide is very limited in many aspects and every case is very different but already some of them (injuries) we know are based on load and minutes. It's inevitable,\u201d Arteta said Friday. \u201cWe have players who have been injured who have played 130 games over the last two seasons. In the end, it\u2019s an accident waiting to happen if you continue to load and load and load.",
      "\u201cIs this season an accumulation of that? Is it the stress of that? Is it luck? Is it preparation? Is it methodology? There are a lot of factors. It\u2019s very difficult to point at something but the schedule that's planned is super-demanding and for certain players, especially explosive players, it\u2019s a real issue.\u201d",
      "Havertz appears to have been unlucky in picking up his injury, with Arteta explaining how the German stretched his leg to stop a shot at a set-piece and \u201cfelt his hamstring go.\u201d",
      "Given the number of injuries sustained by Arsenal players this season \u2014 others to have had long spells out include Ben White, Martin Odegaard, Riccardo Calafiori and Takehiro Tomiyasu \u2014 some have questioned whether Arteta\u2019s training methods are to blame.",
      "Maybe that was the reason why Arteta was eager to point out that Arsenal\u2019s players now \u201ctrain less than ever\u201d and go into a deeper explanation about how too many games \u2014 and, as a result, not enough training \u2014 affects players\u2019 recovery.",
      "\u201cThe muscle is undertrained and then you expose the muscle and the tendon to an exposure that they cannot absorb because the tendon needs 72 hours to recover,\u201d Arteta said. \u201cA lot of people talk about what we're doing outside. It\u2019s not outside, it\u2019s inside.",
      "\u201cWhen you have to load that muscle for two or three or six or eight weeks that you haven\u2019t in training, the risk of injury is much bigger \u2014 one, because the tendon is not recovered, and then it\u2019s not prepared to absorb the load and stress you are going to put it under every three days.\u201d",

      "Paris-based UFC-Que Choisir chose Valentine\u2019s Day to release results of what it said were tests of roses, gerberas and chrysanthemums sold at florists, shops, supermarkets and online. It said it found potentially harmful residues of pesticides in every bouquet.",

      "Unlike for produce that is consumed, regulations in Europe on cut flowers place no limits on the level of pesticides, UFC-Que Choisir notes.",
      "The group is calling on authorities to introduce maximum levels of pesticide residues, a ban on imports of flowers treated with pesticides that are banned in Europe, and mandatory labelling of the origin and treatment of flowers.",
      "The group bought 15 bouquets of flowers. In each one, between seven and up to 46 different pesticide residues were identified, of which an average of almost 12 were deemed hazardous because they are possibly carcinogenic or endocrine disrupting, the group said. Residues of pesticides banned in the EU were found in two-thirds of the bouquets.",

      "SALT LAKE CITY -- Utah students in as early as kindergarten would be required to learn about firearm safety in the classroom under a bill that passed the state House with overwhelming support Friday.",
      "The Republican-controlled chamber approved the measure in a 59-10 vote and sent it to the Senate, despite concerns from some gun violence prevention advocates that it places an unnecessary burden on children.",
      "Under the proposal, public school students would receive mandatory instruction throughout their K-12 years on how to respond if they encounter a gun. The lessons, which could be presented in a video or by an instructor displaying an actual firearm, would demonstrate best practices for safely handling and storing a gun to prevent accidents.",
      "Elementary age children would learn about gun safety on at least three occasions by the time they reach sixth grade, with the possibility for that instruction to begin in kindergarten, when kids are around five years old.",
      "The bill\u2019s Republican sponsor, Rep. Rex Shipp of Cedar City, said it's aimed at preventing accidental shootings by and of young children. The lessons, he said, will be age-appropriate for each grade level, with younger students learning to avoid touching a gun and alert an adult immediately.",
      "\u201cA lot of times when they don't have any firearms in their homes or don't do any hunting and shooting, then these kids are not taught what to do when they come in contact with a firearm,\u201d Shipp said.",
      "One other state, Tennessee, has a law on the books requiring firearm safety training in public schools, but it lets education officials determine in which grade they think it's appropriate for students to start receiving that instruction. The lessons, set to begin next school year, will be annual and cannot include live firearms or ammunition.",
      "A Utah statute already allows firearm safety to be taught in schools, but Shipp said teachers don't currently do so. His bill makes it mandatory but allows parents to opt their kids out of the instruction.",
      "If it passes the similarly Republican-led Senate and is signed into law, the lessons would begin next school year.",
      "Gun violence prevention advocates have applauded Utah Republicans for pushing for more gun safety education, but some argue those lessons should be aimed at adults.",
      "The proposal unfairly places the responsibility of gun safety on children rather than their parents, said Barbara Gentry of the Gun Violence Prevention Center of Utah.",
      "\u201cGuns and gun safety are the responsibility of the adult gun owner, not school children,\" Gentry said. \"We support schools sending home materials to parents outlining the importance of safe storage in keeping our families and schools safe from gun violence.\"",

      "Lawmakers in Alabama's House have passed a bill expediting Medicaid for pregnant women in a state with one of the highest maternal mortality rates in the country",
      "MONTOGMERY, Ala. -- A bill that would expedite Medicaid coverage and prenatal health care for low-income pregnant women in Alabama has advanced as lawmakers across the South try to address rising maternal and infant mortality rates.",
      "The \u201cpresumptive eligibility\u201d legislation states that Medicaid will pay for a pregnant woman\u2019s outpatient medical care for up to 60 days while her application for the government-funded insurance program is being considered.",
      "\u201cThis way we cut out some of the red tape, we get them in as quickly as possible,\u201d said Rep. Marilyn Lands, the Democrat representing Huntsville who introduced the bill.",
      "Processing Medicaid applications can take weeks, Lands said, and physicians say early prenatal care is vital.",
      "Last year, nearly 1 in 5 pregnant Alabama women received prenatal care after five months of pregnancy, or otherwise received less than 50% of the appropriate number of the recommended visits throughout her pregnancy, according to The March of Dimes.",
      "The bill passed in the Alabama House of Representatives unanimously. It will now be considered by the Senate. Republicans celebrated the bill as a \u201cpro-life\u201d measure.",
      "Alabama\u2019s delivery health outcomes currently lag far behind the rest of the country.",
      "One study found Alabama had a maternal mortality rate of 64.63 deaths per 100,000 births between 2018 and 2021, nearly double the national rate of 34.09 per 100,000 births. That jumps to 100.07 deaths for Black women in the state.",
      "Other states have adopted a similar strategy for addressing some of the highest infant and maternal mortality rates across the country. Legislators in both Mississippi and Arkansas have introduced bills that would offer similar coverage to expectant mothers. Mississippi passed a law last year that was nearly identical to the Alabama legislation, but it was never implemented after negotiations with the federal Medicaid agency stalled, according to Mississippi Today.",
      "Alabama and Mississippi are among 10 states nationwide that have not expanded Medicaid, which means many low-income women are only eligible for Medicaid once they become pregnant.",
      "In Alabama, 1 in 6 women of childbearing age fall within the coverage gap, making too much to qualify for Medicaid but too little to afford private insurance, according to Alabama Arise, an advocacy group for low-income families.",
      "A pregnant woman in Alabama with no dependents can qualify for Medicaid if she makes $21,996 or less, or up to $37,704 if she is part of a household of three.",
      "Medicaid was used to pay for 45% of all births in Alabama in 2023, according to the most recent report published by the Alabama Department of Public Health. More than half of all infant deaths were to mothers who used Medicaid.",
      "Dr. Max Rogers, an obstetrician-gynecologist who works with many low-income pregnant women in rural communities, said medical care during the first trimester is essential for ensuring a woman is in a safe environment for carrying a pregnancy and identifying potentially lethal threats early on.",
      "\u201cThe longer you have to get blood pressure under control, or get diabetes under control, the long-term outcomes are going to be much, much better,\u201d Rogers said.",
      "Rogers\u2019 rural office was the fourth labor and delivery unit to close statewide in 2024. He was able to relocate an hour and a half south where he has continued seeing some of his patients \u2014 but the closures have left huge swaths of women in the state without access to prenatal care.",
      "Rogers says he supports the bill but that it will only be effective if other measures are taken to increase access to care.",
      "\u201cIf we don't make sure that a patient can get there and take advantage of services, it doesn't really have an impact, right?\u201d he said."

      "COLUMBIA, S.C. -- With a heartbeat abortion ban solidly in place in South Carolina, lawyers for the state and Planned Parenthood return to the state's highest court Wednesday to argue how restrictive the ban should be.",
      "The law is being enforced in South Carolina as a ban on almost all abortions around six weeks after conception, setting that mark as the time cardiac activity starts.",
      "But Planned Parenthood and other abortion rights groups are arguing the 2023 law includes alternative definitions about the timing of a fetal heart forming and a \u201cheartbeat\u201d starting and the true ban should start around nine or 10 weeks.",
      "Both sides are set to argue for just over an hour at the South Carolina Supreme Court in Columbia. The justices likely will take several months to decide the case. In the meantime, the abortion ban around six weeks likely will remain in place after a lower court upheld it.",
      "The 2023 law says abortions cannot be performed after an ultrasound can detect \u201ccardiac activity, or the steady and repetitive rhythmic contraction of the fetal heart, within the gestational sac.\u201d",
      "South Carolina and several other states place that at six weeks into development. But what follows the \u201cor\u201d in the sentence could require that a heart has formed, and medical experts say that doesn\u2019t happen until around nine weeks.",
      "The legal fight has been brewing since the state Supreme Court reversed itself after overturning a similar ban in 2021. The Republican-dominated General Assembly then made small changes and a justice who voted in the majority in the 3-2 decision to overturn the ban reached retirement age and was replaced.",
      "In the decision upholding the new ban, the state Supreme Court itself noted the different definitions saying resolving them would be a question \u201cfor another day.\u201d",
      "That day is Wednesday. Since then, more inconsistencies in the law\u2019s language have been brought up. The law refers to a fetal heartbeat, but most experts consider a fertilized egg to be an embryo for about 10 weeks after conception before transitioning into a fetus.",
      "Lawyers for the state said the parsing of the language ignores the intent of the Legislature. Both supporters and opponents of the bill called it nearly exclusively a six-week ban during debate in the House and Senate.",
      "Since the U.S. Supreme Court overturned Roe v. Wade in 2022 and ended a nationwide right to abortion, most Republican-controlled states have started enforcing new bans or restrictions and most Democrat-dominated ones have sought to protect abortion access.",
      "Currently, 13 states are enforcing bans on abortion at all stages of pregnancy, with limited exceptions, and South Carolina and three others have bans that kick in at or about six weeks into pregnancy -- often before women realize they\u2019re pregnant.",
      "The latest lawsuit was filed by South Carolina resident Taylor Shelton, who said she had sought medical attention for pain from her intrauterine device and was stunned to find out, just two days after missing her regularly-tracked period, that she was pregnant.",
      "She ended up in North Carolina, driving for hours to several appointments to undergo an abortion because doctors in South Carolina were unsure how to define a heartbeat. Shelton couldn\u2019t be completely sure she was within six weeks.",

      "A new study suggests that medications that have transformed the treatment of obesity may also help people drink less alcohol",
      "Medications that have transformed the treatment of obesity may also help people drink less alcohol, according to new government-funded research.",
      "The study was small \u2014 just 48 adults \u2014 and lasted just over two months, so it\u2019s not the final word. Experts say it\u2019s not yet clear how safe these drugs are for people who don\u2019t need to lose weight.",
      "But the results add to evidence from animal studies and reports that people are finding drugs like Ozempic and Wegovy helpful to manage cravings, not just for food, but also for tobacco and alcohol. Scientists are studying these drugs in smokers, people with opioid addiction and cocaine users.",
      "\u201cThis is such promising data. And we need more of it,\u201d said study co-author Dr. Klara Klein, of the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill, who treats patients with diabetes and obesity. \u201cWe frequently will hear that once people start these medications that their desire to drink is very reduced, if not completely abolished.\"",
      "The drugs, known as GLP-1 receptor agonists, work by mimicking hormones in the gut and the brain to regulate appetite and feelings of fullness. The new study looked at one of these drugs, semaglutide, which is the drug in Ozempic and Wegovy.",
      "The research, published Wednesday in the journal JAMA Psychiatry, was funded by the National Institute on Alcohol Abuse and Alcoholism, part of the National Institutes of Health.",
      "There are already three medications approved to treat alcohol use disorder, so until larger studies can confirm the findings, people should talk to their doctor about what's already available, said lead author Christian Hendershot, an addiction researcher at University of Southern California.",
      "For the new study, researchers recruited people who reported symptoms of alcohol use disorder, such as difficulty controlling their drinking, but weren\u2019t actively seeking treatment for it.",
      "First, each person came to a lab where they were served their favorite alcoholic beverage and could drink as much as they wanted over two hours.",
      "Then, researchers randomly assigned half the people to get a weekly injection of semaglutide. The other half got sham injections.",
      "For nine weeks, everyone kept track of their drinking habits and their desire for alcohol. A lab visit with their favorite alcohol was repeated at the end of the study.",
      "During the last weeks of the study, nearly 40% in the semaglutide group reported no heavy drinking days compared with 20% in the placebo group. And in the final lab test, the semaglutide group drank roughly half the amount, on average, compared to those who got the placebo.",
      "Everyone in the study was overweight. It's unclear how safe the drugs would be for a person of normal weight, Klein said.",
      "Smokers in the study who got the semaglutide also cut back on cigarettes, noted Luba Yammine of UTHealth Houston, who is leading other research on GLP-1 drugs for people who want to quit smoking. The finding is promising but more data is needed, Yammine said.",
      "The study \u201cprovides additional important information on the potential role of this new class of medications\u201d in treating certain addictions, said Dr. Lorenzo Leggio, an NIH researcher who is leading a 20-week trial of semaglutide for alcohol use disorder now underway in Baltimore.",

      "",
      "This is because we snuggle with and sleep in bed with our cats. When we're not looking, cats drink from our water glasses and walk on kitchen counters. So, cat owners should be aware of the ongoing spread of bird flu. \"By reducing the risk to your cats, you reduce the risk to yourself,\" Rasmussen said.",
      "",
      "Rasmussen doesn't think pet owners should be afraid their cats will give them bird flu but said taking precautions is good for pets, and for public health.",
      "",
      "Signs of bird flu in cats include runny nose and discharge around the eyes, explained Michael Q. Bailey, DVM, president-elect of the American Veterinary Medical Association.",
      "",
      "H5N1 also causes neurological problems like dizziness and seizures, which are symptoms of rabies, too. Rabies is almost always fatal, and it poses a threat to human health, so any animal suspected of having the viral disease must be euthanized. Bailey encourages people to ensure pets are up-to-date on their vaccinations.",
      "",
      "Veterinarian Jane Sykes, PhD, who specializes in infectious diseases in cats and dogs at the University of California Davis School of Veterinary Medicine, said people should not assume it's bird flu if their cat is sick  --  even if their animal spends time outdoors or eats a raw diet. Upper-respiratory illnesses are common in cats, while H5N1 is \"still pretty rare.\"",
      "",
      "Sykes gives her indoor cat, Freckles, regular kibble exclusively. She told NPR and KFF Health News she has no concerns about Freckles getting H5N1 because the heating process of making dry or canned pet food kills viruses.",
      "",
      "More Cases in Cats, More Risk to Humans",
      "",
      "Some people feed their pets raw meat or unpasteurized milk because they think it's a more nutritious or natural diet. The American Veterinary Medical Association's website discourages this due to foodborne pathogens like salmonella and listeria, and now the highly pathogenic H5N1.",
      "",
      "By keeping pets healthy, veterinarians play an essential role in protecting humans from zoonotic diseases. The American Veterinary Medical Association says the risk of H5N1 spilling over from a pet to a person is \"considered extremely low, but not zero.\"",
      "",
      "State and local public health agencies, including those in Los Angeles County and Washington state, have issued similar warnings against raw food diets for pets.",
      "",
      "Concerns for human health are partly why the FDA announced last month it is now requiring cat and dog food companies to update their safety plans to protect against bird flu.",
      "",
      "This came after the Oregon Department of Agriculture discovered a cat that was \"strictly an indoor cat\" had contracted H5N1 and died after consuming a frozen turkey product made by the raw pet food brand Northwest Naturals. It stated that \"tests confirmed a genetic match between the virus in the raw and frozen pet food and the infected cat.\"",
      "",
      "Northwest Naturals voluntarily recalled that batch of its frozen turkey-based product. The company told KFF Health News and NPR that the recall involved \"a small product run\" and that it has concerns about the accuracy of the Oregon Agriculture Department's testing.",
      "",
      "Los Angeles County's public health department said five cats from two households tested positive for bird flu after drinking unpasteurized raw milk from the Raw Farm dairy in California's Central Valley.",
      "",
      "Raw Farm voluntarily recalled its milk and cream after retail products tested positive for H5N1, but it denies any food safety issues, calling the concern \"a political issue.\"",
      "",
      "Veterinarians also warn pet owners not to allow cats unsupervised time outside as there's the risk of them getting H5N1 by interacting with other animals that might carry the disease.",
      "",
      "\"This is a very scary virus, given that it can infect so many different host species,\" said Bruce Kornreich, DVM, PhD, director of Cornell University's Feline Health Center.",
      "",
      "At least one instance of a cat infecting a person with bird flu occurred in 2016. As NPR reported, a veterinarian in New York City caught the virus after having close contact with infected cats. The vet experienced mild symptoms and quickly recovered.",
      "",
      "In that case, the strain of bird flu was H7N2, not the H5N1 that is now circulating in the U.S.",
      "",
      "H7N2 is a very different type of virus, Sykes explained. But she said it shows that cat-to-human transmission of avian influenza is theoretically possible.",
      "",
      "There isn't a lot of research on transmission of bird flu from companion animals like cats or dogs to humans, though Rasmussen agreed it's definitely a concern: The more infections you have in animals, \"the more your luck is potentially going to run out.\"",
      "",
      "Most people who have caught H5N1 are agricultural workers who had direct contact with infected poultry or cattle. Of at least 67 confirmed human cases of H5N1 in the U.S., there's been one fatality in an immunocompromised person who had contact with birds.",
      "",
      "In general, zoonotic disease researchers want more H5N1 surveillance in companion animals of all types. Even if the human death toll of H5N1 remains relatively low, it remains a public health risk.",
      "",
      "Chances for Mutation",
      "",
      "Part of the concern with this H5N1 outbreak is that bird flu viruses change. Just a few mutations could make this strain adept at spreading between people. And the more people who catch H5N1, the more likely it would adapt to be more efficient, said Suresh Kuchipudi, PhD, MVSc, a virologist at the University of Pittsburgh School of Public Health, where he researches zoonotic diseases. Kuchipudi has studied H5N1 in cats.",
      "",
      "Another concern is something called reassortment. If an animal or person is infected with two viruses at once, the viruses can trade genetic material, creating something new. This is common in influenza, so virologists are on the lookout for a case in which the bird flu reassorts to make a virus that's far more contagious, and potentially more virulent.",
      "",
      "Virologist Rasmussen is way more worried about this happening in pigs. Human respiratory physiology is more like that of swines than felines. So far, the current outbreak of H5N1 has not reached commercial hog operations. Rasmussen hopes it stays that way.",
      "",
      "Kuchipudi said that reassortments are relatively rare events, but the outcome is completely unpredictable. Sometimes the results are benign, though it was likely a reassortment that involved an avian virus that led to the 1918 flu pandemic, which killed an estimated 50 million people. In the century since, virologists have established a global surveillance network to monitor influenza viruses. Scientists say continued investment in this network is key to preparing for and hopefully preventing another pandemic.",
      "",
      "Winter is \"reassortment season\" because of all the influenza viruses circulating, Rasmussen said. A reassortment in cats could technically be possible since these pets occasionally get seasonal flu, but it's highly unlikely. Rather, Rasmussen said, it's more likely that a cat would pass H5N1 to a human who already has seasonal flu, and then a reassortment happens in the sick person. While the risk isn't zero, Rasmussen doubts this will happen. It would depend on how ill the human was, and how much virus they're exposed to from their cat.",
      "",
      "\"Unless the cat is really shedding a ton of virus, and you're kind of making out with the cat, I think it would be hard,\" she said.",
      "",
      "Rasmussen and Kuchipudi caution there isn't enough research to know for sure how much virus cats shed, or even how they shed the virus.",
      "",
      "The CDC was poised to release a new study about H5N1 in cats, but that was delayed when the Trump administration paused the Morbidity and Mortality Weekly Report. That investigation, revealed through emails obtained by KFF Health News in a public records request, found that house cats likely got bird flu from dairy workers.",
      "",
      "Scientists and public health agencies should question previously held assumptions about bird flu, Kuchipudi urged. He noted that 20 years ago nobody would have predicted that bird flu would infect dairy cattle the way it is now.",
      "",
      "Dogs Seem to Fare Better",
      "",
      "The FDA says other domesticated animals, including dogs, can get bird flu infections. There are no confirmed cases of H5N1 among dogs in the U.S., though in other countries they have died from the virus.",
      "",
      "There's some disagreement and an overall lack of research on whether cat biology makes them more susceptible to H5N1 than other mammals, including humans, pigs, or dogs.",
      "",
      "But cat behaviors, such as their love of dairy and predation of wild birds, put them at higher risk, Kuchipudi said. Also, living in groups might play a role as there are more feral cat colonies in the U.S. than packs of stray dogs.",
      "",
      "There's very little people can do about the H5N1 circulating in wild birds. As Rasmussen explained, \"It's flying around in the skies. It's migrating north and south with the seasons.\"",
      "",
      "But she said there's a lot people can do to keep the virus out of their homes.",
      "",
      "That includes limiting a pet's exposure to H5N1 by not feeding them raw food or unpasteurized milk, and trying to keep them from interacting with animals like rodents and wild birds that could be infected with the virus.",

      "It's too early in some legislative sessions to know whether the measures will get serious consideration. But it does show that the policy debate continues to evolve following the Supreme Court's 2022 ruling that overturned Roe v. Wade and opened the door to state bans on abortion.",
      "Here's a look at where things stand:",
      "Lawmakers in several states have introduced measures to classify the drugs mifepristone and misoprostol \u2014 which are used together in the majority of U.S. abortions \u2014 as controlled dangerous substances, making it a crime to possess them without prescriptions.",
      "Louisiana last year became the first state to adopt such a law, despite concerns from doctors who contended that the restrictions would make it harder for them to access the drugs to perform life-saving procedures.",
      "The measures have been introduced in states where Republicans control the government and where there are bans on abortion at all stages of pregnancy, with some exceptions.",
      "The legislation has died or appears unlikely to advance in Indiana and Mississippi.",

      "\u201cThe more often that they\u2019re introduced, the more normalized these sorts of bills and these sorts of concepts that they\u2019re pushing become,\u201d said Laura Hermer, a professor at Mitchell Hamline School of Law in St. Paul, Minnesota.",
      "Authorities in two states with stringent abortion laws have targeted a New York doctor for allegedly sending abortion pills to patients in those states.",
      "Last month, a Louisiana grand jury indicted Dr. Maggie Carpenter on charges of criminal abortion by means of abortion-inducing drugs, a felony. Texas Attorney General Ken Paxton sued Carpenter in civil court under similar circumstances.",
      "The legal actions set up a test of laws in some Democratic-controlled states, including New York, that seek to protect health care providers who use telehealth to prescribe and then mail abortion pills to patients in states where they're banned. New York officials say they will not extradite the doctor to Louisiana.",
      "Since Carpenter's indictment, New York Gov. Kathy Hochul signed a law that allows doctors to leave their names off prescription bottles for abortion pills as a way to further insulate them. Similar legislation has been introduced in Maine.",
      "The attorneys general of Idaho, Kansas and Missouri are also suing in federal court to roll back federal approvals for mifepristone and bar prescriptions for it by telehealth.",
      "Some advocates are calling on President Donald Trump to enforce an 1873 law to ban mailing medication or instruments used in abortion, but he has not done so.",
      "While critics say the drugs are unsafe, some major medical groups disagree. The American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists says there is decades of evidence that mifepristone and misoprostol are safe and effective. The group cited a study showing that major adverse events such as significant infection and excessive blood loss occur in less than 0.32% of patients taking mifepristone for a medication abortion. Medical organizations say mifepristone\u2019s safety compares to that of the over-the-counter pain medication ibuprofen.",

      "His audience only grew during the COVID-19 pandemic, when Kennedy devoted much of his time to a nonprofit that sued vaccine makers and harnessed social media campaigns to erode trust in vaccines as well as the government agencies that promote them.",

While serving as health secretary, he has promised to reroute fees collected from the arrangement to his son.",
      "Kennedy is expected to take over the agency in the midst of a massive federal government shakeup, led by billionaire Elon Musk, that has shut off \u2014 even if temporarily \u2014 billions of taxpayer dollars in public health funding and left thousands of federal workers unsure about their jobs.",
      "On Friday, the NIH announced it would cap billions of dollars in medical research given to universities and cancer being used to develop treatments for diseases like cancer and Alzheimer's.",
      "Kennedy, too, has called for a staffing overhaul at the NIH, FDA and CDC. Last year, he vowed to fire 600 employees at the NIH, the nation's largest funder of biomedical research."

      "This is what it looks like after the Trump administration halted U.S. foreign assistance last month. The U.S. Agency for International Development, USAID, issued stop-work orders during a 90-day review for what the administration has alleged is wasteful spending.",
      "Fares had been working in three clinics run by M\u00e9decins du Monde, or Doctors of the World, offering free health care to the displaced population in northern Syria, which until the fall of former President Bashar Assad in December had been the country's main rebel-held enclave. It sheltered millions of people who had fled years of civil war.",

      "\u201cIf the support is not resumed, there will be a major disaster and serious harm to vulnerable groups,\u201d said Fares, who heads the organization\u2019s medical programs. \u201cOperating costs of clinics are much lower than those of hospitals.

    "title": "Pope to remain hospitalized as doctors treat respiratory tract infection: Vatican",
    "published": "Mon, 17 Feb 2025 12:16:48 -0500",
    "summary": "The Vatican says Pope Francis&rsquo; respiratory tract infection is presenting a &ldquo;complex clinical picture&rdquo; that will require further hospitalization",
    "story": [
      "The Vatican says Pope Francis\u2019 respiratory tract infection is presenting a \u201ccomplex clinical picture\u201d that will require further hospitalization",
      "ROME -- Pope Francis\u2019 respiratory tract infection is presenting a \u201ccomplex clinical picture\u201d that will require further hospitalization, the Vatican said Monday, as concerns grew about the increasingly frail health of the 88-year-old pontiff.",
      "Vatican spokesman Matteo Bruni said the results of tests conducted in recent days and Monday indicate the pope is suffering from a polymicrobial respiratory tract infection that has necessitated a further change in his drug therapy. Scientists say polymicrobial diseases are caused by a mix of viruses, bacteria, fungi and parasites.",
      "There was no timeframe given for his hospitalization, which at Day 4 has already sidelined Francis for longer than a 2023 hospitalization for pneumonia. Bruni said the complexity of his symptoms \u201cwill require an appropriate hospital stay.\u201d",
      "Francis had part of one lung removed after a pulmonary infection as a young man and is prone to bouts of bronchitis in winter. He was admitted to Rome\u2019s Gemelli hospital in a \u201cfair\u201d condition on Friday after a weeklong bout of bronchitis worsened. Doctors confirmed a respiratory tract infection and prescribed \u201cabsolute rest\u201d alongside unspecified drug therapies. Subsequent updates said his slight fever had gone away and that he was in \u201cstable\u201d condition.",
      "Bruni said Francis ate breakfast and read the newspapers Monday morning after a third peaceful night. And in a sign Francis was still keeping up with some of the essentials of his routine, the parish priest of the Catholic Church in Gaza, the Rev. Gabriel Romanelli, reported that Francis had maintained his daily video call to the church on Friday and Saturday night. He sent a text message on Sunday.",
      "\u201cWe heard his voice. It's true, it was more tired,\u201d Romanelli told Vatican News. \u201cBut we heard his voice clearly and he listened to us,\u201d said the Argentine priest, whom Francis has phoned every day of the Gaza war.",
      "Bronchitis, or an inflammation of the airwaves, can be relatively mild in a healthy person but can become much more severe in someone who is older or has existing lung problems, especially when they are unable to cough up and expel the accumulating mucus. Bacteria and other organisms can colonize, leading to further infection that may be harder to treat.",
      "Dr. Maor Sauler, who specializes in adult pulmonary medicine and critical care at Yale School of Medicine, said it's not uncommon for people suffering from bronchitis to develop an infection with more than one organism in their lungs. The concern, however, is that antibiotics and other drug therapies don't work in isolation and require the body to respond, which given Francis' other problems may make recovery more challenging.",
      "\"Being older, wheelchair-bound, all those are risk factors for a situation in which we can\u2019t treat it despite our best efforts,\u201d said Sauler, who is not involved in Francis' care.",
      "As people get older, their immune systems don\u2019t work as well, making doctors especially concerned when elderly patients develop multiple problems. A decline in lung function and muscle strength can also impair the body's ability to effectively clear respiratory secretions, increasing susceptibility to infections like pneumonia, a deeper and far more serious infection of the lungs\u2019 air sacs.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s in the public record that he\u2019s had chest problems in the past, he\u2019s been admitted to hospital with pneumonia (in 2023), he's had part of one lung removed,\" noted Dr. Nick Hopkinson, clinical director of the Asthma+Lung UK foundation, who is not involved in Francis' treatment. \u201cAll of that makes him a little bit more vulnerable potentially, but we just have to wait and see.\u201d",
      "He said that after doctors have identified clinically what is wrong, they can start treating the underlying infection with the correct therapies.",
      "The Argentine pope is a known workaholic who keeps up a grueling pace despite his increasingly precarious health.",
      "In addition to his frequent bouts of respiratory infections in winter, he uses a wheelchair, walker or cane because of bad knees and suffers from sciatica nerve pain. In 2021 he had 33 centimeters (13 inches) of his colon removed because of a narrowing, and then had a further surgery in 2023 to remove intestinal scar tissue and repair an abdominal hernia.",
      "When he had a bad case of pneumonia in 2023, he left the hospital after three days and only acknowledged after the fact that he had been admitted urgently after feeling faint and having a sharp pain in his chest. This time around, Francis insisted on finishing his morning audiences Friday before leaving the Vatican, even though he was having trouble speaking at length because he was so short of breath.",
      "Francis\u2019 continued hospitalization has already forced the cancellation of some events connected to the Vatican\u2019s Holy Year and put others in question. The official Vatican calendar online has no more papal appointments or activities for February, and picks up only on March 5, Ash Wednesday. This week\u2019s weekly general audience was canceled.",
      "Outside the Gemelli hospital, people were praying for the pope, including Nigerian nuns in front of a giant statue of St. John Paul II. He had so many hospitalizations at Gemelli that the main entry way is decorated with a permanent photo exhibition of his ailments over the course of his quarter-century pontificate.",
      "Sister Mary Beatrice Nnenji said prayers were necessary \u201cbecause no one is strong enough on their own.\u201d",
      "\u201cWith age also you feel your health and especially with his workload and all the efforts he makes,\u201d she said. \u201cSo if God wants he will go on. Let\u2019s hope in God, we cannot go against it, whatever comes.\u201d",

      "The jockeying for position by Europe, Ukraine's top military and financial backer along with the U.S., comes as the Trump administration has quickly sought to mediate an end to the fighting three years after Russia's full-scale invasion of Ukraine.",

      "\u201cThe first phase is the pre-negotiation, and this is a moment when we need to rearm Ukraine and put maximum pressure on Russia, which means sanctions, which means frozen assets, so that Ukraine begins these negotiations from a position of strength,\" Stubb said.",

      "U.S. President Donald Trump's push for a quick way out of Russia's all-out war in Ukraine stirred concern and uncertainty in Munich.",
      "After a phone call with Russian President Vladimir Putin last week, Trump said that he and Putin would likely meet soon to negotiate a peace deal over Ukraine. Trump later assured Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy he also would have a seat at the table. U.S. officials have indicated that European nations, however, wouldn't be involved.",
      "\u201cDon\u2019t underestimate Trump as a negotiator. I genuinely believe that Putin is baffled and afraid what might be coming from there,\" Stubb said. \"Right now, the ball is in our court here in Europe. We need to convince the Americans where\u2019s the value added, and then get back into the table.\u201d",
      "\u201cI think in Europe we need to talk less and do more,\u201d he said later.",
      "President Edgars Rink\u0113vi\u010ds of Latvia, which like Finland borders Russia, agreed that \u201cif we are strong, if we have something to offer ... then we are going to be interesting to the United States.

      "He also noted \u201ca point that probably went unnoticed Friday\u201d in Munich, which was European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen's \u201cimportant announcement\u201d that she would propose a temporary waiver of EU budgetary rules in crisis situations \u2014 this time to allow for extra defense spending.",
      "\u201cI can announce that I will propose to activate the \u2018escape clause\u2019 for defense investments,\" she said. \"This will allow member states to substantially increase their defense expenditure. Of course, we will have to do this in a controlled and conditional way.\u201d",

      "\u201cThe risk that Russia will occupy Europe is 100%,\u201d he said in comments to the \u201cMeet the Press\u201d program recorded Friday.",
      "On Saturday, Zelenskyy told The Associated Press that he had directed his ministers not to sign off on a proposed agreement to give the United States access to Ukraine\u2019s rare earth minerals, because the document was too focused on U.S. interests.",
      "The proposal was a key part of his talks with U.S. Vice President JD Vance on the sidelines of the Munich event, according to one current and one former senior Ukrainian official familiar with the talks. Zelenskyy\u2019s decision not to sign a deal, at least for now, was described as \u201cshortsighted\u201d by a senior White House official.",

      "PALMYRA, Syria -- Experts are returning to Syria\u2019s war-ravaged heritage sites, hoping to lay the groundwork for restoring them and reviving tourism, which they say could provide a much-needed boost to the country\u2019s decimated economy after nearly 14 years of war.",
      "Once-thriving landmarks like the ancient city of Palmyra and the medieval Crusader castle of Crac des Chevaliers remain scarred by years of conflict, but local tourists are returning to the sites, and conservationists hope their historical and cultural significance will eventually draw international visitors back.",
      "One of Syria\u2019s six UNESCO World Heritage sites, Palmyra was once a key hub to the ancient Silk Road network linking the Roman and Parthian empires to Asia. Located in the Syrian desert, it is renowned for its 2,000-year-old Roman-era ruins. It is now marked by shattered columns and damaged temples.",
      "Before the Syrian uprising that began in 2011 and soon escalated into a brutal civil war, Palmyra was Syria\u2019s main tourist destination, attracting around 150,000 visitors monthly, Ayman Nabu, a researcher and expert in ruins told The Associated Press. Dubbed the \u201cBride of the Desert,\u201d he said \u201cPalmyra revitalized the steppe and used to be a global tourist magnet.\u201d",
      "The ancient city was the capital of an Arab client state of the Roman Empire that briefly rebelled and carved out its own kingdom in the third century, led by Queen Zenobia.",
      "In more recent times, the area had darker associations. It was home to Tadmur prison, where thousands of opponents of the Assad family\u2019s rule in Syria were reportedly tortured. The Islamic State group demolished the prison after capturing the town.",
      "IS militants later destroyed Palmyra\u2019s historic temples of Bel and Baalshamin and the Arch of Triumph, viewing them as monuments to idolatry, and beheaded an elderly antiquities scholar who had dedicated his life to overseeing the ruins.",
      "Between 2015 and 2017, control of Palmyra shifted between IS and the Syrian army before Assad\u2019s forces, backed by Russia and Iran-aligned militias, recaptured it. They established military bases in the neighboring town, which was left heavily damaged and largely abandoned. Fakhr al-Din al-Ma\u2019ani Castle, a 16th-century fortress overlooking the city, was repurposed by Russian troops as a military barracks.",
      "Nabu, the researcher, visited Palmyra five days after the fall of the former government.",
      "\u201cWe saw extensive excavation within the tombs,\u201d he said, noting significant destruction by both IS and Assad government forces. \u201cThe (Palmyra) museum was in a deplorable state, with missing documents and artifacts \u2014 we have no idea what happened to them.\u201d",
      "At the theater, the Tetrapylon, and other ruins along the main colonnaded street, Nabu said they documented many illegal drillings revealing sculptures, as well as theft and smuggling of funerary or tomb-related sculptures in 2015 when IS had control of the site. While seven of the stolen sculptures were retrieved and put in a museum in Idlib, 22 others were smuggled out, Nabu added. Many pieces likely ended up in underground markets or private collections.",
      "Inside the city\u2019s underground tombs, Islamic verses are scrawled on the walls, while plaster covers wall paintings, some depicting mythological themes that highlight Palmyra\u2019s deep cultural ties to the Greco-Roman world.",
      "\u201cSyria has a treasure of ruins,\u201d Nabu said, emphasizing the need for preservation efforts. He said Syria\u2019s interim administration, led by the Islamist former insurgent group Hayat Tahrir al-Sham, has decided to wait until after the transition phase to develop a strategic plan to restore heritage sites.",
      "The U.N.\u2019s scientific, educational and cultural organization UNESCO, said in a statement that the agency had since 2015, \u201cremotely supported the protection of Syrian cultural heritage\" through satellite analyses, reports and documentation and recommendations to local experts, but it did not conduct any work on site.",
      "It added that UNESCO has explored possibilities for technical assistance if security conditions improve. In 2019, international experts convened by UNESCO said detailed studies would need to be done before starting major restorations.",
      "Beyond Palmyra, other historical sites bear the scars of war.",
      "Perched on a hill near the town of Al-Husn, with sweeping views, Crac des Chevaliers, a medieval castle originally built by the Romans and later expanded by the Crusaders, was heavily bombarded during the Syrian civil war.",
      "On a recent day, armed fighters in military uniform roamed the castle grounds alongside local tourists, taking selfies among the ruins.",
      "Hazem Hanna, an architect and head of the antiquities department of Crac des Chevaliers, pointed to the collapsed columns and an entrance staircase obliterated by airstrikes. Damage from government airstrikes in 2014 destroyed much of the central courtyard and the arabesque-adorned columns, Hanna said.",
      "\u201cRelying on the cultural background of Syria\u2019s historical sites and their archaeological and historical significance to enthusiasts worldwide, I hope and expect that when the opportunity arises for tourists to visit Syria, we will witness a significant tourism revival,\" he said.",
      "Some sections of Crac des Chevaliers were renovated after airstrikes and the deadly 7.8 magnitude earthquake in 2023 that struck a wide area of neighboring Turkey and also Syria, Hanna said. However, much of the castle remains in ruins.",
      "Both Nabu and Hanna believe restoration will take time. \u201cWe need trained technical teams to evaluate the current condition of the ruin sites,\u201d Nabu said.",
      "In Northwest Syria, more than 700 abandoned Byzantine settlements called Dead Cities, stretch across rocky hills and plains, their weathered limestone ruins featuring remnants of stone houses, basilicas, tombs and colonnaded streets. Despite partial collapse, arched doorways, intricate carvings and towering church facades endure, surrounded by olive trees that root deep into history.",
      "Dating back to the first century, these villages once thrived on trade and agriculture. Today, some sites now shelter displaced Syrians, with stone houses repurposed as homes and barns, their walls blackened by fire and smoke. Crumbling structures suffer from poor maintenance and careless repurposing.",
      "Looters have ravaged the ancient sites, Nabu said, leaving gaping holes in search of artifacts. Local visitors carve names and messages into centuries-old walls. Sheep enclosures dot the ruins, plastic debris blending with ancient stone.",
      "Moustafa Al-Kaddour, a local resident, returned after eight years. Touring the ruins with family members he brought from Quneitra, he reflected on childhood memories.",
      "\u201cThis is where we went to school,\u201d he said, pointing in the distance. \u201cIn the middle of class, we used to leave and come here to see the ruins.\u201d",

      "KURRAM, Pakistan -- Militants in northwestern Pakistan killed a driver and a security official Monday when they ambushed a convoy of trucks carrying food, medicine and other supplies for thousands of residents trapped by sectarian violence, authorities said.",
      "It was the third such assault since January in Kurram, a district in the restive Khyber Pakhtunkhwa province, where at least 130 people have died in recent months in clashes between rival Shiite and Sunni tribes.",
      "The latest attack happened when the trucks were heading to Parachinar, the main city in Kurram, police officials said.",
      "Qaiser Abbas, a doctor at a hospital in Parachinar, said a truck driver and one of the security officials escorting the convoy was killed in the attack. He said they also received 15 wounded people after the attack.",
      "Local authorities said police had launched an operation to apprehend the perpetrators of the attack. Authorities say some of the aid trucks were looted and burned by the attackers.",
      "Militants in recent months have also stepped up attacks on security forces in the northwestern North and South Waziristan regions bordering Afghanistan, where troops often carry out raids on militant hideouts.",
      "In the latest such raids on Saturday, four soldiers and 15 militants were killed in Dera Ismail Khan and North Waziristan districts.",
      "The military said the killed militants were from the Pakistani Taliban, who are known as Tehrik-e-Taliban Pakistan or TTP, and are allies of the Afghan Taliban. TTP is a separate group and has been emboldened since the Afghan Taliban came into power in Afghanistan in 2022."

      "Vatican authorities said Monday that Pope Francis has a complex infection in his respiratory system and will require more targeted drug treatment",
      "LONDON -- Vatican authorities said Monday that Pope Francis has a complex infection in his respiratory system and will require more targeted drug treatment. Officials said the 88-year-old pope is suffering from a \u201cpolymicrobial respiratory tract infection,\u201d but gave no further details on the severity of his illness or what would change in his treatment. Here\u2019s a look at the Pope\u2019s latest diagnosis and what his treatment could involve.",
      "Essentially, it means there\u2019s a mix of bacteria, viruses, fungi or parasites growing in someone\u2019s lungs.",
      "\u201cOften times, people will get a bronchitis or an airway infection and that can often start a cascade of multiple problems, including infections in the lungs,\u201d said Dr. Maor Sauler, who specializes in adult pulmonary and critical care medicine at Yale University's School of Medicine. He said such issues were common in older people whose immune systems might be weaker or had complex health issues.",
      "\u201cIt likely means he has more than one organism in his lungs,\u201d Sauler said, explaining that the pope\u2019s doctors might have to adjust his treatment to make sure the antibiotics attack all the various organisms.",
      "For someone with the pope\u2019s medical history \u2014 he lost part of his right lung decades ago and has previously had pneumonia \u2014 it\u2019s worrying that he\u2019s been hospitalized.",
      "Dr. Nick Hopkinson, medical director of Britain\u2019s Asthma and Lung Foundation, said most healthy people would likely recover quickly from bronchitis.",
      "But in people whose lungs are already damaged, \u201cbacteria can come and colonize the airways \u2026 and you start to see infections which makes it more difficult to treat.\u201d In people with lungs that have been previously compromised, they might need help breathing, including oxygen support or chest physiotherapy to help them clear fluids building up in their lungs.",
      "Still, Hopkinson said that getting the pope on the right medications should help.",
      "\u201cIf they\u2019ve identified particular things to treat, they can treat those and he\u2019ll start to recover.\u201d",
      "That depends. Antibiotic treatments typically take from a few days up to about two weeks. Hopkinson said the pope might be given various medicines, including ones that people typically take for asthma or conditions like chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, in addition to getting physiotherapy to help keep his chest as clear as possible.",
      "\u201cSome infections require prolonged treatment because they\u2019re just harder to clear from the system,\u201d Hopkinson said. \u201cIt sounds like they\u2019ve identified the bugs that are responsible and they\u2019ll be able to treat those\u2026but we\u2019ll just have to wait and see.\u201d",
      "Dr. Peter Openshaw, a lung expert at Imperial College London, said the presence of multiple organisms wasn\u2019t unusual in people with complex medical histories but could be hard to manage.",
      "Pneumonia is a likely worry.",
      "\u201cEven though we can treat pneumonias with antibiotics, pneumonias are also one of the leading causes of death,\u201d said Sauler of Yale University. He said antibiotics don\u2019t work in isolation and that a person\u2019s immune system is also critical to fighting off pneumonia, pointing out that the immune systems in older people aren\u2019t usually as resilient.",
      "\u201cWhen you\u2019re 88 years old, the age of the pope, then all of a sudden you have risk factors that makes the situation tougher than just a routine pneumonia.\u201d",
      "Sauler said the biggest thing to watch out for in the coming days is any sign that the pope is getting worse.",
      "\u201cI\u2019d be most interested in making sure he\u2019s not worsening despite the best efforts (of his doctors). That\u2019s usually a bad prognostic sign,\u201d he said, adding that they would likely review his condition in a few days to see whether or not the prescribed drugs are working.",

      "VIENNA -- The city of Villach in southern Austria is in shock after a man stabbed six passersby in broad daylight, killing a 14-year-old boy and wounding five others, as police tried to establish a motive that put migration in the spotlight.",
      "Residents began placing candles at the site of the attack in the city of about 60,000 inhabitants. A group of young people, who knew the boy who died in Saturday's attack, gathered at the crime scene on Sunday morning to mourn and tearfully light candles, local media reported.",
      "The 23-year-old suspect, who was detained shortly after the stabbing, is a Syrian with a residence permit in Austria. A 42-year-old man, also a Syrian working for a food delivery company, witnessed the attack from his car. He drove toward the suspect and helped to prevent the situation from escalating, police spokesperson Rainer Dionisio told Austria\u2019s public broadcaster ORF.",
      "Austria\u2019s President Alexander Van der Bellen called the attack \u201chorrific.\u201d",

      "The Free Syrian Community of Austria issued a statement on Facebook distancing itself from the attack and expressing its deepest condolences to the victims\u2019 families. \u201cWe all had to flee Syria, our home country, because we were no longer safe there \u2014 no one left their country voluntarily. We are grateful to have found asylum and protection in Austria,\u201d the association said.",
      "\u201cFinally, we would like to emphasize: Anyone who causes strife and disturbs the peace of society does not represent the Syrians who have sought and received protection here,\u201d the statement concluded.",
      "Dionisio said that a motive for the attack was not immediately known and police were investigating the suspect's background.",
      "Villach, a popular tourist destination near the borders of Italy and Slovenia, is known for its laid-back atmosphere, which blends Mediterranean and Alpine traditions. The city hosts annual carnival processions in March and an event on Saturday was canceled in the wake of the attack.",
      "The Austrian Ministry of Interior activated a platform for witnesses to upload videos or photos related to the attack. Interior Minister Gerhard Karner is expected in Villach on Sunday for a press conference. Local authorities said a crisis response team will be available to support pupils when schools open on Monday.",
      "The victims were all men, with two seriously wounded and two sustaining minor injuries, police said. Later Saturday, police said a fifth person was also injured.",
      "Peter Kaiser, the governor of the province of Carinthia, expressed his condolences to the family of the 14-year-old.",
      "\u201cThis outrageous atrocity must be met with harsh consequences. I have always said with clarity and unambiguously: Those who live in Carinthia, in Austria, have to respect the law and adjust to our rules and values,\" he said.",
      "Far-right leader Herbert Kickl wrote on X that he is \u201cappalled by the horrific act in Villach\u201d and called for a rigorous crackdown on asylum.",
      "\u201cAt the same time, I am angry \u2014 angry at those politicians who have allowed stabbings, rapes, gang wars and other capital crimes to become the order of the day in Austria. This is a first-class failure of the system, for which a young man in Villach has now had to pay with his life,\u201d Kickl said.",
      "\u201cFrom Austria to the EU \u2014 the wrong rules are in force everywhere. Nobody is allowed to challenge them, everything is declared sacrosanct,\u201d he said, adding that his party had outlined what he viewed as necessary changes to immigration laws in its election platform.",

      "He finished second in the race for Moscow mayor in 2013 amid allegations of vote rigging. In 2017, he announced plans to run for president and set up a sprawling network of regional offices across the country, recruiting local activists. When he was eventually barred from running, he kept those offices open, extending his reach across Russia\u2019s 11 time zones.",
      "In 2020, Navalny was poisoned with a nerve agent attack he blamed on the Kremlin, which always denied involvement. His family and allies fought to have him flown to Germany for treatment and recovery. Five months later, he returned to Russia, where he was immediately arrested and imprisoned for the last three years of his life.",
      "But even behind bars, in incredibly harsh conditions of constant pressure and surveillance, Navalny found a way to relay messages. His popular social media accounts were regularly updated with sarcastic vignettes about prison life and political statements.",
      "Authorities blamed Navalny's death, announced Feb. 16, 2024, on natural causes \u2014 a sudden spike in blood pressure and chronic diseases. His family and allies reject that and insist he was killed on orders from the Kremlin \u2014 accusations its officials deny.",
      "Tens of thousands of people attended his funeral in Moscow on March 1 in a rare show of defiance in a country where any street rally or even single pickets often result in immediate arrest. For days afterward, people brought flowers to his grave.",
      "Longtime ally Vladimir Ashurkov described Navalny as \u201ca political figure that basically defined the generation of Russians over the last 15 years.\u201d",
      "\u201cWhile he was alive, even from prison, he was raising his voice against the war and against Putin\u2019s tyranny,\u201d Ashurkov told AP in London.",
      "His widow, Yulia Navalnaya, has vowed to continue his fight. She has recorded regular video addresses to her supporters and has met Western leaders and top officials, advocating for Russians who oppose Putin and his war in Ukraine.",
      "Navalny\u2019s Anti-Corruption Foundation continues to expose corruption in Russia in colorful videos and organizes occasional protests abroad, condemning Putin and the war in Ukraine.",
      "A landmark East-West prisoner swap in August freed other key dissidents like Ilya Yashin and Vladimir Kara-Murza, promising to reinvigorate the opposition movement unmoored by Navalny\u2019s death. So far, however, they haven\u2019t gone beyond meetings with Western officials and supporters in exile, or a few rallies -\u2013 actions unlikely to dent Putin\u2019s war effort or his ever-growing crackdowns that sweep up remaining dissidents and ordinary Russians alike.",
      "Ashurkov describes the situation in Russia and Ukraine now as \u201cdark times\u201d and \u201cdifficult times.\u201d",
      "But he notes that Navalny went through many difficulties and pressure in his life.",
      "\"His advice and his motivation to all of us has been, \u2018Don\u2019t sit still. Try to do something to change the situation, and be prepared for change\u2019,\u201d he said.",

      "Egypt is developing a plan to rebuild Gaza without forcing Palestinians out of the strip in a counter to President Donald Trump\u2019s proposal to depopulate the territory so the U.S. can take it over",
      "CAIRO -- Egypt is developing a plan to rebuild Gaza without forcing Palestinians out of the strip in a counter to President Donald Trump\u2019s proposal to depopulate the territory so the U.S. can take it over.",
      "Egypt\u2019s state-run Al-Ahram newspaper said the proposal calls for establishing \u201csecure areas\u201d within Gaza where Palestinians can live initially while Egyptian and international construction firms remove and rehabilitate the strip\u2019s infrastructure.",
      "Egyptian officials have been discussing the plan with European diplomats as well as with Saudi Arabia, Qatar and the United Arab Emirates, according to two Egyptian officials and Arab and Western diplomats. They are also discussing ways to fund the reconstruction, including an international conference on Gaza reconstruction, said one of the Egyptian officials and an Arab diplomat.",
      "The officials and diplomats spoke on condition of anonymity because the proposal is still being negotiated.",
      "The proposal comes after an international uproar over Trump\u2019s call for the removal of Gaza\u2019s population of some 2 million Palestinians. Trump said the United States would take over the Gaza Strip and rebuild it into a \u201cRiviera of the Middle East,\u201d though Palestinians would not be allowed back.",
      "Palestinians have widely said they will not leave their homeland, while Egypt, Jordan \u2013 backed by Saudi Arabia \u2013 have refused Trump\u2019s calls for them to take in Gaza\u2019s population. Rights groups have widely said the plan amounts to forced expulsion, a potential war crime. European countries have also largely denounced Trump\u2019s plan. Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu has praised the idea and says Israel is preparing to implement it.",
      "U.S. Secretary of State Marco Rubio, who was in Saudi Arabia on Monday in a tour of the region, has said the United States was up to hearing alternative proposals. \u201cIf the Arab countries have a better plan, then that\u2019s great,\u201d Rubio said Thursday on the U.S. radio program \u201cClay and Buck Show.\u201d",
      "Egypt\u2019s Al-Ahram newspaper said the proposal is designed to \u201crefute American President Trump\u2019s logic\u201d and counter \u201cany other visions or plans that aim to change the geographic and demographic structure of Gaza Strip.\u201d",
      "Gaza is nearing a critical juncture with the first phase of a ceasefire due to run out in early March. Israel and Hamas must still negotiate a second phase meant to bring a release of all remaining hostages held by the militants, a full Israeli withdrawal from Gaza and a long-term halt to the war.",
      "Any reconstruction plan will be impossible to implement without a deal on the second phase, including an agreement on who will govern Gaza in the long term. Israel demands the elimination of Hamas as a political or military force in the territory, and international donors are unlikely to contribute to any rebuilding if Hamas is in charge.",
      "Central in Egypt\u2019s proposal is the establishment of a Palestinian administration that is not aligned with either Hamas or the Palestinian Authority to run the strip and oversee the reconstruction efforts, according to the two Egyptian officials involved in the efforts.",
      "It also calls for a Palestinian police force mainly made up of former Palestinian Authority policemen who remained in Gaza after Hamas took over the enclave in 2007, with reinforcement from Egyptian- and Western-trained forces.",
      "Asked about the possibility of deploying an Arab force in Gaza one Egyptian official and the Arab diplomat said Arab countries would only agree if there were a \u201cclear path\u201d for the establishment of an independent Palestinian state. Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu has rejected any Palestinian state as well as any role for Hamas or the Western-backed Palestinian Authority in governing Gaza, though he has not put forward any clear alternative.",
      "Hamas has said it is willing to give up power in Gaza. Hamas spokesman Abdul Latif al-Qanou told The Associated Press on Sunday that the group has accepted either a Palestinian unity government without Hamas\u2019 participation or a committee of technocrats to run the territory. The Palestinian Authority, which governs pockets of the West Bank, has so far opposed any plans for Gaza that exclude it.",
      "The Western diplomat said France and Germany have backed the idea of Arab countries developing a counterproposal to Trump\u2019s plan, and that Egyptian President Abdel Fattah el-Sissi discussed his government's efforts with the French president in a phone call earlier this month.",
      "Egyptian Foreign Minister Badr Abdelatty also briefed the German foreign minister and other EU officials on the sidelines of last week\u2019s Munich security conference, one of the Egyptian officials said.",
      "Officials from Egypt, Saudi Arabia, Qatar, the United Arab Emirates and Jordan will discuss Egypt\u2019s proposal at a gathering in Riyadh this week, before introducing it to the Arab summit later this month, according to the two Egyptian officials and the Arab diplomat.",
      "Isarel\u2019s 16-month campaign in Gaza, triggered by Hamas\u2019 Oct. 7, 2023 attack, devastated the territory. Around a quarter million housing units have been destroyed or damaged, according to U.N. estimates. More than 90% of the roads and more than 80% of health facilities have been damaged or destroyed. Damage to infrastructure has been estimated at some $30 billion, along with an estimated $16 billion in damaged to housing.",
      "Egypt\u2019s plan calls for a three-phase reconstruction process that will take up to five years without removing Palestinians from Gaza, the Egyptian officials said.",
      "It designates three \u201csafe zones\u201d within Gaza to relocate Palestinians during an initial six-month \u201cearly recovery period.\u201d The zones will be equipped with mobile houses and shelters, with humanitarian aid streaming in.",
      "More than two dozen Egyptian and international firms would take part in removing the rubble and rebuilding the strip\u2019s infrastructure. The reconstruction would provide tens of thousands of jobs to Gaza\u2019s population, the officials said."

Their presence in central Bukavu is an unprecedented expansion of the rebels' reach in their yearslong fighting with Congolese forces. Unlike in 2012 when they only seized Goma in the fighting connected to ethnic tension, analysts have said the rebels this time are eyeing political power.",

Rwanda has claimed the Tutsis are being persecuted by Hutus and former militias responsible for the 1994 genocide of 800,000 Tutsis and others in Rwanda. Many Hutus fled to Congo after the genocide and founded the Democratic Forces for the Liberation of Rwanda militia group.

      "The visit by Liu Zhongyi, China\u2019s vice minister of public security and commissioner of the Criminal Investigation Bureau, was part of a stepped-up effort by the three countries to address the online scam problem, Thailand\u2019s Deputy Prime Minister Phumtham Wechayachai told reporters.",
      "Areas of Myanmar bordering Thailand have been serving as havens for criminal syndicates employing an estimated hundreds of thousands of people from Southeast Asia and elsewhere who help carry out online scams including false romantic ploys, bogus investment pitches and illegal gambling schemes.",
      "Such scams have cost victims around the world tens of billions of dollars, while the people recruited to carry them out have often been tricked into taking the jobs under false pretenses and find themselves trapped in virtual slavery.",
      "Last week, some 260 people from 20 nations, including many from Africa, crossed from Myanmar into Thailand after they were reportedly rescued from scam centers.",
      "On a visit to China in early February, Thai Prime Minister Paetongtarn Shinawatra vowed along with China\u2019s leader Xi Jinping to crack down on the scam networks. Just ahead of her visit, Thailand cut off electricity, internet and gas supplies to several areas in Myanmar along the border, citing national security and severe damage that Thailand has suffered from scam operations.",
      "The repatriations of foreign workers from Myanmar have been organized by the Border Guard Force in Myawaddy, a militia of the Karen ethnic minority that exercises control over the area. However, critics have accused it of being involved in the criminal activities, at least to the extent of providing protection to the scam centers.",
      "The group's leader, Saw Chit Thu, denied in a news conference on Monday that his group was involved in scam activities, but acknowledged business links to some properties hosting the centers, which he said initially operated simply as resorts.",
      "Thai media reported last week that Thailand's Department of Special Investigation was considering seeking arrest warrants for Chit Thu and others for alleged human trafficking.",
      "Thai officials have said as many as 7,000-10,000 more people may be repatriated, but Phumtham cautioned that Thailand would only receive those that are ready to be taken back right away by their home countries.",
      "The Bangkok Post newspaper reported that an initial batch of about 600 Chinese nationals from scam centers are expected to be flown back to China on chartered flights when Liu concludes his visit.",
      "Liu visited the border areas in Thailand\u2019s Tak province on Monday and appeared in Myawaddy in Myanmar, apparently at a location where hundreds of people believed to have been rounded up from several scam centers are being held awaiting repatriation.",

      "\u201cThis is part of our joint efforts to eradicate the scourge of online gambling and telecom fraud, and to maintain the safety of people\u2019s lives and property and the order of exchanges and cooperation among regional countries.\u201d",
      "Dramatic stories of Chinese people being lured to work in Thailand only to be trafficked into a scam compound in Myanmar spread widely on social media in China, causing alarm and denting Thailand's reputation as a safe destination for Chinese visitors.",
      "Among those trapped was Chinese actor Wang Xing, who arrived in Thailand on a promise of getting a job and was abducted to Myanmar. He was quickly rescued after the incident circulated on social media.",
      "An earlier crackdown on scam centers in Myanmar was initiated in late 2023, after China expressed embarrassment and concern over illegal casinos and scam operations along its border in Myanmar\u2019s northern Shan state.",
      "Ethnic guerrilla groups with close ties to Beijing shut down many operations, and an estimated 45,000 Chinese nationals suspected of involvement were repatriated."

      "One of Ukraine\u2019s largest steel plants lies in the country\u2019s industrial east, where Russia\u2019s 3-year invasion of its neighbor threatens to throttle production at any moment",
      "ZAPORIZHZHIA, Ukraine -- The steel mill in a partially occupied region of Ukraine is a dystopian maze of flames, chutes and tentacled pipes, vast enough to be a small city. Thunderous blazes of sparks flash above the open furnaces where workers smelt iron ore into streams of molten metal day and night.",
      "The Zaporizhstal Iron and Steelworks, one of Ukraine\u2019s largest steel plants, lies in the country\u2019s industrial east, where Russia's 3-year invasion of its neighbor threatens to throttle production at any moment. Daily battles unfold along a front line 40 kilometers (25 miles) away as the plant churns out materials for military equipment and for foreign manufacturers to use in cars, appliances, and construction.",
      "\u201cMorale is not as high as it was before. We are pretty tired here,\u201d plant supervisor Serhii Zhyvotchenko said, reflecting on the hardships. \u201cBut there is no way to go back; the only way is forward.\u201d",
      "Last week, though, a second war came to the doorstep of the hulking factory complex: the possible trade war that U.S. President Donald Trump has provoked since returning to office four weeks ago. Trump imposed tariffs of at least 25% on all imported steel and aluminum, a decision that could hurt an essential sector of Ukraine's battered economy.",
      "Ukrainian government officials and business leaders were shocked by Trump\u2019s Feb. 10 executive order, which underscored Ukraine's growing precarity in relation to its most important Western ally. The president maintains that imposing a variety of tariffs will level the playing field in international trade and make U.S. factories more competitive.",
      "The steel industry\u2019s share of Ukraine's gross domestic product has dropped by almost half since Russian troops entered the country, and steel exports are substantially below pre-war levels. The Ukrainian Steel Association warned that if the U.S. import duties take effect as planned on March 12, it would cost the weakened industry 2.4 billion hryvnias ($58 million) in revenue and the government 1 billion hryvnias ($24 million) in taxes a year.",
      "The tariff order was not the only action by the president or his administration to cause alarm in Kyiv last week. Trump signaled changing winds in U.S. policy by having a direct call with Russian President Vladimir Putin, whom former President Joe Biden and other Western leaders had tried to isolate since Putin sent troops into Ukraine.",
      "Trump also said that he would \u201cprobably\u201d meet in person with the Russian leader in the near future, heightening concerns that Kyiv would be left out of or undermined in any ceasefire talks. Comments by both the president and U.S. Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth rejecting NATO membership for Ukraine further reinforced the fear that the country no longer had Washington in its corner.",
      "Earlier this month, Trump indicated that he wanted to gain access to Ukraine's rare earth materials as a condition for continued U.S. support in the country's defense against Russia.",
      "Ukrainian Economy Minister Yulia Svyrydenko expressed readiness to negotiate with U.S. officials to preserve access to the American steel market.",
      "Ukraine hopes to get an exemption until March 2026 for steel products made in Ukraine, as well as for European Union products made from steel semi-finished Ukrainian steel. The crux of Kyiv\u2019s argument is that the total value of steel supplied to the U.S. from Ukraine directly and via processing in the EU amounts to only 0.81% of total U.S. steel imports and cannot reasonably threaten U.S. industry.",
      "\u201cMaintaining the tariff exemption for Ukrainian steel, including products made in the EU from Ukrainian steel, provides essential support to Ukraine as it continues to resist unprovoked military aggression from Russia,\u201d the Ukrainian Steel Association said in a statement. \"The exemption enables Ukrainian steel exporters to sustain their operations, contribute to the national budget and support the broader Ukrainian economy.\u201d",
      "At the Zaporizhstal plant in southeast Ukraine's Zaporizhzhia region, smelting iron ore is the first step in a process that culminates in millions of tons of cast iron and steel getting shipped abroad",
      "Zhyvotchenko approaches the colossal mouth of the blast furnace as if it were a dragon\u2019s lair. A gust of oxygen raises the heat to nearly 2,000 degrees Celsius (3,632 degrees Fahrenheit). Workers in full protective gear appear like medieval knights, guiding a luminous flow of liquid steel.",
      "For him and other employees, every day since Russia's full-scale invasion has been a test to produce more with less. The Zaporizhstal complex is operating at 75% capacity and with 12% fewer personnel after many workers were drafted into the Ukrainian army or left the country, according to the plant's owner, international mining and metals company Metinvest Group.",
      "Metinvest lost control of two other steel plants when Russian soldiers occupied the city of Mariupol after a months-long siege in 2022. Russian gains recently cost the company an important coal mine in eastern Ukraine's Donetsk region.",
      "Metinvest suspended operations at the Pokrovsk mine and evacuated workers as Russian troops advanced last month. Coking coal is another essential ingredient in steel production. To keep the Zaporizhstal mill running, Metinvest must import 1 million metric tons (1.1 U.S. tons) of coal a year from Europe and the U.S., plant general manager Taras Shevchenko said.",
      "The grinding war already has brought other challenges, including soaring energy costs due to relentless attacks on Ukraine\u2019s energy grid. Blockades and bombs disrupted trade routes. Complex export logistics required Metinivest to shift its focus from serving Asia and the Middle East to seeking customers in Europe. It was a painful process, Shevchenko said.",
      "Ukraine plans to make the EU part of its exemption pitch because the bloc now accounts for the lion\u2019s share of Ukrainian steel exports. There's worry the U.S. steel tariffs will have unwelcome ripple effects, such as European countries putting import duties on Ukrainian products to offset new taxes on their goods, Metinvest Group Chief Operating Officer Oleksandr Myronenko said.",
      "\u201cThis will be a very significant problem for us,\u201d Myronenko said.",
      "Europe is the destination for around 80% of Metinvest\u2019s exported products, he said. The company also has a plant in EU member-state Bulgaria from where reinforcing steel typically used as rods in concrete is exported to the U.S. The rebar shipments would be subject to tariffs as well, and demand may drop as a result, Myronenko said.",
      "\u201cWe will have very large problems in the Bulgarian factory,\" he said.",
      "Plant workers are hoping for the best in this period of uncertainty, they said.",
      "Zhyvotchenko stood outside the industrial complex, the smoke of exhaust seeping up from the ground below, as a rail car delivered gigantic ladles shaped like torpedoes. In the final stages of production, the lava-like metal will be poured into the containers for refining and casting. Then the steelworkers start the process over again.",
      "\u201cWe can be tired, we can be tense, we can be anything, but we must endure and must work,\u201d Myronenko said.",

      "The Kremlin says senior American and Russian officials will hold talks on improving their ties and negotiating an end to the war in Ukraine",
      "RIYADH, Saudi Arabia -- Senior American and Russian officials, including the countries\u2019 top diplomats, will hold talks on improving their ties and negotiating an end to the war in Ukraine, the Kremlin said Monday, in what would be the most significant meeting between the sides since Moscow's full-scale invasion of its neighbor nearly three years ago.",
      "The talks, scheduled for Tuesday in Saudi Arabia, mark another consequential step by the Trump administration to reverse U.S. policy on isolating Russia, and are meant to pave the way for a meeting between U.S. President Donald Trump and Russian President Vladimir Putin.",
      "The moves have sent Kyiv and key allies scrambling to ensure a seat at the table amid concerns that Washington and Moscow could press ahead with a deal that won't be favorable to them. France called an emergency meeting of European Union countries and the U.K. on Monday to decide how to address the U.S. diplomatic blitz on the war.",
      "Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov said that Russian Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov and foreign affairs adviser Yuri Ushakov will fly to the Saudi capital later in the day. U.S. Secretary of State Marco Rubio, national security adviser Mike Waltz and Special Envoy Steve Witkoff will meet the Russian delegation, State Department spokesperson Tammy Bruce said. Ukraine will not participate.",
      "Peskov said the talks will be primarily focused on \u201crestoring the entire complex of U.S.-Russian relations, as well as preparing possible talks on the Ukrainian settlement and organizing a meeting of the two presidents.\"",
      "Speaking on Fox News Channel\u2019s \u201cSunday Morning Futures\u201d program, Witkoff said he and Waltz will be \u201chaving meetings at the direction of the president,\u201d and hope to make \u201csome really good progress with regard to Russia-Ukraine.\u201d",
      "Witkoff didn\u2019t directly respond to a question about whether Ukraine would have to give up a \u201csignificant portion\u201d of its territory as part of any negotiated settlement. U.S. Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth said last week that NATO membership for Ukraine was unrealistic and suggested Kyiv should abandon hopes of winning all its territory back from Russia \u2014 two key items on Putin's wish list.",
      "The talks would mark a significant expansion of U.S.-Russian contacts, nearly three years into a war that has seen ties fall to the lowest level in decades. Lavrov and then-U.S. Secretary of State Antony Blinken talked briefly on the sidelines of a G-20 meeting in India nearly two years ago. They chatted for about 10 minutes, and there was no indication of any movement toward easing the intense tensions at the time. In the fall of 2022, U.S. and Russian spymasters met in Turkey.",
      "Tuesday's talks follow last week\u2019s telephone call between Trump and Putin in which the American president said they \u201cagreed to have our respective teams start negotiations immediately.\u201d The call upended years of U.S. policy, ending the isolation of Moscow over its Feb. 24, 2022, invasion of Ukraine. After the call, Trump phoned Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy to inform him about their conversation.",
      "Trump on Sunday told reporters that Zelenskyy \u201cwill be involved\u201d but did not elaborate. Zelenskyy said Monday his country had not been invited to the upcoming talks and won\u2019t accept the outcome if Ukraine doesn\u2019t take part.",
      "The U.S.-Russia talks would \u201cyield no results,\u201d given the absence of any Ukrainian officials, Zelenskyy said on a conference call with journalists from the United Arab Emirates. Ukraine\u2019s participation in any peace talks had been a bedrock of U.S. policy under Trump\u2019s predecessor, Joe Biden.",
      "Zelenskyy said he would travel to Turkey on Monday and to Saudi Arabia on Wednesday, but that his trip to the Arab nation was unrelated to the U.S.-Russia talks. Andriy Yermak, a top Zelenskyy adviser, has said there is no possibility of Ukrainian and Russian representatives meeting directly \u201cuntil we develop a plan\u201d to end the war and bring about a \u201cjust peace.\u201d",
      "EU officials have pushed for the bloc \u2014 which aloing with the U.S. has staunchly supported Kyiv \u2014 to have a say in any Ukraine peace talks, and Zelenskyy and his officials also insisted that Europe needs to be present at the negotiations.",
      "Lavrov on Monday was dismissive when asked about a possible role for Europe, saying that \u201cI don't know what they have to do at the negotiations table.\u201d",
      "Zelenskyy also confirmed that Trump\u2019s special envoy for Russia and Ukraine, retired Gen. Keith Kellogg, would arrive in Kyiv on Feb. 20 for \u201cbroad conversations about security guarantees.\u201d",
      "Zelenskyy said he wanted to bring Kellogg to the front line and hoped the American would take what he learned from his Ukraine trip back to the White House, adding: \u201cI think after he goes back to the United States we will have an understanding on when I will have a meeting with President Trump.\u201d",
      "Zelenskyy said the possibility of opening up his country\u2019s mineral resources to the U.S., as Trump has suggested, would need to come with a written agreement on security guarantees for Ukraine. Ukraine and several European countries have insisted that without security guarantees, Russia could invade the country again, even if a settlement is reached.",
      "Those guarantees could include NATO membership, which Hegseth poured cold water on, weapons and economic support, Zelenskyy said.",

      "The Argentine pope, a known workaholic who keeps up a grueling pace despite his many ailments, was admitted to Rome\u2019s Gemelli hospital on Friday after a weeklong bout of bronchitis worsened. It was his fourth hospitalization since his 2013 election and raised questions about his increasingly precarious health.",

    "published": "Mon, 17 Feb 2025 09:27:02 -0500",
    "summary": "President Donald Trump's billionaire top lieutenant, Elon Musk, is the focus for thousands of Democratic activists launching a massive protest campaign this week",
    "story": [
      "President Donald Trump's billionaire top lieutenant, Elon Musk, is the focus for thousands of Democratic activists launching a massive protest campaign this week",
      "NEW YORK -- NEW YORK (AP) \u2014 Donald Trump is the president, but billionaire Elon Musk is the focus for thousands of Democratic activists launching a protest campaign this week to fight the Trump administration's push to gut federal health, education and human services agencies.",
      "Hundreds of protests are scheduled outside congressional offices and Tesla dealerships, with organizers hoping to send a pointed message to members of Congress who are on recess this week.",
      "The backlash still hasn't approached the intensity of protests during and after Trump's first inauguration eight years ago. But a loose coalition of Democrats and progressives is coalescing around Musk's rise as Trump's top lieutenant and his purge of the federal bureaucracy.",
      "\u201cHe\u2019s a major weak link in the MAGA coalition,\u201d Ezra Levin, co-founder of the progressive group Indivisible, said of Musk. \u201cI can\u2019t think of something that polls worse than the richest man in the world is coming after your Social Security check or your Meals on Wheels or your Head Start.\u201d",
      "Indivisible, which claims more than 1,300 local chapters nationwide, is encouraging members to protest at the offices of their members of Congress, regardless of political party. The group also offered a step-by-step guide for protesting at dealerships for Tesla, Musk's electric vehicle company.",
      "The memo encourages protesters to stay on sidewalks and public spaces and to avoid any actions that might directly interfere with business operations, such as blocking entrances or trespassing on private property. It also calls for Tesla protesters to stay on message: \u201cThis is about Musk\u2019s political takeover, not Tesla, SpaceX, or X as companies.\u201d",
      "Vermont Sen. Bernie Sanders is launching what he\u2019s calling \u201ca national tour to fight oligarchy\u201d with stops in working-class districts of Iowa and Nebraska this week.",
      "Democratic National Committee Chair Ken Martin will hit the road for the first time as party leader as well. The newly elected DNC chair will travel to Pennsylvania, Texas, Illinois, Wisconsin and Missouri in the coming days to meet with local Democratic officials and labor leaders, spokesperson Hannah Muldavin said.",
      "Like the protesters, Martin is expected to seize on Musk\u2019s role. During a meeting with labor leaders in Pittsburgh, for example, he plans to highlight Musk\u2019s recent focus on the Department of Labor, which could put \u201cthe integrity of data like the unemployment rate and inflation rate at risk, which is important for a stable U.S. economy and, by extension, working people,\u201d Muldavin said.",
      "Aware of the intense displeasure from their party\u2019s base, many House Democrats plan to be proactive.",
      "The House Democratic Policy and Communications Committee issued a memo ahead of the recess instructing Democrats to embrace \u201cnine days of visibility\u201d and said it was essential for members to host one town hall, in-person or via telephone, and at least one community event that highlights the \"devastating impacts\u201d of Trump and Musk\u2019s actions.",
      "The wave of protests comes at a critical moment as fractured Democrats struggle to stop the Republican president\u2019s purge of the federal bureaucracy, which features thousands of layoffs inside departments focused on public health, education, veterans affairs and human services, among others.",
      "Firings in recent days at the Department of Veterans Affairs include researchers working on cancer treatment, opioid addiction, prosthetics and burn pit exposure, according to U.S. Sen. Patty Murray, a Democrat from Washington state. The cuts also include more than 5,000 employees at the Department of Health and Human Services and roughly one-tenth of the workforce at the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.",
      "In some cases, Musk\u2019s team is trying \u2014 with Trump's blessing but without congressional approval \u2014 to shutter entire agencies, including the U.S. Agency for International Development, the Department of Education and the U.S. Consumer Financial Protection Bureau.",
      "Trump has defended the cuts as necessary to eliminate waste and fraud. And he has praised Musk\u2019s work with his Department of Government Efficiency, or DOGE, saying it has found \u201cshocking\u201d evidence of wasteful spending. He signed an executive order expanding Musk\u2019s influence.",
      "Musk, meanwhile, has defended the swift and extensive cuts he\u2019s pushing across the federal government while acknowledging there have been mistakes.",
      "Democrats in Congress condemn the moves as dangerous, but without control of either chamber of Congress, there is little they can do to stop the Trump administration aside from turning to the courts. Still, three of the nation's largest progressive groups \u2014 Indivisible, MoveOn and the Working Families Party \u2014 are coordinating this week's protests to send a clear message to elected officials in both major political parties that they must do more.",
      "Still, Democratic members of Congress may face their own voters' fury.",
      "MoveOn, which boasts a membership of nearly 10 million, is hosting dozens of rallies outside town halls and congressional offices for those members who do not host public events. The group will focus on \u201cpersuadable House Republicans whose votes will be crucial to opposing the Trump-Musk agenda,\u201d according to a preview of its recess week plan. But there will also be rallies targeting House Democratic Leader Hakeem Jeffries and Senate Democratic Leader Chuck Schumer, both of New York, among other Democrats.",
      "\u201cWe are seeing a true resurgence in energy opposing what Trump, Musk and Republicans are doing to our country,\u201d MoveOn executive director Rahna Epting said, adding that \u201cpeople are mad as hell.\u201d",
      "The Working Families Party is focusing protests in the districts of vulnerable Republicans in states such as California, New Jersey, New York, Pennsylvania and Wisconsin. The actions will feature people directly impacted by the Trump administration's cuts, including special education teachers, nurses and Head Start workers, according to Working Families spokesman Ravi Mangla.",
      "\u201cA lot of Republicans,\" Mangla said, \u201chave not have had their feet held to the fire.\u201d",

      "Argentine lawyers filed fraud charges against President Javier Milei in criminal court on Sunday for promoting a cryptocurrency on his social media, one of the lawyers told The Associated Press",
      "MONTEVIDEO, Uruguay -- Argentine lawyers filed fraud charges against President Javier Milei in criminal court on Sunday for promoting a cryptocurrency on his social media, one of the lawyers told The Associated Press.",
      "On Friday, Milei posted on X about $LIBRA, a coin that he said was aimed at \u201cencouraging economic growth by funding small businesses and startups.\u201d",
      "He deleted the post a few hours later and the value of the currency collapsed, causing millions of dollars in losses to its brief investors, according to financial site Dexscreener.",
      "The coin, developed by KIP Protocol and Hayden Davis, could be obtained by accessing a link that directed users to a website called vivalalibertadproject.com, referring to the well-known phrase with which Milei closes speeches and messages on his social media.",
      "The President's Office said in a Saturday statement that Milei was not involved in any stage of the cryptocurrency\u2019s development and decided to remove the post to avoid speculation and limit further exposure, following the public reaction to the project\u2019s launch.",
      "Jonatan Baldiviezo, a lawyer and one of the plaintiffs, told the AP that they saw an illicit association to commit \u201can indeterminate number of frauds\u201d in the episode. \u201cWithin this illicit association, the crime of fraud was committed, in which the president\u2019s actions were essential,\u201d he said.",
      "Baldiviezo signed the petition with Marcos Zelaya, another lawyer; the engineer Mar\u00eda Eva Koutsovitis; and the economist Claudio Lozano, who presided over the Argentine Central Bank during former president Alberto Fern\u00e1ndez\u2019s administration. Criminal justice is expected to assign a judge to the case or refer it to a prosecutor for further investigation on Monday.",
      "The plaintiffs saw in Milei\u2019s action an operation known in the crypto world as \u201crug pull.\u201d This occurs when a developer launches an attractive token to lure investors but later abandons it after funds become overpriced, making the tokens worthless. Baldiviezo also added that Milei violated the Public Ethics Law.",
      "\u201cThe President shared a post on his personal accounts announcing the launch of KIP Protocol\u2019s project, as he does daily with many entrepreneurs who wish to launch projects in Argentina to create jobs and attract investments,\u201d the President's Office said.",
      "After deleting the post, Milei said on X he was unaware of the currency's development and blamed his political opponents for trying to exploit the episode. \u201cI was not aware of the details of the project, and after getting informed, I decided not to continue promoting it (which is why I deleted the tweet),\u201d he said.",
      "The President's Office said the country's Anti-Corruption Office, which operates under the Executive Branch, would act immediately. The administration also acknowledged that Milei and members of his administration recently met with representatives of KIP Protocol at the presidential office.",
      "\u201cAll the information gathered in the investigation will be handed over to the judiciary to determine if any of the companies or individuals linked to the KIP Protocol project committed a crime,\u201d the Milei administration said in the Saturday statement.",
      "Hayden Mark Davis, one of KIP Protocol's representatives who met with Milei, blamed the president for the crypto currency's collapse in a video posted on his social media on Saturday.",
      "\u201cDespite prior commitments, Milei and his team unexpectedly changed their position, withdrawing their support and deleting all previous posts on social media,\u201d Davis said."

      "He\u2019s also attached the Trump name to a crypto token and other crypto-themed products. The cryptocurrency industry, which spent heavily to help Trump win last year\u2019s election, has expressed mixed feelings about some of his crypto ventures.",

      "That\u2019s how much a watch company is charging for a new \u201cCrypto President Tourbillon\u201d watch from the Trump-themed online watch store, which pays a licensing fee for using the Trump name. Trump has a long history of melding his political and business interests. He first promoted Trump watches in September of last year.

      "\u201cThe Crypto President Tourbillon isn\u2019t just a watch\u2014it\u2019s a declaration. Of wealth. Of power. Of vision,\u201d the website says.",

      "Some in the crypto industry hailed the launch of Trump\u2019s meme coin, which was quickly followed by the launch of First Lady Melania Trump\u2019s meme coin, as a sign of his enthusiasm and commitment to digital assets.",
      "Critics said it reflected poorly on the crypto industry\u2019s reputation at a time when it is hoping to become more mainstream. Meme coins are a strange and highly volatile corner of the crypto industry that often start as a joke with no real value but can surge in price if enough people are willing to buy them.",
      "That\u2019s the price for a new pair of crypto-themed sneakers sold by another website that pays a licensing fee to sell Trump-themed products, which the president has promoted. The low-top orange shoes are set to start shipping in April, with a planned limited run of just 400 pairs.",
      "That\u2019s how much Chinese crypto mogul Justin Sun has said his company has invested in World Liberty Financial, a decentralized finance cryptocurrency platform that Trump and his sons helped launch last year. Sun founded the decentralized blockchain platform TRON and is also known for his recent purchase of a banana for $6.2 million.",
      "Sun and his companies were sued by the SEC in 2023 for allegedly artificially inflating the price of TRON, and the U.S. has also accused his company of facilitating transfers tied to groups designated as terrorist organizations. World Liberty Financial announced it had bought $4.7 million of TRON\u2019s token, TRX, on Inauguration Day.",

    "story": [
      "Residents in the German town of Geretsried have long wanted to run their buildings with clean heat and electricity from geothermal energy rather than fossil fuels",
      "Residents in the German town of Geretsried have long wanted to run their buildings with clean heat and electricity from geothermal energy instead of fossil fuels.",
      "Their hopes were dashed about 15 years ago when a drilling company couldn't find enough hot water close to the surface to be profitable using traditional geothermal technology. That basically left them with natural gas.",
      "\u201cWe gave up. We had big hopes,\u201d recalled First Mayor of Geretsried Michael M\u00fcller, who was raised in the town.",
      "Today the next generation of geothermal companies is trying to succeed where previous efforts failed. They don't rely on hot water close to the surface, but instead use techniques developed in the oil and gas industry to drill deep and extract heat from dry, hot rock. One of them, Eavor, is starting up its first commercial power plant in Geretsried \u2014 turning the tiny town of about 26,000 people, south of Munich, into a proving ground for the future of geothermal energy.",
      "Can technology like this be scaled and really make a difference for the future of the planet? The International Energy Agency thinks so. In a recent report, it said technology breakthroughs are unlocking huge potential for geothermal energy. Now that companies are drilling deeper than 3 kilometers (close to 2 miles), nearly every country has the potential to make heat and electricity this way, the IEA said.",
      "\u201cIt has been a niche energy and concentrated in a few countries,\u201d IEA Executive Director Fatih Birol said in an interview. But soon, Birol said, \"geothermal can contribute to the global energy picture in an accelerated manner.\u201d",
      "Eavor CEO John Redfern said the earlier failure in Gerestried opened up the possibility for a high-profile success \u2014 Geretsried\u2019s ordinary geology was appealing. No one would\u2019ve been impressed if the Canadian company demonstrated its technology in Iceland, a place with abundant, easily accessible hot water, he added.",
      "It helped that the town was excited for geothermal and open to new ideas, he added.",
      "\u201cOur whole point is that we want to have geothermal anywhere, everywhere,\u201d Redfern said. \u201cWhat better way to prove that than to put our first well where they tried and failed with traditional geothermal systems.\u201d",
      "Germany is committed to transitioning away from fossil fuels. As part of the commitment, heating systems must switch to renewable sources because heating is one of the main sources of carbon dioxide emissions in Germany. And Germany couldn\u2019t depend on importing natural gas from Russia after Russia invaded Ukraine in 2022.",
      "Eavor, named for the phrase \u201cenergy for ever,\u201d has a demonstration facility in Alberta, Canada. Company executives know Geretsried well. One of them managed operations for the contractor that drilled there previously.",
      "This project will start by generating electricity in Geretsried, then add heat as the town fully builds out a district heating system.",
      "With district heating, heat is generated in a central location and distributed to homes and businesses. Most of these systems make their heat from burning fossil fuels, especially in China and Russia, which have the largest number of them, according to the IEA. Europe has 17,000 district heating and cooling networks, serving 67 million people, according to Euroheat & Power, the international network for district energy.",
      "In the United States, district energy systems are most often on college campuses, at hospitals, on military bases and in some downtown areas in larger cities. Some universities are switching their district heating systems off gas or heating oil to geothermal energy to address climate change. The Trump administration, while pivoting back to pro-oil and gas policies, does appear to also favor geothermal.",
      "Eavor has a contract to provide heat in the northwestern German city of Hanover, too. The city of more than 500,000 people is phasing out coal.",
      "Eavor is also licensing its technology to utilities and companies that are trying to curb emissions and want secure energy, Redfern said. A large Japanese power provider, Chubu Electric Power Company, is a major investor in Eavor. Japan has many sites suitable for geothermal but few geothermal power plants.",
      "The way it works is that Eavor drills two wells about 4 kilometers (2.5 miles) deep, then branches out and drills a dozen lateral wells, to maximize contact with the hot rock. The wells intersect to create a closed loop where water can flow, the \u201cEavor loop.\u201d The Geretsried project will have four loops, each with two vertical wells and about 12 lateral ones.",
      "Eavor does not frack, or hydraulically fracture, to create cracks and increase the permeability of rock.",
      "Instead in Geretsried, it will pump water down to flow through the hot rock, heating up on contact. It will rise naturally to the surface through an outlet well.",
      "That hot water can be used to heat the utility's water so it can be sent through pipes to heat the equivalent of about 36,000 homes. The hot water also can be routed to a power plant to make steam and then recirculated. When used to spin a turbine, that steam can generate electricity without any planet-warming greenhouse gas emissions.",
      "M\u00fcller, the mayor, said it's better to start changing the approach to energy today than push it off to tomorrow. He said residents can't rely on fossil fuels long term, they have to address climate change and they need secure energy.",
      "\u201cWe want to remain future proof,\u201d he said. \u201cSo let's start the future.\u201d",

      "Germany needs a new business model to get its stalled economy going again",
      "MULFINGEN, Germany -- Germany needs a new business model. The old one, fueled by cheap natural gas from Russia and lucrative exports to China, is broken, leaving Europe's biggest economy mired in stagnation and angst about the future.",
      "Delivering that fresh growth strategy is going to be the biggest challenge for the government that takes office after a national election set for Feb. 23, seven months ahead of schedule. The nation that became known for the quality of its products has not seen real economic growth for five years.",
      "Multiple factors conspired to take Germany from industrial powerhouse to post-pandemic straggler: too much bureaucracy, a shortage of skilled workers, slow deployment of technology and a lack of clear direction from the outgoing coalition government are among them. Rising competition from China and high energy prices due to Russia's war in Ukraine were additional hits.",
      "\u201cWe really need a more company- and enterprise-friendly politics,\" said Klaus Geissdoerfer, CEO of industrial fan manufacturer EBM-Papst. \u201cWe have bright talent in Germany. We have good companies, but at the moment we don\u2019t have the awareness on the political level.\u201d",
      "With 2.5 billion euros ($2.6 billion) in annual revenue and plants on three continents, EBM-Papst describes itself as the global leader in its field. The company reported last year that it was \u201csuffering in Germany in particular\u201d and experienced a 4.1% revenue decline in its home market.",
      "Geissdoerfer said EBM-Papst\u2019s heating technology division lost 18.7% of its sales through a clumsily handled push to get property owners to replace gas furnaces with less polluting electric heat pumps.",
      "The requirements of the Building Energy Act put forward by Chancellor Olaf Scholz\u2019 three-party coalition were so confusing, people put off the upgrades to their heating systems or rushed to buy new gas devices before the law took effect, he said. That sapped demand for the ultra-quiet heat pump fans EBM-Papst makes.",
      "Consumers wondered, \u201cWhat is the right technology for my house?\u201d Geissdoerfer said. \u201cAnd so everybody said, 'If I don't have to, I better wait.'\u201d",
      "Geissdoerfer made a complaint heard across industry: Germany's bureaucracy is excessive. A 2023 law that requires public and private entities to combat climate change by reducing their energy use means EBM-Papst must assign employees to detail what the company is doing to comply, he said.",
      "\u201cSo now, instead of implementing measures, they write and report,\u201d the CEO said, adding that the documentation work is a poor use of time at a company whose core business is energy-saving equipment. \u201cI really hope with the new government we can get this solved, because at the moment it\u2019s too much.\u201d",
      "EBM-Papst is moving in the direction where economists say Germany as a whole should put its industrial resources: into green and digital technology. The company, headquartered in Mulfingen, a town of 3,700 residents in rural southwest Germany, is equipping energy-hungry artificial intelligence data centers with efficient cooling systems for their servers. It also is working on incorporating AI features to help tech companies optimize their power use and to predict when equipment needs to be replaced.",
      "In the meantime, EBM-Papst is coping with Germany\u2019s economic malaise by shifting its investment focus to Asia and the United States. The company now supplies U.S. customers, for instance, from plants in Farmington, Connecticut,and Telford, Tennessee. Its moves to localize production abroad predate the coronavirus pandemic but give EBM-Papst a shield against any new import taxes imposed by U.S. President Donald Trump.",
      "On top of the homegrown issues, international relations have dealt another blow. Russia cut off most of the country's natural gas supplies over the German government's wartime support for Ukraine. Electricity prices, a key cost for industry, have risen to 2 1/2 times higher than in the U.S. and China.",
      "Metalworking firm Mecanindus-Vogelsang Group, which makes precision parts for automakers and other manufacturers, says it pays twice as much per kilowatt hour for the electricity its German plants use as it does for its U.S. sites in Mt. Sterling, Kentucky, and Lakewood, New Jersey. That's 100,000 euros in added costs and \u201ca gigantic competitive disadvantage\" CEO Ulrich Flatken said.",
      "\u201cTo avoid deindustrialization, which is already taking place, we urgently need internationally competitive energy prices,\u201d Flatken said.",
      "Another shock came from China, which throughout the 2010s served as a lucrative market for German-made machinery and automobiles. Once Chinese companies started making those same products, backed by government subsidies, German exports suffered.",
      "Germany's economy contracted in each of the last two years. By the end of 2024, it was only 0.3% bigger than it was in 2019, before the pandemic. The U.S. economy grew by 11.4% during over the same period, while China's expanded by 25.8%, according to Germany's Federal Statistical Office.",
      "Marcel Fratzscher, president of the German Institute for Economic Research, thinks complacency set in during the boom years of exports to China. German companies weren\u2019t quick enough to respond to technological trends, such as the move to electric cars, he said.",
      "\u201cThey enjoyed the success of the 2010s and they have been too slow in understanding that they need to change and adapt,\u201d Fratzscher said.",
      "As the economic woes drag on, \u201cmental depression\u201d has set in, he said. \u201cThe pessimism is enormous among companies and citizens, and that\u2019s an important explanation why companies are not investing.\u201d",
      "Many business executives and economists argue that Germany's next government should work to loosen constitutional limits on debt so it can increase public spending on infrastructure and education. Fratzscher wonders if political leaders, like the economy, will falter in adopting new ways of doing things.",
      "\u201cFor the past 75 years, Germany has been built very much on consensus, stability oriented, lots of checks and balances in the political system, and that makes rapid change very difficult,\u201d he said. \u201cWe need to change the mindset, to understand we need to be much faster on economic transformations.\u201d"

      "The cryptocurrency industry is emboldened, impatient and eager to cement its influence in politics and mainstream financial systems",
      "When the Trump administration\u2019s crypto czar, David Sacks, recently held a news conference to announce a new congressional working group to advance cryptocurrency regulation, many digital asset enthusiasts were unimpressed and underwhelmed.",
      "\u201cThere were a lot of people on X who felt like this wasn\u2019t, you know, a mind-blowing announcement,\u201d Sacks said on a podcast a few days later, referring to the social media outlet formerly known as Twitter. But Sacks said having the White House and key members of Congress committed to passing key crypto legislation in the next year, possibly within six months, was worth celebrating. \u201cWe\u2019ve never had that before, so that is pretty monumental,\u201d he said.",
      "Sacks\u2019 defensiveness highlights a new reality in Washington: After spending heavily to help elect Trump and other crypto-friendly lawmakers, the industry is emboldened, impatient and eager to cement its influence in politics and mainstream financial systems.",
      "\u201cTime is critical,\u201d Ji Hun Kim, president and acting CEO at the Crypto Council for Innovation said at a recent House committee hearing titled: \u201cA Golden Age of Digital Assets: Charting a Path Forward.\u201d",
      "The crypto industry has scored some early wins since Trump took office, including the repeal of an accounting rule by the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission and an executive order by the president directing a working group to study and propose changes to crypto regulations as well as the possible formation of a strategic government reserve of cryptocurrencies within 180 days.",
      "As the industry calls for more substantive action, some crypto companies are looking to exert their influence by trying to punish old enemies.",
      "Tyler Winklevoss, co-founder of the crypto exchange Gemini, said his firm won\u2019t hire any MIT graduates as punishment for the school rehiring former SEC Chairman Gary Gensler to teach classes.",
      "\u201cNot even interns for our summer intern program,\u201d Winklevoss said on X. The move came after Coinbase\u2019s CEO announced his firm wouldn\u2019t work with any law firms that hired any of Gensler\u2019s former deputies who\u2019d committed \u201cbad deeds\u201d toward the crypto industry. The Gensler SEC was the most aggressive financial regulator in trying to police the crypto industry.",
      "Congress has held several hearings in recent weeks where crypto supporters have aired grievances over how they were treated during the Biden administration, particularly around how regulators allegedly forced banks to cut ties with crypto companies.",
      "And new Republican leadership at the SEC has criticized the agency\u2019s past performance under Gensler and promised a new day, while making it clear that day won't be tomorrow.",
      "\u201cIt took us a long time to get into this mess,\u201d SEC Commissioner Hester Peirce, who is leading a new crypto task force, said in a lengthy statement on the agency\u2019s website. \u201cPlease be patient.\u201d",
      "The SEC recently asked a federal court to pause ongoing litigation against Binance, the world\u2019s largest cryptocurrency exchange, because leadership is now rethinking previous enforcement actions.",
      "Sacks and crypto-friendly lawmakers expect two pieces of legislation to become law. One would set regulations and reserve requirements for issuers of stablecoins, a type of crypto that\u2019s exploded in popularity and whose value is typically tied to the dollar or other traditional currencies.",
      "The other piece of legislation aims to set clear rules for how crypto exchanges and other companies operate, as well as decide which digital assets are regulated as securities, like stocks, and which should be considered commodities, like gold or oil. Securities generally face stricter regulations.",
      "Similar legislation has stalled in past years but many in the crypto industry expect broad, bipartisan support for passage this time. That\u2019s due in part to the heavy political spending by the crypto industry. Fairshake, the crypto super PAC that was one of the biggest spenders in last year\u2019s election, said recently it has already amassed a huge war chest for next year\u2019s midterms. One of the crypto industry's biggest wins last year was helping knock off former Sen. Sherrod Brown, a Democrat from Ohio and crypto critic who led the Senate's banking committee.",
      "\u201cThe Democrats have gotten the message,\u201d said crypto investor Anthony Scaramucci, who briefly served as communications director during Trump\u2019s first term, \u201cThey don\u2019t want to be in the 2026 campaign having a crypto army against them.\u201d",
      "Just like crypto prices, the industry\u2019s popularity and influence are prone to wild upswings and falls. A few years ago, the Super Bowl was packed with celebrities doing commercials for crypto companies and mogul Sam Bankman-Fried had easy access to the top halls of power.",
      "That popularity and influence waned after Bankman-Fried\u2019s company collapsed amid massive criminal fraud, a market meltdown and other scandals -- before roaring back with Trump\u2019s victory.",
      "But while showing a united front for the election, debates over the crypto legislation and other policy proposals risk exposing fault lines among the industry's many different tribes and strong and eccentric personalities.",
      "The CEO of Ripple, for example, caused waves when he said he\u2019d like to see a U.S. government reserve of crypto include multiple digital assets rather than bitcoin, the world\u2019s most popular cryptocurrency. The idea is a nonstarter for many bitcoin diehards.",
      "And a new report from JPMorgan highlighted how some of the proposals in the stablecoin legislation related to how those coins hold reserves could pose a \u201csignificant challenge\u201d to Tether, the world\u2019s largest stablecoin.",
      "The CEO of Tether, which recently relocated to crypto-friendly El Salvador, responded on social media by disputing the bank\u2019s findings and calling its analysts \u201csalty.\u201d"

      "MUNICH -- Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy says he directed his ministers not to sign off on a proposed agreement to give the United States access to Ukraine\u2019s rare earth minerals because the document was too focused on U.S. interests.",
      "The proposal, which was a key part of Zelenskyy\u2019s talks with U.S. Vice President JD Vance on the sidelines of the Munich Security Conference on Friday, did not offer any specific security guarantees in return, according to one current and one former senior Ukrainian official familiar with the talks.",
      "Zelenskyy\u2019s decision not to accept the proposal, at least for now, was described as \u201cshort-sighted\u201d by a senior White House official.",
      "\u201cI didn\u2019t let the ministers sign a relevant agreement because in my view it is not ready to protect us, our interest,\u201d Zelenskyy told The Associated Press on Saturday in Munich.",
      "The proposal focused on how the U.S. could use Kyiv\u2019s rare earth minerals \u201cas compensation\u201d for support already given to Ukraine by the Biden administration and as payment for future aid, the current and former senior Ukrainian officials said, speaking anonymously so they could speak freely.",
      "Ukraine has vast reserves of critical minerals that are used in the aerospace, defense and nuclear industries. The Trump administration has indicated it is interested in accessing them to reduce dependence on China but Zelenskyy said any exploitation would need to be tied to security guarantees for Ukraine that would deter future Russian aggression.",
      "\u201cFor me is very important the connection between some kind of security guarantees and some kind of investment,\u201d the Ukrainian president told AP.",
      "Zelenskyy did not go into details about why he instructed his officials not to sign the document, which was given to Ukrainian officials on Wednesday by U.S. Treasury Secretary Scott Bassent on a visit to Kyiv.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s a colonial agreement and Zelenskyy cannot sign it,\u201d the former senior official said.",
      "White House National Security Council spokesman Brian Hughes did not explicitly confirm the offer, but said in a statement that \u201cPresident Zelenskyy is being short-sighted about the excellent opportunity the Trump administration has presented to Ukraine.\u201d",
      "The Trump administration has grown weary of sending additional U.S. aid to Ukraine and Hughes said a minerals deal would allow American taxpayers to \u201crecoup\u201d money sent to Kyiv, while growing Ukraine\u2019s economy.",
      "Hughes added that the White House believes \u201cbinding economic ties with the United States will be the best guarantee against future aggression and an integral part of lasting peace.\u201d He added: \u201cThe U.S. recognizes this, the Russians recognize this, and the Ukrainians must recognize this.\u201d",
      "U.S. officials in discussions with their Ukrainian counterparts in Munich were commercially minded and largely concentrated on the specifics of exploring the minerals and how to form a possible partnership to do that with Ukraine, the senior official said.",
      "The potential value of the deposits in Ukraine has not yet been discussed, with much unexplored or close to the front line.",
      "The U.S. proposal apparently did not take into account how the deposits would be secured in the event of continuing Russian aggression. The official suggested the U.S. did not have \u201cready answers,\u201d to that question and that one of their takeaways from discussions in Munich will be how to secure any mineral extraction operation in Ukraine involving people and infrastructure.",
      "Any deal must be in accordance with Ukrainian law and acceptable to the Ukrainian people, the senior Ukrainian official said.",
      "\u201cSubsoil belongs to Ukrainians under the constitution,\u201d Kseniiia Orynchak, founder of the National Association of Mining Industry of Ukraine, previously told the AP, suggesting a deal would need popular support.",
      "Zelenskyy and Vance did not discuss the details of the U.S. document during their meeting Friday at the Munich conference, the senior official said. That meeting was \u201cvery good\u201d and \u201csubstantive,\u201d with Vance making it clear his and Trump\u2019s main goal was to achieve a durable, lasting peace, the senior official said.",
      "Zelenskyy told Vance that real peace requires Ukraine to be in a \u201cstrong position\u201d when starting negotiations, stressed that the U.S negotiators should come to Ukraine, and that the U.S., Ukraine and Europe must be at the negotiating table for talks with Russia.",
      "But Gen. Keith Kellogg, Trump\u2019s special envoy for Ukraine and Russia, all but cut Europeans out of any Ukraine-Russia talks, despite Zelenskyy\u2019s request.",
      "\u201cYou can have the Ukrainians, the Russians, and clearly the Americans at the table talking,\u201d Kellogg said at an event hosted by a Ukrainian tycoon at the Munich conference. Pressed on whether that meant Europeans won\u2019t be included, he said: \u201cI\u2019m a school of realism. I think that\u2019s not going to happen.\u201d",
      "Ukraine is now preparing a \u201ccounter proposal\u201d which will be delivered to the U.S. in \u201cthe near future,\u201d the official said.",
      "\u201cI think it\u2019s important that the vice president understood me that if we want to sign something, we have to understand that it will work,\u201d Zelenskyy told the AP.",
      "That means, he said, \u201cit will bring money and security.\u201d",

      "The Trump administration\u2019s effort to slash the size of the federal workforce reached the Food and Drug Administration this weekend",
      "WASHINGTON -- The Trump administration\u2019s effort to slash the size of the federal workforce reached the Food and Drug Administration this weekend, as recently hired employees who review the safety of food ingredients, medical devices and other products were fired.",
      "Probationary employees across the FDA received notices Saturday evening that their jobs were being eliminated, according to three FDA staffers who spoke to The Associated Press on condition of anonymity because they were not authorized to speak publicly.",
      "The total number of positions eliminated was not clear Sunday, but the firings appeared to focus on employees in the agency\u2019s centers for food, medical devices and tobacco products \u2014 which includes oversight of electronic cigarettes. It was not clear whether FDA employees who review drugs were exempted.",
      "On Friday, the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services announced plans to fire 5,200 probationary employees across its agencies, which include the National Institutes of Health, the FDA and the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.",
      "People who spoke with the AP on condition of anonymity on Friday said the number of probationary employees to be laid off at the CDC would total nearly 1,300. But as of early Sunday afternoon, about 700 people had received notices, according to three people who spoke on condition on anonymity because they were not authorized to speak publicly. They said none of the CDC layoffs affected the young doctors and researchers who track diseases in what\u2019s known as the Epidemic Intelligence Service.",
      "The FDA is headquartered in the Maryland suburbs outside Washington and employs nearly 20,000 people. It's long been a target of newly sworn-in health secretary Robert Kennedy Jr., who last year accused the agency of waging a \u201cwar on public health\u201d for not approving unproven treatments such as psychedelics, stem cells and chelation therapy.",

      "Germany hasn\u2019t seen significant economic growth in five years",
      "FRANKFURT, Germany -- FRANKFURT, Germany (AP) \u2014 Germany hasn't seen significant economic growth in five years. It's a stunning turnaround for Europe's biggest economy, which for much of this century had expanded exports and dominated world trade in engineered products like industrial machinery and luxury cars.",
      "So what happened?",
      "Here are five reasons for Germany's ongoing economic slump:",
      "Moscow's decision to cut off natural gas supplies to Germany in the wake of Russia's invasion of Ukraine dealt a severe blow. For years, Germany\u2019s business model was based on cheap energy fueling production of industrial goods for export.",
      "In 2011, then-Chancellor Angela Merkel decided to hasten the end of nuclear power use in Germany while relying on gas from Russia to bridge the gap as the country moved away from coal generation and toward renewable energy. Russia was then considered to be a reliable energy partner; warnings to the contrary from Poland and the United States were dismissed.",
      "When Russia discontinued the flow, prices in Germany skyrocketed for gas and for electricity generated from gas, both key costs for energy-intensive industries such as steel, fertilizer, chemicals and glass. Germany had to turn to liquefied natural gas, or LNG, super-cooled and imported by ship from Qatar and the U.S. LNG costs more than pipeline gas.",
      "Electricity now costs industrial users in Germany an average of 20.3 euro cents per kilowatt hour, according to a study the research firm Prognos AG prepared for the Bavarian Industry Association. In the U.S. and China, where many competitors of German companies are located, the cost is the equivalent of 8.4 euro cents.",
      "Renewable sources of energy haven't scaled up fast enough to fill the gap. Homeowner and regional resistance to turbines slowed wind energy growth. Infrastructure to transport hydrogen as a replacement fuel for steel furnaces remains mostly on the drawing board.",
      "For years, Germany benefited from China's entry into the global economy - even as other developed countries lost jobs to China. German companies found a massive new market for industrial machinery, chemicals and vehicles. Through the early and mid 2010s, Mercedes-Benz, Volkswagen and BMW reaped fat profits selling into what became the world's largest car market.",
      "At the time, Chinese companies produced items like furniture and consumer electronics that didn't compete with Germany's core strengths. Then, manufacturers in China started making the same things that Germans did.",
      "State-subsidized Chinese solar panels wiped out Germany's makers. In 2010, Chinese panel makers depended on imported German equipment; today, global solar panel production relies on equipment from China. The government in Beijing has ramped up efforts to promote and subsidize manufacturing for export. The resulting goods \u2014 steel, machinery, solar panels, electric vehicles and EV batteries \u2014 now compete with German goods on export markets.",
      "Germany, the most auto-centric of the European Union economies, had the most to lose from China's export-oriented industrial policy. In 2020, China was not a net exporter of vehicles; by 2024, it was exporting 5 million a year. Germany's net exports fell by half over the same period, to 1.2 million cars. Chinese factory capacity is estimated at 50 million vehicles a year, roughly half of global demand.",
      "Germany grew complacent during the good times and put off investing in long-term projects such as rail lines and high-speed internet. The government balanced its budget and sometimes ran surpluses off the tax revenue from a booming economy.",
      "These days, German commuters shake their heads at trains that don't run on time and constant service disruptions while repairs are made to worn-out tracks. High speed internet hasn't yet reached some rural areas. A transmission line to bring electricity from Germany's windy north to factories in the south has run years behind and won't be ready before 2028. A key bridge on the highway connecting the industrial Ruhr region with southern Germany had to be closed in 2021, 10 years after doubts about its durability emerged. A replacement won't be ready before 2027.",
      "A 2009 constitutional amendment handcuffed the government by limiting deficit spending. Whether to loosen the so-called debt brake will be a thorny issue for the German government installed after the country's Feb. 23 election.",
      "German companies are having trouble finding workers with the right skills, from highly trained IT workers to daycare providers, senior care workers and hotel staff members. In a German Chamber of Commerce and Industry survey of 23,000 firms, 43% of companies said they couldn't fill open positions. The response rose to 58% for companies with more than 1,000 workers.",
      "Fewer German students are interested in STEM fields, meaning science, technology, engineering and mathematics. An aging population compounds the problem, as does a shortage of affordable child care that keeps many women working part-time or not at all. Bureaucratic hurdles pose an obstacle to employing high-skill immigrants, though a law passed in 2020 and strengthened in 2023 aims to ease the process.",
      "Lengthy approval procedures and too much paperwork are a drag on the economy, according to Germany companies and economists. Securing a construction permit for a wind turbine can take years. A few other examples, among dozens raised by German business groups:",
      "\u2014 Companies installing solar panels need to register with both government regulators and their local utility even though the utility could pass on the information to the government level.",
      "\u2014 Restaurants have to log refrigerator temperatures by hand and keep hard copies of the records for a month even if the data has been stored digitally.",
      "\u2014 A law requiring companies to certify that their suppliers are obeying environmental and labor standards went beyond EU requirements, putting a heavier burden on German companies than their European competitors.",

      "The city's government has proposed new rules that would set minimum standards for such housing units, but residents and advocates for the poor worry that it could drive up rents and make it even harder to hang on in the city. The city's eventual goal, mandated by Beijing, is to eliminate subdivided apartments over the next 25 years.",
      "Officials are aiming to pass the rules into law within the year. After that, landlords will have a grace period to make their substandard flats meet the bar. The government has promised to assist affected residents in resettlement and adopt a gradual approach in its policy implementation to avoid causing panic.",
      "Here are some of the numbers that illustrate the residents' living conditions and the proposed policy.",
      "Hong Kong's population in mid-2024",
      "How much land is used for housing in the densely-packed territory, according to the city's planning department",
      "The number of dwellings created by dividing apartments",
      "The number of people who live in them",
      "The median size of the units that have been carved out. About one-fourth are less than eight square meters (86 square feet), the minimum size mandated under the proposed rules",
      "The standard size of a parking space in Hong Kong",

      "Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi and SpaceX CEO Elon Musk met during Modi's visit to the U.S., where he spoke with Trump about trade and tariff concerns",
      "NEW DELHI -- Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi met with SpaceX CEO Elon Musk during his visit to the U.S. to meet President Donald Trump. The exact nature of the meeting is unclear, although Modi said on X that the two men \u201cdiscussed various issues, including those he is passionate about such as space, mobility, technology and innovation.\u201d",
      "Musk was recently chosen by Trump to head a new U.S. Department of Government Efficiency, or DOGE.",
      "Modi and Musk also met each other in New York in 2023. At that time Musk said he was \u201cconfident that Tesla will be in India ... as soon as humanly possible.\u201d",
      "Modi and Musk met each other on Thursday during the Indian prime minister\u2019s visit to the U.S. While Musk was accompanied by his three young children, Modi was notably flanked by his top advisers \u2014 including External Affairs Minister S. Jaishankar and National Security Adviser Ajit Doval.",
      "Later, at a joint press conference with Modi at the White House, Trump said he wasn\u2019t sure why Musk met the Indian prime minister but he assumed Musk \"wants to do business in India.\u201d",
      "\u201cI would imagine he met, possibly, because you know he\u2019s running a company,\u201d Trump told reporters.",
      "India\u2019s foreign ministry in a statement said Modi and Musk \u201cdiscussed strengthening collaboration between Indian and U.S. entities in innovation, space exploration, artificial intelligence and sustainable development\u201d and on \u201centrepreneurship and good governance.\u201d",
      "Musk, who previously called himself a \u201cfan of Modi,\" has long wanted his Starlink satellite internet service to make an entry into the Indian market. Its launch, however, has been delayed due to regulatory challenges, security concerns and opposition from domestic telecom giants like Mukesh Ambani's Reliance Jio.",
      "Last November, India\u2019s telecoms minister, Jyotiraditya Scindia, said Starlink was yet to comply with security norms, and a license for satellite communications services will be issued only after the company meets all the requirements.",
      "Musk had earlier criticized India's policy of granting spectrum for satellite services through auctioning. The Indian government later changed the policy and said it will assign satellite spectrum and not auction it.",
      "India\u2019s satellite broadband service market is highly competitive. At least six companies control the market, led by Ambani\u2019s Reliance Jio.",
      "Apart from regulatory roadblocks, Musk's Starlink has also faced resistance by Reliance Jio, which last year said granting spectrum for satellite services through auctioning is necessary to ensure fair competition.",
      "Musk\u2019s Starlink has at least 6,900 active satellites orbiting Earth that provide low-latency broadband to some 4.6 million people. But if Musk wants to enter the Indian market, Starlink's high pricing could be a concern.",
      "Mobile data in India is among the cheapest globally, and Ambani's Jio once gave data for free on its mobile plans. And yet, at least 40% of the country\u2019s more than 1.4 billion people still don\u2019t have access to the internet. Cheap satellite broadband is needed to bridge this gap, particularly in India\u2019s vast remote and mountainous areas.",
      "Musk\u2019s Tesla has also been waiting to get into India, which is one of the world\u2019s largest automobile markets, but has faced hurdles due to high import duties on vehicles brought into the country.",
      "Also, India\u2019s electric vehicle market is still nascent and made up a little more than 2% of total car sales last year. But the government wants to change that and increase the electric vehicle share to 30% by 2030.",
      "India also recently unveiled a new policy that extends concessional tariffs on fully imported electric vehicles made by foreign carmakers who commit to starting local manufacturing.",

      "Beginning July 1, unions serving Utah teachers, firefighters, police officers, transit workers and other public employees will be banned from negotiating on their behalf for better wages and working conditions.",
      "Gov. Spencer Cox announced his decision Friday evening following a week of rallies outside his office in which thousands of union members from the public and private sector urged him to veto the bill. The Republican-controlled Legislature had narrowly approved it last week after its sponsors abandoned a proposed compromise that would have removed the outright ban.",
      "\u201cI\u2019m disappointed that, in this case, the process did not ultimately deliver the compromise that at one point was on the table and that some stakeholders had accepted,\" Cox said in a statement announcing he had signed the bill.",
      "The measure did not pass with veto-proof margins, meaning that if Cox had rejected it, Republican supporters would have needed to pull in more support to override his veto.",

      "Many educators, who are the state\u2019s most frequent users of collective bargaining, view the new law as way for Republicans to curb the political influence of teachers unions and clear a path for their own education agenda.",
      "Its GOP sponsors argued it was needed to allow employers to engage directly with all employees, instead of communicating through a union representative.",
      "The Utah Education Association, the state\u2019s largest public education employees\u2019 union, criticized Cox for ignoring the many workers who urged him to issue a veto.

      "Students at the state\u2019s public colleges and universities will only be allowed to enter or live in a gendered space, such as a dorm building, locker room or bathroom, that corresponds with their sex assigned at birth. It's the first transgender restriction explicitly aimed at university housing, though some states have broad bathroom laws that could be interpreted to apply to dorms."

      "Americans looking to buy a newly built home this spring are likely to get a helping hand with their mortgage rate and other costs",
      "LOS ANGELES -- Americans looking to buy a newly built home this spring are likely to get a helping hand with their mortgage rate and other costs.",
      "Many homebuilders are offering buyers valuable incentives like paying down their mortgage rate, covering closing costs or even throwing in \u201cflex dollars\u201d that home shoppers can put toward upgrades or other costs.",
      "While the sales strategy isn\u2019t new, builders are under pressure this year to ramp up such incentives because they\u2019re facing a tough spring homebuying season.",
      "Stubbornly high mortgage rates, more competition from existing homes on the market and the realization that years of rising home prices have pushed affordability to the limit for many prospective buyers gives builders little opportunity to ease off the costly incentives.",
      "\u201cThey\u2019re running into more competition, fewer buyers and increased costs to sell a home,\u201d said Ali Wolf, chief economist at Zonda.",
      "And dialing back incentives may not be easy, as home shoppers have now come to expect them.",
      "\u201cWe should anticipate that builder incentives are here to stay,\u201d Wolf said. \u201cI don\u2019t see a world where they don\u2019t need them, unless interest rates came down, and most signs point to higher-for-longer with interest rates.\u201d",
      "Elevated mortgage rates and rising prices have kept many prospective home shoppers on the sidelines, especially first-time buyers who don\u2019t have equity from an existing home to put toward a purchase. While mortgage rates have eased in recent weeks, the average rate on a 30-year mortgage has been hovering around 7% since November after climbing from a 2-year low of just over 6% in September, according to Freddie Mac.",
      "Builders have increasingly relied on buyer incentives to mitigate the impact of higher borrowing costs on home shoppers as the average rate on a 30-year mortgage more than doubled in recent years from its pandemic-era historic low of 2.65%. Many builders have also lowered prices.",
      "The share of homebuilders that offer sales incentives has ranged between 60% and 64% since June, while between 30% and 33% have lowered prices, according to surveys by the National Association of Home Builders.",
      "The use of buyer incentives helped drive sales of new homes higher last year, while the resale home market remained in a deep slump. Sales of newly built single-family homes rose 2.6% last year to around 1.02 million units, the highest level since 2021, according to data from the U.S. Census Bureau. Sales of previously occupied U.S. homes fell in 2024 to their lowest level in nearly 30 years.",
      "While mortgage buydowns and other incentives can help builders entice buyers, their cost eats into their profit margins. The average operating margin for 12 of the largest homebuilders, including D.R. Horton, PulteGroup and Lennar, was 15.08% in the fourth-quarter, according to data compiled by FactSet. That\u2019s down from an average of 16.3% in the same period a year earlier.",
      "The concern now is that builders will have to maintain, if not boost, buyer incentives to continue mitigating the impact of high mortgage rates at a time when home shoppers have a wider selection to choose from. Last month, active listings \u2014 a tally that encompasses all homes on the market except those pending a finalized sale \u2014 were up 25% from a year earlier, according to Realtor.com.",
      "Rising construction costs and uncertainty over the impact that the Trump administration\u2019s trade and immigration policies may have on building materials and labor costs, respectively, are also fueling worries on Wall Street about how well builder profit margins will hold up this year.",
      "\u201cWe expect order growth to come at the expense of margins for homebuilders,\u201d analysts at BofA Securities wrote in a recent research note. They also said they expect a \u201cchallenging environment for homebuilders to persist\u201d through the first half of this year.",
      "Concern over builders\u2019 profit margins has weighed on the stocks, with many homebuilders off to a downbeat start this year after lagging the overall stock market in 2024.",
      "D.R. Horton, the nation\u2019s largest builder by closings, is down around 7.5% this year. Lennar is down 5.6% and NVR is off 10.2%.",
      "The SPDR S&P Homebuilders ETF, which tracks a variety of building products companies, is up 1.4%. By comparison, the S&P 500 is up about 4%.",

      "The Trump administration has blocked The Associated Press from traveling with President Trump on Air Force One and also from covering an Oval Office event",
      "The White House barred a credentialed Associated Press reporter and photographer from boarding the presidential airplane Friday for a weekend trip with Donald Trump, saying the news agency\u2019s stance on how to refer to the Gulf of Mexico was to blame for the exclusion. It represented a significant escalation by the White House in a four-day dispute with the AP over access to the presidency.",
      "The administration has blocked the AP from covering a handful of events at the White House this week, including a news conference with India's leader and several times in the Oval Office. It\u2019s all because the news outlet has not followed Trump\u2019s lead in renaming the body of water, which lies partially outside U.S. territory, to the \u201cGulf of America.\u201d",
      "AP reporters and photographers travel with the president virtually everywhere as part of a press \u201cpool\u201d and have for decades. AP journalism serves millions of readers and thousands of news outlets around the world.",
      "Journalists consider the administration's move a violation of the U.S. Constitution's First Amendment \u2014 a governmental attempt to dictate what a news company publishes under threat of retribution. The Trump administration says the AP has no special right of access to events where space is limited, particularly given the news service's \u201ccommitment to misinformation.\u201d",

      "\u201cFreedom of speech is a pillar of American democracy and a core value of the American people. The White House has said it supports these principles,\u201d AP spokeswoman Lauren Easton said Friday night. \u201cThe actions taken to restrict AP\u2019s coverage of presidential events because of how we refer to a geographic location chip away at this important right enshrined in the U.S. Constitution for all Americans.\u201d",
      "The body of water in question has been called the Gulf of Mexico for hundreds of years. AP, whose influential stylebook is used by news outlets as an arbiter of language and usage, advised that because of its broad set of global customers, it would both refer to the body of water as the Gulf of Mexico and also reference Trump\u2019s order changing the name to the Gulf of America within the United States.",
      "At the same time, the AP switched style last month from Denali to Mount McKinley for the mountain in Alaska that Trump ordered renamed. That location lies entirely within U.S. jurisdiction.",
      "Taylor Budowich, White House deputy chief of staff, said in a post to X Friday \u2014 one that was later released as a White House statement \u2014 that the AP \u201ccontinues to ignore the lawful geographic name change of the Gulf of America. This decision is not just divisive, but it also exposes The Associated Press\u2019 commitment to misinformation.\u201d",
      "While the First Amendment protects the AP\u2019s \u201cright to irresponsible and dishonest reporting,\u201d it doesn\u2019t ensure unfettered access to limited spaces like the Oval Office and Air Force One, Budowich said. He said AP would retain its credentials to the White House complex overall.",
      "On Friday, an AP reporter and photographer had traveled to Joint Base Andrews for their participation in the traveling press pool to Trump's Florida residence. But, after clearing security, neither was allowed to board Air Force One, a decision they were told was \u201coutlet-specific.\u201d Meanwhile, reporters in the press pool who were permitted on the plane sent the AP journalists pictures of cards with their names saying \u201cwelcome aboard\u201d on their empty seats.",
      "Other news organizations, like The New York Times and Washington Post, have also said they would primarily use Gulf of Mexico. Fox News said that it was switching to Gulf of America.",
      "The White House Correspondents Association has issued statements condemning the action against AP. Although there are talks going on behind the scenes, individual news outlets have been relatively quiet.",
      "The Times, through spokesman Charles Stadtlander, said on Friday that \"we stand by The Associated Press in condemning repeated acts of retribution by this administration for editorial decisions it disagrees with. Any move to limit access or impede reporters doing their jobs is at odds with the press freedoms enshrined in the Constitution.\u201d",
      "In a statement, the Washington Post said that the AP's \u201caccess to the administration is central for all journalistic organizations, including The Washington Post, in serving millions of Americans with fact-based, independent journalism each day.\u201d",

Sales rose at general merchandise stores, a category that includes big retailers like Walmart and Target, and at restaurants and bars.",

      "Record high egg prices prompted Nevada lawmakers to unanimously back suspending their cage-free egg law, but the six other states with similar laws in effect have shown no sign of dropping them even if it might help lower grocery bills",
      "LAS VEGAS -- Back when egg prices remained securely under $2 a dozen in 2021, Nevada joined several other states concerned about animal welfare in requiring cage-free eggs.",
      "Now four years later, a dozen eggs costs an average of nearly $5 in the U.S. because of the lingering bird flu, so Nevada passed a law the governor signed Thursday that will allow the state to suspend that law temporarily in hopes of getting residents some relief at the checkout counter.",
      "But it is not quite that simple, which is why the other six states with the same laws are so far reticent to follow suit.",
      "By relaxing the rule, Nevada might get access to additional eggs, but the supply of all eggs remains tight because nearly 159 million birds have been slaughtered since the bird flu outbreak began in 2022 to help limit virus spread. The virus prompts the slaughter of entire flocks anytime it is found.",
      "It is not clear dropping cage-free laws will have a significant effect on egg prices that have peaked at an average of $4.95 per dozen because the farmers who collectively invested several billion dollars in making the switch can\u2019t easily go back to raising chickens packed together in massive barns that they already spent the money to convert.",
      "Even if all the cage-free laws went away, big corporations like McDonald\u2019s and Sodexo remain committed to buying only those kind of eggs, ensuring strong demand for cage-free eggs.",
      "University of Arkansas agricultural economist Jada Thompson said opening up Nevada to all kinds of eggs \u201ccould ease egg prices in Nevada very slightly,\u201d but that it might make prices worse elsewhere because supplies are so tight.",
      "But Nevada is going to give it a try even if California, Massachusetts, Washington, Oregon, Colorado and Michigan don't seem to be considering it. Arizona, Rhode Island and Utah also have cage-free laws on the books, but theirs won't take effect for at least a couple more years.",
      "Democratic Assemblymember Howard Watts III, who raises chickens in his Nevada backyard, advocated for the 2021 bill to promote the \u201cstandard of humane treatment\u201d of the animals. But the ongoing bird flu outbreak in the U.S. has caused egg prices to to hit a record high, and cage-free eggs are generally even more expensive.",
      "\u201cOne of the things that was not foreseen at that time was this major animal disease outbreak,\u201d Watts testified Tuesday. \u201cAs a result, there was no regulatory flexibility to suspend those requirements in the event of a major supply chain disruption.\u201d",
      "Republican Gov. Joe Lombardo approved the legislation Thursday. Nevada Department of Agriculture Director J.J. Goicoechea is expected to authorize the 120-day suspension of the cage-free egg requirements within a day, according to Goicoechea's spokesperson Ciara Ressel.",
      "\u201cWe anticipate 30 days before we can see an impact at the grocery stores,\u201d Ressel said.",
      "This month\u2019s jump in egg prices was the biggest since the nation\u2019s last bird flu outbreak in 2015. The previous high was set two years ago when eggs were selling for $4.82 per dozen on average.",
      "The average prices mask just how bad it is in some places. Some Californians these days are shelling out $12.99 for a dozen, or more than a buck an egg. Some New York shops even started selling bundles of three eggs to help people who can't afford a full dozen.",
      "Nevada resident Nancy Wong said she has been \u201coutraged\u201d by egg prices in the state. \u201cWe have gone to the store and eggs have been either rationed or completely out,\u201d she said.",
      "The concern with the cage-free requirements is that only about 121 million of the 304 million chickens laying eggs nationwide are raised on cage-free farms, so the supply is limited.",
      "Many of the eggs those hens produce are promised to restaurant chains like McDonald's and Panera, food service giants like Sodexo and Aramark and grocers under long-term contracts that help keep prices down. But even when they do have to pay a premium, grocers sometimes lose money on eggs by selling them cheaply to try to get shoppers in the door.",
      "The number of cage-free chickens has steadily increased in recent years because of the laws and the pressure from the companies buying eggs, increasing exponentially from just 38 million at the start of 2017. But the United Egg Producers trade group has estimated it would take at least 226 million cage-free hens to meet all the demand for those eggs, and more customers are clamoring for them, so the supply is tight.",
      "The total flock of chickens nationwide used to number above 330 million before the bird flu outbreak began.",
      "Even as more egg farmers were converting to cage-free setups over the past decade, prices stayed between $1.40 and $2 per dozen most of the time with only the normal seasonal price spikes around Easter and Thanksgiving until this current bird flu outbreak began in early 2022.",
      "If bird flu outbreaks happen to hit cage-free farms hard, there are fewer eggs out there that can replace the lost ones. For example, out of the nearly 47 million birds slaughtered just since the start of December, more than 3 million of them were on five cage-free farms in California.",
      "Anytime birds must be killed, it takes months for a farm to resume producing eggs because of the time required to dispose of the carcasses, sanitize the barns and raise new chickens until they are about 5 months old and capable of laying eggs.",
      "California won\u2019t consider dropping its cage-free law in part because the rule came from a measure voters passed in 2018, so voters would have to approve any major changes.",
      "But there doesn't seem to be much support for changes in other states either.",
      "Michigan state Rep. Jerry Neyer, a dairy farmer and chair of the state House Agriculture Committee, said the idea that new cage-free laws are driving up egg prices is a \u201cmisconception.\u201d The Republican added that most farms already adapted to comply with the law, so dropping the mandate wouldn't cut costs.",
      "A bill to repeal Colorado\u2019s cage-free requirements, which just took effect on Jan. 1, was killed in its first committee vote last month. The sponsor, Republican state Rep. Ryan Gonzalez, argued that while the avian flu was a major factor in prices, the cage-free rules played a significant role. But the majority of lawmakers on the panel appeared skeptical.",
      "Jonathan Kuester, who runs the small Historic Wagner Farm with about 200 Red Star hens in Illinois just outside Chicago, said he doesn't think cage-free practices are the cause of the egg shortages.",
      "He acknowledged his farm is more vulnerable to a bird flu infection than a traditional farm where chickens are confined inside a barn that can be better protected. Kuester's birds roam free, where they might interact with ducks and geese that are the main carriers of the disease.",
      "\u201cThe egg shortage that people are seeing is a result of some fairly large flocks being euthanized, and so fewer chickens are currently laying than were three or four months ago,\" Kuester said. \u201cThere\u2019s been a little bit of a panic, too. People are suddenly buying eggs as quickly as they can, and so you see that shortage.\"",

      "Julie Pace, the AP's senior vice president and executive editor, called it a \u201cdeeply troubling escalation\" and \u201ca plain violation of the First Amendment\u201d to the U.S. Constitution.",
      "\u201cWe urge the Trump administration in the strongest terms to stop this practice,\u201d Pace, who also wrote to Trump's chief of staff on Wednesday, said in a statement. \u201cThis is now the third day AP reporters have been barred from covering the president \u2014 first as a member of the pool, and now from a formal press conference \u2014 an incredible disservice to the billions of people who rely on The Associated Press for nonpartisan news.\u201d",
      "Eugene Daniels, president of the White House Correspondents\u2019 Association, issued a statement Thursday supporting the AP.",
      "\u201cThe White House is seeking to curtail the press freedoms enshrined in our Constitution, and has admitted publicly they are restricting access to events to punish a news outlet for not advancing the government\u2019s preferred language,\" he said. \"Prohibiting journalists from access because of their editorial decisions is viewpoint discrimination.\u201d",

      "The White House had no immediate comment about Thursday's additional actions. Barring a credentialed reporter from a news conference with leaders of two of the world's most influential nations represents a step beyond preventing access to an Oval Office event.",

But the agency decided to stick with the Gulf of Mexico for a body that lies partially outside U.S. territory \u2014 while noting Trump's move.",

      "Austan Goolsbee, president of the Federal Reserve's Chicago branch, talks with The Associated Press about inflation, the job market and when rate cuts could resume",
      "WASHINGTON -- After three cuts to its key interest rate last year, Federal Reserve officials, led by Chair Jerome Powell, have signaled that they are in a new phase of watching and waiting. They'd like to see inflation fall further and gauge what impact that new policies from President Donald Trump, particularly tariffs, will have on the economy before they reduce borrowing costs further.",
      "One of those officials, Austan Goolsbee, is president of the Fed\u2019s Chicago branch. In an interview with The Associated Press, Goolsbee said in an interview on Feb. 7 that he expects inflation to decline and thinks the job market is stable. If tariffs don\u2019t worsen inflation, rate cuts could resume, he added.",
      "The interview was edited for clarity and length.",
      "A. We've got solid growth and we\u2019ve got stable employment at around full employment. There have been bumps along the way but looking at the longer arc, we have made a lot of progress on inflation toward our target. Of course, we should keep an eye out for overheating. But thus far this doesn\u2019t look like overheating to me.",
      "If we can clear out the fog coming from these uncertainties in the short run, what lies beneath there is pretty strong.",
      "A. Now we\u2019re getting into this area where we\u2019re uncertain where we are going to ultimately settle \u2014 it would make sense to kind of slow the rate at which we\u2019re going down and feel our way to the stopping point. Add on top of it, these new uncertainties, and I do feel like we've still just got to wait for the dust to clear before it\u2019s going to be easier to see the through line.",
      "A. If we were to see further increases in inflation, then we\u2019d have to be trying to distinguish which part is overheating, which threatens to be persistent, and which part is just a one-time cost increase, say, coming from tariffs. And that\u2019s not that easy to do, it\u2019s going to take time to figure that out.",
      "I will say the 2018 tariff experience was one in which the tariffs almost immediately went into the prices of those affected commodities or products. But they did not make a material difference to aggregate inflation.",
      "So if there is no further uptick in inflation, then I\u2019m still back on my underlying view of the economy is that we\u2019re pretty much stabilized at full employment, and the through line of inflation and inflation expectations are for a return to 2% and commensurate with inflation going down, I think the rates can go down. So it in my view it all depends on what the conditions look like. But I don\u2019t have a set time frame of \u2014 is that in two meetings or five meetings or one meeting or, or that kind of thing.",

      "In letters to the editor published Thursday in The Financial Times and the Los Angeles Times, Anne and Lucy Dayton said their father, Bruce Dayton, along with his four other brothers, expanded the Minneapolis department store into a massive brand that became Target that was built on two principles: a focus on the customer and the well-being of the community.",
      "Bruce Dayton died in 2015 at 97.",

      "Hong Kong plans to crack down on poor-quality subdivided flats are leaving many low-income residents uncertain about their future in one of the world\u2019s most expensive housing markets",
      "HONG KONG -- Jimmy Au\u2019s world shrinks to about the size of a parking space whenever she gets home.",
      "Her cramped Hong Kong home is one of four units carved out of what was once a single apartment. Most of the space is occupied by the bunk bed she shares with her husband and son, and their sleep is often disrupted by neighbors returning late or heading out early. Au\u2019s son often gets bruises bumping into things. Privacy is limited, with only a curtain separating the bathroom from the kitchen.",
      "But what troubles Au most about her home is that she might lose it. Hong Kong's government is planning to crack down on what it calls inadequate housing in subdivided apartments, mandating a minimum size and other baseline standards for homes like Au's. A public consultation period ended on Monday, and the government is aiming to pass the rules into law this year.",
      "The proposed rules leave many low-income residents like Au uncertain about their future in one of the world\u2019s most expensive housing markets.",
      "Au, a homemaker who moved from mainland China nine years ago, said her family pays about $460 a month in rent, about half of the income her husband makes from irregular renovation jobs.",
      "\u201cI\u2019m afraid the rent will get so high we can\u2019t afford it,\u201d Au said, sitting on the bed's lower bunk, surrounded by clothes, a fan and plastic storage drawers.",
      "Housing is a sensitive issue in Hong Kong, one of the world's least affordable cities. Some 7.5 million people live in a small territory that's mostly made up of steep slopes. Just 7%, or 80 square kilometers (30 square miles), of the city's total land is residential. The average price of an apartment of less than 40 square meters (430 square feet) last December ranged from about $13,800 to $16,800 per square meter, depending on the district.",
      "Beijing, which sees the city\u2019s housing problems as a driver of the 2019 anti-government protests, wants the city to phase out subdivided units by 2049. The government is also boosting the public housing supply, aiming to provide 189,000 flats over the next five years.",
      "But some 220,000 people rely on subdivided units, including migrants, workers, students and young professionals.",
      "Most subdivided homes are not far from the standards, the government said, but an estimated 33,000 units would need major renovations to meet them.",
      "The proposed rules would mandate a minimum size of at least eight square meters (86 square feet), a bar the government says it meant to leave room for low-priced housing. Every unit will also need to have a window, a toilet exclusively for the occupants' use, and a door to separate the toilet from other parts of the home, among other criteria.",
      "Landlords will have a grace period to renovate. After that, violations could lead to up to three years' imprisonment and a maximum fine of about $38,500.",
      "Security guard Fafa Ching has lived in multiple subdivided flats for over a decade. Her current unit costs about $490 per month and lacks even a bathroom sink, forcing her to collect water from the showerhead with a basin to wash her face. Her home will need renovation to meet proposed requirements for fire safety and separate electricity and water meters.",
      "Ching worries that upgraded homes will be too expensive for her.",
      "The government has said if necessary, it will offer assistance such as helping affected tenants to find other private accommodation or directly providing temporary shelter. A top official told the city\u2019s public broadcaster that transitional housing apartments are ready and assured that large-scale enforcement will happen only when proper resettlement arrangements are available.",
      "Chan Siu-ming, a professor at the City University of Hong Kong\u2019s social and behavioral sciences department, welcomed the government\u2019s taking steps to set minimum standards, but said its resettlement plans are inadequate.",
      "Chan said the impact could be wider than officials expect, and the city\u2019s supply of public and transitional housing may not meet needs. Low-income residents may also need help shouldering the cost of moving house, he said.",
      "As of last September, the average waiting time for a public flat is five and a half years, but it can take even longer than that. Ching said she's waited for eight years.",
      "In an emailed response to questions from The Associated Press, the government said it does not expect significant surges in rent as demand will drop with the increasing public housing supply. It reiterated that the rules will be implemented gradually to avoid causing panic.",
      "Chan added that some single people may be forced into even smaller dormitory-like \u201cbed spaces,\u201d which are not covered by the proposed rules. Bed spaces are widely considered to be Hong Kong's worst form of housing \u2014 partitioned areas in which residents get barely enough space to fit a single bed and some belongings. They are currently regulated under another law, the government said.",
      "Sze Lai-shan, the deputy director of the Society for Community Organization, a non-government organization, said some people have already been asked to move out of subdivided homes as landlords anticipate the policy.",
      "She suggested the government start registering substandard flats before the legislation comes into force to assess the residents\u2019 needs and consider expanding the eligibility for transitional housing. She also hoped the policy would eventually cover those living in tiny bed spaces.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s difficult to explain to people that Hong Kong has two sets of housing standards,\u201d she said.",
      "In Sham Shui Po, one of the city\u2019s poorest districts, bed space resident Law Chung Yu said he doubts that landlords will be able to comply with the rules.",
      "Law, who can\u2019t work due to a health problem and rents one layer of a bunk bed, pays around $280 in monthly rent for the bed space, about 30% of what he gets from the government subsidies he lives on. He shares a bathroom with neighbors in an apartment infested by lice.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s basically an armchair strategy, I don\u2019t see it having much impact in reality,\u201d he said.",
      "Au's never measured her unit, and isn\u2019t sure if her unit meets the minimum size. But with her neighboring units falling short of the minimum size requirement, she knows her home would probably be gone too. She hopes the government will help resettle affected households into places that cost the same as their current rent.",
      "Her landlord hasn\u2019t discussed the issue with her yet. For now, all she can do is wait.",
      "\u201cI\u2019m taking it day by day. It\u2019d be worse if I think about it so much I develop mental problems,\u201d she said."

      "It's the latest group of Amazon employees to side against union representation.",
      "Workers at an Amazon warehouse in North Carolina rejected a proposal to unionize, becoming the latest group of the company\u2019s employees to side against union representation.",
      "About three-quarters of employees at an Amazon fulfillment center in Garner, a town located near Raleigh, voted against joining a grassroots labor organization called Carolina Amazonians United for Solidarity and Empowerment, the National Labor Relations Board announced Saturday.",
      "The federal labor agency said 2,447 workers cast ballots against union representation while 829 voted in favor of joining the independent union, which is made up of former and current Amazon workers. The NLRB had said 4,300 Amazon workers were eligible to cast ballots in the election, which took place Monday through Saturday.",
      "Rev. Ryan Brown, a former Amazon worker who co-founded the group, said Saturday, \u201cWe had already braced ourselves for a loss.\u201d",
      "\u201cWe knew that historically the tide was against us to have a win for several reasons,\u201d Brown said. \u201cOne, we\u2019re in the South. Two, the average worker that\u2019s in North Carolina knows nothing about a union and the benefits of a union and what a union could do for them.\u201d",
      "The outcome came just weeks after workers at a Whole Foods Market store in Pennsylvania voted to unionize, leading to the first successful entry of organized labor into the grocery chain, which Amazon owns. Following the union win, Whole Foods asked the NLRB to toss out the election results, arguing the voting process was tainted.",
      "In 2022, workers at an Amazon warehouse in the New York City borough of Staten Island unionized with Amazon Labor Union, which joined forces with the Teamsters last year. However, Amazon has objected to the election result and refused to negotiate over a contract.",
      "At the same time, the company has also been able to successfully fend off union victories at a second warehouse on Staten Island, as well as at facilities near Albany, New York, and in Bessemer, Alabama.",
      "In November, an NLRB administrative law judge ordered a third union election for Amazon warehouse workers in Bessemer after determining that the company committed six violations leading up to a rerun election in March 2022. That rerun was held after the Retail, Wholesale and Department Store Union, which is seeking to represent Amazon workers in Bessemer, filed objections to the first election, which results in a union loss.",
      "Workers affiliated with Carolina Amazonians United for Solidarity and Empowerment, or CAUSE, have been organizing at the North Carolina warehouse since January 2022. Co-founder Brown said in an interview last month he started organizing because he felt like Amazon was not providing workers adequate protections against COVID-19.",
      "The company said Saturday that Amazon already offers what many unions are requesting, such as safe and inclusive workplaces and competitive pay.",
      "\u201cWe\u2019re glad that our team in Garner was able to have their voices heard, and that they chose to keep a direct relationship with Amazon,\" Amazon spokesperson Eileen Hards said in a written statement.",

      "Athletic Bilbao\u2019s game at Espanyol in the Spanish league was briefly interrupted because of fans\u2019 racist chants",
      "MADRID -- Athletic Bilbao\u2019s game at Espanyol was briefly interrupted on Sunday because of fans' racist chants.",
      "The referee activated the anti-racism protocol and stopped the Spanish league match in Barcelona about 20 minutes into the first half.",
      "Athletic forward I\u00f1aki Williams denounced the chants afterward, saying they were targeted at his teammate Maroan Sannadi. Williams has previously been subjected to racist chants at Espanyol.",
      "\u201cPeople should come to soccer matches to have a good time,\u201d Williams said. \u201cThese types of things can't be happening.\u201d",
      "The interruption lasted about three minutes and a message was broadcast to fans reminding them about punishment under the law for such chants.",
      "The game ended 1-1, with Oihan Sancet scoring the equalizer in the 77th after Roberto Fern\u00e1ndez put the hosts ahead in the 62nd.",
      "The Spanish league is expected to investigate the chants, with Espanyol facing a possible punishment.",
      "The result kept Athletic four points ahead of Villarreal and in the fourth and final Champions League spot. Villarreal was held at home by Valencia on Saturday.",
      "Real Sociedad had Igor Zubeldia sent off in the 20th minute and Sheraldo Becker ejected in the 75th in a 3-0 loss at Real Betis.",
      "It was the team's first loss after a three-game winning streak in all competitions.",
      "The result left the Basque Country club in 11th place.",
      "Marc Roca scored twice for Betis, which moved to eighth place.",
      "Sevilla snapped a three-game winless streak by routing last-placed Valladolid 4-0 with a brace for Juanlu S\u00e1nchez. Isaac Romero and Dodi Lukebakio also scored for the visitors, who moved to 12th place.",
      "It was the fifth consecutive loss for Valladolid, whose fans protested against the owner - former Brazil great Ronaldo. Some fans held \u201cRonaldo Go Home\u201d signs.",
      "Striker Vedat Muriqi scored twice in the first half-hour to lead Mallorca to a comfortable 3-1 home win over Las Palmas.",
      "It was Mallorca's first win after six matches. It lost five in a row in all competitions before a draw against Osasuna in the previous Spanish league round. It sits in seventh place, near the European qualifying places.",
      "Las Palmas, in 17th place, hasn't won in seven matches in all competitions with six losses and a draw.",

      "SAN FRANCISCO -- Victor Wembanyama and Chris Paul made history on All-Star Saturday night.",
      "The wrong type of history, that is.",
      "The San Antonio teammates were disqualified from the Skills Challenge on All-Star Saturday night because their shot attempts during the event were not \u201cvalid,\" as the rules required. And afterward, all everyone wanted to know was who came up with the plan.",
      "\u201cI did,\u201d Wembanyama said. \u201cI don't regret it. I think it was a good idea.\u201d",
      "The challenge included bounce passes, chest passes, shots from three different locations on the floor and dribbling. On the shots \u2014 from the corner over an automated defender, near the top of the arc and at the elbow \u2014 players had to either make one or shoot three, whichever came first.",
      "Wembanyama read the rules and determined that if he and Paul simply flipped the three shots from each location forward they would save a lot of time.",
      "And they did. Their time in the first round was 47.9 seconds, easily the best. It just didn't count after the NBA evidently thought their effort wasn't in the spirit of taking \u201cvalid\u201d shots, like the rules state.",
      "\u201cWe had the best time,\u201d Wembanyama said. \"Numbers speak for themselves.\"",
      "It was a most unconventional approach, but Wembanyama didn't surprise other competitors with his plan. Golden State's Draymond Green, who paired up with Warriors teammate Moses Moody in the event, said Wembanyama asked people beforehand if his plan was acceptable.",
      "\u201cIt definitely sucked to see them throwing the ball like that,\u201d Green said. \u201cBut what I will say is Wemby walked around the court asking everybody, \u2018Make one or three attempts?\u2019 And Wemby said, \u2018Oh, so I can get all three of them up there?\u2019 So, he asked. Now, he may not have asked the right people. But I will say, in Wemby's defense, he did ask a lot of people.\u201d",
      "Green and Moody lost to the Cleveland duo of Donovan Mitchell and Evan Mobley in the final of the skills event. Mitchell reacted by waving two-thumbs-down when Paul and Wembanyama finished, as some in the crowd booed.",
      "\u201cIf they weren\u2019t disqualified, I think we probably would have just did the same thing, to be honest with you,\u201d Mitchell said. \u201cPlay to win, I guess.\u201d",
      "Mobley indicated that he had similar thinking as Wembanyama.",
      "\u201cI feel like my first round I tried to do a similar thing but made it look like a real shot,\u201d Mobley said. \u201cBut that didn\u2019t work really well, so I switched up my strategy.\u201d",
      "Paul also said Wembanyama asked about the strategy beforehand. He said he had a good time nonetheless.",
      "\u201cWe tried something that we thought could win,\u201d Paul said. \u201cTo see if we had the best time, so ... it was fun.\"",
      "Green said Paul warmed up taking conventional shots, presumably before Wembanyama \u2014 a second-year player and the league's reigning rookie of the year, who'll play in his first All-Star Game on Sunday \u2014 presented his time-saving plan.",
      "\u201cThe old man followed the rookie,\u201d Green said, \u201cright off the cliff.\u201d",

    "story": [
      "Patrick Rodgers has a chance for his first PGA Tour victory after a wild day at the Genesis Invitational",
      "SAN DIEGO -- Patrick Rodgers is often mentioned alongside Tiger Woods because they share the Stanford record for most wins. What usually follows is the reminder that the 32-year-old Rodgers has yet to win on the PGA Tour.",
      "He has a chance to change that in the Genesis Invitational, with Woods presenting the trophy.",
      "Rodgers was at his best Saturday when golf's best were faltering on a tough day at Torrey Pines, playing mistake-free until dumping a gap wedge into the water on the par-5 18th for his only bogey. That gave him a 4-under 68 and a one-shot lead going into the final round.",
      "\u201cWhenever my name is mentioned, that\u2019s the first thing that everybody says professionally so it\u2019s something that I have to deal with,\u201d said Rodgers, who has played 283 times on the PGA Tour as a pro without winning.",
      "\u201cI\u2019ve struggled with it for a long time, but I feel like I\u2019m viewing my career from a different vantage point now and I\u2019m excited about the opportunity to cross that finish line tomorrow.\u201d",
      "Scottie Scheffler and Rory McIlroy have a longer road than they imagined to that line. Both were in contention early, and both faded in their own way with a series of mistakes, each with a three-putt from the 12-foot range. They were five behind.",
      "Rodgers was at 8-under 208, one shot ahead of Denny McCarty (71). Ludvig Aberg, who had an ace on the par-3 third hole, had a 70 and was another shot behind.",
      "Rodgers won 11 times at Stanford, same as Woods (and later Maverick McNealy). Now he is one round away from Woods, the tournament host who is likely to be at Torrey Pines on Sunday, presenting him the trophy. Woods withdrew when his mother died last week.",
      "But for Rodgers, 18 holes can feel like a marathon, especially on a beast like the South course at Torrey Pines.",
      "The course did a number on Scheffler and McIlroy.",
      "Scheffler, the world's No. 1 player, tied Davis Thompson for the lead with a birdie on the fifth and had the easily reachable par-5 sixth ahead of him. But he hit 7-wood from a fairway bunker into the crowd and then three-putted from just inside 15 feet for bogey.",
      "He also took two chips from thick rough near the par-5 ninth green and made bogey, took double bogey with a tee shot into the hazard on the 14th and wound up with a 76, his highest score in nearly three years.",
      "He was five shots behind with McIlroy, whose round of 74 was more of a slow bleed until he three-putted from 12 feet on the par-3 16th.",
      "Scheffler and McIlroy will be paired together in the final round, teeing off a lot earlier than both of them would have liked.",
      "The first day of full sunshine allowed for some good scoring early before a strong Pacific breeze kicked in. Tony Finau chipped in three times on his way to a 67. He started the day nine shots behind and will be in the penultimate group Sunday, four shots back.",
      "Also four back were Patrick Cantlay (68), Tommy Fleetwood (69) and Thompson, the 36-hole leader who was holding his own until a 40 on the back nine gave him a 76.",
      "McCarthy, steady through a roller coast day for so many others, also is going for his first PGA Tour win. But far more was expected from Rodgers, who grew up in amateur golf with Jordan Spieth and Justin Thomas and has watched them pile up tour wins and majors.",
      "He has switched his thinking from playing with expectations to simply trying to perform.",
      "\u201cIt felt like early in my career with the amateur resume that I had, I felt like there was a lot expected of myself internally,\" he said. \"And it was something where when immediate success, immediate wins didn\u2019t come straight away, it was kind of fighting who I saw myself to be.",
      "\u201cSo instead of playing with a monkey on your back that gets bigger and bigger over time when it doesn\u2019t happen, I\u2019m trying to play from a perspective that feels fresh and new and exciting and full of opportunity. Because that\u2019s what this game is, and I have a great one tomorrow.\u201d",
      "The bogey on the 18th \u2014 his gap wedge came out softer than he imagined from the first cut and barely reached the green before rolling down the hill \u2014 was his only blemish. Still, he had a 54-hole lead for only the third time in his 11 years on tour.",
      "His best work came on the back nine, starting with a 4-iron he laced into 15 feet for birdie on the 504-yard 12th hole, and a 3-wood onto the green at the par-5 13th. Only three other players hit that green in two.",
      "Rodgers also holed a 40-foot birdie putt across the 17th before his bogey at the end.",
      "Aberg played alongside Rodgers and was impressed with what he saw.",
      "\u201cHe played amazing and he was great off the tee,\u201d Aberg said. \u201cYou can be rewarded and have a lot of good chances into the greens, but as soon as you start missing the fairways, it gets pretty difficult. It\u2019s a great golf course, it\u2019s a U.S. Open golf course, and it definitely played that way today.\u201d",

      "NBA Commissioner Adam Silver has a message to those Dallas Mavericks fans who are still angry, two weeks later: He feels your pain",
      "SAN FRANCISCO -- NBA Commissioner Adam Silver has a message to those Dallas Mavericks fans who are still angry, two weeks later: He feels your pain.",
      "That said, he's also sure that the Mavericks believe that their decision to trade Luka Doncic to the Los Angeles Lakers for Anthony Davis was \u2014 in their minds, at least \u2014 the best possible move for the franchise.",
      "Silver, in his annual address at All-Star weekend on Saturday, said he had no advance word that the trade was looming and that he was surprised like everyone else. He also said he wasn't going to second-guess Dallas' decision.",
      "\u201cI can say one thing for sure: Whether or not history will ultimately judge this as a smart trade, they did what they thought was in the best interest of their organization,\" Silver said. \"I have absolutely no knowledge or belief there were any ulterior motives, no doubt in my mind that the Dumont-Adelson families bought that team to keep it in Dallas. I have no doubt whatsoever that they\u2019re committed to the long-term success of that franchise.\u201d",
      "The Doncic-for-Davis trade sent shock waves across the NBA. It was the first midseason trade where All-NBA players were swapped for one another, and the angry fallout from fans in Dallas over trading a 25-year-old superstar and global icon hasn't exactly subsided.",
      "\u201cI'm empathetic,\u201d Silver said. \u201cI understand it.\u201d",
      "San Antonio star Victor Wembanyama also understands how some Mavericks fans feel, even though he plays for the in-state rival Spurs.",
      "\u201cWhat really strikes me is how the Mavs\u2019 fans are hurting, how they feel,\u201d Wembanyama said Saturday. \u201cIt\u2019s really something that I think was a really strong emotion. But otherwise, I think the Mavs are still contenders. The Lakers are contenders. It\u2019s very competitive. They traded for very good players. ... But two weeks after, it\u2019s still the craziest trade I\u2019ve ever seen.\u201d",
      "Further adding to the disappointment or frustration for some Dallas fans is the fact that Davis got hurt in his debut game with the Mavericks, one of many big-man injuries the team is currently grappling with.",
      "\u201cTime will tell whether it was a smart trade,\u201d Silver said. \u201cBut they should believe in their organization.\u201d",
      "In other topics covered by Silver on Saturday:",
      "All-Star Saturday last year was highlighted by the 3-point contest between Stephen Curry and Sabrina Ionescu.",
      "Everyone left that night indicating that it would come back in 2025. But it didn't happen \u2014 and Silver said the reason is simply that it might have been too good to do twice.",
      "\u201cLast year was so magical, that competition, that it started to feel forced. And I think there was concern from all of us that we just weren\u2019t feeling it,\" Silver said.",
      "A few days after an arbitration panel ruled that ownership transfer of the Minnesota Timberwolves to Marc Lore and Alex Rodriguez \u2014 who would get the majority stake for $1.5 billion \u2014 must continue as originally planned, Silver said the league is waiting to see what happens next.",
      "\u201cMy expectation is that will move forward. But first, Glen Taylor does have a decision to make as to whether to appeal that arbitration decision,\" Silver said. \"I mean, that\u2019s Glen\u2019s decision to make. I haven\u2019t talked to him directly about that. I think, though, that A-Rod, certainly Marc Lore, are well-known to the league at this point. They\u2019ve already been vetted and approved as minority owners. I think they understood that the league had no role in this arbitration. That was something they had agreed to as part of their purchase agreement.\u201d",
      "Silver said he sees no reason why the sale wouldn't be approved, but stopped short of speaking for the Board of Governors and the decision they would have to make to get the sale across the finish line.",
      "A week after a trade between Charlotte and the Lakers fell through because of the results of Hornets center Mark Williams' physical, Silver said the Hornets have not filed a formal appeal with the league.",
      "The Lakers rescinded the trade.",
      "\u201cLet\u2019s see what Charlotte decides to do here,\" Silver said. \"But I think either way, it\u2019s gotten our attention. We understand that in the back and forth of teams and trades that the extent we can reduce uncertainty, that\u2019s a positive thing.\u201d",
      "The NBA hasn't hidden from the fact that their television ratings aren't where the league wants them to be, but Silver sees progress.",
      "\u201cI\u2019ll begin with the state of our ratings right now as they\u2019re conventionally measured,\" Silver said. \"They\u2019re slightly down from last season. We had some weakness early in the season. We rebounded. The ratings are heading up right now. So, I see that as very positive.\u201d",
      "The NBA also doesn't solely look at ratings. The league's footprint on social media is growing and is at \u201crecord popularity,\u201d Silver said, and he said that the TV numbers don't show the interest from podcasts and other forms of new media.",
      "\u201cNow, how do you blend all those things together? I think that's the really tough question,\u201d Silver said.",

      "Kotsay and the Athletics announced Monday that they've agreed to a contract extension through the 2028 season that includes a club option for 2029. The deal coincided with the team's first full-squad workout of spring training, and dozens of players and coaches were in attendance for the manager's news conference.",
      "\u201cI'm very humbled right now,\u201d Kotsay said. \u201cOutside of the day I married my wife, I think this is going to go down as one of the best days of my life. The opportunity has been given to me to lead this group forward.",

      "The 49-year-old Kotsay is in his fourth season with the Athletics and has led the team through a period of upheaval that's included a move from Oakland to Sacramento, California, where they will play at a minor league stadium for the next few seasons. The eventual plan is to end up in Las Vegas.",

      "The coldest burst of Arctic air this season is coming to put an icy exclamation point on America's winter of repeated polar vortex invasions, meteorologists warn. And it will stay frozen there all next week.",
      "Different weather forces in the Arctic are combining to push the chilly air that usually stays near the North Pole not just into the United States, but also Europe, several meteorologists tell The Associated Press.",
      "This will be the 10th time this winter that the polar vortex \u2014 which keeps the coldest of Arctic air penned in at the top of the world \u2014 stretches like a rubber band to send some of that big chill south, said Judah Cohen, seasonal forecast director at the private firm Atmospheric and Environmental Research. In a normal winter, it happens maybe two or three times.",
      "This winter, with record snow in New Orleans and drought and destructive wildfires in Southern California, has not been normal.",
      "The latest projected cold outbreak should first hit the northern Rockies and northern Plains Saturday and then stick around all next week. The cold will likely concentrate east of the Rockies with only the far American west and central and southern Florida exempted, meteorologists said.",
      "On Tuesday, expect the Lower 48 states to have an average low of 16.6 degrees Fahrenheit (minus 8.6 Celsius), and then plunge to 14 degrees (minus 10 Celsius) on Wednesday, calculated private meteorologist Ryan Maue, a former National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration chief scientist.",
      "Sometime next week, 89% of the contiguous United States will be below the freezing mark and 27% of the Lower 48 will be below zero (minus 18 degrees Celsius), according to National Weather Service forecasts.",
      "Meteorologists expect strong winds to make the cold feel even worse. Every U.S. state but Hawaii, California and Florida have some or all parts forecast to have a good chance of windchills of 20 degrees or below sometime next week, the National Weather Service predicted.",
      "Kansas, Nebraska, Missouri and Iowa will have \u201cprobably the most impressive\u201d cold, with temperatures as much as 35 degrees (19 degrees Celsius) below what's normal for this time of year, said Zack Taylor, a meteorologist at the weather service's Weather Prediction Center. NOAA weather models predict Wednesday lows below zero in Oklahoma, Colorado, Nebraska, Missouri, Illinois, Iowa, Kansas, Wyoming, Montana, North Dakota, South Dakota, Minnesota, Wisconsin and Michigan.",
      "Some storms \u2014 with flooding, heavy snow or even a nor'easter \u2014 could hit during next week's prolonged cold outbreak, but details on those aren't certain yet, Taylor said.",
      "\u201cEverything, all the stars align, all the wind directions in the atmosphere are dragging the cold polar air out of the Canadian Arctic,\u201d Maue said. \u201cIt\u2019s the depths of winter. Everything signals extreme biting, winter cold. Obviously this isn\u2019t the first polar vortex episode of the winter, but it looks to be the most severe.\u201d",
      "A stretched polar vortex like this one happens lower in the atmosphere and is different than when the polar vortex has sudden warming, weakens and all the cold air escapes south and out of the poles, Cohen said. During stretching events, the polar vortex remains in place and strong, but it also just pulls and bends. Stretch outbreaks are usually slightly milder than the big polar escape events and often hit the United States, not Europe.",
      "Meteorologists are going to want to study why this stretching is happening so often this year, but it could just be natural randomness, said Laura Ciasto, a meteorologist at NOAA's Climate Prediction Center who specializes in the polar vortex.",
      "\u201cWhat we're observing right now is interesting, but not unprecedented,\u201d said Martin Stendel, a scientist at the National Center for Climate Research in Denmark.",
      "Another factor adding to the polar vortex stretching is a big blob of high pressure in the upper atmosphere over Greenland. It's moving west and will push the jet stream \u2014 the river of air that moves weather systems such as storms \u2014 into a pattern that causes polar air to plunge and stay there, Cohen said.",
      "Human-caused climate change may be making the jet stream wavier and more likely to be stuck in that wavy pattern, one of the factors involved, Stendel said.",
      "There haven't been many winters like this in the past to help meteorologists forecast what will happen next and when the cold will finally go away, Maue said.",
      "Despite the unusually cold winter across the U.S., the world remains in an overall warming pattern. Earth's average overall temperature set yet another monthly heat record in January. It was the 18th month of the last 19 that the world hit or passed the internationally agreed upon warming limit of 1.5 C (2.7 F) above pre-industrial times.",

      "The man who led a NASA facility that shouldered much of the blame for the 1986 space shuttle Challenger explosion has died",
      "William Ray Lucas, who led the NASA facility that shouldered much of the blame for the 1986 explosion of the space shuttle Challenger, has died. Lucas was 102.",
      "Lucas died Monday at his home in Huntsville, Alabama, according to an obituary published Friday by Laughlin Service Funeral Home in Huntsville. A funeral service has been set for March 1 on what would have been his 103rd birthday, funeral director Bryan Peek said Saturday.",
      "Lucas was director of the Marshall Space Flight Center in Huntsville when the Challenger exploded on Jan. 28, 1986, just 73 seconds after liftoff from Cape Canaveral, Florida. It was the deadliest U.S. space flight disaster at that time.",
      "The explosion killed all seven crew members, including schoolteacher Christa McAuliffe, who had been tapped to become the first U.S. civilian to travel to space. Her inclusion on the flight meant thousands of schoolchildren across the country were watching the Challenger's launch and witnessed the televised disaster in real time.",
      "A presidential commission charged with investigating the cause of the explosion pointed to the shuttle's solid-fuel booster rockets as the likely culprit and criticized NASA managers for not taking safety concerns surrounding the rockets more seriously. The Marshall center had supervised development of the rockets.",
      "Lucas pushed back on the criticism, telling reporters a month after the explosion that it was too soon to pinpoint the cause of the explosion, adding, \u201cI think it was a sound decision to launch.\"",
      "But within months he had resigned, just days ahead of the release of a commission report blaming faulty design of the booster rockets.",
      "The explosion and resulting shakeup within NASA overshadowed what was an otherwise stellar career for Lucas, who was born and raised in rural western Tennessee and graduated from high school in 1939 as the class valedictorian. He earned a bachelor of science degree from Memphis State College, served in the U.S. Navy during World War II and later earned a doctorate in metallurgy from Vanderbilt University.",
      "Lucas began his career in the guided missile development division of the U.S. Army's Redstone Arsenal near Huntsville. He became a charter member of the Marshall Space Flight Center when it was established in 1960 before rising through the ranks to become its director in 1974."

      "PORTLAND, Maine -- A recording released by the federal government appears to include audio of the implosion of the experimental submersible that went missing on its way to the wreck of the Titanic.",
      "A National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration passive acoustic recorder located about 900 miles (1,448 kilometers) away from the implosion site picked up the sound, U.S. Coast Guard officials said in a statement. The recording became public on Feb. 7.",
      "The brief, staticky recording includes a loud noise that sounds somewhat like an underwater thunderclap. It then goes silent for its remaining few seconds.",
      "The Coast Guard said in a statement that the audio clip \u201crecords the suspected acoustic signature of the Titan submersible implosion\u201d on June 18, 2023, the day the submersible went missing.",
      "The implosion of the Titan killed all five people on board and set off a Coast Guard investigation and international debate about the future of private deep-sea travel. The Titan vanished on its way to the wreck of the Titanic in the North Atlantic Ocean, setting off a five-day search that ended with authorities telling the world that the vessel had been destroyed with no survivors.",
      "Concerns were raised after the implosion because of the Titan's unconventional design and its creator's refusal to submit to independent safety checks. OceanGate, the Washington state-based company that owned the submersible, suspended operations in July 2023.",
      "Titan operator Stockton Rush, who co-founded OceanGate, was among those who died in the implosion. The implosion also killed two members of a prominent Pakistani family, Shahzada Dawood and his son Suleman Dawood; British adventurer Hamish Harding; and Titanic expert Paul-Henri Nargeolet.",
      "A Coast Guard panel performing a lengthy investigation into the submersible disaster heard two weeks of testimony last September. The testimony included dramatic moments, such as when a former OceanGate scientific director said the Titan malfunctioned during a dive just a few days before its implosion.",
      "The Coast Guard is expected to release more information about the implosion in the future. A spokesperson for the agency said Wednesday the investigation is still ongoing and a final report will be released after it is completed."

    "story": [
      "Ukraine has offered to strike a deal with U.S. President Donald Trump for continued American military aid in exchange for developing Ukraine\u2019s mineral industry",
      "KYIV, Ukraine -- KYIV, Ukraine (AP) \u2014 Ukraine has offered to strike a deal with U.S. President Donald Trump for continued American military aid in exchange for developing Ukraine\u2019s mineral industry, which could provide a valuable source of the rare earth elements that are essential for many kinds of technology.",
      "Trump said that he wanted such a deal earlier this month, and it was initially proposed last fall by Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy as part of his plan to strengthen Kyiv\u2019s hand in future negotiations with Moscow.",
      "\u201cWe really have this big potential in the territory which we control,\u201d Andrii Yermak, chief of staff to the Ukrainian president, said in an exclusive interview with The Associated Press. \u201cWe are interested to work, to develop, with our partners, first of all, with the United States.\u201d",
      "Here is a look at Ukraine\u2019s rare earth industry and how a deal might come together:",
      "Rare earth elements are a set of 17 elements that are essential to many kinds of consumer technology, including cellphones, hard drives and electric and hybrid vehicles.",
      "It's unclear if Trump is seeking specific elements in Ukraine, which also has other minerals to offer.",
      "\u201cIt can be lithium. It can be titanium, uranium, many others,\u201d Yermak said. \u201cIt\u2019s a lot.\u201d",
      "China, Trump\u2019s chief geopolitical adversary, is the world\u2019s largest producer of rare earth elements. Both the U.S and Europe have sought to reduce their dependence on Beijing.",
      "For Ukraine, such a deal would ensure that its biggest and most consequential ally doesn't freeze military support. That would be devastating for the country, which has been at war for nearly three years after Russia's full-scale invasion on Feb. 24, 2022.",
      "The idea also comes at a time when reliable and uninterrupted access to critical minerals is increasingly hard to come by globally.",
      "Ukraine\u2019s rare earth elements are largely untapped because of the war and because of state policies regulating the mineral industry. The country also lacks good information to guide the development of rare earth mining.",
      "Geological data is thin because mineral reserves are scattered across Ukraine, and existing studies are considered largely inadequate. The industry's true potential is clouded by insufficient research, according to businessmen and analysts.",
      "In general, the outlook for Ukrainian natural resources is promising. The country's reserves of titanium, a key component for the aerospace, medical and automotive industries, are believed to be among Europe\u2019s largest. Ukraine also holds some of Europe\u2019s largest known reserves of lithium, which is required to produce batteries, ceramics and glass.",
      "In 2021, the Ukrainian mineral industry accounted for 6.1% of the country\u2019s gross domestic product and 30% of exports.",
      "An estimated 40% of Ukraine's metallic mineral resources are inaccessible because of Russian occupation, according to data from We Build Ukraine, a Kyiv-based think tank. Ukraine has argued that it's in Trump\u2019s interest to develop the remainder before Russian advances capture more.",
      "The European Commission, the executive branch of the European Union, identified Ukraine as a potential supplier for more than 20 critical raw materials and concluded that if the country joins the 27-nation EU, it could strengthen the European economy.",
      "Details of any deal will likely develop in meetings between U.S. and Ukrainian officials. Zelenskyy and Trump will probably discuss the subject when they meet.",
      "U.S. companies have expressed interest, according to Ukrainian business officials. But striking a formal deal would likely require legislation, geological surveys and negotiation of specific terms.",
      "It's unclear what kind of security guarantees companies would require to risk working in Ukraine, even in the event of a ceasefire. And no one knows for sure what kind of financing agreements would underpin contracts between Ukraine and U.S companies.",

      "ROME -- ROME (AP) \u2014 The Italian government denied Wednesday that it had spied on journalists and migrant activists using spyware but said it would cooperate with an investigation into \u201cvulnerabilities\u201d after at least seven Italian cellphones were apparently hacked with military-grade surveillance technology.",
      "Meta\u2019s WhatsApp messaging service informed dozens of people across the European Union on Jan. 31 that they had been targeted in a spyware attack using technology from Israeli cyber firm Paragon Solutions.",
      "In a statement provided by Meta\u2019s Italy press office, WhatsApp said it had disrupted what it called \u201ca spyware campaign by Paragon that targeted several users, including journalists and members of civil society.\u201d",
      "After The Guardian newspaper reported the story, the Italian government confirmed on Feb. 5 that at least seven Italian cellphones were involved and that it had activated the National Cybersecurity Agency, which reports to the premier\u2019s office, to investigate.",
      "It said other targeted phones had numbers from Belgium, Greece, Latvia, Lithuania, Austria, Cyprus, Czech Republic, Denmark, Germany, Netherlands, Portugal, Spain and Sweden.",
      "Speaking to parliament\u2019s lower chamber Wednesday, Cabinet Minister Luca Ciriani confirmed that the Italian government for many years has had a contract with Paragon Solutions to provide intelligence-gathering capabilities to fight terrorism and other threats to national security.",
      "But he insisted that the law was \u201crigorously respected\u201d and denied the government had used the technology to spy on journalists illegally. He threatened legal action against any claims to the contrary.",
      "\u201cRegardless, it\u2019s up to judicial authorities to ascertain the source of the vulnerabilities that have been claimed,\u201d he said, adding that Italian intelligence services \u201care ready to provide full support.\u201d",
      "The Guardian has reported that Paragon halted its contract with Italy after the spyware attack became public, but Ciriani said the contract with the intelligence services continues. That suggests that a second contract, perhaps with another law enforcement agency or police department, was canceled. Israel\u2019s Haaretz newspaper has said Paragon had two contracts with Italy for Graphite, a military-grade surveillance technology capable of hacking into encrypted smartphones.",
      "There was no immediate response to an email seeking comment sent to Paragon Solutions.",
      "Among the Italians targeted were Luca Casarini, the head of the migrant rescue group Mediterranea Saving Humans, and Francesco Cancellato, editor of the Fanpage new website, both of whose work has been critical of the government.",
      "Both confirmed in interviews Wednesday that they had been informed by WhatsApp on Jan. 31 that their phones had been infected with the spyware. The message they received from WhatsApp suggested they contact Citizen Lab, based out of the Munk School at the University of Toronto, which has for years played a leading role in exposing state-backed hackers.",
      "Cancellato said he believed he had been targeted by hackers who wanted to see what investigative stories Fanpage was developing. He declined to speculate on who it might have been. Fanpage has published undercover reports in which journalists infiltrated the youth branch of Premier Giorgia Meloni's party and exposed neofascist behavior.",
      "Casarini, for his part, heads an aid group that rescues migrants in the Mediterranean and has criticized the Italian government's support of Libya's patrols of its coasts to prevent smugglers\u2019 boats from leaving."

      "NEW YORK -- Google's online calendar has removed default references for a handful of holidays and cultural events \u2014 with users noticing that mentions of Pride and Black History Month, as well as other observances, no longer appear in their desktop and mobile applications.",
      "The omissions gained attention online over the last week, particularly around upcoming events that are no longer automatically listed. But Google says it made the change midway through last year.",
      "The California-based tech giant said it manually added \"a broader set of cultural moments in a wide number of countries\u201d for several years, supplementing public holidays and national observances from timeanddate.com that have been used to populate Google Calendar for over a decade. Still, the company added, it received feedback about some other missing events and countries.",
      "\u201cMaintaining hundreds of moments manually and consistently globally wasn\u2019t scalable or sustainable,\u201d Google said in a statement sent to The Associated Press. \"So in mid-2024 we returned to showing only public holidays and national observances from timeanddate.com globally, while allowing users to manually add other important moments.\u201d",
      "Google did not provide a full list of the cultural events it added prior to last year's change \u2014 and therefore no longer appear by default today.",
      "But social media users and product experts posting to online community boards have pointed to several holidays and cultural observances that they're not seeing anymore. In addition to the first days of Pride Month and Black History Month, that includes the start of Indigenous Peoples Month and Hispanic Heritage Month, as well as Holocaust Remembrance Day. The Verge first reported on some of these omissions last week.",
      "Norway-based Time and Date AS, which operates timeanddate.com, did not immediately respond to requests for comment Tuesday. The website shows numerous country-by-country lists of holidays and observances from around the world \u2014 some of which include cultural awareness events like Pride and Black History Month \u2014 but those specific to public holidays are more limited.",
      "Separate from this Calendar shift, Google has also gained attention over its more recent decision to change the names of the Gulf of Mexico and Denali on Google Maps \u2014 following orders from President Donald Trump to rename the body of water bordering the U.S., Mexico and Cuba the Gulf of America, as well as revert the title of America\u2019s highest mountain peak back to Mt. McKinley.",
      "\u201cWe have a longstanding practice of applying name changes when they have been updated in official government sources,\u201d Google said last month. The company added that its maps will reflect any updates to the Geographic Names Information System, a database of more than 1 million geographic features in the U.S.",
      "Google confirmed Monday that the Gulf of America name had gone into effect. Google Maps users in the U.S. now only see the Gulf of America name, whereas those in other countries see both names. Denali, however, still appears on both Google Maps and the GNIS.",
      "And the new names on Google Maps aren't the only change the company has made following recent actions from the Trump administration. Last week, Google outlined plans to scrap some of its diversity hiring targets \u2014 joining a growing list of U.S. companies that have abandoned or scaled back their diversity, equity and inclusion programs. Google's move notably came in the wake of an executive order aimed, in part, at pressuring government contractors to end DEI initiatives. As a federal contractor, Google said it was evaluating required changes.",
      "By Tuesday, both Apple and Microsoft\u2019s Bing made the switch from Gulf of Mexico to Gulf of America on their maps."

      "OpenAI CEO Sam Altman has dismissed a $97.4 billion takeover bid led by rival Elon Musk, but the unsolicited offer could complicate Altman\u2019s push to transform the maker of ChatGPT into a for-profit company",
      "PARIS -- OpenAI CEO Sam Altman has dismissed a $97.4 billion takeover bid led by rival Elon Musk, but the unsolicited offer could complicate Altman's push to transform the maker of ChatGPT into a for-profit company.",
      "\"We are not for sale,\u201d Altman said Tuesday at an artificial intelligence summit in Paris.",
      "Musk\u2019s bid, announced Monday, is the latest in a bitter years-long battle with Altman over control of the AI startup they both helped found a decade ago as a nonprofit and is now a leading force in the global boom surrounding generative AI technology.",
      "\u201cOpenAI has a mission,\u201d Altman told France\u2019s AI minister in an on-stage discussion Tuesday mobbed by tech industry workers and investors. \u201cWe are an unusual organization and we have this mission of making AGI benefit all humanity. And we are here to do that.\u201d",
      "Its stated aim since its founding in 2015 is to safely build futuristic, better-than-human AI known as artificial general intelligence, or AGI. Musk, an early investor and board member, quit OpenAI in 2018 after an internal power struggle left Altman in charge.",
      "Their public feud has escalated over the past year as Musk sued OpenAI and is working to grow his own AI company called xAI, part of a business empire that includes Tesla, SpaceX and social media platform X. Musk also now holds power as a top adviser to President Donald Trump in reshaping the U.S. government, and has publicly questioned OpenAI\u2019s Trump-backed private investment project for building AI data centers in the United States.",
      "The offer complicates OpenAI's plan to shift its structure away from its nonprofit roots to a company beholden to shareholders.",
      "OpenAI's nonprofit board will need to consider Musk's offer. It's not Altman alone who can accept or reject it, though the chair of the board, Bret Taylor, echoed Altman's approach and declared \u201cOpenAI is not for sale\u201d at a Wall Street Journal event Tuesday in Palo Alto, California.",
      "Taylor said Musk's move was \u201clargely a distraction\u201d from the board's fiduciary duty to its mission.",
      "As a nonprofit board, said Taylor, \u201cour job is very simple, which is to basically evaluate every strategic decision of the organization through that one test, which is, \u2018Does this actually further the mission of ensuring AGI benefits humanity?\u2019 And I have a hard time seeing how this would.\u201d",
      "The board will need to weigh not just the value of the company's assets but also the value of controlling the company developing this technology. Musk's offer also seems to set a floor for how much the nonprofit should be paid if it does relinquish control of its subsidiaries.",
      "Rose Chan Loui, executive director for the Lowell Milken Center on Philanthropy and Nonprofits at UCLA Law, said the board should consider the credibility of Musk's offer, including if he and his investors will pay in cash. And they should consider whether a new board under the control of Musk and other investors would be independent and what guarantees they can give about protecting its public mission.",
      "Musk's $44 billion Twitter takeover in 2022 also started with an unsolicited offer and a legal fight with Twitter's board, which was also led by Taylor, a former Facebook and Salesforce executive. However, taking over OpenAI would be more complicated because of its charitable purpose.",
      "\u201cThere is a legally binding purpose,\u201d said Jill Horwitz, a professor at UCLA School of Law. \u201cIt is the promise that was made to the public when OpenAI, the nonprofit, was formed. That promise is legally enforceable.\u201d",
      "The sudden popularity of ChatGPT two years ago brought worldwide fame and new commercial possibilities to OpenAI and also heightened internal turmoil over the future of the organization and the advanced AI it was trying to develop. Its nonprofit board fired Altman in late 2023. He came back days later with a new board.",
      "OpenAI\u2019s nonprofit purpose, as defined most recently in 2020, is \u201c(to) ensure that artificial general intelligence benefits all of humanity, including by conducting and/or funding artificial intelligence research.\u201d",
      "The question is, can it do that if it sells its assets and loses control of the company developing this technology?",
      "\u201cTo make the promise to the world that you are bound by a legal purpose and to build with that promise, including telling your investors not to expect any returns and to think of your investments as more akin to a donation than an investment,\" said Horwitz. \"And then to say once you\u2019ve gotten big enough, \u2019You know what? We\u2019d like to own this.' That seems like a real violation of the promise.\u201d",
      "Musk sued OpenAI last year, first in a California state court and later in federal court, alleging it had betrayed its founding aims as a nonprofit research lab that would benefit the public good. A lawyer for Musk has said he invested about $45 million in the startup from its founding until 2018.",
      "Lawyers for OpenAI and Musk faced off in a California federal court last week as a judge weighed Musk\u2019s request for a court order that would block OpenAI's for-profit conversion.",
      "The judge hasn\u2019t yet ruled on Musk\u2019s request but in the courtroom said it was a \u201cstretch\u201d for Musk to claim he will be irreparably harmed if she doesn\u2019t intervene to stop OpenAI from moving forward with its planned transition. But she also suggested Musk had plausible enough arguments to take to a jury trial.",
      "Along with Musk and xAI, others backing the bid announced Monday include Baron Capital Group, Valor Management, Atreides Management, Vy Fund, and firms run by Musk allies Ari Emanuel and Jon Lonsdale.",
      "Musk attorney Marc Toberoff said in a statement that if Altman and OpenAI\u2019s current board \u201care intent on becoming a fully for-profit corporation, it is vital that the charity be fairly compensated for what its leadership is taking away from it: control over the most transformative technology of our time.\u201d",
      "Altman told employees this week that OpenAI's structure \u201censures that no individual can take control of OpenAI\u201d and he has sought to characterize Musk's tactics as those of a competitor trying to catch up.",
      "\u201cI think he\u2019s probably just trying to slow us down. He obviously is a competitor,\u201d Altman told Bloomberg TV at the Paris summit on Tuesday.",
      "Continuing their deeply personal feud, Altman said Musk is probably not a \u201chappy person.\u201d",
      "\u201cProbably his whole life is from a position of insecurity. I feel for the guy,\u201d Altman said.",
      "\u2014-",
      "O'Brien reported from Providence, Rhode Island, and Beaty from Seattle.",

      "Elon Musk has long railed against the U.S. government, saying numerous investigations and safety programs have stymied Tesla, his electric car company, and its efforts to create fleets of robotaxis and other self-driving automobiles",
      "WASHINGTON -- Elon Musk has long railed against the U.S. government, saying a crushing number of federal investigations and safety programs have stymied Tesla, his electric car company, and its efforts to create fleets of robotaxis and other self-driving automobiles.",
      "Now, Musk\u2019s close relationship with President Donald Trump means many of those federal headaches could vanish within weeks or months.",
      "On the potential chopping block: crash investigations into Tesla\u2019s partially automated vehicles; a Justice Department criminal probe examining whether Musk and Tesla have overstated their cars\u2019 self-driving capabilities; and a government mandate to report crash data on vehicles using technology like Tesla\u2019s Autopilot.",
      "The consequences of such actions could prove dire, say safety advocates who credit the federal investigations and recalls with saving lives.",
      "\u201cMusk wants to run the Department of Transportation,\u201d said Missy Cummings, a former senior safety adviser at the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration. \u201cI\u2019ve lost count of the number of investigations that are underway with Tesla. They will all be gone.\u201d",
      "Within days of Trump taking office, the White House and Musk began waging an unbridled war against the federal government \u2014 freezing spending and programs while sacking a host of career employees, including prosecutors and government watchdogs typically shielded from such brazen dismissals without cause.",
      "The actions have sparked outcries from legal scholars who say the Trump administration\u2019s actions are without modern-day precedent and are already upending the balance of power in Washington.",
      "The Trump administration has not yet declared any actions that could benefit Tesla or Musk\u2019s other companies. However, snuffing out federal investigations or jettisoning safety initiatives would be an easier task than their assault on regulators and the bureaucracy.",
      "Investigations into companies like Tesla can be shut down overnight by the new leaders of agencies. And safety programs created through an agency order or initiative \u2014 not by laws passed by Congress or adopted through a formal regulatory process \u2014 can also be quickly dissolved by new leaders. Unlike many of the dismantling efforts that Trump and Musk have launched in recent weeks, stalling or killing such probes and programs would not be subject to legal challenges.",
      "As such, the temporal and fragile nature of the federal probes and safety programs make them easy targets for those seeking to weaken government oversight and upend long-established norms.",
      "\u201cTrump\u2019s election, and the bromance between Trump and Musk, will essentially lead to the defanging of a regulatory environment that\u2019s been stifling Tesla,\u201d said Daniel Ives, a veteran Wall Street technology and automobile industry analyst.",
      "Among Musk\u2019s businesses, the federal government\u2019s power over Tesla to investigate, order recalls, and mandate crash data reporting is perhaps the most wide-ranging. However, the ways the Trump administration could quickly ease up on Tesla also apply in some measure to other companies in Musk\u2019s sprawling business empire.",
      "A host of Musk's other businesses \u2014 such as his aerospace company SpaceX and his social media company X \u2014 are subjects of federal investigations.",
      "Musk\u2019s businesses are also intertwined with the federal government, pocketing hundreds of millions of dollars each year in contracts. SpaceX, for example, has secured nearly $20 billion in federal funds since 2008 to ferry astronauts and satellites into space. Tesla, meanwhile, has received $41.9 million from the U.S. government, including payment for vehicles provided to some U.S. embassies.",
      "Musk, Tesla\u2019s billionaire CEO, has found himself in his newly influential position by enthusiastically backing Trump\u2019s third bid for the White House. He was the largest donor to the campaign, plunging more than $270 million of his vast fortune into Trump\u2019s political apparatus, most of it during the final months of the heated presidential race.",
      "Those donations and his efforts during the campaign \u2014 including the transformation of his social media platform X into a firehose of pro-Trump commentary \u2014 have been rewarded by Trump, who has tapped the entrepreneur to oversee efforts to slash government regulations and spending.",
      "As the head of the Department of Government Efficiency, Musk operates out of an office in the Eisenhower Executive Office Building, where most White House staff work and from where he has launched his assault on the federal government. Musk\u2019s power under DOGE is being challenged in the courts.",
      "Even before Trump took office, there were signs that Musk\u2019s vast influence with the new administration was registering with the public \u2014 and paying dividends for Tesla.",
      "Tesla\u2019s stock surged more than 60% by December. Since then, its stock price has dropped, but still remains 40% higher than it was before Trump's election.",
      "\u201cFor Musk,\u201d said Ives, the technology analyst, \u201cbetting on Trump is a poker move for the ages.\u201d",
      "The White House did not respond to questions about how it would handle investigations and government oversight involving Tesla or other Musk companies. A spokesman for the transition team said last month that the White House would ensure that DOGE and \u201cthose involved with it are compliant with all legal guidelines and conflicts of interest.\u201d",
      "In the weeks before Trump took office on Jan. 20, the president-elect\u2019s transition team recommended changes that would benefit the billionaire and his car company, including scrapping the federal order requiring carmakers to report crash data involving self-driving and partially automated technology.",
      "The action would be a boon for Tesla, which has reported a vast majority of the crashes that triggered a series of investigations and recalls.",
      "The transition team also recommended shelving a $7,500 consumer tax credit for electric vehicle purchases, something Musk has publicly called for.",
      "\u201cTake away the subsidies. It will only help Tesla,\u201d Musk wrote in a post on X as he campaigned and raised money for Trump in July.",
      "Auto industry experts say the move would have a nominal impact on Tesla \u2014 by far the largest electric vehicle maker in the U.S. \u2014 but have a potentially devastating impact on its competitors in the EV sector since they are still struggling to secure a foothold in the market.",
      "Musk did not respond to requests for comment. Before the election, he posted a message on X, saying he had never asked Trump \u201cfor any favors, nor has he offered me any.\u201d",
      "Although most of the changes that Musk might seek for Tesla could unfold quickly, there is one long-term goal that could impact the autonomous vehicle industry for decades to come.",
      "Though nearly 30 states have rules that specifically govern self-driving cars, the federal government has yet to craft such regulations.",
      "During a late October call with Tesla investors, as Musk was pouring hundreds of millions of dollars into Trump\u2019s campaign, he signaled support for having the federal government create these rules.",
      "\u201cThere should be a federal approval process for autonomous vehicles,\u201d Musk said on the call. \u201cIf there\u2019s a department of government efficiency, I\u2019ll try to help make that happen.\u201d",
      "Musk leads that very organization.",
      "People whose lives have been forever changed by Tesla crashes fear that dangerous and fatal accidents may increase if the federal government\u2019s investigative and recall powers are restricted.",
      "They say they worry that the company may otherwise never be held accountable for its failures, like the one that took the life of 22-year-old Naibel Benavides Leon.",
      "The college student was on a date with her boyfriend, gazing at the stars on the side of a rural Florida road, when they were struck by an out-of-control Tesla driving on Autopilot \u2014 a system that allows Tesla cars to operate without driver input. The car had blown through a stop sign, a flashing light and five yellow warning signs, according to dashcam video and a police report.",
      "Benavides Leon died at the scene; her boyfriend, Dillon Angulo, suffered injuries but survived. A federal investigation determined that Autopilot in Teslas at this time was faulty and needed repairs.",
      "\u201cWe, as a family, have never been the same,\u201d said Benavides Leon\u2019s sister, Neima. \u201cI\u2019m an engineer, and everything that we design and we build has to be by important codes and regulations. This technology cannot be an exception.\u201d",
      "\u201cIt has to be investigated when it fails,\u201d she added. \u201cBecause it does fail.\u201d",
      "Tesla\u2019s lawyers did not respond to requests for comment. In a statement on Twitter in December 2023, Tesla pointed to an earlier lawsuit the Benavides Leon's family had brought against the driver who struck the college student. He testified that despite using Autopilot, \u201cI was highly aware that it was still my responsibility to operate the vehicle safely.\u201d",
      "Tesla also said the driver \u201cwas pressing the accelerator to maintain 60 mph,\" an action that effectively overrode Autopilot, which would have otherwise restricted the speed to 45 mph on the rural route, something Benavides Leon's attorney disputes.",
      "The federal agency that has the most power over Tesla \u2014 and the entire automobile industry \u2014 is the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration, which is part of the Department of Transportation.",
      "NHTSA sets automobile safety standards that must be met before vehicles can enter the marketplace. It also has a quasi-law enforcement arm, the Office of Defects Investigation, which has the power to launch probes into crashes and seek recalls for safety defects.",
      "The agency has six pending investigations into Tesla\u2019s self-driving technology, prompted by dozens of crashes that took place when the computerized systems were in use.",
      "Other federal agencies are also investigating Musk and Tesla, and all of those probes could be sidelined by Musk-friendly officials:",
      "\u2014The Securities and Exchange Commission and Justice Department are separately investigating whether Musk and Tesla overstated the autonomous capabilities of their vehicles, creating dangerous situations in which drivers may over rely on the car\u2019s technology.",
      "\u2014The Justice Department is also probing whether Tesla misled customers about how far its electric vehicles can travel before needing a charge.",
      "\u2014The National Labor Relations Board is weighing 12 unfair labor practice allegations leveled by workers at Tesla plants.",
      "\u2014The Equal Employment Opportunity Commission is asking a federal judge to force Tesla to enact reforms and pay compensatory and punitive damages and backpay to Black employees who say they were subjected to racist attacks. In a federal lawsuit, the agency has alleged that supervisors and other employees at Tesla\u2019s plant in Fremont, California, routinely hurled racist insults at Black employees.",
      "Experts said most, if not all, of those investigations could be shut down, especially at the Justice Department where Trump has long shown a willingness to meddle in the department\u2019s affairs. The Trump administration has already ordered the firing of dozens of prosecutors who handled the criminal cases from the Jan. 6, 2021 attack on the Capitol.",
      "\u201cDOJ is not going to be prosecuting Elon Musk,\u201d said Peter Zeidenberg, a former Assistant U.S. Attorney in the Justice Department's public integrity section who served during the Clinton and George H.W. Bush administrations. \u201cI\u2019d expect that any investigations that were ongoing will be ground to an abrupt end.\u201d",
      "Trump has also taken steps to gain control of the NLRB and EEOC. Last month, he fired Democratic members of the board and commission, breaking with decades of precedent. One member has sued, and two others are exploring legal options.",
      "Tesla and Musk have denied wrongdoing in all those investigations and are fighting the probes.",
      "The federal agency that appears to have enjoyed the most success in changing Tesla\u2019s behavior is NHTSA, an organization of about 750 staffers that has forced the company to hand over crash data and cooperate in its investigations and requested recalls.",
      "\u201cNHTSA has been a thorn in Musk\u2019s side for over the last decade, and he\u2019s grappled with almost every three-letter agency in the Beltway,\u201d said Ives, the Wall Street analyst who covers the technology sector and automobile industry. \u201cThat\u2019s all created what looks to be a really big soap opera in 2025.\u201d",
      "Musk has repeatedly blamed the federal government for impeding Tesla\u2019s progress and creating negative publicity with recalls of his cars after its self-driving technology malfunctions or crashes.",
      "\u201cThe word \u2018recall\u2019 should be recalled,\u201d Musk posted on Twitter (now X) in 2014. Two years ago, he posted, \u201cThe word \u2018recall\u2019 for an over-the-air software update is anachronistic and just flat wrong!\u201d",
      "Michael Brooks, executive director of the Center for Auto Safety, a non-profit consumer advocacy group, said some investigations might continue under Trump, but a recall is less likely to happen if a defect is found.",
      "As with most car companies, Tesla\u2019s recalls have so far been voluntary. The threat of public hearings about a defect that precedes a NHTSA-ordered recall has generally prompted car companies to act on their own.",
      "That threat could be easily stripped away by the new NHTSA administrator, who will be a Trump appointee.",
      "\u201cIf there isn\u2019t a threat of recall, will Tesla do them?\u201d Brooks said. \u201cUnfortunately, this is where politics seeps in.\u201d",
      "Among the active NHTSA investigations, several are examining fundamental aspects of Tesla\u2019s partially automated driving systems that were in use when dozens of crashes occurred.",
      "An investigation of Tesla\u2019s \u201cFull Self-Driving\u201d system started in October after Tesla reported four crashes to NHTSA in which the vehicles had trouble navigating through sun glare, fog and airborne dust. In one of the accidents, an Arizona woman was killed after stopping on a freeway to help someone involved in another crash.",
      "Under pressure from NHTSA, Tesla has twice recalled the \u201cFull Self-Driving\u201d feature for software updates. The technology \u2014 the most advanced of Tesla\u2019s Autopilot systems \u2014 is supposed to allow drivers to travel from point to point with little human intervention. But repeated malfunctions led NHTSA to recently launch a new inquiry that includes a crash in July that killed a motorcyclist near Seattle.",
      "NHTSA announced its latest investigation in January into \u201cActually Smart Summon,\u201d a Tesla technology that allows drivers to remotely move a car, after the agency learned of four incidents from a driver and several media reports.",
      "The agency said that in each collision, the vehicles were using the system that Tesla pushed out in a September software update that was \u201cfailing to detect posts or parked vehicles, resulting in a crash.\u201d NHTSA also criticized Tesla for failing to notify the agency of those accidents.",
      "NHTSA is also conducting a probe into whether a 2023 recall of Autopilot, the most basic of Tesla\u2019s partially automated driver assistance systems, was effective.",
      "That recall was supposed to boost the number of controls and alerts to keep drivers engaged; it had been prompted by an earlier NHTSA investigation that identified hundreds of crashes involving Autopilot that resulted in scores of injuries and more than a dozen deaths.",
      "In a letter to Tesla in April, agency investigators noted that crashes involving Autopilot continue and that they could not observe a difference between warnings issued to drivers before or after the new software had been installed.",
      "Critics have said that Teslas don\u2019t have proper sensors to be fully self-driving. Nearly all other companies working on autonomous vehicles use radar and laser sensors in addition to cameras to see better in the dark or in poor visibility conditions. Tesla, on the other hand, relies only on cameras to spot hazards.",
      "Musk has said that human drivers rely on their eyesight, so autonomous cars should be able to also get by with just cameras. He has called technology that relies on radar and light detection to discern objects a \u201cfool\u2019s errand.\u201d",
      "Bryant Walker Smith, a Stanford Law School scholar and a leading automated driving expert, said Musk\u2019s contention that the federal government is holding him back is not accurate. The problem, Smith said, is that Tesla\u2019s autonomous vehicles cannot perform as advertised.",
      "\u201cBlaming the federal government for holding them back, it provides a convenient, if dubious, scapegoat for the lack of an actual automated driving system that works,\u201d Smith said.",
      "Smith and other autonomous vehicle experts say Musk has felt pressure to provide Tesla shareholders with excuses for repeated delays in rolling out its futuristic cars. The financial stake is enormous, which Musk acknowledged during a 2022 interview. He said the development of a fully self-driving vehicle was \u201creally the difference between Tesla being worth a lot of money and being worth basically zero.\u201d",
      "The collisions from Tesla\u2019s malfunctioning technology on its vehicles have led not only to deaths but also catastrophic injuries that have forever altered people\u2019s lives.",
      "Attorneys representing people injured in Tesla crashes \u2014 or who represent surviving family members of those who died \u2014 say without NHTSA, the only other way to hold the car company accountable is through civil lawsuits.",
      "\u201cWhen government can\u2019t do it, then the civil justice system is left to pick up the slack,\u201d said Brett Schreiber, whose law firm is handling four Tesla cases.",
      "However, Schreiber and other lawyers say if the federal government\u2019s investigative powers don\u2019t remain intact, Tesla may also not be held accountable in court.",
      "In the pending wrongful death lawsuit that Neima Benavides Leon filed against Tesla after her sister\u2019s death, her attorney told a Miami district judge the lawsuit would have likely been dropped if NHTSA hadn\u2019t investigated and found defects with the Autopilot system.",
      "\u201cAll along we were hoping that the NHTSA investigation would produce what it did, in fact, end up producing, which is a finding of product defect and a recall,\u201d attorney Doug Eaton said during a March court hearing. \u201cAnd we had told you very early on in the case if NHTSA had not found that, we may very well drop the case. But they did, in fact, find this.\u201d",

      "The area, long named the Gulf of Mexico across the the world, has gained a geopolitical spotlight in recent weeks after President Donald Trump declared he would change the Gulf's name.",
      "Sheinbaum, in her morning press conference on Thursday, said the president's decree is restricted to the \u201ccontinental shelf of the United States\" because Mexico still controls much of the Gulf. \u201cWe have sovereignty over our continental shelf,\" she said.",
      "Sheinbaum said that despite the fact that her government sent a letter to Google saying that the company was \u201cwrong\u201d and that \u201cthe entire Gulf of Mexico cannot be called the Gulf of America,\" the company has insisted on maintaining the nomenclature.",
      "It was not immediately clear where such a suit would be filed.",
      "Google reported last month on its X account, formerly Twitter, that it maintains a \u201clong-standing practice of applying name changes when they have been updated in official government sources.\u201d",
      "An Associated Press analysis shows that as of Thursday, the user's location and other data was dependent on how the Gulf appeared on Google Maps. If the user is in the United States, the body of water appeared as Gulf of America. If the user was physically in Mexico, it would appear as the Gulf of Mexico. In many other countries across the world it appears as \u201cGulf of Mexico (Gulf of America).\u201d",
      "Sheinbaum has repeatedly defended the name Gulf of Mexico, saying its use dates to 1607 and is recognized by the United Nations.",
      "She has also mentioned that, according to the constitution of Apatzing\u00e1n, the antecedent to Mexico\u2019s first constitution, the North American territory was previously identified as \u201cMexican America\u201d. Sheinbaum has used the example to poke fun at Trump and underscore the international implications of changing the Gulf's name.",
      "In that sense, Sheinbaum said on Thursday that the Mexican government would ask Google to make \u201cMexican America\u201d pop up on the map when searched.",
      "This is not the first time Mexicans and Americans have disagreed on the names of key geographic areas, such as the border river between Texas and the Mexican states of Chihuahua, Coahuila, Nuevo Le\u00f3n and Tamaulipas. Mexico calls it Rio Bravo and for the United States it is the Rio Grande.",
      "This week, the White House barred AP reporters from several events, including some in the Oval Office, saying it was because of the news agency's policy on the name. AP is using \u201cGulf of Mexico\u201d but also acknowledging Trump's renaming of it as well, to ensure that names of geographical features are recognizable around the world."

If you do engage, try to verify the person\u2019s identity by looking them up on the platform \u2014 check when their accounts were created or use a reverse image search on their photos.

      "Neutrinos spew from stars like the sun and trillions stream through our bodies every second. They're known as ghost particles because their mind-bogglingly small mass makes them difficult to spot.",
      "Scientists aren\u2019t able to detect neutrinos zipping around on their own. Instead, they measure what happens when the particles bump into other bits of matter.",
      "Two years ago, a neutrino collided with matter and produced a tiny particle called a muon that pinged through the underwater detector, producing flashes of blue light.

    "summary": "Federal courts are considering whether Elon Musk\u2019s status as de facto administrator of DOGE complies with the Constitution\u2019s Appointments Clause.",
    "story": [
      "Critics say the DOGE head must be confirmed by the Senate to be lawful.",
      "To his critics, Elon Musk is an unelected and unaccountable government official wielding expansive executive power in violation of the U.S. Constitution.",
      "To President Donald Trump, the world's richest man is a trusted adviser and authorized deputy, leading an unconventional -- but entirely legal -- campaign to downsize federal agencies.",
      "Now a pair of lawsuits have put a spotlight on the legality of Musk's status as de facto administrator of the Department of Government Efficiency, or DOGE, with federal courts -- potentially the Supreme Court -- soon to decide whether his role complies with the Constitution's appointments clause.",
      "The cases have the potential to sideline Musk and, at least temporarily, undo changes he has appeared to authorize involving federal agencies, property, staffing and policy, legal experts told ABC News. But the outcome is far from certain.",
      "The appointments clause says that a president may appoint officers of the U.S. \u2013 like ambassadors, Cabinet secretaries and Supreme Court justices -- but only \"by and with the advice and consent of the Senate\" through a confirmation vote. Musk has not been confirmed.",
      "The clause also says that a president may appoint \"inferior officers\" without Senate confirmation, but only if Congress has passed a law explicitly authorizing the positions. Trump created the DOGE by executive order without involvement from Congress.",
      "\"Musk manifestly answers only to Trump. Answering only to the President while wielding vast and enormous power is basically the Platonic form of a principal officer, thus requiring Senate confirmation,\" said James Sample, a constitutional law scholar at Hofstra University.",
      "The White House has said Musk is classified as an unpaid \"special government employee,\" a status Congress created in 1962 for temporary executive branch hires to perform limited duties for no more than 130 days.",
      "But the plaintiffs in the lawsuits against Musk \u2013 a coalition of 14 states and a group of two dozen federal civil servants -- claim the DOGE leader has in practice been acting as an \"officer of the U.S.\" and exercising authority well beyond an \"employee.\"",
      "The suits allege that Musk has directly made decisions about agency expenditures, contracts, government property, regulations. They also allege he has acquired vast troves of sensitive government data.",
      "\"Given Musk's depth and breadth of access, authority, and autonomy, any assertion that, despite his nominal 'special government employee' designation, he is operating as a mere employee is simply not credible,\" Sample said.",
      "The Supreme Court in a 1976 decision defined \"officer of the U.S.\" as a presidential appointee \"exercising significant authority pursuant to the laws of the U.S.\" More than two decades later, an opinion authored by the late conservative Justice Antonin Scalia affirmed that officers either had to be confirmed by the Senate or supervised by someone who had been confirmed.",
      "\"I think they have a good case,\" said Sarah Isgur, a former Justice Department official during Trump's first term and ABC News legal contributor. \"He's obviously an 'officer of the U.S.'\"",
      "Isgur said Musk's \"special government employee\" title -- which has never been constitutionally tested or defined by a court -- could, however, provide some buffer in his legal defense.",
      "The administration has also invoked a novel legal theory that says the president has virtually unchecked authority to hire and fire whomever he chooses within the entirety of the executive branch.",
      "\"With a great team around them, we're going to look at the receipts of this federal government and ensure it's accountable to American taxpayers,\" White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt said last month defending Musk's job as an advisor.",
      "Some legal scholars say ambiguity about Musk's precise actions behind the scenes could also complicate his critics' legal challenges.",
      "\"I think these sorts of early lawsuits will flame out because we truly don't know what Musk is doing. We are mostly left with conjecture and speculation,\" said Josh Blackman, a constitutional law professor at South Texas College of Law. \"So long as an actual government official is pushing the 'cancel' button, I don't know that Musk is holding any actual substantial authority.\"",
      "The appointment clause cases against Musk are at a very early stage and will likely take months to play out, several legal experts said. And regardless of the outcome, the practical impact could be minimal.",
      "\"By July 4, 2026, Musk will be out of office, and then something like the 'de facto officer' doctrine could save whatever work Musk did,\" Blackman pointed out. \"I don't see these cases as going anywhere.\"",
      "Sample suggested that if a court concluded Musk qualifies as an \"officer of the U.S.\" and needs to be confirmed, the White House could either \"retrofit\" actions already taken to be approved by another top official, or quickly work to have the GOP-controlled Senate confirm Musk himself.",
      "\"I actually think the administration is calculating, even with a hint of Machiavellian genius, that Musk is more or less untouchable by consequences short of imprisonment,\" Sample said. \"Even if they lose in the courts, the real-world consequences of the disruptions will nonetheless be substantial. The president thinks in transactional, as opposed to constitutional terms. Unfortunately, such an approach has long-term ramifications that extend far beyond any one presidency.\"",

      "Peter Marocco said the agency is \"working diligently to address these delays.\"",
      "A top official with the U.S. Agency for International Development acknowledged that \"changes\" in the agency's payment system had left some foreign service officers without \"certain allowance payments\" in recent weeks as the Trump administration has sought to dismantle the aid organization, according to a sworn declaration filed Friday in federal court.",
      "Peter Marocco, a Trump loyalist and the architect of efforts to slash USAID as part of President Donald Trump's massive federal cuts, wrote in his eight-page affidavit that the agency is \"working diligently to address these delays,\" which he said included \"routine payments to employees\" stationed overseas. The agency has placed several employees on temporary paid leave, including some deployed in high-risk countries.",
      "\"Although these delays could continue to impact certain payments to employees in the immediate future, an employee's leave status would not itself impact the timing or eligibility for such payments,\" Marocco said.",
      "Marocco did not specify how many government workers have been impacted, nor did he describe what actions had precipitated the delays, except to call them \"changes in the process by which payments can be made and approved by the Agency over the past weeks.\"",
      "Aid organizations have also reported having difficulty accessing funds dispersed through the agency's payment system, called Phoenix, though it was not clear from Marocco's affidavit whether those issues were related.",
      "Marocco penned the affidavit as part of a lawsuit brought by a union that represents government employees who are challenging the staffing cuts to USAID being made by the administration and its new Department of Government Efficiency. Plaintiffs in the case include foreign service officers who described their harrowing escape from the Democratic Republic of the Congo in recent weeks amid protests tearing through the country.",
      "One such official, identified in the court record only as Olivia Doe, said she and her family were evacuated from Kinchasa by speedboat in the middle of the night only \"with what could fit on our laps,\" calling the experience \"traumatizing\" for her two small children who \"witnessed the violence on the streets.\"",
      "\"Three days later, we finally arrived back to winter in DC with no warm clothes, a place to stay, or a school for the kids to go to,\" Doe wrote. \"We arrived to the news that DOGE and the Trump Administration were calling us 'criminals' -- something particularly hard to stomach after the ordeal we had just survived.\"",
      "Doe added that she feared losing her evacuation allowance \"due to the whims of DOGE and the Trump Administration,\" saying it would be \"completely unfair and inhumane to cut USAID evacuees off from the special evacuation allowance after many of us served for years in what is one of the poorest countries in the world.\"",
      "Marocco responded to some of those concerns in his affidavit on Friday, claiming that the administration's communication with employees being evacuated \"was clear, consistent, and without disruption,\" and that those who left the Congo \"were welcomed by a USAID landing team at Dulles Airport in Dulles, Virginia, and were provided a host of necessities and care packages upon their arrival to the United States.\"",

      "Here is a transcript of that conversation, which has been lightly edited for space and clarity:",
      "Pence: \u201cTo be an anchor to windward ... I came across that line I think in a Herman Melville book a long time ago.\u201d",
      "\u201cThe wind blows in the direction of more government. And I think it\u2019s a role of conservatives to anchor the party so that when the wind blows, you put the anchor to windward so you stay grounded and hopefully do some small part to hold, you know, hold the ship of state on the principles that really minted my career in this movement.\u201d",
      "\u201cA strong defense, to American leadership of the free world, limited government, fiscal responsibility, growth, the right to life, traditional values \u2014 those were the values that drew me to the Republican Party. And I still think that they are the timeless ideals of the party of Lincoln. And so I want to do my part, even as a former elected official, to use whatever remains of my bully pulpit to be a champion for those principles.\u201d",
      "Pence: \u201cWell, for me, it\u2019s always principles first. It\u2019s not personal. I went to the inauguration last month and I was very moved in the outpouring of kind words and expressions of appreciation from former colleagues, including many members of the new administration who I encountered in hallways. And I saw Secretary of State (Marco) Rubio. I gave him a hug, told him how proud I was of him. We had praised him from here when he was selected. I must have seen about or interacted with about half the incoming Cabinet.\"",
      "\u201cWe went to the Carter funeral. And the president and I had a very cordial exchange. You know, he was coming down the row in front of us at the National Cathedral and he said, \u2018Hi, Mike.\u2019 And I was standing up, extended my hand, and I said, \u2018Congratulations, Mr. President.\u2019 And I could see his countenance softened. And he said, \u2018Thanks.\u2019 And Melania reached out and I said, \u2018Congratulations, Melania.\u2019 And it was, you know, the people that know me know it\u2019s not personal. I\u2019ve long since forgiven the president for any differences that we had at the end of our administration. We still have those differences as the president still holds the view that, to my knowledge, that I had some authority that I did not have under the Constitution or laws of the country. But from my heart, I've prayed often for the president.\"",
      "\u201cAnd so, to answer your question, I think that the way we want to approach this is with integrity to principle. And I\u2019m very encouraged. I think the Trump administration is off to a great start ... I\u2019m very pleased about the president undoing Biden\u2019s border policies and putting back into place the policies that we had negotiated and established that secured the border. But you know, with regard to the nomination of RFK ... for me, it would begin and end with the right to life ... I saw the nomination of an abortion rights supporter to be secretary of HHS to be a dramatic departure from 50 years of strong pro-life leadership at HHS under Republican administrations. So we thought it was important to speak out. And we got a lot of quiet encouragement about that.\"",
      "\u201cWell, we got a lot of quiet encouragement from people that, for whatever reason, didn't feel compelled to join us in that chorus. But I thought it was an important point for us to make. And, you know, we'll continue to be a champion.\"",
      "Pence: \u201cI never speculate on motives. You know, I\u2019m not new to town. I\u2019ve waged lonely battles before.\u201d",
      "\u201cBut you know, you have to be willing to step out and lead. And my hope is that even in the wake of this fight that, you know, the Senate has worked its will, the president will get his choice at HHS. My hope is that when the next issue of life comes up, that people will have been encouraged, emboldened to know that they\u2019re not alone.\u201d",
      "Pence: \u201cWell now you hit it. Now you're on it. I don\u2019t think \u2014 look, I think some of the prominent voices in the party have embraced a more populist thinking. I don\u2019t believe the overwhelming majority of people that ever vote Republican think any differently than they thought during our administration when we hewed to a conservative agenda or the years before or since.\"",
      "\"Let me give you one anecdote. So I'm at a town hall meeting when I\u2019m running for president. And at the end of the town hall meeting \u2014 it was well-attended, it was in Iowa \u2014 a farmer walked up to me and he said, \u2018It was a great town hall meeting. I agree with everything you say.\u2019 You know, and I argued for \u2014 this was literally in the wake of the Oct. 7 attack. And I argued for strong American support for Israel, strong American leadership in the world, continued support for Ukraine in their fight and limited government and bringing about reforms to put our fiscal house in order and right to life.",
      "And this farmer says to me, he said, \u2018I agree with absolutely everything you said.\u2019 So I said, \u2018Well, can I count on your vote?\u2019 And he said, \u2018No, I got to be for Trump this time.\u2019 And he goes, \u2018But I\u2019ll see you in four years. You\u2019re going to be a great president someday.\u2019 I said, \u2018Would you mind telling me, you know, why?\u2019 And he said words I never forgot, which was in effect: He lamented Biden\u2019s failed record. And I saw that he was drawn to the need for a rematch. And then he said, \u2018Plus, if they can do that to a former president, they can do that to me.\u2019 And the \u2018lawfare\u2019 stuff went into higher relief.",
      "\u201cSo I didn\u2019t see in this last election a Republican Party that was embracing big government or a vision to pull back from America\u2019s commitments on the world stage or marginalizing the right to life. I didn\u2019t see that traveling all over the country and I still don\u2019t see it. I think there were other factors that gave the former president a decided advantage in the election. He\u2019d earned it. He\u2019d won it. And then he won it in the fall. But I don\u2019t think the party\u2019s changed.\"",
      "(At the funeral, former second lady Karen Pence refused to acknowledge the then-president elect or shake Melania Trump\u2019s hands \u2014 footage that ended up going viral online.)",
      "Pence: \u201cMy wife loves her husband. And I love my wife and I have great respect for her. And so \u2014 but I\u2019ve been really moved at how many people around the country have thanked us both for that day.",
      "\"But again, you know, I want to emphasize, we\u2019re eyes forward here. You know, I\u2019d always thought the president was going to come around on the position he took on Jan. 6. If you read the end of my book, which I\u2019d be flattered if you did, you\u2019ll read we actually parted on very amicable terms, very good terms. But in the spring, when he returned to the rhetoric about how I could have done something that neither the Constitution nor the law would ever permit any vice president to do, then I just decided it was important to go our separate ways. But hope springs eternal. And we want to be a constructive force for the conservative agenda. I think that\u2019s good for the administration. It\u2019s good for the Congress. More importantly, it\u2019s good for America.\u201d",

      "NEW YORK -- NEW YORK (AP) \u2014 Donald Trump is the president, but billionaire Elon Musk is the focus for thousands of Democratic activists launching a protest campaign this week to fight the Trump administration's push to gut federal health, education and human services agencies.",
      "Hundreds of protests are scheduled outside congressional offices and Tesla dealerships, with organizers hoping to send a pointed message to members of Congress who are on recess this week.",
      "The backlash still hasn't approached the intensity of protests during and after Trump's first inauguration eight years ago. But a loose coalition of Democrats and progressives is coalescing around Musk's rise as Trump's top lieutenant and his purge of the federal bureaucracy.",
      "\u201cHe\u2019s a major weak link in the MAGA coalition,\u201d Ezra Levin, co-founder of the progressive group Indivisible, said of Musk. \u201cI can\u2019t think of something that polls worse than the richest man in the world is coming after your Social Security check or your Meals on Wheels or your Head Start.\u201d",
      "Indivisible, which claims more than 1,300 local chapters nationwide, is encouraging members to protest at the offices of their members of Congress, regardless of political party. The group also offered a step-by-step guide for protesting at dealerships for Tesla, Musk's electric vehicle company.",
      "The memo encourages protesters to stay on sidewalks and public spaces and to avoid any actions that might directly interfere with business operations, such as blocking entrances or trespassing on private property.

He signed an executive order expanding Musk\u2019s influence.",
      "Musk, meanwhile, has defended the swift and extensive cuts he\u2019s pushing across the federal government while acknowledging there have been mistakes.",
      "Democrats in Congress condemn the moves as dangerous, but without control of either chamber of Congress, there is little they can do to stop the Trump administration aside from turning to the courts. Still, three of the nation's largest progressive groups \u2014 Indivisible, MoveOn and the Working Families Party \u2014 are coordinating this week's protests to send a clear message to elected officials in both major political parties that they must do more.",

      "The Trump administration has halted the firings of hundreds of federal employees who were tasked with working on the nation\u2019s nuclear weapons programs",
      "WASHINGTON -- The Trump administration has halted the firings of hundreds of federal employees who were tasked with working on the nation's nuclear weapons programs, in an about-face that has left workers confused and experts cautioning that DOGE's blind cost cutting will put communities at risk.",
      "Three U.S. officials who spoke to The Associated Press said up to 350 employees at the National Nuclear Security Administration were abruptly laid off late Thursday, with some losing access to email before they'd learned they were fired, only to try to enter their offices on Friday morning to find they were locked out. The officials spoke on the condition of anonymity for fear of retaliation.",
      "One of the hardest hit offices was the Pantex Plant near Amarillo, Texas, which saw about 30% of the cuts. Those employees work on reassembling warheads, one of the most sensitive jobs across the nuclear weapons enterprise, with the highest levels of clearance.",
      "The hundreds let go at NNSA were part of a DOGE purge across the Department of Energy that targeted about 2,000 employees.",
      "\u201cThe DOGE people are coming in with absolutely no knowledge of what these departments are responsible for,\u201d said Daryl Kimball, executive director of the Arms Control Association, referencing Elon Musk\u2019s Department of Government Efficiency team. \u201cThey don\u2019t seem to realize that it\u2019s actually the department of nuclear weapons more than it is the Department of Energy.\u201d",
      "By late Friday night, the agency's acting director, Teresa Robbins, issued a memo rescinding the firings for all but 28 of those hundreds of fired staff members.",
      "\u201cThis letter serves as formal notification that the termination decision issued to you on Feb. 13, 2025 has been rescinded, effective immediately,\u201d said the memo, which was obtained by the AP.",
      "The accounts from the three officials contradict an official statement from the Department of Energy, which said fewer than 50 National Nuclear Security Administration staffers were let go, calling them \u201cprobationary employees\u201d who \u201cheld primarily administrative and clerical roles.\u201d",
      "But that wasn't the case. The firings prompted one NNSA senior staffer to post a warning and call to action.",
      "\u201cThis is a pivotal moment. We must decide whether we are truly committed to leading on the world stage or if we are content with undermining the very systems that secure our nation\u2019s future,\u201d deputy division director Rob Plonski posted to LinkedIn. \u201cCutting the federal workforce responsible for these functions may be seen as reckless at best and adversarily opportunistic at worst.\u201d",
      "While some of the Energy Department employees who were fired dealt with energy efficiency and the effects of climate change, issues not seen as priorities by the Trump administration, many others dealt with nuclear issues, even if they didn't directly work on weapons programs. This included managing massive radioactive waste sites and ensuring the material there doesn't further contaminate nearby communities.",
      "That incudes the Savannah River National Laboratory in Jackson, South Carolina; the Hanford Nuclear Site in Washington state, where workers secure 177 high-level waste tanks from the site's previous work producing plutonium for the atomic bomb; and the Oak Ridge Reservation in Tennessee, a Superfund contamination site where much of the early work on the Manhattan Project was done, among others.",
      "U.S. Rep. Marcy Kaptur of Ohio and U.S. Sen. Patty Murray of Washington, both Democrats, called the firings last week \u201cutterly callous and dangerous.\u201d",
      "The NNSA staff who had been reinstated could not all be reached after they were fired, and some were reconsidering whether to return to work, given the uncertainty created by DOGE.",
      "Many federal employees who had worked on the nation's nuclear programs had spent their entire careers there, and there was a wave of retirements in recent years that cost the agency years of institutional knowledge.",
      "But it's now in the midst of a major $750 billion nuclear weapons modernization effort \u2014 including new land-based intercontinental ballistic missiles, new stealth bombers and new submarine-launched warheads. In response, the labs have aggressively hired over the past few years: In 2023, 60% of the workforce had been there five years or less.",
      "Edwin Lyman, director of nuclear power safety at the Union of Concerned Scientists, said the firings could disrupt the day-to-day workings of the agency and create a sense of instability over the nuclear program both at home and abroad.",
      "\u201cI think the signal to U.S. adversaries is pretty clear: throw a monkey wrench in the whole national security apparatus and cause disarray,\u201d he said. \u201cThat can only benefit the adversaries of this country.\u201d"

      "Arata had been a probationary employee since September with the Department of Agriculture's Natural Resources Conservation Service but had worked as a contractor in the role for a year before that. Arata, who turns 32 on Sunday, has experience in this area. She obtained her bachelor's degree in environmental science and her master's degree in ecological restoration.",
      "\"We're relying on this job and we're qualified for this job, and yet, we're losing it just because we're under a year,\" Arata said.",
      "Arata develops conservation plans for farmers in Georgia and helps them get federal funding.",
      "\"These poor farmers. \u2026 It's like I abandoned them, and that's not the case at all,\" Arata said. \"They were amazing and cared so much about their land, and I wanted to help them preserve that.\"",
      "Arata said the message from Elon Musk and President Donald Trump about waste in the government is misguided.",
      "\"Everyone that is there loves what they do, and they bust their butts to do it,\" Arata said of her colleagues. \"They know their jobs inside and out.\"",
      "She added that the firings will damage farmers the most.",
      "\"They say they care so much about their farmers, and they're taking away the people that help them the most,\" Arata said. \"And they already aren't getting the funding from [the Inflation Reduction Act] currently because the IRA funds are frozen. \u2026 A lot of people are going to miss out on money that is vital to their operations.\"",
      "Arata said she was the only soil conservationist in her office overseeing two counties in Georgia. Her role also included helping farmers with installing wells and watering facilities for animals, cover cropping and cross-fencing for cattle.",
      "When asked about her message to Elon Musk and Trump, Arata said: \"You're offering uncertainty and fear, and I don't see how they think that this is going to make anything better.\"",
      "Among the roughly 2,000 workers fired from the Department of Energy is Corey Krzan Matta, who works on the legal team for the Hanford site nuclear cleanup in Washington state.",
      "Krzan Matta said the firings are \"haphazard.\" He acknowledged that while previous administrations have also tried to cut waste and reduce the government workforce, he argued Trump and Musk are going about it in an \"arbitrary\" way.",
      "\"There's no consideration for the mission. There's no consideration for whether or not this position is critical,\" he said.",
      "Krzan Matta joined the Department of Energy after six years of active-duty service in the Navy and after years of legal experience.",
      "\"I'm not one who likes to sit around twiddling my thumbs,\" Krzan Matta said. \"If there's one thing that's not deficient, it's my performance, and then to have a letter from the Department of Energy that says your performance isn't in the public interest -- it just, there's no rhyme or reason to it.\"",
      "Krzan Matta received the termination email Thursday night. Immediately, his computer access was terminated, and his badge was deactivated.",
      "\"You know custom courtesy within the profession is give you two weeks' notice, give you time to figure out your future,\" he said. \"It is simply: It's done. It's over with. Leave.\"",
      "He argued that rather than cutting waste and increasing inefficiency, Trump's and Musk's efforts are simply overloading already-overworked federal government employees.",
      "\"I think of my colleagues who are already overworked from an incredibly busy schedule with an understaffed team who now have to shoulder all of my work -- because it doesn't just go away because I go away,\" he said.",
      "Hanford is an old Manhattan Project site from when the United States was in the race to build a nuclear bomb during World War II. Fast-forward to 2024, \"the mission is clean up that mess we made while we were producing plutonium enrichment,\" Krzan Matta said.",
      "\"I was overjoyed to have found a job that I really fell in love with, not just for the work that I do [find] interesting and fulfilling, but the mission out here of cleaning up the Hanford site and supporting the community that I grew up in,\" he said.",
      "To Arata, the future looks bleak.",
      "\"I'm going to be driving food delivery or something until I can find something, and thank goodness I have my master's degree and a load of student debt,\" Arata said sarcastically.",
      "\"The nonprofit world isn't looking great either, with what's happening with grants, and that's where I came from,\" she added. \"So I'm not sure I'm going to be able to go back to that, and now I don't have an income at all.\"",
      "Arata said colleagues who accepted the buyout offer are even more confused and have received no guidance. She said those who accepted the offer but were in their probationary periods were also terminated.",

      "President Donald Trump and the Department of Government Efficiency, led by the world\u2019s richest man, Elon Musk, opened the latest chapter for a phrase hailed as common sense and derided as propaganda.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s a very broad idea,\u201d said Matt Weidinger of the right-leaning American Enterprise Institute. \u201cBut this phrase \u2018waste, fraud and abuse\u2019 obviously means different things to different people.\u201d",
      "Here is a look at this rhetorical cudgel and how it relates to the outset of Trump\u2019s second administration.",
      "Pinpointing the genesis of \u201cwaste, fraud and abuse\u201d as political rhetoric is difficult. But the concept and resulting battles are older than the nation: Think \u201ctaxation without representation\u201d and the break from Great Britain.",
      "After winning independence, the early American republic reprised the arguments.",
      "Two generations fought over Alexander Hamilton\u2019s national bank \u2014 a philosophical forerunner to everything from the Federal Reserve system to Small Business Administration loans, federally backed mortgage securities and bank deposit insurance.",
      "Trump\u2019s populist hero, Andrew Jackson, cast the Second National Bank as a sop to its wealthy stockholders. \u201cThere are no necessary evils in government,\u201d the seventh president wrote in one veto message. \u201cIts evils exist only in its abuses.\u201d",
      "Many of Jackson\u2019s fellow Southerners opposed the related \u201cinternal improvements\u201d of Henry Clay\u2019s American System. The enslaving planter class viewed the spending for roads, bridges and navigable waterways \u2014 long before Washington had \u201cinfrastructure weeks\u201d \u2014 as an unconstitutional federal overreach that transferred their wealth indirectly to factory owners, bankers and shipping magnates in more industrialized northern states.",
      "Ronald Reagan cemented modern conservatives\u2019 approach in his first inaugural address. \u201cGovernment is not the solution to our problem,\u201d he said in 1981. \u201cGovernment is the problem.\u201d",
      "He railed against \u201cthe welfare queen\u201d as the public face of an inefficient social safety net and unaccountable federal government. Reagan based the attack, which critics lambasted as a racist trope, on one woman\u2019s criminal fraud case for getting hundreds of thousands of dollars in assistance.",
      "In a forerunner to DOGE, Reagan impaneled a group of private sector CEOs to identify waste. The \u201cGrace Commission,\u201d colloquially named for its chairman, businessman J. Peter Grace, moved more deliberately than DOGE, and its recommendations were not implemented on a broad scale. Reagan and Congress did raise the retirement age for Social Security eligibility.",
      "The federal government spent about $6.7 trillion in fiscal year 2023.",
      "The libertarian Cato Institute counts the biggest-ticket items this way: $3.19 trillion in transfer payments; $1.15 trillion in aid to states; $950 billion in interest payments on national debt; $840 billion in purchases of goods and services; and $560 billion to pay federal workers.",
      "Social Security and Medicare comprise most of Cato\u2019s transfer category, along with programs like food assistance and the earned income tax credit for low-income households. Medicaid accounts for most state aid, which also includes education, transportation and other infrastructure.",
      "The issue for Musk, or perhaps for Trump and Republican majorities in Congress, is that Americans hold conflicting views about the details.",
      "March 2023 polling from The Associated Press-NORC Center for Public Affairs Research found that 6 in 10 U.S. adults said the U.S. government was spending \u201ctoo much\u201d overall. Yet an AP-NORC poll taken in January 2025 found that about two-thirds of American adults say the U.S. government is spending \u201ctoo little\u201d on Social Security and education. About 6 and 10 said the same about Medicare, the government health insurance program for older Americans, and assistance to poor Americans.",
      "Most adults also say Medicaid, the health insurance program for the poorest working-age Americans and low-income children, is underfunded. Medicare and Medicaid payments do not go directly to patients but to health care providers \u2014 physicians, hospitals, clinics, pharmaceutical companies and medical supply firms in communities across the country.",
      "The Government Accountability Office and other agencies produce regular reports identifying inefficiencies and other problems. The GAO said in 2024 that its enacted recommendations have saved about $667 billion since 2011.",
      "Vivek Ramaswamy, another Trump ally initially involved with DOGE, seized on hundreds of billions of dollars in contracts and programs that Congress may not have reauthorized explicitly. Yet contrary to Ramaswamy\u2019s characterization, most are ongoing programs from veterans medical care to NASA functions.",
      "Trump has not addressed another pool of potential money: the so-called \u201ctax gap.\u201d That\u2019s not about the Republican vs. Democratic debate over rates and loopholes. It\u2019s the estimated gap between what the federal government should collect under existing law and what actually gets paid on time. Like \u201cimproper payments,\u201d it\u2019s a mix of clerical error and intentional fraud.",

      "Weidinger, the AEI budget expert, said that includes some fraudulent spending but is mostly overpayments or payments that require more documentation. Mistakes could include a Social Security payment a month after a recipient has died, a government miscalculation of someone\u2019s benefit, someone getting one unemployment check after getting a new job or an insufficiently documented claim from a health care provider.",
      "But Weidinger also noted that special government programs, such as unemployment during the COVID pandemic, carried a much higher rate of outright fraud \u2014 identity thieves, including from foreign nations, gaming the system to get money.",

      "House Minority Leader Hakeem Jeffries decried what he called the \"toxic bait-and-switch\" of President Donald Trump's leadership on ABC News' \"This Week\" on Sunday.",
      "\"Donald Trump and Republicans consistently promised that they were going to lower the high cost of living, and they've done the exact opposite,\" Jeffries told co-anchor Jonathan Karl. \"They've shown no interest in lowering costs in the United States of America, which are too high.\"",
      "Jeffries said the Trump administration has \"broken their promise\" to Americans, and accused them of having \"no interest in improving the quality of life of hard working American taxpayers.\"",
      "\"Instead, what they're trying to do while they distract the American people is to jam the GOP tax scam down the throats of people all across this country, all in service of massive tax cuts for their billionaire donors and wealthy corporations,\" he continued. \"It's a toxic bait-and-switch that is underway, and we will continue to push back forcefully.\"",
      "While Jeffries blasted his Republican counterparts, Speaker Mike Johnson has asserted Democrats are \"flailing,\" saying they \"have no clear leader.\"",
      "But Democratic Rep. Don Beyer of Virginia has also suggested the party is without a clear leader. \"We're still looking for that national spokesperson,\" Beyer told Axios. \"And it could be that Hakeem becomes that national voice. ... It hasn't happened yet.\"",
      "Asked to respond to that, Jeffries said it was his \"honor to be House Democratic leader.\"",
      "\"We're going to continue to work together in an all-hands-on-deck effort to push back against the far-right extremism that is being unleashed on this country with record velocity,\" he said. \"We're pushing back forcefully against those efforts every day, every week, every month, every year, and that will continue.\"",
      "During the interview, Jeffries also said he was \"very concerned\" by the Department of Justice dropping the bribery case against New York Mayor Eric Adams.",
      "\"Mayor Adams has a responsibility to convince the people of New York City that he will be able to continue to govern in a manner that puts their best interests first at all times, and that he's not simply taking orders from a Trump administration, a Trump Department of Justice, or Trump officials who do not have the best interests of the city of New York at heart,\" said Jeffries, who represents a Brooklyn district in the House.",
      "\"This Department of Justice is not promoting law and order -- it's promoting lawlessness and disorder,\" he added. \"And that's been consistent with what we've seen from the Trump administration from the very beginning.\"",
      "As an example of this, Jeffries pointed to the mass pardoning of convicted Jan. 6 rioters \"who attacked and brutally beat police officers and then were released back into communities all across the country, threatening public safety.\"",
      "Many of the pardoned rioters \"have extensive criminal records for things like domestic violence, weapons charges that are serious and rape,\" he added.",
      "\"This is not an administration that is committed to the safety of the American people. They continue to undermine it and flood the zone with chaos,\" he said.",

      "Republican Sen. Markwayne Mullin said Sunday that President Donald Trump is the only one who has the ability to pressure Russian President Vladimir Putin to negotiate to end the war with Ukraine.",
      "\"Putin knows the one person that can truly change the war is the United States,\" Mullin told co-anchor Jonathan Karl on ABC News' \"This Week.\" \"If we went all-in for Ukraine, if we went all-in with the resources we have, from air superiority to the weapons that we can deploy to Ukraine, Putin knows at that point he would be in an extremely negative position.\"",

We don't want to have to engage more, but we're not going to allow you to move forward. So let's negotiate a peace deal here, or you're going to force our hand to be farther involved.'\"",
      "Trump announced via social media on Wednesday that his team would begin negotiations with Putin to end the nearly 3-year-long war. Trump said he and Putin discussed an end to the war in which Ukraine cedes territory captured by Russia and gives up its ambitions to join the North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO), two major concessions for Ukraine.",
      "Many world leaders argue Trump has given into Putin's demands before negotiations begin. Trump added that he informed Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy about his call with Putin after it concluded.",

      "\"I know the negotiations are moving forward, and we want to have Ukraine and Russia both at the table, and I think the negotiations go better if both sides are looking for a peace deal, because they're at a neutral position,\" Mullin said.",
      "Mullin praised Trump's negotiation tactics, despite continuing backlash.",
      "\"What President Trump is doing here is actually really smart. He's meeting with Zelenskyy. He's having conversations with him. You're seeing [Secretary of State Marco] Rubio. You saw, you saw that the senators and representatives both met with Zelenskyy while they were in Munich, and you're seeing them also meeting with Putin in Saudi Arabia,\" Mullin said. \"What that is doing, Jon, is, that's putting both people, getting them in separate rooms, talking about what they will accept, and then finding out a negotiation path forward before you bring them to the table. A lot of times, bring people to the table too fast, Jon, it'll blow up.\"",
      "Mullin also defended Elon Musk's efforts to overhaul the federal government.",
      "The Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE) began directing mass layoffs after their deferred resignation program ended on Feb. 12. Initially, DOGE has its sights set on probationary employees, individuals with only a couple of years of service, which is nearly 200,000 government workers.",
      "\"Anytime you take over a situation, like Elon Musk has had many opportunities and many experiences with taking over businesses, you have to start cutting some of the fat. And unfortunately, the number one expense we have in the United States government right now is payroll,\" Mullin said.",
      "Karl noted that the largest expenses in the federal budget are for entitlement programs like Medicare and Social Security.",
      "Musk has promised transparency in his actions, and many Democratic lawmakers have called for him to testify in front of Congress. Whether he does should be left to Trump, Mullin said.",
      "\"That's up to President Trump. Keep in mind, President Trump put in Musk to be a consultant, just like many successful corporations around the world, including myself, that have hired consultants to come in and look at it from an unbiased perspective,\" Mullin said.",

      "Between December 2023 and the same month in 2024 the Argentine peso appreciated by around 41% against the official U.S. dollar, thanks in part of a strong adjustment plan implemented by President Javier Milei, an ultra-liberal who came to power at the end of 2023 on vows to \u201cblow up\u201d the central bank, take an axe to the bloated government and kill sky-high inflation.",
      "The stampede of Argentines traveling abroad for their summer vacations is driven by several factors, including the recent devaluation of various foreign currencies, the convenience of nearby destinations accessible by car and the prohibitively high cost of domestic vacations, especially along the Argentine Atlantic coast.",
      "Argentine tourism abroad surged in December, with departures up 76.4% year-over-year to 1.3 million travelers compared to the same month the previous year, according to official figures. Of those, 80.7% visited neighboring countries, primarily Chile (28%), Brazil (22.6%) and Uruguay (15.6%).",
      "Chile has become a popular destination for Argentines, who made up 40% of the 5.2 million visitors to the country in 2024 and early 2025. Chile\u2019s strong economic position relative to Argentina has resulted in competitive prices, a major draw for Argentine tourists.",
      "Chile\u2019s tourism undersecretary, Ver\u00f3nica Pardo, noted that visitors are also spending more than in previous years, averaging about $63.3 per person per day.",
      "Argentine visitors aren\u2019t confined to the sun-drenched beaches of the Chilean coast. Messi jerseys and mate gourds are also a common sight in other neighboring countries.",
      "Nicol\u00e1s Lentini, 37, recently arrived in Brazil, drawn by the devalued real and lower prices. \u201cA week\u2019s rent for four people in Argentina costs $700,\" he said, noting that he paid the same amount for 14 days in B\u00fazios, a Brazilian resort east of Rio de Janeiro.",
      "\u201cBesides, the beaches here are incomparable to ours, where it\u2019s cold. Here, you can wear a T-shirt all day.\u201d",
      "Brazil experienced a surge in tourism after the real depreciated by around 27% in 2024, when it reached a record of 6.6 million foreign arrivals, with Argentines being the main visitors (1.9 million).",
      "Andr\u00e9s Dey\u00e1, from Argentina's federation of travel and tourism business associations, highlighted the challenges of competing with neighboring countries like Brazil.",
      "\u201cWe can provide good services, financing tools, tourism quality and everything else,\u201d he said, but ultimately \"macroeconomic issues define where Argentines decide to travel.\u201d",
      "After a four-year hiatus marked by the COVID-19 pandemic and a subsequent economic crisis, Luis S\u00e1nchez returned to the exclusive resort of Punta del Este, Uruguay.",
      "\u201cWe like it a lot... this year the prices aren\u2019t as high as they\u2019ve been,\u201d said S\u00e1nchez, one of 309,570 Argentines who visited Uruguay between December 20, 2024, and January 13, 2025, representing nearly half of all visitors to the country, where the U.S. dollar appreciated almost 13% against the Uruguayan peso in 2024 compared to 2023.",
      "Tourism operators in Argentina note that the Argentine exodus was also fueled by recovering purchasing power due to falling inflation and the recent elimination of a tax on foreign credit card purchases.",
      "Sunbathing in a bikini on a Punta del Este beach, Esperanza Fagalde said she hadn\u2019t vacationed at the Uruguayan resort for the past two years. \u201cIt just wasn\u2019t affordable,\u201d she said, citing the unfavorable exchange rate and high costs.",
      "\u201cBut now it is, so we\u2019re back,\u201d she said.",

      "Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy says he directed his ministers not to sign off on a proposed agreement to give the United States access to Ukraine\u2019s rare earth minerals because the document was too focused on U.S. interests",
      "MUNICH, Germany -- Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy says he directed his ministers not to sign off on a proposed agreement to give the United States access to Ukraine\u2019s rare earth minerals because the document was too focused on U.S. interests.",
      "The proposal, which was at the center of Zelenskyy\u2019s talks with U.S. Vice President JD Vance on the sidelines of the Munich Security Conference on Friday, did not offer any specific security guarantees in return, according to one current and one former senior official familiar with the talks.",
      "Zelenskyy\u2019s decision to reject a deal, at least for now, was described as \u201cshort-sighted\u201d by a senior White House official.",
      "\u201cI didn\u2019t let the ministers sign a relevant agreement because in my view it is not ready to protect us, our interest,\u201d Zelenskyy told The Associated Press on Saturday in Munich.",
      "The proposal focused on how the U.S. could use Kyiv\u2019s rare earth minerals \u201cas compensation\u201d for support already given to Ukraine by the Biden administration and as payment for future aid, current and former senior Ukrainian officials said speaking anonymously so they could speak freely.",
      "Ukraine has vast reserves of critical minerals which are used in aerospace, defense and nuclear industries. The Trump administration has indicated it is interested in accessing them to reduce dependence on China but Zelenskyy said any exploitation would need to be tied to security guarantees for Ukraine that would deter future Russian aggression.",
      "\u201cFor me is very important the connection between some kind of security guarantees and some kind of investment,\u201d the Ukrainian president said.",
      "Zelenskyy did not go into details about why he instructed his officials not to sign the document which was given to Ukrainian officials on Wednesday by U.S. Treasury Secretary Scott Bassent on a visit to Kyiv.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s a colonial agreement and Zelenskyy cannot sign it,\u201d the former senior official said.",
      "White House National Security Council spokesman Brian Hughes did not explicitly confirm the offer, but said in a statement that \u201cPresident Zelenskyy is being short-sighted about the excellent opportunity the Trump Administration has presented to Ukraine.\u201d The Trump administration has grown weary of sending additional U.S. aid to Ukraine and Hughes said a minerals deal would allow American taxpayers to \u201crecoup\u201d money sent to Kyiv while growing Ukraine\u2019s economy.",
      "Hughes added that the White House believes \u201cbinding economic ties with the United States will be the best guarantee against future aggression and an integral part of lasting peace.\u201d He added, \u201cThe U.S. recognizes this, the Russians recognize this, and the Ukrainians must recognize this.\u201d",
      "U.S. officials in discussions with their Ukrainian counterparts in Munich were commercially minded and largely concentrated on the specifics of exploring the minerals and how to form a possible partnership to do that with Ukraine, the senior official said.",
      "The potential value of the deposits in Ukraine has not yet been discussed, with much unexplored or close to the front line.",
      "The U.S. proposal apparently did not take into account how the deposits would be secured in the event of continuing Russian aggression. The official suggested the U.S. did not have \u201cready answers,\u201d to that question and that one of their takeaways from discussions in Munich will be how to secure any mineral extraction operation in Ukraine involving people and infrastructure.",
      "Any deal must be in accordance with Ukrainian law and acceptable to the Ukrainian people, the senior Ukrainian official said.",
      "\u201cSubsoil belongs to Ukrainians under the Constitution,\u201d Kseniiia Orynchak, founder of the National Association of Mining Industry of Ukraine previously told the AP suggesting a deal would need popular support.",
      "Zelenskyy and Vance did not discuss the details of the U.S. document during their meeting Friday at the Munich Security Conference, the senior official said. That meeting was \u201cvery good\u201d and \u201csubstantive,\u201d with Vance making it clear his and Trump\u2019s main goal was to achieve a durable, lasting peace, the senior official said.",
      "Zelenskyy told Vance that real peace requires Ukraine to be in a \u201cstrong position\u201d when starting negotiations, stressed that the U.S negotiators should come to Ukraine, and that the U.S., Ukraine and Europe must be at the negotiating table for talks with Russia.",
      "But Gen. Keith Kellogg, Trump\u2019s special envoy for Ukraine and Russia, all but cut Europeans out of any Ukraine-Russia talks, despite Zelenskyy\u2019s request.",
      "\u201cYou can have the Ukrainians, the Russians, and clearly the Americans at the table talking,\u201d Kellogg said at an event hosted by a Ukrainian tycoon at the Munich Security Conference. Pressed on whether that meant Europeans won\u2019t be included, he said: \u201cI\u2019m a school of realism. I think that\u2019s not going to happen.\u201d",

    "story": [
      "As crews work to remove potentially hundreds of thousands of tons of hazardous materials from the Los Angeles wildfires, researchers and officials are trying to understand how the fires on land have impacted the sea",
      "LOS ANGELES -- On a recent Sunday, Tracy Quinn drove down the Pacific Coast Highway to assess damage wrought upon the coastline by the Palisades Fire.",
      "The water line was darkened by ash. Burnt remnants of washing machines and dryers and metal appliances were strewn about the shoreline. Sludge carpeted the water's edge. Waves during high tide lapped onto charred homes, pulling debris and potentially toxic ash into the ocean as they receded.",
      "\u201cIt was just heartbreaking,\u201d said Quinn, president and CEO of the environmental group Heal the Bay, whose team has reported ash and debris some 25 miles (40 kilometers) south of the Palisades burn area west of Los Angeles.",
      "As crews work to remove potentially hundreds of thousands of tons of hazardous materials from the Los Angeles wildfires, researchers and officials are trying to understand how the fires on land have impacted the sea. The Palisades and Eaton fires scorched thousands of homes, businesses, cars and electronics, turning everyday items into hazardous ash made of pesticides, asbestos, plastics, lead, heavy metals and more.",
      "Since much of it could end up in the Pacific Ocean, there are concerns and many unknowns about how the fires could affect life under the sea.",
      "\u201cWe haven't seen a concentration of homes and buildings burned so close to the water,\" Quinn said.",
      "Fire debris and potentially toxic ash could make the water unsafe for surfers and swimmers, especially after rainfall that can transport chemicals, trash and other hazards into the sea. Longer term, scientists worry if and how charred urban contaminants will affect the food supply.",
      "The atmospheric river and mudslides that pummeled the Los Angeles region last week exacerbated some of those fears.",
      "When the fires broke out in January, one of Mara Dias' first concerns was ocean water contamination. Strong winds were carrying smoke and ash far beyond the blazes before settling at sea, said the water quality manager for the Surfrider Foundation, an environmental nonprofit.",
      "Scientists on board a research vessel during the fires detected ash and waste on the water as far as 100 miles (161 kilometers) offshore, said marine ecologist Julie Dinasquet with the University of California, San Diego\u2019s Scripps Institution of Oceanography. Things like twigs and shard. They described the smell as electronics burning, she recalled, \u201cnot like a nice campfire.\u201d",
      "Runoff from rains also are a huge and immediate concern. Rainfall picks up contaminants and trash while flushing toward the sea through a network of drains and rivers. That runoff could contain \u201ca lot of nutrients, nitrogen and phosphate that end up in the ash of the burn material that can get into the water,\u201d said Dias, as well as \"heavy metals, something called PAHs, which are given off when you burn different types of fuel.\u201d",
      "Mudslides and debris flows in the Palisades Fire burn zone also can dump more hazardous waste into the ocean. After fires, the soil in burn scars is less able to absorb rainfall and can develop a layer that repels water from the remains of seared organic material. When there is less organic material to hold the soil in place, the risks of mudslides and debris flows increase.",
      "Los Angeles County officials, with help from other agencies, have set thousands of feet of concrete barriers, sandbags, silt socks and more to prevent debris from reaching beaches. The LA County Board of Supervisors also recently passed a motion seeking state and federal help to expand beach clean ups, prepare for storm runoff and test ocean water for potential toxins and chemicals, among other things.",
      "Beyond the usual samples, state water officials and others are testing for total and dissolved metals such as arsenic, lead and aluminum and volatile organic compounds.",
      "They also are sampling for microplastics, polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons, or PAHs, that are harmful to human and aquatic life, and polychlorinated biphenyls, or PCBs, a group of man-made chemicals shown to cause cancer in animals and other serious health effects. Now banned from being manufactured, they were used in products like pigments, paints and electrical equipment.",
      "County public health officials said chemical tests of water samples last month did not raise health concerns, so they downgraded one beach closure to an ocean water advisory. Beachgoers were still advised to stay out of the water.",
      "Dinasquet and colleagues are working to understand how far potentially toxic ash and debris dispersed across the ocean, how deep and how fast they sunk and, over time, where it ends up.",
      "Forest fires can deposit important nutrients like iron and nitrogen into the ocean ecosystem, boosting the growth of phytoplankton, which can create a positive, cascading effect across the ecosystem. But the potentially toxic ash from urban coastal fires could have dire consequences, Dinasquet said.",
      "\u201cReports are already showing that there was a lot of lead and asbestos in the ash,\u201d she added. \"This is really bad for people so its probably also very bad for the marine organisms.\"",
      "A huge concern is whether toxic contaminants from the fire will enter the food chain. Researchers plan to take tissue fragments from fish for signs of heavy metals and contaminants. But they say it will take a while to understand how a massive urban fire will affect the larger ecosystem and our food supply.",
      "Dias noted the ocean has long taken in pollution from land, but with fires and other disasters, \u201ceverything is compounded and the situation is even more dire.\u201d",

    "title": "Justice Department's independence is threatened as Trump's team asserts power over cases and staff",
    "published": "Sun, 16 Feb 2025 07:46:38 -0500",
    "summary": "Pam Bondi had insisted at her Senate confirmation hearing that as attorney general, her Justice Department would not &ldquo;play politics.&rdquo;",
    "story": [
      "Pam Bondi had insisted at her Senate confirmation hearing that as attorney general, her Justice Department would not \u201cplay politics.\u201d",
      "WASHINGTON -- WASHINGTON (AP) \u2014 Pam Bondi had insisted at her Senate confirmation hearing that as attorney general, her Justice Department would not \u201cplay politics.\u201d",
      "Yet in the month since the Trump administration took over the building, a succession of actions has raised concerns the department is doing exactly that.",
      "Top officials have demanded the names of thousands of FBI agents who investigated the Capitol riot, sued a state attorney general who had won a massive fraud verdict against Donald Trump before the 2024 election, and ordered the dismissal of a criminal case against New York Mayor Eric Adams by saying the charges had handicapped the Democrat's ability to partner in the Republican administration's fight against illegal immigration.",
      "Even for a department that has endured its share of scandals, the moves have generated great upheaval and tested its independence. Recent firings and resignations have rattled the foundations of an institution that has prided itself on being driven solely by facts, evidence and the law, and led to this question: Will a president who raged against his own Justice Department during his first term succeed in bending it to his will entirely in his second?",
      "\u201cWe have seen now a punishing ruthlessness that acting department leadership and the attorney general are bringing to essentially subjugate the workforce to the wishes and demands of the administration, even when it\u2019s obvious\u201d that some of the decisions have all the signs \"of corrupting the criminal justice system,\u201d said retired federal prosecutor David Laufman, a senior department official across Democratic and Republican administrations.",
      "He spoke not long after Manhattan\u2019s top federal prosecutor, Danielle Sassoon, resigned in protest following a directive from Emil Bove, the Justice Department's acting No. 2 official, to dismiss the case against Adams.",
      "In a letter foreshadowing her decision, Sassoon accused the department of acceding to a \u201cquid pro quo\u201d \u2014 dropping the case to ensure Adams\u2019 help with Trump\u2019s immigration agenda. Though a Democrat, Adams had for months positioned himself as eager to aid the administration's effort in America's largest city, even meeting privately with Trump at Trump's Florida estate just days before the Republican took office.",
      "Multiple high-ranking officials who oversaw the Justice Department's public integrity section, which prosecutes corruption cases, joined Sassoon in resigning.",
      "On Friday, a prosecutor involved in the Adams case, Hagan Scotten, became at least the seventh person to quit in the standoff, telling Bove in a letter that it would take a \u201cfool\u201d or a \u201ccoward\u201d to meet his demand to drop the charges. (Bove and department lawyers in Washington ultimately filed paperwork Friday night to end the case).",
      "Though the circumstances are significantly different, the wave of resignations conjured memories of the 1973 \u201cSaturday Night Massacre\u201d when multiple Justice Department leaders quit rather than carry out President Richard Nixon's orders to fire the Watergate special prosecutor.",
      "\u201cEven though there may not be more resignations, a clear message has been sent about the objectives and the expectations of the department,\u201d said Alberto Gonzales, who served as attorney general under Republican President George W. Bush until his 2007 resignation in the wake of the dismissal of several U.S. attorneys.",
      "\u201cThe purpose of the department is to ensure that our laws are carried out, that those who engage in criminal wrongdoing are prosecuted and punished,\u201d Gonzales said. And to some it may appear \u201cthat if you have some kind of relationship with the White House, there may not be consequences for doing something that ordinary Americans engaged in similar conduct would be punished.\u201d",
      "Bove, a former New York federal prosecutor himself who represented Trump in his criminal cases, pointedly made no assessment about the legal merits of the case against Adams. Bove cited political reasons, including the timing of the charges months before Adams' presumed reelection campaign and the restrictions the case had placed on the mayor's ability to fight illegal immigration and violent crime.",
      "In a letter to Sassoon, Bove said case prosecutors would be subject to internal investigations.",
      "Bondi defended the decision to drop the case, asserted in a Fox New interview Friday that Adams was targeted after he criticized the Biden administration's immigration policies. Her chief of staff, Chad Mizelle, said prosecutors who refused the dismissal order have \u201cno place at DOJ.\u201d",
      "\u201cThe decision to dismiss the indictment of Eric Adams is yet another indication that this DOJ will return to its core function of prosecuting dangerous criminals, not pursuing politically motivated witch hunts,\" Mizelle said in a statement that accused prosecutors without evidence of \"disordered and ulterior motives.\"",
      "At the White House on Friday, Trump said he was \u201cnot involved\u201d in the Adams case and knew \u201cnothing\u201d about it.",
      "The New York showdown follows a separate dispute between Bove and the acting FBI leadership over his demands for a list of agents involved in the investigations of the Jan. 6, 2021, riot at the Capitol so the Justice Department could determine whether personnel action was warranted.",
      "The request was seen by some as a precursor to possible mass firings, but it was also consistent with Trump's fury over those criminal cases, which he erased with sweeping pardons soon after his inauguration.",
      "Bove referred to the acting FBI director's resistance to his directive as an act of \u201cinsubordination\u201d and said agents who \u201csimply followed\u201d orders would not lose their jobs but those who acted with \u201cpartisan intent\u201d were at risk.",
      "In between White House terms, Trump and his allies pressed the case that the Justice Department had become \u201cweaponized\u201d against conservatives and him in particular, citing separate indictments that were later dismissed after Trump won back the presidency in November.",
      "On her first day on the job, Bondi announced the creation of a \u201cWeaponization Working Group,\u201d to scrutinize the prosecutors who brought criminal and civil cases against Trump and to examine the Jan. 6 prosecutions. She wrote in a memo that the department \u201cmust take immediate and overdue steps to restore integrity and credibility\u201d and to ensure that personnel were \u201cready and willing\u201d to implement the president's agenda.",

      "Among the prosecutors singled out by the working group was special counsel Jack Smith, who brought two criminal cases against Trump, and New York Attorney General Letitia James, whose civil fraud suit against Trump led to a nearly $500 million judgment.",

Bondi opened her remarks by saying she had \u201cfiled charges\u201d against James and Democratic Gov. Kathy Hochul, before later clarifying that she was referring to a lawsuit.",

They intend to praise the administration when they agree with it, while raising concerns when they don't, advocating for longtime conservative principles that have fallen out of favor as Trump's \u201cMake America Great Again\u201d brand of populism has taken hold.",

      "Here is a transcript of that conversation, which has been lightly edited for space and clarity:",
      "Pence: \u201cTo be an anchor to windward ... I came across that line I think in a Herman Melville book a long time ago.\u201d",
      "\u201cThe wind blows in the direction of more government. And I think it\u2019s a role of conservatives to anchor the party so that when the wind blows, you put the anchor to windward so you stay grounded and hopefully do some small part to hold, you know, hold the ship of state on the principles that really minted my career in this movement.\u201d",
      "\u201cA strong defense, to American leadership of the free world, limited government, fiscal responsibility, growth, the right to life, traditional values \u2014 those were the values that drew me to the Republican Party. And I still think that they are the timeless ideals of the party of Lincoln. And so I want to do my part, even as a former elected official, to use whatever remains of my bully pulpit to be a champion for those principles.\u201d",
      "Pence: \u201cWell, for me, it\u2019s always principles first. It\u2019s not personal. I went to the inauguration last month and I was very moved in the outpouring of kind words and expressions of appreciation from former colleagues, including many members of the new administration who I encountered in hallways. And I saw Secretary of State (Marco) Rubio. I gave him a hug, told him how proud I was of him. We had praised him from here when he was selected. I must have seen about or interacted with about half the incoming Cabinet.\"",
      "\u201cWe went to the Carter funeral. And the president and I had a very cordial exchange. You know, he was coming down the row in front of us at the National Cathedral and he said, \u2018Hi, Mike.\u2019 And I was standing up, extended my hand, and I said, \u2018Congratulations, Mr. President.\u2019 And I could see his countenance softened. And he said, \u2018Thanks.\u2019 And Melania reached out and I said, \u2018Congratulations, Melania.\u2019 And it was, you know, the people that know me know it\u2019s not personal. I\u2019ve long since forgiven the president for any differences that we had at the end of our administration. We still have those differences as the president still holds the view that, to my knowledge, that I had some authority that I did not have under the Constitution or laws of the country. But from my heart, I've prayed often for the president.\"",
      "\u201cAnd so, to answer your question, I think that the way we want to approach this is with integrity to principle. And I\u2019m very encouraged. I think the Trump administration is off to a great start ... I\u2019m very pleased about the president undoing Biden\u2019s border policies and putting back into place the policies that we had negotiated and established that secured the border. But you know, with regard to the nomination of RFK ... for me, it would begin and end with the right to life ... I saw the nomination of an abortion rights supporter to be secretary of HHS to be a dramatic departure from 50 years of strong pro-life leadership at HHS under Republican administrations. So we thought it was important to speak out. And we got a lot of quiet encouragement about that.\"",
      "\u201cWell, we got a lot of quiet encouragement from people that, for whatever reason, didn't feel compelled to join us in that chorus. But I thought it was an important point for us to make. And, you know, we'll continue to be a champion.\"",
      "Pence: \u201cI never speculate on motives. You know, I\u2019m not new to town. I\u2019ve waged lonely battles before.\u201d",
      "\u201cBut you know, you have to be willing to step out and lead. And my hope is that even in the wake of this fight that, you know, the Senate has worked its will, the president will get his choice at HHS. My hope is that when the next issue of life comes up, that people will have been encouraged, emboldened to know that they\u2019re not alone.\u201d",
      "Pence: \u201cWell now you hit it. Now you're on it. I don\u2019t think \u2014 look, I think some of the prominent voices in the party have embraced a more populist thinking. I don\u2019t believe the overwhelming majority of people that ever vote Republican think any differently than they thought during our administration when we hewed to a conservative agenda or the years before or since.\"",
      "\"Let me give you one anecdote. So I'm at a town hall meeting when I\u2019m running for president. And at the end of the town hall meeting \u2014 it was well-attended, it was in Iowa \u2014 a farmer walked up to me and he said, \u2018It was a great town hall meeting. I agree with everything you say.\u2019 You know, and I argued for \u2014 this was literally in the wake of the Oct. 7 attack. And I argued for strong American support for Israel, strong American leadership in the world, continued support for Ukraine in their fight and limited government and bringing about reforms to put our fiscal house in order and right to life.",
      "And this farmer says to me, he said, \u2018I agree with absolutely everything you said.\u2019 So I said, \u2018Well, can I count on your vote?\u2019 And he said, \u2018No, I got to be for Trump this time.\u2019 And he goes, \u2018But I\u2019ll see you in four years. You\u2019re going to be a great president someday.\u2019 I said, \u2018Would you mind telling me, you know, why?\u2019 And he said words I never forgot, which was in effect: He lamented Biden\u2019s failed record. And I saw that he was drawn to the need for a rematch. And then he said, \u2018Plus, if they can do that to a former president, they can do that to me.\u2019 And the \u2018lawfare\u2019 stuff went into higher relief.",
      "\u201cSo I didn\u2019t see in this last election a Republican Party that was embracing big government or a vision to pull back from America\u2019s commitments on the world stage or marginalizing the right to life. I didn\u2019t see that traveling all over the country and I still don\u2019t see it. I think there were other factors that gave the former president a decided advantage in the election. He\u2019d earned it. He\u2019d won it. And then he won it in the fall. But I don\u2019t think the party\u2019s changed.\"",
      "(At the funeral, former second lady Karen Pence refused to acknowledge the then-president elect or shake Melania Trump\u2019s hands \u2014 footage that ended up going viral online.)",
      "Pence: \u201cMy wife loves her husband. And I love my wife and I have great respect for her. And so \u2014 but I\u2019ve been really moved at how many people around the country have thanked us both for that day.",
      "\"But again, you know, I want to emphasize, we\u2019re eyes forward here. You know, I\u2019d always thought the president was going to come around on the position he took on Jan. 6. If you read the end of my book, which I\u2019d be flattered if you did, you\u2019ll read we actually parted on very amicable terms, very good terms. But in the spring, when he returned to the rhetoric about how I could have done something that neither the Constitution nor the law would ever permit any vice president to do, then I just decided it was important to go our separate ways. But hope springs eternal. And we want to be a constructive force for the conservative agenda. I think that\u2019s good for the administration. It\u2019s good for the Congress. More importantly, it\u2019s good for America.\u201d",

      "George Washington was uneasy about the idea of commemorating his life",
      "NORFOLK, Va. -- Like the other Founding Fathers, George Washington was uneasy about the idea of publicly celebrating his life. He was the first leader of a new republic, not a king.",
      "And yet the United States will once again commemorate its first president on Monday, 293 years after he was born.",
      "The meaning of Presidents Day has changed dramatically, from being mostly unremarkable and filled with work for Washington in the 1700s to the bonanza of consumerism it has become today. For some historians, the holiday has lost all discernible meaning.",
      "Historian Alexis Coe, author of \u201cYou Never Forget Your First: A Biography of George Washington,\u201d has said she thinks about Presidents Day in much the same way as the towering monument in D.C. bearing his name.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s supposed to be about Washington, but can you really point to anything that looks or sounds like him?\u201d she remarked in an interview with The Associated Press in 2024. \u201cJefferson and Lincoln are presented as people with limbs and noses and words associated with their memorials. And he\u2019s just a giant, granite point. He has been sanded down to have absolutely no identifiable features.\u201d",
      "Here is a look at how things have evolved:",
      "Washington was born Feb. 22, 1732, on Popes Creek Plantation near the Potomac River in Virginia.",
      "Technically, though, he was born Feb. 11 under the ancient Julian calendar, which was still in use for the first 20 years of his life. The Gregorian calendar, intended to more accurately mark the solar year, was adopted in 1752, adding 11 days.",
      "Either way, Washington paid little attention to his birthday, according to Mountvernon.org, the website of the organization that manages his estate. Surviving records make no mention of observances at Mount Vernon, while his diary shows he was often hard at work.",
      "\u201cIf he had it his way, he would be at home with his family,\u201d Coe said. \u201cMaybe some beloved nieces and nephews (and friend) Marquis de Lafayette would be ideal. And Martha\u2019s recipe for an indulgent cake. But that\u2019s about it.\u201d",
      "Washington\u2019s birthday was celebrated by his peers in government when he was president, mostly.",
      "Congress voted during his first two terms to take a short commemorative break each year, with one exception, his last birthday in office, Coe said. By then, Washington was less popular, partisanship was rampant and many members of his original Cabinet were gone, including Thomas Jefferson.",
      "\u201cOne way to show their disdain for his Federalist policies was to keep working through his birthday,\u201d Coe said.",
      "The Library of Congress does note a French military officer, the comte de Rochambeau, threw a ball celebrating Washington\u2019s 50th birthday in 1782.",
      "Washington was very aware of his inaugural role as president and its distinction from the British crown. He didn\u2019t want to be honored like a king, Seth Bruggeman, a history professor at Temple University in Philadelphia, told the AP last year.",
      "Still, he said, a market for Washington memorabilia sprang up almost immediately after his death in 1799 at age 67, with people snapping up pottery and reproductions of etchings portraying him as a divine figure going off into heaven.",
      "\u201cEven in that early moment, Americans kind of conflated consumerism with patriotic memory,\u201d said Bruggeman, whose books include \u201cHere, George Washington Was Born: Memory, Material Culture, and the Public History of a National Monument.\u201d",
      "It wasn\u2019t until 1832, the centennial of his birth, that Congress established a committee to arrange national \u201cparades, orations and festivals,\u201d according to the Congressional Research Service.",
      "Only in 1879 was his birthday formally made into a legal holiday for federal employees in the District of Columbia.",
      "The official designation for the holiday is Washington\u2019s Birthday, although it has come to be known informally as Presidents Day. Arguments have been made to honor President Lincoln as well because his birth date falls nearby, on Feb. 12.",
      "A small number of states, including Illinois, observe Lincoln\u2019s birthday as a public holiday, according to the Library of Congress. And some commemorate both Lincoln and Washington on Presidents Day.",
      "But on the federal level, the day is still officially Washington\u2019s Birthday.",
      "By the late 1960s, Washington\u2019s Birthday was one of nine federal holidays that fell on specific dates on different days of the week, according to a 2004 article in the National Archives\u2019 Prologue magazine.",
      "Congress voted to move some of those to Mondays, following concerns that were in part about absenteeism among government workers when a holiday fell midweek. But lawmakers also noted clear benefits to the economy, including boosts in retail sales and travel on three-day weekends.",
      "The Uniform Monday Holiday Act took effect in 1971, moving Presidents Day to the third Monday in February. Sales campaigns soared, historian C. L. Arbelbide wrote in Prologue.",
      "Bruggeman said Washington and the other Founding Fathers \u201cwould have been deeply worried\u201d by how the holiday became taken over by commercial and private interests.",
      "\u201cThey were very nervous about corporations,\u201d Bruggeman said. \u201cIt wasn\u2019t that they forbade them. But they saw corporations as like little republics that potentially threatened the power of The Republic.\u201d",
      "Coe, who is also a fellow at the Washington think tank New America, said by now the day is devoid of recognizable traditions.",
      "\u201cThere\u2019s no moment of reflection,\u201d Coe said. Given today\u2019s widespread cynicism toward the office, she added, that sort of reflection \u201cwould probably be a good idea.\u201d"

Tony Evers that proposes sweeping changes to the state\u2019s troubled correctional system without building a new facility, as some lawmakers have long called for.",
      "Evers presented his plan as the best and only option to address the state\u2019s aging facilities, which have been beset with deaths of incarcerated people, assaults against staff including one that left a juvenile guard dead, lockdowns, lawsuits, federal investigations, criminal charges against prison staff, resignations and rising maintenance costs.",
      "The roughly $500 million proposal, made public on Sunday, would be subject to approval by the Republican-controlled Legislature, which has backed some aspects in the past but also has repeatedly blocked initiatives by the Democratic governor.",
      "Evers cast the proposal as a better option than building a new adult prison that he said would take at least a decade to complete and cost more than $1.3 billion.",
      "\u201cThis plan is as good as plans get,\u201d Evers said at a Friday briefing while encouraging Democrats and Republicans to work together to enact it. \u201cWe have to get this done, period.\u201d",
      "The state\u2019s current trajectory of maintaining aging, overcrowded and understaffed prisons is not sustainable, Evers said.",
      "The multi-tiered plan starts with finally closing the troubled Lincoln Hills and Cooper Lake juvenile correctional facilities in northern Wisconsin and building a new one near Madison at the site of a current minimum security prison. The Lincoln Hills campus would then be converted into a medium security adult prison. The prison in Green Bay, built in 1898, would be closed.",
      "The plan also proposes that the state\u2019s oldest prison in Waupun, built in 1851, be converted from a maximum security prison to a medium security center focused on vocational training. The Stanley Correctional Center would be converted from a medium to a maximum security prison and the prison in Hobart would be expanded to add 200 minimum security beds.",
      "Another key part of the plan is expanding options for those convicted of nonviolent offenses to participate in the earned release program and be set free earlier.",
      "All of the changes would take place over the next six years.",
      "Republicans and Democrats alike have been calling for years to close both the prisons in Waupun and Green Bay. But concerns over job losses in the communities and the cost of building a new prison have been stumbling blocks.",
      "There would be no staff layoffs under the new plan, the Evers administration said.",
      "Evers said he hoped lawmakers would come together and support the plan, much like they did in 2017 when they agreed to close the Lincoln Hills juvenile prison. Eight years later, that prison remains open amid obstacles to fully implementing the closure plan."

It's officially Washington's Birthday, honoring the first president and the original American yardstick for measuring greatness.",

      "\u201cThe concept of Presidents Day is a confusing mishmash of ideas,\u201d Hunter Abell, a Republican state legislator from Washington state, said recently. \u201cBy celebrating all the presidents, I believe that we inadvertently celebrate none.\u201d",

      "The federal holiday for Washington started in 1879, but the current date was fixed by law as of 1971.",
      "States, of course, have been left to their own devices for decades. Thirty-four still use some form of Washington's name in their laws, while 19 use some form of Presidents Day. A few use both, while California law goes with \u201cthe third Monday in February.\u201d",

    "story": [
      "The Trump administration has halted the firings of hundreds of federal employees who were tasked with working on the nation\u2019s nuclear weapons programs",
      "WASHINGTON -- The Trump administration has halted the firings of hundreds of federal employees who were tasked with working on the nation's nuclear weapons programs, in an about-face that has left workers confused and experts cautioning that DOGE's blind cost cutting will put communities at risk.",
      "Three U.S. officials who spoke to The Associated Press said up to 350 employees at the National Nuclear Security Administration were abruptly laid off late Thursday, with some losing access to email before they'd learned they were fired, only to try to enter their offices on Friday morning to find they were locked out. The officials spoke on the condition of anonymity for fear of retaliation.",
      "One of the hardest hit offices was the Pantex Plant near Amarillo, Texas, which saw about 30% of the cuts. Those employees work on reassembling warheads, one of the most sensitive jobs across the nuclear weapons enterprise, with the highest levels of clearance.",
      "The hundreds let go at NNSA were part of a DOGE purge across the Department of Energy that targeted about 2,000 employees.",
      "\u201cThe DOGE people are coming in with absolutely no knowledge of what these departments are responsible for,\u201d said Daryl Kimball, executive director of the Arms Control Association, referencing Elon Musk\u2019s Department of Government Efficiency team. \u201cThey don\u2019t seem to realize that it\u2019s actually the department of nuclear weapons more than it is the Department of Energy.\u201d",
      "By late Friday night, the agency's acting director, Teresa Robbins, issued a memo rescinding the firings for all but 28 of those hundreds of fired staff members.",
      "\u201cThis letter serves as formal notification that the termination decision issued to you on Feb. 13, 2025 has been rescinded, effective immediately,\u201d said the memo, which was obtained by the AP.",
      "The accounts from the three officials contradict an official statement from the Department of Energy, which said fewer than 50 National Nuclear Security Administration staffers were let go, calling them \u201cprobationary employees\u201d who \u201cheld primarily administrative and clerical roles.\u201d",
      "But that wasn't the case. The firings prompted one NNSA senior staffer to post a warning and call to action.",
      "\u201cThis is a pivotal moment. We must decide whether we are truly committed to leading on the world stage or if we are content with undermining the very systems that secure our nation\u2019s future,\u201d deputy division director Rob Plonski posted to LinkedIn. \u201cCutting the federal workforce responsible for these functions may be seen as reckless at best and adversarily opportunistic at worst.\u201d",
      "While some of the Energy Department employees who were fired dealt with energy efficiency and the effects of climate change, issues not seen as priorities by the Trump administration, many others dealt with nuclear issues, even if they didn't directly work on weapons programs. This included managing massive radioactive waste sites and ensuring the material there doesn't further contaminate nearby communities.",
      "That incudes the Savannah River National Laboratory in Jackson, South Carolina; the Hanford Nuclear Site in Washington state, where workers secure 177 high-level waste tanks from the site's previous work producing plutonium for the atomic bomb; and the Oak Ridge Reservation in Tennessee, a Superfund contamination site where much of the early work on the Manhattan Project was done, among others.",
      "U.S. Rep. Marcy Kaptur of Ohio and U.S. Sen. Patty Murray of Washington, both Democrats, called the firings last week \u201cutterly callous and dangerous.\u201d",
      "The NNSA staff who had been reinstated could not all be reached after they were fired, and some were reconsidering whether to return to work, given the uncertainty created by DOGE.",
      "Many federal employees who had worked on the nation's nuclear programs had spent their entire careers there, and there was a wave of retirements in recent years that cost the agency years of institutional knowledge.",
      "But it's now in the midst of a major $750 billion nuclear weapons modernization effort \u2014 including new land-based intercontinental ballistic missiles, new stealth bombers and new submarine-launched warheads. In response, the labs have aggressively hired over the past few years: In 2023, 60% of the workforce had been there five years or less.",
      "Edwin Lyman, director of nuclear power safety at the Union of Concerned Scientists, said the firings could disrupt the day-to-day workings of the agency and create a sense of instability over the nuclear program both at home and abroad.",
      "\u201cI think the signal to U.S. adversaries is pretty clear: throw a monkey wrench in the whole national security apparatus and cause disarray,\u201d he said. \u201cThat can only benefit the adversaries of this country.\u201d"

      "Some experts say disruptions to polar vortexes are happening more frequently because of a warming world. A warmer Artic gives more energy to atmospheric waves that can drive weather patterns, making the waves more likely to disrupt the vortex and move colder air south into lower latitudes.",
      "Despite the unusually cold winter across the U.S., the world remains in an overall warming pattern. Earth\u2019s average overall temperature set yet another monthly heat record in January. It was the 18th month of the last 19 that the world hit or passed the internationally agreed upon warming limit of 1.5 C (2.7 F) above pre-industrial times."

      "WASHINGTON -- The Trump administration wants the Supreme Court to permit the firing of the head of the federal agency dedicated to protecting whistleblowers, according to documents obtained Sunday that would mark the first appeal to the justices since President Donald Trump took office.",
      "The emergency appeal is the start of what probably will be a steady stream from lawyers for the Republican president and his administration seeking to undo lower court rulings that have slowed his second term agenda.",
      "The Justice Department's filing obtained by The Associated Press asks the conservative-majority court to lift a judge\u2019s court order temporarily reinstating Hampton Dellinger as the leader of the Office of Special Counsel.",
      "Dellinger has argued that the law says he can only be dismissed for problems with the performance of his job, none of which were cited in the email dismissing him.",
      "The petition came hours after a divided appeals court panel refused on procedural grounds to lift the order, which was filed Wednesday and expires on Feb. 26.",
      "The case is not expected to be docketed until after the Supreme Court returns from the Presidents Day holiday weekend. The justices would not act until Tuesday at the earliest.",
      "It\u2019s not clear what reception Trump will get from the conservative-dominated court that includes three justices he nominated in his first term.",
      "The case began last week when Dellinger sued over his removal as head of the Office of Special Counsel, which is responsible for guarding the federal workforce from illegal personnel actions, such as retaliation for whistleblowing. He was appointed by Democratic President Joe Biden and confirmed by the Senate to a five-year term in 2024.",
      "Dellinger said the office\u2019s work \u201cneeded now more than ever,\u201d noting the \u201cunprecedented\u201d number of firings, without cause, of federal employees with civil service protections in recent weeks by the Trump administration.",
      "The administration argues that the order reinstating Dellinger for two weeks wrongly restricts what the president can do. The brief cites the Supreme Court decision that gave Trump immunity from criminal prosecution and reflected a muscular view of executive power.",
      "\u201cUntil now, as far as we are aware, no court in American history has wielded an injunction to force the president to retain an agency head,\u201d acting Solicitor General Sarah M. Harris wrote.",
      "The brief references some of the dozen or more cases where judges have slowed Trump\u2019s agenda, including by ordering the temporary lifting of a foreign aid funding freeze and blocking workers with Elon Musk\u2019s so-called Department of Government Efficiency team from accessing Treasury Department data for now.",
      "The executive branch has argued since the Carter administration that the Office of Special Counsel is the kind of job where the president should have the power to hire and fire, and letting the order in Dellinger's case stand could \u201cembolden\u201d judges to issue additional blocks in the roughly 70 lawsuits the Trump administration is facing so far, the Justice Department argues.",
      "Dellinger\u2019s firing was the latest move in Trump\u2019s sweeping effort to shrink and reshape the federal government, testing the limits of well-established civil service protections by moving to dismantle federal agencies and push out staffers.",
      "The independent Office of Special Counsel is separate from Justice Department special counsels such as Jack Smith, who are appointed by the attorney general for specific investigations, such as Smith's criminal investigation of Trump before he returned to the White House."

      "The United States has \u201cgravely backpedaled\u201d on its position on Taiwan and sent the wrong message to \u201cseparatist forces\" on the island, ministry spokesperson Guo Jiakun said.",
      "Taiwan and China split in 1949 during the civil war that brought the communists to power in China. The defeated Nationalists fled to Taiwan and set up a rival government there. Taiwan has its own government and military but has never declared formal independence from China.",
      "\u201cWe urge the U.S. to ... stop emboldening and supporting Taiwan independence and avoid further damaging China-U.S. relations and the peace and stability of the Taiwan Strait,\u201d Guo said when asked about the revision at a daily media briefing.",
      "The Taiwan Strait is a narrow waterway that separates the island of Taiwan from China's east coast.",
      "The U.S. State Department removed the phrase \"we do not support Taiwan independence\u201d from the fact sheet last week. The document on America\u2019s relations with the self-governing island is posted on its website.",
      "Taiwan's government welcomed the move, though a statement sent to The Associated Press on Monday did not mention the language specifically.",
      "\u201cThe Ministry of Foreign Affairs has noted that the U.S. State Department updated the \u2018Current State of U.S.-Taiwan Relations\u2019 page ... with text that is positive and friendly toward us, reflecting the close and amicable partnership between Taiwan and the United States,\u201d it said.",
      "It\u2019s not the first time the State Department has removed the phrase. It did so in May 2022 but restored it a few weeks later after a strong protest from China.",
      "It\u2019s unclear why the State Department changed the language again and whether it signals any shift in policy under President Donald Trump, who returned to the White House last month.",
      "The government in Taiwan is worried that Trump might not be as steadfast a supporter of the island as his predecessor, former President Joe Biden.",
      "The U.S. does not recognize Taiwan as a country but is its strongest backer and biggest arms supplier.",
      "Trump said last week that Taiwan, a leading maker of semiconductors, had taken the chip business away from the U.S. and that he wants it to come back.",
      "China, which says that Taiwan must come under its control, has stepped up military exercises around the island of 23 million people in recent years. The U.S. government fact sheet says that it expects \u201cdifferences to be resolved by peaceful means, free from coercion, in a manner acceptable to the people on both sides.\u201d",

    "published": "Fri, 14 Feb 2025 16:02:40 -0500",
    "summary": "Jailed and disgraced movie mogul Harvey Weinstein is suing his brother and other executives at their now-defunct film company",
    "story": [
      "Jailed and disgraced movie mogul Harvey Weinstein is suing his brother and other executives at their now-defunct film company",
      "Jailed and disgraced movie mogul Harvey Weinstein alleges in a new lawsuit that his brother, Bob Weinstein, and other executives at their now-defunct film company duped him into guaranteeing a $45 million loan in 2016, but diverted funds for their own personal use while setting the stage for his downfall.",
      "Harvey Weinstein, 72, filed the claims Thursday in a long-running civil case in New York City involving a lender accusing him of defaulting on the loan. He is currently detained while awaiting a retrial on sex crimes charges in New York.",
      "\u201cHarvey Weinstein was deceived by those closest to him, and secured a $45 million dollar loan under the pretense of saving The Weinstein Company,\u201d Imran Ansari, Harvey Weinstein's lawyer, said in a statement. \u201cWhile Harvey personally guaranteed the loan, others within The Weinstein Company enriched themselves and strategically undermined him, leaving him \u2018holding the bag\u2019 of debt while \u2018lining their pockets\u2019 when the company was in crisis.\u201d",
      "Ansari alleged Bob Weinstein and others at The Weinstein Co. were in on a plot to position Harvey Weinstein for a downfall in an attempt to seize control of the company, which went bankrupt in 2018 as the sexual misconduct scandal surrounding Harvey Weinstein exploded.",
      "An attorney for Bob Weinstein, Brian Kohn, replied with a brief statement Friday saying, \u201cHarvey\u2019s allegations are entirely without merit,\u201d in an email to The Associated Press.",
      "Former Weinstein Co. chief operating officer David Glasser, now chief executive of 101 Studios, known for its production of Paramount's popular series \u201cYellowstone,\u201d is also named in Harvey Weinstein's lawsuit. He did not immediately return a phone message left at his office Friday.",
      "AI International Holdings loaned the money to two affiliates of The Weinstein Co. and Harvey Weinstein, and later sued when it said they defaulted.",
      "Harvey Weinstein alleges that his brother, Glasser and others duped him into guaranteeing the $45 million loan by saying the money would help the financially struggling company. Instead, his lawsuit says, they diverted millions of dollars from the company for improper purposes, leaving it short on cash and Harvey Weinstein liable for repaying the loan.",
      "\u201cAs a direct result of these actions, the Companies were drained of, at the very least, $12 million in cash that should have been allocated to repay the Loan owed to AI International,\u201d the lawsuit says. \u201cThis mismanagement left the Companies unable to satisfy their financial obligations, resulting in insolvency and placing Weinstein at substantial personal financial risk as the guarantor of the Loan.\u201d",
      "The lawsuit, filed in the state Supreme Court in Manhattan, says Weinstein was made to suffer \u201csevere and outrageous financial and reputational harm.\u201d",
      "It also makes several allegations of financial misconduct against Bob Weinstein, Glasser and others.",
      "It accuses Bob Weinstein of withdrawing at least $6 million from company accounts under false pretenses, to give himself priority over creditors including AI International.",
      "The lawsuit alleges Glasser approved and received $5 million in excessive bonuses and unauthorized financial transactions, and used company funds to pay his father $1 million despite no legitimate business reason.",
      "AI International Holdings sued Harvey Weinstein and the two affiliates of The Weinstein Co. in late 2017. The lawsuit said they defaulted on the loan after AI International had ordered the entire balance to be paid immediately because Harvey Weinstein had been dismissed as co-chairman amid the sexual misconduct allegations.",
      "According to Harvey Weinstein, Bob Weinstein and Glasser settled their liability for the loan with AI International for about $15 million due to \u201cbad faith negotiations,\u201d leaving Harvey Weinstein responsible for the remaining $30 million plus interest.",
      "Harvey Weinstein's lawsuit seeks to shield him from any financial liability for the loan, as well as punitive damages for alleged fraud and financial misconduct and his legal fees.",
      "Bob Weinstein recently asked the judge to reject subpoenas for documents and a deposition issued by Harvey Weinstein's lawyer.",
      "Harvey Weinstein, who also co-founded the film company Miramax, was once one of the most powerful people in Hollywood, having produced films such as \u201cPulp Fiction\u201d and \u201cThe Crying Game.\u201d",
      "In 2017, he became the most prominent villain of the #MeToo movement, which erupted when women began going public with accounts of his behavior.",
      "He has long maintained that any sexual activity was consensual.",
      "Harvey Weinstein is being retried on charges that he forcibly performed oral sex on a movie and TV production assistant in 2006 and raped an aspiring actor in 2013. Another charge filed in September alleges he forced oral sex on a different woman at a Manhattan hotel in 2006.",
      "His 2020 conviction and 23-year prison sentence were overturned last year, as an appeals court found the trial judge unfairly allowed testimony against Weinstein based on allegations that weren\u2019t part of the case."

      "NIAGARA FALLS, N.Y. -- At Niagara Falls, the iconic honeymoon and tourist destination on the U.S.-Canadian border, visitors from both countries took in President Donald Trump\u2019s unsolicited suggestion that the U.S. annex its neighbor to the north with an air of detached amusement.",
      "Do they take the idea seriously? Generally speaking, no. But some citizens of both nations wonder why it\u2019s necessary to pick a fight with one of America\u2019s closest allies when there wasn\u2019t much friction there to begin with.",
      "\u201cWe\u2019re allies,\u201d said Shannon Robinson, of Milton, Ontario. \u201cWe love you guys. And we\u2019re proud of the amicable relationship we have. But we\u2019re also proud to be distinct.\u201d",
      "Trump\u2019s idea is bold, offensive and ignorant, but \u201che can say what he wants, and it's actually bringing Canadians together right now,\" said Robinson, standing on the Niagara Falls Observation Tower, which extends over the Niagara Gorge and affords an unobstructed view of all three falls and the Niagara River.",
      "In some instances, that togetherness involved booing. The response was slightly more muted on a recent day as bundled-up tourists from all over the world braved sub-freezing temperatures to catch a glimpse of the majestic falls.",
      "Jeremy Powers, of Panama City, Florida, said the Republican U.S. president's talk of annexing one of America's closest allies and trading partners is \u201cvery weird.\u201d",
      "\u201cHaving that as their own independent nation needs to be maintained, I feel,\u201d said Powers, who was in New York state on a work trip and decided to check out Niagara Falls.",
      "\u201cYou know, we don\u2019t need to try and manifest destiny and gather more land. We need to partner and work with other countries in a more friendly manner,\u201d Powers said before dropping down on one knee to open up a bag containing his camera equipment.",
      "Manifest destiny, the idea that the United States is exceptional among world nations and destined by God to expand its territory across North America, drove U.S. growth through the 19th century. Territorial expansion was not a prominent feature of foreign policy debates before Trump started talking about taking on Canada, Greenland and the Panama Canal \u2014 and even colonizing Mars.",
      "\u201cThe United States will once again consider itself a growing nation, one that increases our wealth, expands our territory, builds our cities, raises our expectations and carries our flag into new and beautiful horizons,\u201d Trump said in his inaugural address. \u201cAnd we will pursue our manifest destiny into the stars, launching American astronauts to plant the Stars and Stripes on the planet Mars.\u201d",
      "Canadian energy minister Jonathan Wilkinson agreed that Trump is uniting Canadians, but he said they're done laughing about his talk of annexation.",
      "\u201cOn the 51st state, I think, you know, when that was said the first time, some people thought it was funny,\u201d Wilkinson said in a recent interview with The Associated Press. \u201cI don\u2019t think Canadians find it funny anymore.\u201d",
      "Back at Niagara Falls, plumes of vapor rose off the frigid water. On Rainbow Bridge, an American flag and a Canadian flag stand feet apart, the representation of two neighboring countries overseeing the shared beauty of nature.",

      "\u201cAll he\u2019s doing,\" Sullivan said, \u201cis creating chaos and making other countries want to hate America.\u201d",

      "The Treasury Department\u2019s Office of Inspector General says it's launching an audit of the security controls for the federal government\u2019s payment system",
      "WASHINGTON -- The Treasury Department's Office of Inspector General on Friday said it was launching an audit of the security controls for the federal government's payment system, after Democratic senators raised red flags about the access provided to Trump aide Elon Musk's Department of Government Efficiency team.",
      "The audit will also review the past two years of the system's transactions as it relates to Musk's assertion of \u201calleged fraudulent payments,\u201d according to a letter from Loren J. Sciurba, Treasury\u2019s deputy inspector general, that was obtained by The Associated Press.",
      "The audit marks part of the broader effort led by Democratic lawmakers and federal employee unions to provide transparency and accountability about DOGE's activities under President Donald Trump's Republican administration. The Musk team has pushed for access to the government's computer systems and sought to remove tens of thousands of federal workers.",
      "\u201cWe expect to begin our fieldwork immediately,\u201d Sciburba wrote. \u201cGiven the breadth of this effort, the audit will likely not be completed until August; however, we recognize the danger that improper access or inadequate controls can pose to the integrity of sensitive payment systems. As such, if critical issues come to light before that time, we will issue interim updates and reports.\u201d",
      "Tech billionaire Musk, who continues to control Tesla, X and SpaceX among other companies, claims to be finding waste, fraud and abuse while providing savings to taxpayers, many of his claims so far unsubstantiated. But there is a risk that his team's aggressive efforts could lead to the failure of government computer systems and enable Musk and his partners to profit off private information maintained by the government.",
      "Democratic Sens. Elizabeth Warren of Massachusetts and Ron Wyden of Oregon led the push for the inspector general office's inquiry.",
      "On Wednesday, Warren, Wyden and Sen. Jack Reed, D-Rhode Island, sent a letter to Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent noting the inconsistencies in the accounts provided by his department about DOGE.",
      "\u201cYour lack of candor about these events is deeply troubling given the threats to the economy and the public from DOGE\u2019s meddling, and you need to provide a clear, complete, and public accounting of who accessed the systems, what they were doing, and why they were doing it,\u201d the Democratic lawmakers wrote in their letter.",
      "The Treasury Department provided conflicting information about DOGE's access to the payment system. Initially, it claimed the access was read only, only to then acknowledge that a DOGE team member briefly had the ability to edit code, and then to say in an employee sworn statement that the ability to edit was granted by accident.",
      "The 25-year-old employee granted the access, Marko Elez, resigned this month after racist posts were discovered on one of his social media accounts, only for Musk to call for his rehiring with the backing of Trump and Vice President JD Vance.",
      "Advocacy groups and labor unions have filed lawsuits over DOGE\u2019s potential unauthorized access to sensitive Treasury payment systems, and five former treasury secretaries have sounded the alarm on the risks associated with Musk\u2019s DOGE accessing sensitive Treasury Department payment systems and potentially stopping congressionally authorized payments.",
      "Earlier this week, the Treasury declined to brief a pair of the highest-ranking lawmakers on the Senate Finance Committee, including Wyden, on the ongoing controversy related to DOGE's use of Treasury payment systems, citing ongoing litigation.",

      "Last month, an American Airlines passenger jet and an Army helicopter collided as the plane prepared to land at Washington D",
      "On Jan. 29, an American Airlines passenger jet and an Army helicopter collided as the plane prepared to land at Washington D.C.\u2019s Ronald Reagan National Airport. Both plunged into the Potomac River, killing all 67 people aboard.",
      "Since then, much of the attention has focused on the helicopter's altitude, and whether it may have been flying too high. The National Transportation Safety Board, which is handling the investigation, plans to brief reporters Friday on their probe.",
      "The collision was the deadliest plane crash in the U.S. since 2001, when a jet slammed into a New York City neighborhood just after takeoff, killing all 260 people on board and five more on the ground.",
      "Air travel remains overwhelmingly safe in the U.S., but there have been a string of incidents in recent weeks, including a fiery explosion on Jan. 31 when a medical transport jet crashed into a Philadelphia neighborhood, killing seven people. Last week, a small commuter aircraft crashed off western Alaska, killing 10 people.",
      "American Airlines Flight 5342 was coming in from Wichita, Kansas, carrying 60 passengers and four crew members, as it approached Reagan National to land on a clear Wednesday night. Nearby, a U.S. Army Black Hawk with three soldiers on board was on a training exercise, practicing emergency evacuation routes that would be used to ferry out key government officials in case of an attack or catastrophe.",
      "A few minutes before the twin-engine jet was to land, air traffic controllers asked if it could use a shorter runway. The pilots agreed, and flight-tracking sites show the plane adjusted its approach.",
      "Shortly before the collision, a controller got an alert that the plane and Black Hawk were converging and asked the helicopter if it had the plane in sight. The military pilot said yes and asked for \u201cvisual separation\u201d with the jet \u2014 allowing it to fly closer than otherwise may have been allowed if the pilots didn\u2019t see the plane. Controllers approved the request.",
      "Roughly 20 seconds later, the aircraft collided.",
      "Since the crash, the National Transportation Safety Board has recovered all the flight data recorders and pulled the wreckage of both aircraft from the Potomac.",
      "It will take more than a year to get the final NTSB report on the crash, but officials have been providing regular updates as investigators learn more and they plan to publish a preliminary report in the coming weeks.",
      "Almost immediately after the crash, President Donald Trump publicly faulted the helicopter, which had a flight ceiling of 200 feet (61 meters), for flying too high. He also blamed federal diversity and inclusion efforts, particularly regarding air traffic controllers. When pressed by reporters, the president could not back up those claims. A few days later, Trump placed the blame on what he called an \u201cobsolete\u201d air traffic control system.",
      "Army officials have said the Black Hawk crew was highly experienced and familiar with the crowded skies around Washington.",
      "Altitude data was not fully clear in the early days of the investigation, with conflicting numbers from the plane's flight data recorder and the control tower.",
      "At the time, however, investigators were still working to recover information from the helicopter\u2019s black box, which had been waterlogged after plunging into the river, and to refine other data.",
      "Investigators also said that about a second before impact, the jet\u2019s flight recorder showed a change in its angle, though they did not say whether that indicated the pilots were trying to perform an evasive maneuver to avoid the crash.",
      "The Army identified the Black Hawk crew as Capt. Rebecca M. Lobach of Durham, North Carolina; Staff Sgt. Ryan Austin O\u2019Hara, 28, of Lilburn, Georgia; and Chief Warrant Officer 2 Andrew Loyd Eaves, 39, of Great Mills, Maryland. O\u2019Hara was the crew chief and Eaves and Lobach were pilots.",
      "Among the jet\u2019s passengers were several members of the Skating Club of Boston returning from a development camp for elite junior skaters that followed the 2025 U.S. Figure Skating Championships in Wichita.",
      "The victims also included a group of hunters returning from a guided trip in Kansas, four members of a steamfitters\u2019 local union in suburban Maryland, nine students and parents from Fairfax County, Virginia, schools and two Chinese nationals."

      "Conservatives who have spent decades promoting deep cuts to government are giving mixed reviews to the Department of Government Efficiency, the Elon Musk-led project to slash the federal workforce and reduce or end disfavored programs",
      "DES MOINES, Iowa -- Conservatives who have spent decades promoting deep cuts to government are giving mixed reviews to the Department of Government Efficiency, the Elon Musk-led project to slash the federal workforce and reduce or end disfavored programs.",
      "The Associated Press interviewed four veteran budget hawks, including some who have worked on Republican presidential campaigns predating Musk or President Donald Trump becoming dominant in GOP politics.",
      "Some say Musk\u2019s early targets demonstrate success and show more potential than previous efforts to downsize government due to his unique access and influence. Others say it\u2019s too early to tell and argue that DOGE has stoked conservative outrage about specific agencies without going after much bigger pieces of the federal budget, like defense spending or programs with bipartisan support like Medicare and Social Security.",
      "A list of savings provided by the White House last week noted at least $2.2 billion in initial savings identified by the group. The DOGE website has since noted at least $5.6 billion. Any total so far is a tiny fraction of Musk's initial goal of $2 trillion, the size of the federal budget deficit, or even the $1 trillion he has since mentioned more regularly.",
      "Here's what the budget hawks said:",
      "Norquist, whose government-cutting advocacy goes back to the administration of President Ronald Reagan, is famous for having said in 2001, \u201cI don\u2019t want to abolish government. I simply want to reduce it to the size where I can drag it into the bathroom and drown it in the bathtub.\u201d",
      "He cheered Musk's early efforts.",
      "\u201cWhen you look at what they found after looking for a few days \u2014 I\u2019m not going to second-guess some of the larger numbers they are talking about \u2014 this thing has paid for itself many times over now,\" Norquist said. As of last week, DOGE was operating with about $14 million, according to the Office of Management and Budget.",
      "\u201cNever mind if they find anything more,\u201d Norquist added.",
      "Musk is succeeding, no matter the final tally of DOGE's work, because he has unfettered access both to Trump and millions of followers on the social media platform he owns, X, Norquist said.",
      "\u201cYou can\u2019t bat it down and tell it to go away because X is out there before defenders of allowing Washington to do whatever it wants,\u201d Norquist said. \u201cThat group can\u2019t get over the fact that 10 million people read a tweet by Elon Musk listing five things suggesting Washington is out of control.\u201d",
      "Musk's early efforts appear to be aimed more at satisfying Trump's culturally conservative base than targeting the biggest government spending sources, said Riedl, a veteran Republican budget analyst who was chief economist for former Ohio Sen. Rob Portman, the conservative Heritage Foundation's senior budget researcher, and the architect of 2012 Republican presidential nominee Mitt Romney\u2019s 10-year deficit reduction proposal.",
      "By seeking to eradicate racial and gender-based diversity, equity and inclusion spending from the the federal civil service, Musk is succeeding in getting the attention of Trump-styled conservatives with relatively few dollars to show for it, she said.",
      "Cancelling so-called DEI contracts across the federal government is akin to cancelling the media subscriptions to national outlets such as The Associated Press, The New York Times, Politico and The Washington Post, she said. They are all regular targets of criticism from Trump's core supporters.",
      "\u201cSo far, DOGE seems more about looking for symbolic culture war savings than truly reducing the budget deficit in any meaningful way,\u201d said Riedl,",
      "Likewise, Musk's effort to encourage many of the hundreds of thousands of eligible federal employees to accept terms to quit immediately in exchange for months of pay is seen by that same segment of voters as ridding the government of a force seen as thwarting Trump's policy agenda.",
      "\u201cThese really get attention of Trump conservatives as fronts in the culture war, but ultimately do not save very much money at all,\" Riedl said.",
      "A large majority of federal spending is tied up in Medicare and Social Security, veterans benefits, defense spending and interest on the national debt. During his 2024 presidential campaign, Trump insisted he would protect the two politically sacrosanct entitlement programs and expand the U.S. military, making these areas unlikely targets for cuts.",
      "\u201cIf Trump were serious about the deficit, he'd be addressing Social Security, Medicare, defense and veterans benefits,\u201d Riedl said. \u201cAnd that's if the public even cares. I've seen no real evidence that they do.\u201d",
      "Only about a quarter of Americans said they were in favor of, as Musk recommended Thursday, eliminating entire federal agencies, according to an Associated Press-NORC poll conducted in January. Likewise, only about 3 in 10 U.S. adults said they favored eliminating a large number of federal jobs.",
      "So far, DOGE's recommendations read like a public relations campaign aimed at discrediting the federal government, said Nowrasteh, an executive for the libertarian think tank and co-author of a report published in December recommending cuts to Musk's group.",
      "Nowrasteh thinks the group may be shoring up its standing with conservative voters before it reaches for further buy-in among more moderate voters.",
      "\u201cThey are trying to take down portions of the government that appear to be liberal or left leaning. And in the process, they are trying to expose some of the sillier aspects of what is being funded,\" he said.",

      "But the unsolicited bid might not be a failure - at least as far as Musk is concerned, experts say.",
      "That's because the offer could still complicate CEO Sam Altman's plans to transform OpenAI from a non-profit controlled entity to a for-profit company.",
      "Musk is \"basically trying to stymie OpenAI's growth trajectory,\" said University of Cambridge associate teaching professor Johnnie Penn in an interview with the BBC.",
      "Profit & non-profit",

      "It was a huge sum - but less than the $157bn the firm was valued at in a funding round just four months ago, and much lower than the $300bn that some think it is worth now.",
      "Complicating all of this is OpenAI's unusual structure which involves a partnership between non-profit and for-profit arms.",
      "Mr Altman is understood to want to change that, stripping it of its non-profit board.",
      "That involves costs which Mr Musk is seemingly trying to inflate.",
      "\"What Musk is trying to do here is raise the perceived value of the non-profit arm of OpenAI, so that OpenAI has to pay more to get out of the obligations it has to its own non-profit,\" said Dr Penn.",

      "\"By Musk putting a price tag on the non-profit part, he makes the split way more expensive for Altman to do,\" Mr Finger told the BBC. \"It's very simple.\"",
      "'Missed the AI train'",
      "Mr Musk justified his actions by saying he wants to return OpenAI - which he co-founded - to its non-profit roots and original mission of developing AI for the benefit of humanity.",
      "Others, though, suggest he has somewhat less noble motives linked to his own AI company xAI and chatbot Grok, which have received a lacklustre response from the public.",
      "\"Musk has missed the AI train, somewhat. He's behind, and he has made several attempts to catch up,\" Mr Finger said.",
      "Now, Mr Finger says, Mr Musk is trying to kneecap his most formidable competitor.",
      "An already-tense relationship appeared to worsen further last week with Mr Altman taunting Mr Musk's offer on X, and Mr Musk retorting by calling his onetime partner a \"swindler\".",
      "Mr Altman then hit back in an interview with Bloomberg, opining that Mr Musk is not \"a happy person\" and saying his decisions are made from a \"position of insecurity\".",
      "The tit-for-tat is also playing out in court, where US district judge Yvonne Gonzalez Rogers is considering Mr Musk's request for an injunction that would block OpenAI from its planned conversion.",
      "He claims that he will be irreparably harmed without her intervention.",
      "\"It is plausible that what Mr Musk is saying is true. We'll find out. He'll sit on the stand,\" Gonzalez Rogers said during a hearing in Musk v Altman earlier this month in Oakland, California.",
      "According to OpenAI's lawyers, Mr Musk's recent bid contradicts his earlier claims that OpenAI's assets cannot be transferred away for \"private gain.\"",

    "story": [
      "Donald Trump is threatening to introduce big tariffs on EU car imports, unhappy that Europeans don't buy more American vehicles. But why are US cars, with the notable exception of Tesla, not more popular in Europe?",
      "Italy's ancient towns and cities, with their narrow, cobbled streets, offer an obvious explanation why, in the words of US President Donald Trump, Europeans \"don't take our cars\".",
      "Or as car industry analyst Hampus Engellau puts it: \"Try to go around Italy in a big SUV. I've done it, and it's very difficult\".",
      "Add cost to the question, and it becomes obvious why you don't see too many American pick-up trucks on European roads, observes Mike Hawes, CEO of The Society of Motor Manufacturers & Traders, which represents the industry in the UK.",
      "\"We tend to have higher fuel prices than the Americans, so we prefer smaller, more fuel-efficient vehicles, while they generally prefer larger vehicles.\"",
      "Mr Engellau, who works for Swedish investment bank Handelsbanken Capital Markets, also highlights petrol prices being substantially cheaper in the US. \"They pay per gallon what we pay per litre,\" he says. There are 3.8 litres to one US gallon.",
      "Yet these differences have done little to deter European carmakers from gaining market share in the US. Again, in the words of Mr Trump, the US has \"millions of cars coming in - BMW, Mercedes, Volkswagen and many others\".",
      "In 2022, 692,334 new EU-made cars were exported to the US, worth \u20ac36bn ($37bn; \u00a330bn). While only 116,207 new US-made cars went in the opposite direction, for \u20ac5.2bn.",
      "This imbalance is caused by unfair trading rules and needs correcting, according to Mr Trump.",

      "These disparities have prompted Trump to say he wants to raise US tariffs on European automotive imports. He has already announced 25% import tariffs on steel and aluminium imports, two metals crucial for carmakers.",
      "Trump's move appears to have prompted EU officials to consider reducing their own tariffs in order to protect Europe's automotive industry from a potential trade war.",
      "Trump's intervention has not impressed Jim Farley, the boss of US carmaker Ford. \"So far what we've been seeing is a lot of cost and a lot of chaos,\" NBC News recently reported him as saying.",
      "In fact, the very focus on trade is perhaps misplaced, according to automotive industry veteran Andy Palmer, formerly the chief operating officer of Nissan and CEO of Aston Martin, and currently a consultant. \"If you can help it, you don't want to ship cars around the world. They're big boxes of expensive air,\" he says.",
      "The automotive industry is global, adds the SMMT's Mr Hawes, so carmakers generally want to \"manufacture close to where the customer is based\".",
      "As such, several European carmakers, most notably marques such as BMW, Mercedes and Audi, are making some of their largest cars in North America, and some of these vehicles are exported back to Europe.",
      "US carmakers have historically pursued similar strategies in Europe. General Motors owned and manufactured European marques such as Opel/Vauxhall and Saab, but it sold the former in 2017, and shut the latter back in 2009.",

      "\"There's a natural inclination for people to buy local champions, especially in Germany, France and Italy,\" explains Mr Asumendi.",
      "He adds that while other European countries are more open to different brands, the market is crowded, with a slew of Japanese, South Korea, and, increasingly, Chinese cars.",

      "The UK's trading relationship with US had suggested it would be less exposed to tariffs than others, but the surprise inclusion of VAT to calculate potential tariffs has prompted questions over the impact on British businesses.",
      "Analysts have suggested tariffs of 20% or more could be placed on the UK as well as the European Union, but the outcome remains uncertain.",
      "The British Chambers of Commerce (BCC) business group warned that cars, pharmaceuticals, and food and drink were specific goods which could be \"significantly hit\" by the measures, which were announced by the White House on Thursday.",
      "The latest announcement by Trump administration was wide-ranging and threatened retaliation by the US for not just trade tariffs, but for other \"unfair or harmful acts, policies or practices\".",
      "One of the justifications Trump has given to date for imposing tariffs on countries is whether they have a trade surplus with the US - i.e. they sell more to the US than they import from the country.",

      "Both the UK and US claim to have trade surpluses with each other due to discrepancies in how the countries collect data. It remains uncertain whether Trump would exempt the UK from tariffs, but the introduction of Value Added Tax (VAT) into the equation complicates matters.",
      "The president's latest announcement cited VAT as an \"unfair, discriminatory or extraterritorial tax\".",
      "VAT tax is the tax people have to pay when people buy most goods or services, apart from food and children's clothes. The standard rate in the UK is 20% and it is levied regardless of whether a product has been imported from overseas or not.",
      "George Saravelos, global head of FX research at Deutsche Bank, said if the US imposed taxes based on existing tariffs and VAT combined, British businesses exporting to the US could face charges of 21%.",
      "\"If reciprocal tariffs are applied on a VAT basis, European countries would be much higher on the list of impacted countries,\" he said.",
      "William Bain, head of trade policy at the BCC, said the UK had a \"level of insulation\" due to it not exporting as many goods to the US in comparison to other countries.",

      "She said the government should \"be strong negotiators\", adding that Prime Minister Sir Keir Starmer needed to \"strengthen our partnership\" with the US.",
      "Paul Ashworth, chief UK economist for Capital Economics, said that most people would regard VAT as a non-discriminatory tax as it is applied to all goods whether they were produced domestically or imported.",
      "But he noted one of Trump's advisers had argued that given the US applied a much lower average sales tax at state level, VAT was a \"form of discriminatory tariff\".",
      "Mr Ashworth said it appeared the US president now favoured tariffs to be imposed on a \"country-by-country basis\" as opposed to his original idea of introducing universal tax on all imports to the US.",
      "'Difficult to predict'",
      "A tariff is a tax on imports collected by a government and it is paid by the company importing the good. Countries typically erect tariffs in a bid to protect certain sectors from foreign competition.",
      "But in protecting domestic businesses, prices for consumers can go up if a company importing goods from abroad passes higher costs on, rather than absorbing them or reducing imports.",
      "Caroline Ramsay, partner and head of international trade at law firm TLT, said it was \"difficult to predict\" what the latest announcement would mean for the UK.",
      "She suggested the word \"reciprocal\" did not mean what people might have first assumed, adding an assessment by the US would be made on what it considers to be fair.",
      "\"It does not mean that the USA is going to check what the UK tariff is on paper imports and match that tariff percentage for paper exports to the US from the UK,\" she added.",

    "story": [
      "Two US lawmakers have strongly condemned what they call the UK's \"dangerous\"  and \"shortsighted\" request to be able to access encrypted data stored by Apple users worldwide in its cloud service.",
      "Senator Ron Wyden and Congressman Andy Biggs have written to national intelligence director Tulsi Gabbard saying the demand threatens the privacy and security of the US.",
      "They urge her to give the UK an ultimatum: \"Back down from this dangerous attack on US cybersecurity, or face serious consequences.\"",
      "The BBC has contacted the UK government for comment.",
      "\"While the UK has been a trusted ally, the US government must not permit what is effectively a foreign cyberattack waged through political means\", the US politicians wrote.",
      "If the UK does not back down Ms Gabbard should \"reevaluate US-UK cybersecurity arrangements and programs as well as US intelligence sharing\", they suggest.",
      "What is the UK seeking?",
      "The request for the data emerged last week.",
      "It applies to all content stored using what Apple calls \"Advanced Data Protection\" (ADP).",
      "This uses end-to-end encryption, where only the account holder can access the data stored. Apple itself cannot see it.",
      "It is an opt-in service, and not all users choose to activate it.",
      "The demand was first reported by the Washington Post, quoting sources familiar with the matter, and the BBC has spoken to similar contacts.",
      "The Home Office said then: \"We do not comment on operational matters, including for example confirming or denying the existence of any such notices.\"",
      "Apple declined to comment, but says on its website that it views privacy as a \"fundamental human right\".",
      "The order has been served by the Home Office under the Investigatory Powers Act, which compels firms to provide information to law enforcement agencies.",
      "Under the law, the demand by the Home Office cannot be made public.",
      "Senator Wyden and Congressman Biggs say agreeing to the request would \"undermine Americans' privacy rights and expose them to espionage by China, Russia and other adversaries\".",
      "They state that Apple does not make different versions of its encryption software for each country it operates in and, therefore, Apple customers in the UK will use the same software as Americans.",
      "\"If Apple is forced to build a backdoor in its products, that backdoor will end up in Americans' phones, tablets, and computers, undermining the security of Americans' data, as well as of the countless federal, state and local government agencies that entrust sensitive data to Apple products.\"",
      "The move by the UK government has stunned experts and worried privacy campaigners, with Privacy International calling it  an \"unprecedented attack\" on the private data of individuals.",
      "However the US government has previously asked Apple to break its encryption as part of criminal investigations.",
      "In 2016, Apple resisted a court order to write software which would allow US officials to access the iPhone of a gunman - though this was resolved after the FBI were able to successfully access the device.",
      "That same year, the US dropped a similar case after it was able to gain access by discovering the passcode of an alleged drug dealer.",
      "Similar cases have followed, including in 2020, when Apple refused to unlock iPhones of a man who carried out a mass shooting at a US air base. The FBI later said it had been able to \"gain access\" to the phones.",
      "It is understood that the UK government does not want to start combing through everybody's data.",
      "Rather it would want to access it if there were a risk to national security - in other words, it would be targeting an individual, rather than using it for mass surveillance.",
      "Authorities would still have to follow a legal process, have a good reason and request permission for a specific account in order to access data - just as they do now with unencrypted data.",
      "Apple has previously said it would pull encryption services like ADP from the UK market rather than comply with such government demands - telling Parliament it would \"never build a back door\" in its products.",
      "WhatsApp, owned by Meta, has also previously said it would choose being blocked over weakening message security.",
      "But even withdrawing the product from the UK might not be enough to ensure compliance - the Investigatory Powers Act applies worldwide to any tech firm with a UK market, even if they are not based there."

      "In Mr Walter's view the properties were unsuitable for solid wall insulation and said it would have to be removed from all of the properties. He warned this could cost tens of thousands of pounds per home to fix.",
      "He said the cost \"could actually exceed the market value'' of each house and added ''it just demonstrates what a catastrophic scheme it's been.''",

      "\"We don't want to let them down, we want it to be sorted for them and for us,\" she said. \"Somebody is responsible and they need to act.\"",
      "The company hired by Durham County Council to do the work on Mrs Chappell's house, Tolent, went bust before the installations were completed.",

    "story": [
      "US President Donald Trump is sharpening plans to hit exports from countries that he says have trade policies that are unfair to the US.",
      "On Thursday, Trump signed a memo that instructed staff to develop custom tariffs for each country, taking into account features such as their existing tariffs, exchange rates, trade balances and other rules.",
      "In outlining its concerns, the White House said that tariffs imposed by other countries were not necessarily the biggest issue, singling out the European Union for other policies the Trump administration said put US exporters at a disadvantage.",
      "While big questions remain about the plans, the announcement is likely to kick off trade talks around the world.",
      "Which countries could be affected?",
      "The memo signed by the president asked that staff report back for a plan for \"reciprocal trade and tariffs\" within 180 days.",
      "Trump's pick for Commerce Secretary, Howard Lutnick, said his team would be ready to hand a plan to the president by 1 April.",
      "Trump cast his plan for so-called reciprocal tariffs as part of his effort to bring investment to the US and boost manufacturing.",
      "\"If you build your product in the United States, there are no tariffs,\" he said, adding that he was \"just doing what was fair\".",
      "\"In almost all cases, they're charging us vastly more than we charge them but those days are over,\" he said. \"This should have been done a long time ago.\"",
      "As well as the European Union, Trump's moves are expected to have an impact on trade relationships with countries such as India, Vietnam and Thailand, which have relatively higher tariffs and rely on the US as a big market for exports.",
      "Trump signed the memo ahead of a meeting with Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi, who has already taken steps to reduce tariffs on key items such as motorcycles, which Trump made an issue during his first term.",
      "Still, he vowed reciprocal tariffs on Indian imports at a joint press conference with Modi on Thursday: \"Whatever India charges us, we charge them.\"",
      "In recent days, officials in Thailand and Vietnam have also said they were reviewing trade with the US.",
      "Ahead of Trump's announcement, the European Union said it was committed to \"maintaining a close partnership with the US\".",
      "\"We will continue to seek constructive engagement,\" Olof Gill, the commission's spokesperson for trade said. \"At the same time, we stand ready to protect our interests.\"",
      "What are reciprocal tariffs?",
      "A tariff is a tax on imports collected by the government. It is paid by the company importing the good.",
      "Countries typically erect tariffs in a bid to protect certain sectors from foreign competition.",
      "Historically, the US has championed free trade and kept the majority of its tariffs low, except on certain products such as footwear and, more recently, steel and aluminium.",
      "The US has an average tariff rate of 3.4%, compared with an average rate of 5% in Europe, according to the WTO.",
      "In setting out its plans, the White House cited objections to tariffs such as the 10% tax that US-made cars face in Europe, compared with the 2.5% tariff the US applies to cars brought into the US.",
      "The White House also said that Brazil charges an 18% tariff on ethanol imports, while the US charges a 2.5% tariff on the same product.",
      "But officials made clear that the US intends to use tariffs to challenge policies farther afield, citing concerns about the digital services taxes many countries, including Canada and the UK, have unveiled against Big Tech firms - many of which are US-based - as well as Europe's rules for its Value Added Tax (VAT), a kind of sales tax.",
      "Those kinds of issues also raise risks for the UK.",
      "Duncan Edwards, chief executive of BritishAmerican Business, a group representing transatlantic firms, said Trump's plans \"should not come as a surprise\"  and the details of how any reciprocal tariffs are calculated will be a key focus.",
      "\"Our hope at BritishAmerican Business, is that the UK's relatively open market and balanced trade with the USA gives it a chance to avoid much of the impact of this policy but nothing should be taken for granted,\" he said.",
      "What impact could tariffs have on the economy?",
      "Thursday's announcement comes after a string of tariff-related moves from the new administration.",
      "Earlier this week, Trump ordered the US to start charging a 25% import tax on all steel and aluminium brought into the country, ending exemptions for countries including the European Union, UK and Brazil. That is due to go into effect next month.",
      "He also raised tariffs on all goods from China to 10% and threatened to hit imports from Canada and Mexico with duties of 25%, a plan that has been put on hold until March.",
      "Shares on Wall Street rose after no immediate tariffs were announced.",
      "John Cassidy, chief executive of Red Cedar Investment Management, said Trump's string of rapid-fire tariff announcements had unnerved Wall Street, which \"does not like the unknown\".",
      "But he warned against over-reacting, noting that tariffs that Trump imposed during his first term had a relatively mild impact on the US economy.",
      "\"I think Trump's playing a hand here and I think he's got a very strong hand to play,\" he said.",
      "However, Alex Durante, economist at the Tax Foundation, said it remained to be seen what changes could result from Trump's moves.",
      "He does not think tariffs are the best strategy for dealing with trade complaints, given the costs and uncertainty they introduce for US firms and risks of retaliation.",
      "\"I think we're inching toward more and more tariffs with each coming week and further escalation of a trade war with other countries,\" he said.",
      "He noted that Trump in his first term walked away from the Trans Pacific Partnership, a free trade agreement that had been intended to address some of these same issues with countries in Asia.",
      "\"They were open to doing this without having to put the US through more trade uncertainty,\" he said.",
      "Trump has dismissed concerns about collateral economic damage, saying his plans will boost manufacturing in the US over the long term.",
      "\"What's going to go up is jobs are going to go up,\" he said. \"Prices could go up somewhat short term, but prices will also go down.\"",
      "But surveys indicate the US public remains concerned about the cost of living and is unconvinced about the benefits of tariffs, which economists have warned are likely to lead to higher prices for US businesses and households.",
      "A recent Marquette Law School poll found just 24% of respondents believe tariffs will help the US economy, including just under half of Republicans and just 12% of independents and 4% of Democrats.",
      "\"The question is are these tariffs going to lead to higher inflation, higher costs of goods,\" said Charles Franklin, director of the poll. \"The fairness argument is probably a good argument for the president to make but the price impact is much more of a hard thing to sell\".",

      "TikTok is again available on the US app stores of Apple and Google, after President Donald Trump postponed enforcement of a ban of the Chinese-owned social media platform until 5 April.",
      "The popular app, which is used by more than 170 million American users, went dark briefly last month in the US as the ban deadline approached.",
      "Trump then signed an executive order granting TikTok a 75-day extension to comply with a law banning the app if it is not sold.",
      "TikTok did not immediately respond to a request for comment from BBC News.",
      "According to Bloomberg, which first reported TikTok's return to app stores in the US, the decision to resume its availability came after Apple and Google received assurances from the Trump administration that they would not be held liable for allowing downloads, and the ban wouldn't be enforced yet.",
      "The ban, which passed with a bipartisan vote in Congress, was signed into law by former President Joe Biden. It ordered TikTok's Chinese owner ByteDance to sell the US version of the platform to a neutral party to avert an outright ban.",
      "The Biden administration had argued that TikTok could be used by China as a tool for spying and political manipulation.",
      "China and TikTok have repeatedly denied those accusations. Beijing has also previously rejected calls for a sale of TikTok's US operations.",
      "The law banning the app was supported by US lawmakers on both sides of the aisle and it was ultimately upheld by the Supreme Court.",
      "Trump himself had supported banning the app during his first term in office but he appeared to have a change of heart last year during the presidential race.",
      "He professed a \"warm spot\" for the app, touting the billions of views he says his videos attracted on the platform during last year's presidential campaign.",

    "published": "Fri, 14 Feb 2025 06:03:08 GMT",
    "summary": "Businesses want a review of the regulations that govern what Heathrow Airport can charge.",
    "story": [
      "Airlines and hoteliers say Heathrow's funding model should be reformed before any investment is made in the proposed third runway.",
      "Businesses want a fundamental review of the regulations set by the Civil Aviation Authority (CAA) that govern what Heathrow can charge. They say the current model makes Heathrow the most expensive airport in the world.",
      "If changes are not made, businesses say the third runway will not happen as it will be too expensive.",
      "The CAA said it would \"carefully consider\" conducting a review of Heathrow's economic regulatory model.",
      "A Heathrow source said that the airport management had already told airlines and the government that it would propose to look at a different, longer-term regulatory model for a third runway.",
      "But, as with other goods that consumers buy, those who use a service or product have to pay for the cost of providing or producing it as is the case today.",
      "Surinder Arora is the chair of Arora group which owns 16 hotels and lots of land around the airport. He is pro-expansion but he has his doubts it will happen.",
      "He told BBC London that Heathrow is overcharging for many items.",
      "For example, he says he pays 2.62p a unit for a unit of water at the Renaissance Hotel which is outside the Heathrow Airport boundary.",
      "At his Hilton hotel next to Terminal 2, within the boundary, he pays Heathrow Airport a lot more - 23.27p a unit. That high price is passed on to his customers.",
      "He gives other examples including three oak trees being chopped down and the airlines being charged \u00a376,000.",
      "A smoking shelter which he says would cost normally \u00a320-30,000, he says cost Heathrow \u00a31.1m.",
      "Sources at Heathrow dispute those figures.",
      "But he says the regulatory model allows Heathrow to charge what they want for many services, such as water, parking or construction, as they are a monopoly.",
      "\"The current monopoly at Heathrow doesn't only vastly overcharge passengers on aviation fees but also on their parking and a variety of other services as it continues to stand out as the most expensive airport in the world by a long way,\" says Mr Arora.",
      "\"We are delighted to be working with the airlines to ask the CAA to look more carefully at the regulatory issues which lead to such high prices and seize the opportunity for competition to improve Heathrow's offer to passengers.\"",
      "Most expensive for airport charges",
      "He told me without change the third runway would not happen.",
      "\"If it stays the same then it won't happen,\" he says.",
      "\"If you look at the last two decades they have never delivered a project on time and on budget.",
      "\"What they're looking at spending is \u00a362bn plus. And the current value of the airport is \u00a320bn.",
      "\"So what they're saying is we will increase the passenger numbers by 50% but we want you to pay three times than what the value is today. How can any business survive that?",
      "\"If they just carry on the same model, everyone else will end up paying for it.\"",
      "Nigel Wicking, chief executive of Heathrow Airline Operators Committee, says all of the costs are passed on to travellers.",
      "\"Heathrow is rapidly falling behind other major airports around the globe both in facilities and service to airline customers, while having the unenviable accolade of being the most expensive for airport charges. This cannot continue,\" he says.",
      "\"The airline community want to offer travellers, to and from the UK, a great experience through Heathrow and we want growth, also avoiding the disproportionate costs we too often see by Heathrow Airport Limited.\"",

      "What's the plan for a third runway at Heathrow Airport?",
      "Will a third runway at Heathrow help UK growth?",
      "The government has said it will back a third runway if it can be expanded within noise, pollution and carbon limits.",
      "This week, Heathrow Airport said it would be applying for planning permission by the summer.",
      "The Heathrow source said it made little sense to suggest that passengers would have new runways and terminal buildings for free as they would require investments over and above current regular investment levels.",
      "Heathrow is keen to run a transparent process and work in partnership with airlines, the regulator and ministers to put in place a model that delivers the benefits of expansion for the UK as quickly as possible - including the lower airfares that consumers can expect as a result of new capacity being unlocked.",
      "It also pointed out as part of the settlement airlines must agree to approve of all spending and the regulator makes sure it is value for money.",
      "Selina Chadha, group director for consumers and markets at the UK CAA, said: \"We have received a submission asking us to conduct a review of Heathrow's economic regulatory model, and we will carefully consider it as part of our commitment to effective regulation.",

    "published": "Fri, 14 Feb 2025 00:08:50 GMT",
    "summary": "Researchers have given a robot a powerful radio-based vision system which can see through smoke.",
    "story": [
      "If you want to find out whether your robot can see through smoke, well, you're going to need some smoke.",
      "But a University of Pennsylvania student got a shock when they began setting up a late night experiment to test such a robot.",
      "Shortly after flicking the switch on the smoke machine, a loud fire alarm went off.",
      "\"The whole building got triggered,\" says Mingmin Zhao of the University of Pennsylvania, smiling. \"My student called me. He was very surprised.\"",
      "The incident was a minor setback for the team developing a robot equipped with a innovative radio-based sensing system.",
      "Radio waves could allow robots or autonomous vehicles to see through thick smoke, intense rain \u2013 or even around corners. Such waves can even detect concealed weapons.",
      "But simulating visual imagery based on radio waves is an unusual approach for robots and autonomous vehicles. Much more established in those fields are regular optical cameras, light detection and ranging (Lidar), and other sensors.",
      "However, Prof Zhao and his students have developed a potentially powerful way for robots to see using radio waves.",
      "Of course radar, which uses radio waves, has been used for decades to track aircraft, ships and the weather.",
      "But the spinning array on Prof Zhao's robot throws radio waves in all directions.",
      "An on-board artificial intelligence (AI) system then builds a 3D view of the environment with this information.",
      "\"What we have been trying to do here is basically help robots obtain superhuman vision \u2013 to see in scenarios where human eyes or traditional visual sensors cannot,\" explains Prof Zhao.",
      "He suggests the technology could help a future search-and-rescue robot save people from a burning building.",
      "Subsequent tests of the bot used a clear plastic box full of smoke placed around the its spinning equipment, in order to avoid triggering any nearby fire alarms.",
      "Although humans can't see them, radio waves are a form of light in the sense that they are part of the electromagnetic spectrum, which also includes X-rays and gamma rays. Only a small part the spectrum is classed as visible light.",
      "Being light, radio waves can reflect off surfaces and materials, though in a slightly different way to visible light. Prof Zhao and his colleagues have designed their robot so that it can sense these radio wave reflections.",
      "The crucial factor here is that radio waves are much longer than visible light waves meaning they are not blocked by tiny smoke particles.",
      "Prof Zhao says he has also been working on adapting the technology so that the robot can see part of the way round a corner. Think of it like a hall of mirrors, he suggests, just for radio waves rather than visible light.",
      "\"It's really very interesting work and quite impressive,\" says Friedemann Reinhard at the University of Rostock in Germany, who was not involved in the work. In 2017, Prof Reinhard and colleagues described how Wi-Fi signals could allow spies to see into private rooms.",
      "One slight limitation is that the spinning array cannot, by definition, see in all directions at once. Prof Reinhard says that a lot of data processing carried out by the system appears necessary to clean up the image that results from this spinning device.",
      "However, the robot sends out radio waves in the millimetre wave band (waves that are between one and ten millimetres long). This is the same technology used for some 5G installations.",
      "\"That's potentially very attractive, it's a very well understood, cheap technology,\" says Prof Reinhard. \"I certainly would love to see a self-driving car driving only on radar.\"",
      "But it is possible to avoid using spinning radio-emitting devices to get a full picture, says Fabio da Silva, founder and chief executive of US firm Wavsens, which is also developing radio-based sensing technology.",
      "\"We created an algorithm that allows you to sense the entire space instantaneously and continuously so we don't have to spin our antennas,\" he says.",
      "He describes the system as akin to echolocation, used by bats. It sends out radio waves and \"listens\" to how the waves come back, which reveals the shape of whatever they have hit.",
      "Some researchers have used radio waves to detect concealed weapons such as hidden handguns and knives.",
      "Radio waves can even \"fingerprint\" the details of a room. Then, if scanned again later, this would reveal whether any objects in the room have been moved.",
      "Last year, scientists in Germany proposed that countries use this method to scrutinise other countries' management of their nuclear weapons stockpiles. It would be one way of knowing whether someone had been moving the warheads around, for example.",
      "Separately, Luana Olivieri at Loughborough University has explored using a different form of non-visible electromagnetic radiation, terahertz waves. These are shorter than radio waves but longer than visible light waves. \"This wavelength is particularly unexplored,\" says Dr Olivieri.",
      "It is possible to see through objects and analyse materials using this form of radiation, she adds. Such a system could even, in theory, identify specific drugs by detecting their chemical structure.",
      "But while seeing through materials could help a rescue bot find a trapped person in some future disaster, it also has other applications. Police forces and militaries have access to radio-based technology that allows them to see through doors and walls, to some extent.",
      "\"Warfighting is definitely one market that it caters to. It can be used to find and kill someone,\" says Mr da Silva. He has exhibited Wavsens' technology to the US Department of Defense and the Israeli Ministry of Defense, he says.",
      "And yet these applications are not entirely surprising, suggests Prof Reinhard, who points out that a range of emerging technologies have, in principle, made it easier to detect and attack people.",
      "\"Maybe radar sounds scary \u2013 but drones and cheap cameras are the much more dangerous thing,\" he says."

      "India's Prime Minister Narendra Modi has hailed a \"mega partnership\" with the US, as he and US President Donald Trump agreed on a deal for Delhi to import more American oil and gas.",
      "Modi's two-day visit comes as Trump recently ordered that all the US'  trading partners - including India - should face sweeping reciprocal tariffs.",
      "While both men praised each other's leadership, Trump criticised India for having some of the highest trade tariffs in the world, calling them a \"big problem\".",
      "The Indian leader, seeking to soften impending trade barriers, said he was open to reducing tariffs on US goods, repatriating undocumented Indian nationals and buying military fighter jets from the US.",
      "At a joint news conference, Modi made several references to Trump's \"make America great again\" slogan, including his own spin to it: \"It's Make India Great Again - Miga,\" Modi said.",

      "With India already being reliant on imported oil, which it sources from multiple countries, the energy deal with the US \"presents a relatively low hanging fruit for both parties\", Radhika Rao, a senior economist at Singapore's DBS bank told the BBC.",
      "\"The US is the largest export market for India's goods and services, which underscores the administration's willingness to pre-emptively smoothen trade relations and offer concessions to narrow the bilateral trade deficit that the US runs with India,\" she said.",
      "However, \"India's challenge will be to balance its own trade deficit because US oil and gas might be more expensive due to a stronger dollar,\" Amitendu Palit, senior research fellow at the National University of Singapore's Institute of South Asian Studies said.",
      "\"Reciprocal tariffs are likely to follow on India too at some stage. Hopefully for India, they won't turn out to be larger than expected,\" said Dr Palit.",
      "Trump also added that the US would increase sales of military hardware to India by millions of dollars, eventually supplying Delhi with F-35 fighter jets.",
      "The two also spoke about immigration - another pain point in bilateral relations - with Trump announcing that the US would extradite a man who allegedly plotted 2008 Mumbai terror attack to \"face justice in India\".",
      "Modi thanked Trump for allowing the extradition and vowed to accept repatriations of Indian nationals illegally living in the US.",
      "Last week, US deported on a military plane 104 Indians accused of being illegal immigrants, with a video showing deportees in shackles. A second flight is expected to land in India on Saturday.",
      "Indians are one of the largest populations of unauthorised immigrants in the US. They also hold the majority of H-1B visas - a programme that Trump had temporarily banned during his first term and is now coming under fresh scrutiny.",
      "Shortly before his meeting with Modi, Trump had ordered his advisers to calculate broad new tariffs on US trading partners around the globe, warning they could start coming into effect by 1 April.",
      "He acknowledged the risks of his tariff policy but argued the policy would boost American manufacturing and the country would be \"flooded with jobs\".",
      "Trump told reporters that \"our allies are worse than our enemies\", when it comes to import taxes.",
      "\"We had a very unfair system to us,\" the Republican president said before meeting Modi. \"Everybody took advantage of the United States.\"",
      "The White House also issued a news release that fired a trade shot across the bows of India and other countries.",
      "The document noted that the average US tariff on agricultural goods was 5% for countries to which Washington had granted most favoured nation (MFN) status.",
      "\"But India's average applied MFN tariff is 39%,\" the White House fact sheet said.",
      "\"India also charges a 100% tariff on US motorcycles, while we only charge a 2.4% tariff on Indian motorcycles.\"",
      "Trump has already placed an additional 10% tariff on imports from China, citing its production of fentanyl, a deadly opioid that has stoked a US overdose epidemic.",
      "He has also readied tariffs on Canada and Mexico, America's two largest trading partners, that could take effect in March after being suspended for 30 days.",

      "US President Donald Trump has announced 25% taxes on steel entering the country, meaning American businesses face having to pay more to import the metal.",
      "But Business Secretary Jonathan Reynolds told the BBC that the UK had a strong case to avoid the border taxes, given the amounts Britain exported to the US were small in comparison to other countries and because the steel was used in areas such as defence.",
      "Trump has previously said the tariffs will be enforced on 12 March \"without exceptions or exemptions\".",
      "The government has said it would not retaliate immediately to new measures announced this week, despite many in the steel industry calling on Britain to join the European Union and Canada who have said they will hit back against the policy.",
      "The UK is not a big supplier of steel to the US, with the country accounting for about 10% of British steel exports. However, for some suppliers of specialist products, trade with the US is much more important.",
      "There are also concerns within the industry that the tariffs might not only hinder exports to the US, but could also lead to excess steel being \"dumped\" in the UK.",
      "This could occur if other countries no longer exporting to the US decide to offload steel at cheaper prices, which could potentially lead to UK steelmaking businesses being undercut.",
      "Reynolds acknowledged there was a global oversupply of steel and aluminium but said he would argue to the Trump administration that the UK was not the problem.",
      "His comments also suggested that the UK would be reluctant to join potential retaliation by the EU to any further tariffs imposed by the US, adding that \"the UK national interest was best served by free trade\".",

      "Rachel Reeves and two colleagues were the subject of an expenses probe while she was a senior manager at Halifax Bank of Scotland (HBOS) in the late 2000s.",
      "It was also revealed that the chancellor's online CV exaggerated the length of time she worked at the Bank of England.",
      "Sir Keir Starmer said Reeves has \"dealt with any issues that arise\" when asked about her CV by a reporter.",
      "The initial stage of the investigation found that a whistleblower's complaint was substantiated at HBOS, and the three employees appeared to have broken the rules, according to a senior source with direct knowledge of the probe.",
      "We have not been able to establish what the final outcome of the investigation was. Indeed, it may not have concluded.",
      "A spokesman for Reeves said the chancellor had no knowledge of the investigation, always complied with expenses rules and left the bank on good terms.",
      "BBC News investigates the Chancellor's expenses before she became an MP",
      "In a brief interview with a reporter, Sir Keir was asked about Rachel Reeves's CV.",
      "The prime minister was asked whether he was \"comfortable that she exaggerated her relevant experience\".",
      "He said the issues were from \"many years ago\" but that he and the chancellor \"get up every day to... make sure that the economy in our country, which was badly damaged under the last government, is revived and we have growth, and that is felt in the pockets of working people across the country\".",
      "Conservative leader Kemi Badenoch said the investigation raised questions for the chancellor.",

      "Rachel Reeves has frequently cited her time at the Bank of England as part of the reason that voters can trust her with the public finances, and has repeatedly claimed to have spent up to 10 years there.",
      "The chancellor left the financial institution nine months earlier than she stated in her LinkedIn profile. This means she spent five and a half years working at the bank - including nearly a year studying - despite publicly claiming to have spent a decade there.",
      "On the professional networking site LinkedIn, the chancellor's profile claimed she worked at the Bank of England from September 2000 to December 2006.",
      "However, BBC News has established she had left by March 2006 when she began working for Halifax Bank of Scotland (HBOS) in West Yorkshire.",
      "A spokesman for Reeves confirmed that dates on her LinkedIn were inaccurate and said it was due to an administrative error by the team.",
      "They said the chancellor hadn't seen it before it was published.",
      "Speaking before the prime minister was interviewed, a Downing Street spokesman said the prime minister had no concerns about Reeves's conduct.",

The Chancellor and the prime minister are working hand in hand to deliver on the priorities, the plan for change, and to deliver the higher growth and the improvements in living standards that the country needs.\"",

      "The rest of the profile was subsequently edited to clarify the dates she worked at HBOS.",
      "A photo taken in March 2006 shows her with other HBOS staff at the Council of Mortgage Lenders annual lunch.",
      "A former HR lead for the bank who helped with Reeves's relocation also said she could recall her first day and it was in March 2006.",
      "In a 2021 magazine interview, which she subsequently posted on X, she said: \"I spent a decade working as an economist at the Bank of England and loved it.\"",
      "In a speech to the Labour Party Business Conference in February last year, Reeves said: \"I spent the best part of a decade as an economist at the Bank of England.\"",
      "She said the same thing in a speech at a CEO summit in July 2022, and in a video posted on her Facebook page in the same month.",
      "The claim was also repeated in a Labour party document last year which stated that she spent \"most of the first decade of her career at the Bank of England\".",
      "As she had already started at HBOS by the spring of 2006, her time at the central bank only amounted to five and a half years. This included nearly a year studying for a Masters at the London School of Economics (LSE).",
      "Last year, during previous controversy about Reeves's CV, the Bank of England confirmed that Reeves had left in 2006 but refused to give the month of her departure saying it was a detailed staff record which they couldn't provide.",
      "Reeves also stood for election in Bromley in south-east London more than three months after she had taken a job in West Yorkshire.",
      "She stood in a by-election on 29 June 2006 but had taken up a role at HBOS in March that year and received a relocation package to move from London. It is understood she rented a flat in Leeds and kept a flat in London at this time.",
      "The chancellor's online CV gives incorrect dates for her time at HBOS as well, which her team also acknowledged. It states that she left in December 2009, five months before she was elected to parliament in May 2010.",
      "In fact, we have established, her employment at HBOS finished in mid-May 2009, when she signed a compromise agreement. An invoice for legal advice on the agreement stated that it arose \"from a decision by your employer to terminate your employment\".",

      "The economy expanded by 0.1% between October and December, according to official figures, despite analysts predicting it would contract.",
      "Growth in the quarter was driven by a range of industries, from pubs and bars to machinery manufacturers, having a strong December.",
      "However, the figures also indicated living standards last year were slightly lower than in 2023 on average.",
      "With tax rises coming into force in April, concerns remain that economic growth will remain sluggish for sometime.",
      "Businesses have warned that paying more in National Insurance, along with minimum wages rising and business rates relief being reduced, could affect the economy's ability to grow, with employers expecting to have less cash to give pay rises and create new jobs.",
      "The Bank of England has also halved its growth forecast for the UK this year, amid concerns that higher costs for employers could hit hiring, profits, investment - and push up prices. Last week, it decided to cut interest rates to 4.5%.",
      "Paul Dales, chief UK economist at Capital Economics, said the economy was \"all-but stagnating\" as businesses adjusted for higher costs and \"more uncertainty overseas\" - pointing to the introduction of trade tariffs in the US by President Donald Trump.",
      "He said it was a clear that \"a lot of the weakness\" in the economy was due to the rise in taxes on firms announced by Chancellor Rachel Reeves in her Budget last year, with \"business sentiment on the floor\" and investment and consumer spending down.",
      "\"Overall, the economy is unlikely to do more than move sideways over the next six months,\" he suggested.",
      "How fast is the UK's economy growing?",

      "But the latest figures showing a return to growth at the end of 2024 will be welcome news for the government, which has made growing the economy its top priority in its effort to improve living standards.",
      "A separate figure from the Office for National Statistics (ONS) measuring living standards fell 0.1% in 2024 compared with the year before. The measure - known as real GDP per head - calculates the volume of goods and services available to the average person in the UK and a person is deemed better off the more they have.",
      "When an economy grows, businesses on average have more money to spend to employ more people or give pay rises. Firms making more profits also pay more in tax to the government, which can be spent on public services.",
      "All this together, in theory, leaves people better off - but it takes time for the benefits to be felt, and it does not necessarily benefit everyone.",
      "In December alone, the economy was estimated to have grown by 0.4%.",
      "Film distribution firms, pubs and bars all had a \"strong month\", as did industries involved in machinery manufacturing, according to Liz McKeown, director of economic statistics at the ONS.",
      "However, this was offset by weak months in trade for computer programming, publishing and car sales businesses.",
      "In the construction sector, the final months of 2024 saw an increase in new work driven by new private housing projects, but repairs and maintenance work from private homes fell over the period, suggesting homeowners cut back.",
      "'People don't have the money'",
      "Sushma Solanki, the owner of Bolton catering firm Sushma's Snacks, told the BBC the economic situation was \"very worrying\" as she found trading at the end of last year very tough.",
      "\"I normally do about 20 to 30 Christmas office events,\" she said. \"Instead, I did two, which was very hard. People don't have the money.\"",
      "She said she had to let go an employee partly because of the upcoming rise in National Insurance.",
      "\"It's not just the policies, it's everything. Peppers for my chicken dish started off at 79p, they are \u00a31.85,\" she added.",
      "Chris Taylor, the owner of coffee shop Gran T's in Manchester, said he was \"shocked\" that there had been any growth in the economy.",
      "\"Going into last winter was one of the biggest struggles. I think a lot of people were naturally clinging onto their purse strings. Trade was not there,\" he said.",
      "\"This government's action plan, without hitting people directly with higher taxes, is hitting the level above and that effectively is going to hit people one way or another. It is really an indirect punch to the whole economy.\"",
      "Following the release of the new figures, the chancellor said she was still not satisfied with the performance of the economy.",
      "\"It's not possible to turn around more than a decade of poor economic performance in just a few months, but we are doing what is necessary to bring stability to the economy,\" she said.",
      "Reeves also said the government was going \"further and faster\" to \"put more money in people's pockets\".",
      "She also reiterated her self-imposed rules on borrowing and debt were \"non-negotiable\" after reports this week suggested the government's official forecaster, the Office for Budget Responsibility, had downgraded growth forecasts.",
      "Shadow chancellor Mel Stride said Reeves's Budget was \"killing growth\" in the UK.",
      "\"Working people and businesses are already paying for her choices with ever rocketing taxes, hundreds of thousands of job cuts and business confidence plummeting,\" he added.",

      "\"Difficult issues that are part of the history and memory of our country cannot simply be remembered by a T-shirt, or a sticker sold on a street corner,\" says Juan Sebasti\u00e1n G\u00f3mez, Congress member and co-author of the bill.",
      "The proposed law would prohibit the selling, as well as the use and carrying of clothing and items promoting criminals, including Escobar. It would mean fines for  those who violated the rules, and a temporary suspension of businesses.",

      "\"This is terrible. We have a right to work, and these Pablo T-shirts especially always sell well,\" says Joana Montoya, who owns a stall stocked full of Escobar merchandise in Comuna 13, a popular tourist zone of Medell\u00edn.",
      "Medell\u00edn, Escobar's hometown, was known as \"the most dangerous city in the world\" in the late 80s and early 90s due to violence associated with drug wars and Colombia's armed conflict.",

      "\"We'd need a transition phase so that people could stop selling these products and replace them with other ones,\" explains Congressman G\u00f3mez.

      "Some of the T-shirts, sold for around \u00a35, bear a catchphrase linked to Escobar - \"silver or lead?\".  This symbolises the choice the cartel boss gave to those who posed a threat to his criminal operations: accept a bribe or be killed.",

      "Listen to Theo read this story",
      "For decades, car-making has been the jewel in Germany's industrial crown, a powerful symbol of the country's famous post-war economic miracle. Its \"Big Three\" brands, Volkswagen, Mercedes-Benz, and BMW, have long been praised for their performance, innovation and precision engineering. But today, the German motor industry is struggling. With the faltering economy a key factor in federal elections this month, how can it get back on the road to recovery?",
      "When you arrive by train in Wolfsburg, Lower Saxony, the first thing you see is the Volkswagen factory. Its huge facade, emblazoned with a giant VW logo and flanked by four tall chimneys, dominates one bank of the canal that runs through the city. The 6.5 sq km (2.5 sq mile) complex sits adjacent to the Autostadt, a kind of theme park devoted to the automobile and to VW, Europe's biggest carmaker. The Volkswagen Arena, a sports stadium, is a short distance away.",
      "Wolfsburg is Germany's answer to mid-20th Century Detroit - not so much a city with a car factory as a factory with a city that has grown up around it. Some 60,000 people from across the region work in the plant, while the town itself has a population of around 125,000. Locals say that even if you don't work in the factory yourself, it's certain many of your friends will, along with half of your class from school.",
      "\"Wolfsburg and Volkswagen - it's kind of a synonym,\" explains Dieter Landenberger, the VW Group's in-house historian, as he looks lovingly at an early model Beetle. It is one of an array of beautifully restored classic cars in the Zeithaus \u2013 a huge, glass-fronted museum in the Autostadt dedicated to icons of the motor industry.",
      "\"We're proud of the plant,\" he says. \"It is a symbol of that period in the 1950s when Germany had to reinvent itself and rebuild after the war. It was a kind of motor for the German economic miracle.\"",
      "Today, however, the plant has also come to symbolise some of the main problems affecting the German car industry as a whole. The Wolfsburg factory is capable of building 870,000 cars a year. But by 2023 it was making just 490,000, according to the Cologne-based German Economic Institute. And in Germany it is far from alone. Car factories across the country have been operating well below their maximum capacity. The number of cars produced in Germany declined from 5.65m in 2017 to 4.1m in 2023, according to the International Organisation of Motor Vehicle Manufacturers.",
      "All of this matters deeply as the German public prepares to go to the polls on 23 February. The car industry is not just a source of national pride; it is also a significant driver of national wealth. Disagreements over how to resolve the country's economic malaise were a factor in the collapse of the coalition government in November. Whoever is in power after the election will inevitably need a plan to revive the economy \u2013 and getting the motor industry back in gear is likely to play an important role.",
      "Car-making makes up about a fifth of the country's manufacturing output, and if the supply chain is taken into account, it generates around 6% of GDP, according to Capital Economics. The industry employs some 780,000 people directly \u2013 and supports millions of other jobs.",
      "It's not just production that is down. Sales of cars made by German brands are far lower than they were just a few years ago. Between 2017 and 2023, those of VW fell  from 10.7m to 9.2m, while over the same period BMW's went from 2.46m to 2.25m and Mercedes-Benz's went from 2.3m to 2.04m, company reports show.",
      "All of the Big Three saw their pre-tax profits fall by about a third in the first nine months of 2024, and each warned that their earnings for the year as a whole would be lower than previously forecast.",
      "The development of electric cars has sucked up huge investment, but the market for them hasn't grown as quickly as expected, while foreign competitors are flexing their muscles. The threat of tariffs being imposed by the US and other governments also looms large.",
      "\"There are so many crises, a whole world of crises. When one crisis is over, another is coming up,\" is how Simon Sh\u00fctz, a spokesman for the German Automotive Industry Federation (VDA) puts it.",
      "Car sales across Europe have been declining since 2017, according to Franziska Palmas, a senior Europe economist at Capital Economics. \"Lately they've recovered a bit, but they're still around 15 to 20% lower than they were at the peak in 2017,\" she says. \"That's partly due to factors like the pandemic, the energy crisis. But it's also cars lasting longer  - and people already have a lot of cars in Europe. So demand has been weak.\"",
      "Electric dreams",
      "Another key factor has been the aforementioned transition to electric cars. Since the diesel emissions scandal of 2015 \u2013 in which VW was found to have rigged emissions tests in the US \u2013 the industry has been undergoing a technological revolution.",
      "With the EU and European governments determined to phase out petrol and diesel cars over the next decade, manufacturers have had little choice but to invest tens, and collectively hundreds of billions of Euros on developing electric models and building new production lines.",
      "However, although electric cars do now make up a significant share of all cars sold \u2013 13.6% in the EU and 19.6% in the UK last year, for example \u2013 their market share has not been growing as quickly as anticipated.",
      "And in Germany itself, the sudden removal of generous subsidies for electric car buyers in late 2023 actually contributed to a dramatic 27% fall in sales of all electric cars within the country last year, making life still more difficult for German firms in their home market.",
      "\"The decision to drop subsidies suddenly \u2013 that was very bad, because it undermined trust among our customers,\" says the VDA's Simon Sch\u00fctz.",
      "\"Going from the combustion engine to electric mobility is very big process. We are investing billions in rebuilding all the factories. And so that takes some time, there's no question about it.\"",
      "An expensive business",
      "While all of this has been going on, German manufacturers have also been grappling with another serious concern. Doing business in Germany itself, operating factories here and employing hundreds of thousands of people, is very expensive.",
      "Workers in the automotive sector have traditionally enjoyed generous pay and benefits thanks to agreements drawn up between unions and management. According to Capital Economics, in 2023 the average monthly base salary in the German auto industry was about \u20ac5,300, compared with \u20ac4,300 across the German economy as a whole.",
      "For years, this approach gave German-based companies certain advantages, for example in avoiding industrial unrest and in attracting and retaining talented staff. However, it also led to German car manufacturers having the highest labour costs in the global industry. In 2023, these averaged \u20ac62 per hour, compared to \u20ac29 in Spain and \u20ac20 in Portugal, according to the VDA.",
      "The situation for Germany's domestic car industry became more acute following Russia's invasion of Ukraine. This choked off Germany's once-abundant supplies of cheap Russian gas, at the very time when the country was phasing out nuclear power.",
      "The result was a sharp increase in energy prices. Although they have since subsided, energy costs for industrial users in Germany remain very high by international standards. \"Energy prices here are three to five times higher than in the US, or in China \u2013 much higher than for our main competitors,\" says Mr Sch\u00fctz.",
      "And this is being felt across the industry, not just at the carmakers themselves. \"From the Thysenkrupp and Salzgitter steel mills producing the sheet metal rolls that are later turned into doors and bonnets, to makers of smaller components used in drivetrains, costs have exploded as a result of high energy prices,\" says Matthias Schmidt of Schmidt Automotive Research.",
      "'A very big shock'",
      "Last year these pressures came to a head. At VW, which has 45% of its global staff in Germany, managers finally decided radical action was needed to bring down costs.",
      "\"It was a very big shock,\" IG Metall union spokesman Steffen Schmidt tells me over a cup of coffee near the VW factory in Wolfsburg. \"The company didn't say anything publicly.\"",
      "It was left to Daniela Cavallo, head of the powerful VW works council and the top employees' representative, to deliver the news. \"They held a big meeting outside the gates of the factory. Thousands of workers \u2013 and you could have heard a pin drop,\" says Mr Schmidt.",
      "\"They were stunned. Thousands of people, all completely silent.\"",
      "What VW proposed was unprecedented. Union representatives had come to meetings expecting to negotiate an annual pay rise. They were asking for a 7% boost. Instead, they were told, the company needed them to take a 10% pay cut.",
      "Worse was to follow. The company said it might have to close up to three of its factories within Germany itself \u2013 and was tearing up a job security agreement that had been in place for decades.",
      "Arne Meiswinkel, VW's chief negotiator, said at the time that the situation it faced in Germany was \"very serious\" and that \"Volkswagen will only be able to prevail if we future-proof the company now in the face of rising costs and the massive increase in competition\".",
      "Volkswagen had never previously closed a German factory in its 87-year history. In the face of intense opposition from unions and politicians, and following short but disruptive \"warning strikes\" by unionised workers, the idea was ultimately shelved. But the very fact it had been put forward sent a seismic shock through the entire sector.",
      "In the meantime, the workforce did agree to painful limits on pay and bonuses, and VW said it would cut more than 35,000 jobs by the end of the decade, albeit in a \"socially responsible manner\" that avoided compulsory redundancies.",
      "Less conspicuously, Mercedes-Benz also launched a cost-cutting drive last year, aimed at saving several billion euros annually - albeit compulsory redundancies in the German workforce are highly unlikely, as a job security agreement effectively rules them out until 2030. Meanwhile Ford, which operates two factories in Germany, recently announced plans to cut 2,800 jobs in the country.",
      "Not all of the German car industry's problems are confined to Germany itself. With the European market saturated, for several decades the continent's manufacturers have looked for growth elsewhere.",
      "The impact of China",
      "One of the most lucrative markets has been China, where for a while the growing middle class had an apparently insatiable appetite for upmarket European vehicles. VW, Mercedes-Benz and BMW all teamed up with local businesses, setting up factories in China itself to meet local demand.",
      "But now that source of growth is drying up. The Big Three have all seen sales fall recently  \u2013 in 2023 VW's China sales were down 9.5% on the previous year, Mercedes-Benz's by 7% and BMW's by 13.4%. Their combined share of the Chinese market has shrunk as well to 18.7%, from a peak of 26.2% in 2019. This appears to be the result of a slowing Chinese economy, falling interest in expensive, foreign-badged cars and the rapid growth of local marques, especially in the electric car market.",
      "\"Not that long ago, Western brands represented quality and trust,\" explains Mark Rainford, founder of the Inside China Auto website. However, he says, since then the reputation and appeal of Chinese brands has improved beyond recognition.",
      "All of the Big Three say trends in China have had a significant impact on their earnings.",
      "Chinese brands are also attempting to build a share of the European market, helped by their much lower operating costs than more established rivals, both because wages are lower in China and because, as pure EV firms, they don't have the same legacy costs carried by manufacturers making the transition from petrol and diesel to battery-powered cars.",
      "According to the European Commission, Chinese brands also benefit from hefty government subsidies, which allow them to sell cars at artificially low prices. In October, the EU introduced extra tariffs on imports of Chinese-made EVs, in an effort to create a more level playing field.",
      "Trade wars?",
      "German firms opposed the EU tariffs, because they feared retaliation from China could affect their own exports. Now they also face the threat of new protectionist measures being introduced by the Trump administration, including possible tariffs on cars shipped from the EU. For an industry that relies heavily on exports, the rise of protectionism is a growing threat.",
      "\"We know that trade wars only create losers on both sides. Tariffs will cost wealth, cost growth and cost jobs,\" says the VDA's Simon Sch\u00fctz.",
      "Although some of the pressures facing Germany's car companies were not foreseeable, there was still an element of complacency, believes analyst Matthias Schmidt: \"They knew the structural issues were there, but were blindsided by cheap Russian gas,\" he says.",
      "\"The expansion to China and the high profits being shipped back to Europe plastered over the high labour cost issues, giving unions a joker card to play with.",
      "\"Germany has effectively been an export-driven market, and once those markets sneeze, Germany catches a cold, which is what's happened.\"",
      "A high-stakes challenge",
      "So can Germany's carmakers revive their fortunes? It is a vital question for the manufacturers, for their networks of suppliers and for the country as a whole.",
      "\"The problem for Germany is we are not competitive,\" says Dr Ferdinand Dudenh\u00f6ffer, head of the Bochum-based Center for Automotive Research. \"Not just in cost terms, but also in terms of the new technologies which will run the world in future\".",
      "He thinks China has become the centre of gravity for innovation in areas such as digitisation and battery technology. \"The solution for the carmakers and for the suppliers, in my view, will be that they take their factories abroad,\" he says.",
      "The Debate: Do Trump's tariffs mean the end of the post-war free trade world?",
      "Why more young men in Germany are turning to the far right",
      "How Jaguar lost its way - long before that polarising advert",
      "Simon Sch\u00fctz is more optimistic. He thinks the industry can prosper, but only if it gets the support it needs from the government after the elections later this month.",
      "\"Our automotive industry will be world-leading, I am sure of that,\" he says.",
      "\"The question is, where will the future jobs be? Will they be in Germany, because we can build cars here, or will our companies go elsewhere?'",
      "For union rep Steffen Schmidt, however, the solution is to go back to Germany's traditional industrial values. \"We have to become a leader in innovation and technology again,\" he says. \"Then we can keep high pay and good conditions for workers.\"",
      "He thinks the path ahead for the new government is very clear: \"Invest, invest, invest. In infrastructure, in technology, in green energy and in education.\"",
      "For tens of thousands of workers in Wolfsburg, and in Germany's other \"car towns\" such as Ingolstadt, Weissach, Munich, Stuttgart and Zwickau, the stakes could not be higher.",

    "story": [
      "Growing up, Samuel Weidenhofer struggled with his mental health after losing his aunt to suicide when he was nine, experiencing a speech impediment, and being bullied.",
      "The trauma of it all made him want to end his own life, he says. When he was 17, he says he decided to turn to social media to spread a positive message.",
      "\"It started with simple things like giving people hugs in public and giving out roses and flowers and things that would make people smile,\" says Weidenhofer, now 21, and living in Melbourne, Australia.",
      "The difference was Weidenhofer filmed these acts and shared them across his social media accounts. The content spiralled and four years later, on Instagram alone he has amassed 1.7 million followers, where he can be seen surprising a person with a serious illness with money or a visit from a celebrity such as Jake Paul or Kristen Bell.",
      "\"I hope my videos inspire someone just a little bit,\" he says.",
      "Kindness content creators, or influencers as they're often called, are increasing in numbers on social media.",
      "Their approaches differ but a common tactic is to secretly film someone being given money, or tickets to a gig or sports match, or perhaps a free haircut.",
      "\"Kindness is cool,\" says Zachery Dereniowski, 31, in the bio of his Instagram account where he has 5.7 million followers.",
      "Mr Dereniowski's videos often involve him telling a stranger that he is hungry and asking for food. When the person helps him out, he rewards the person with a gift, such as a laptop, or money.",
      "\"I suppose I want to really emphasise that every single person you come across has a story\u2026 and often the people who have the least give the most,\" says Mr Dereniowski, who lives in Windsor, near Toronto in Canada, and started the account after giving free hugs to strangers.",
      "Like many influencers, the kindness creators make money from adverts and sponsorship from the brands they work with. For example they might do a deal that involves giving away a particular brand's product.",
      "The videos of kindness content creators attract millions of views. Why are they so popular?",
      "Saoirse Cleary, creative strategy director at marketing agency MG Empower, says they incorporate many of the elements that both social media algorithms and audiences favour: strong hooks, engaging captions, heartfelt narratives, and authentic, unscripted moments.",
      "\"Audiences are captivated by raw, real interactions with everyday people, offering an emotional connection from the comfort of their own screens. People increasingly seek positivity, authenticity, and emotional resonance in their online experiences, especially in spaces often saturated with entertainment-driven content.\"",
      "On the face of it the acts seem well meaning, so why do they attract criticism?",
      "\"\"While these influencers may be genuinely generous... the generosity can sometimes feel performative, as it often serves as a way to attract more views, engagement, and ultimately financial reward, rather than purely altruistic motives,\" says Ms Cleary.",
      "Others go further, questing whether focussing on one, usually vulnerable person, is the right way to help out.",
      "\"I find the typical set up of many of the scenes quite disturbing,\" says Hilda Burke, a psychotherapist, accredited with the British Association for Counselling and Psychotherapy.",
      "She explains that the videos often involve someone being identified as \"in need\". They are then asked for a favour. It might be spare money for a bus fare or help with something.",
      "She argues the participant is being \"lured\" into valuing the needs of someone else, who appears richer, more highly than their own.",
      "Only if they do that are they rewarded.",
      "\"I wonder what happens to those who don't play the game?,\" asks Ms Burke.",
      "The influencers defend themselves by arguing that using social media this way is an effective strategy.",
      "\"I can raise more money, so I can help more people if I post it online,\" says Mr Weidenhofer.",
      "And how about filming people without their consent?",
      "\"If you are doing a video where you're giving a hug to someone, if you tell them beforehand, it just takes away that authenticity,\" says Mr Weidenhofer.",
      "But he adds that these days he avoids filming people without consent as it was making him \"feel weird\".",
      "Sometimes large amounts of money are given to vulnerable people, which they might not be in a position to manage.",

    "title": "Do Trump's tariffs mean the end of the post-war free trade world?",
    "published": "Tue, 11 Feb 2025 01:05:54 GMT",
    "summary": "President Trump has proposed a sweeping set of tariffs. Does this mark the end of the post-war free trade world?",
    "story": [
      "President Trump's sweeping set of tariffs is intended, in part, to protect American industries, raise money and - as we've seen - be used as a bargaining chip.",
      "The Republican has already imposed tariffs on imports from China, announced plans for a 25% duty on all steel and aluminium imports, and threatened to place 25% tariffs on Canada and Mexico. We don't yet know how far he will go, but if what is already on the table comes to pass then it would raise average tariffs to their highest since the 1940s, signalling a new chapter for global trade.",
      "Since the end of World War Two in 1945, tariffs have been broadly viewed as leading to higher consumer prices, less choice and \u2013 amidst the inevitable retaliation -  backfiring on the industries they were meant to protect. But are we turning our backs on this era?",
      "I hosted a debate with two economic experts in trade policy to unpick the implications of Trump's policies on America and the world, and explore differing views on who among us might be the biggest winners or losers.",
      "Meet the participants",
      "Meredith Crowley is Professor of Economics at the University of Cambridge. She believes tariffs could lead to a much heavier economic burden on the lowest income people.",
      "Jeff Ferry is Chief Economist Emeritus at the Coalition for A Prosperous America. He believes tariffs can trigger growth and rebuild the US manufacturing industry.",
      "Trump's ambitions",
      "Dharshini David (DD): President Trump described tariffs as \"the most beautiful word in the dictionary\" - which is really intriguing. What's the attraction for him?",
      "Jeff Ferry (JF): I think Trump has made it pretty clear that he thinks tariffs are a 'beautiful' thing for several reasons.",
      "Firstly, because they can revive and rebuild the US manufacturing industry. He also sees the US is running a huge trade deficit. In 2024, we had a record goods trade deficit of $1.2 trillion which means the rest of the world, and particularly trade surplus countries, is generating large amounts of revenue by selling to the US market. This gives the US a powerful negotiating tool and we've seen him use that, regarding drugs and immigration with Canada and Mexico in the last few days.",
      "Meredith Crowley (MC): My presumption is that what is really concerning Trump is the decline in manufacturing jobs within the United States over the last 40 years.",
      "He observed that lots of jobs that used to exist in the US have migrated to other lower wage countries like Mexico and China and I think his hope would be that by imposing tariffs he could stimulate the creation of jobs.",
      "Retaliation",
      "DD: We know countries are thinking of retaliatory measures as well. To what extent will these measures impact Trump's economic goals?",
      "JF: There is no doubt that a tariff policy, coupled with an investment and growth strategy policy and a national security policy, will grow the US economy and do a better job of delivering productivity growth than we've seen in the last 25 years, which frankly have been abysmal by traditional US standards.",
      "Five hundred years of history shows that the economics profession, in its obsession with short term equilibrium, has done a disservice to not just American workers and the American people, but actually, to British people and British workers - and workers in many countries.",
      "DD: In the post-war era, we saw the tearing down of trade barriers and the idea that globalisation was good. Are we now seeing a backlash against this?",
      "JF: We are seeing a historic shift away from the post WW2 consensus, which stemmed from the period when America was way ahead of the rest of the world - and America was very worried about the Communist threat.",
      "So what you call 'free trade,' and I would call the Bretton Woods fixed exchange rate consensus, was designed for America to support and even subsidise the growth of European economies and other economies.",
      "We've now moved to a new stage where it's well known the US economy started to falter in the 1970s, and China has risen to become the world's number one manufacturing power basically through exploiting all the rules in the system.",
      "We need a new system.",
      "MC: I have a different diagnosis of what happened in recent history.",
      "Over the past 40 years, it's clear more protection is very popular. Between 1981 and 1994, the US restricted imports of automobiles from Japan and that ultimately had two consequences.",
      "One, it raised the price of automobiles for Americans. Two, in the long run, it led to investment by Japanese manufacturers in the US, and today, the US has a vibrant automobile industry.  You could support US industry much more directly by having direct government support.",
      "Trump has now created uncertainty that Canadian manufacturers will have access to the US market in the future. And because Trump made good on his threats in 2018 to impose tariffs on China, major corporations might be revising plans to expand operations in Canada or Mexico to serve the US market. There will be a pullback on real economic activity in those trading partners.",
      "Higher prices",
      "DD: Meredith, Trump has acknowledged there may be 'a little pain' for Americans in the short term because as you mentioned, tariffs tend to mean higher prices.",
      "MC:  A study on what happened in round one of Trump's tariffs on China in 2018 showed, in the first two years, that most of the cost increase was absorbed by importers and distributors and it didn't get passed on to consumers. The price increases though, tend to come more gradually.",
      "Once you realise the tariff is in place permanently, the manufacturer realises everyone's going to have to pay it and they gradually raise their prices.",
      "One of the concerns economists have is people who buy a lot of goods rather than services tend to be lower income people. So when you put a tariff on things like kids' trainers, backpacks and clothing, these kinds of consumer items, you're really placing a much heavier tax burden on the lowest income people in the country, rather than somebody who's spending their money on vacations and private education for children.",
      "Trade war",
      "DD: Jeff, are you concerned about a global trade war that could backfire on Trump's aims?",
      "JF: We have been in a trade war since 2001, since China entered the world trading community. The trade war is long-standing. Now America is taking action and a lot of people are throwing up their hands, not because they are concerned about a trade war, but because they're concerned they might lose a valuable market for their own products.",
      "But I want to go back to consumer prices.",
      "People focus purely on the negative. The purpose of the tariff is to stimulate domestic industry, so on the positive side, you create brand new investments in domestic industry. On the negative side you get a price increase. So it depends critically on the numbers in both cases.",
      "What we know from round one of Trump's tariffs, between 2018 and 2019, is the price of tariff goods went up, such as steel, but companies committed to building new factories like steel mills which have hired several hundreds of people - great blue collar jobs for people who generally speaking do not have a college degree.",
      "The current phase of globalisation which began around 1990 was just a huge mistake. The idea that the US could compete with Mexico on salaries, particularly to manufacturing workers, was just crazy.",
      "DD: Lets get Meredith's view on this. Would you agree that for higher wage economies, frankly, globalisation has not been a great idea since the 1990s?",
      "MC: I understand Jeff's point, that the only concern of the president should be the wellbeing of Americans. But, between 1990 and 2023, the number of people around the world living in extreme poverty on less than $2.15 (\u00a31.75) a day fell from two billion to around 700 million. Over a billion people exiting poverty because of increasing globalisation is an astounding achievement of humanity.",

      "Faisal Islam: The 'Iron Chancellor' will have to flex to get the growth she wants",
      "'Not the ministry of fun': Troubling issues clatter onto Yvette Cooper's desk",
      "It is completely clear to everyone that within American society the benefits of globalisation have not been equal and so there is a real need within the US to think about how do we improve the wellbeing of less skilled people, and how do we get jobs into the economy to help them.",
      "Where I differ with Trump is I think there are more effective tools. You need an industrial policy or subsidies to production. American productivity is so high because we are constantly investing in labour saving technology but the consequence is that the less skilled have been left behind and their lives are materially worse than they were thirty years ago.",
      "JF: I agree one hundred percent with Meredith.",
      "Equality",
      "DD: This is fascinating. If we see the kind of trade barriers that Trump wants to put in place, what does that mean for this issue of equality?",
      "MC: Once you start putting barriers between countries you create a lot of opportunity for what in the economics world we call monopoly profits. Once you limit entry, the existing producers get to jack up their prices and exploit consumers.",
      "If the US goes into a trade war with China, what's going to happen to imports from countries the US isn't interested in having a trade war with?",
      "If the US and China deepen their trade war, this could affect the supply chain participation of sub-Saharan African countries with the US and China, meaning it is going to be one of the areas of the world that bears some of the brunt of this trade war.",
      "So the spillover effects could be very, very negative.",
      "DD:  Jeff, is this a price worth paying? What kind of impact could we see on growth?",
      "JF: I don't think of it as a price worth paying, I think of it as an evolution of the world system where hopefully we'll get higher growth everywhere. And this is where I differ with the mainstream economics view which focuses far too much on trade and on minor productivity gains.",
      "The world has grown through the success of industries. The US prosperity from 1900 to 1970 was due largely to the automobile industry. What you saw was huge productivity gains as Henry Ford and all his successors invented and developed mass production. You saw wage increases and spending increases and we had the most prosperous economy in the world.",
      "So what we need is industrial growth and when you look at a national security framework, we cannot be dependent on China for as many goods as we are today. We are far too dependent on China here in the United States, Europe is far too dependent on China. So what's the resolution? Well the resolution is pretty obvious - we need to make certain goods here in the US.",

      "The Institute for Fiscal Studies (IFS) said there could be 90,000 fewer pupils in the country's classrooms by 2040 - and suggested that teacher numbers could be cut as a result.",
      "The group said this could eventually free up \u00a3500m per year, but the government has flatly rejected the idea.",
      "Teaching unions have hit out too, with the EIS saying cutting teacher numbers \"lacks any educational rationale\" and the NASUWT calling it a \"false economy\" that would damage life chances and Scotland's future prosperity.",
      "But when you consider the falling birth rate and demographic changes alongside the need to get the maximum benefit out of every pound spent on services, is it time to talk about teacher numbers?",
      "School staffing is a frequent topic of dispute between politicians - usually in terms of demands for more of them, not fewer.",
      "The SNP pledged in its 2021 manifesto to increase teacher numbers by 3,500.",
      "So when it was revealed in December that the figure had actually fallen, opposition leaders were quick to give the first minister a hard time about it.",
      "John Swinney pledged to get teacher numbers back to 2023 levels, and keeping them there is the government's new goal.",
      "But pupil numbers are already starting to plateau, and are projected to drop sharply over the coming decades.",
      "That's why the Institute for Fiscal Studies argues that perhaps it would be OK to allow teacher numbers to go down in line with that, rather than holding them at 2023 levels.",
      "The government has flatly rejected the report's conclusions.",
      "But much of the picture it paints is actually pretty positive.",
      "The IFS underlines that class sizes in Scotland are smaller than those elsewhere in the UK - averaging about 13 pupils per teacher, compared with 17 to 19 pupils per teacher down south.",
      "Spending per pupil is also rising, and is the highest in the UK - 20% higher than it is in England.",
      "But on both counts that can be explained in part by the number of pupils rising far more sharply south of the border. Scotland is set to have the opposite problem.",
      "The stickiest issue for the government is that these smaller class sizes and higher spending hasn't necessarily led to notably better outcomes.",
      "Scotland's struggle in international comparisons of school performance has been well documented. There has been a long-term decline in reading, maths and science, and Covid has hardly helped.",
      "The gap in attainment between pupils from more and less affluent backgrounds also remains stubbornly unclosed, almost a decade on from it being made the government's \"number one priority\".",
      "The IFS argument is that continuing to plough money into school staffing against a backdrop of falling school rolls isn't the most cost-effective way to improve things.",
      "Pupil numbers are projected to fall by 90,000 by 2040. If teacher numbers hold steady at 2023 levels, then the pupil-teacher ratio will fall closer to 12 - the lowest ever.",
      "But IFS research economist Darcey Snape says smaller class sizes \"only tend to have modest effects on pupil attainment\".",
      "Her analysis suggests that letting teacher numbers fall could free up funds - up to \u00a3500m per year by 2040 - either for other areas of schooling, or indeed for other badly-stretched budgets such as social care.",
      "Ms Snape accepts there would inevitably be \"practical difficulties\", like amalgamating classes and schools as rolls fall - but says local councils are arguably best placed to make these decisions, \"rather than applying a one-size-fits-all approach across Scotland\".",
      "The latter point is already the subject of some dispute between schools and councils.",
      "Ultimately councils are the employers, and control the overall numbers - the government can only enforce its policy by holding carrots and sticks over them.",
      "Education Secretary Jenny Gilruth has clashed with council leaders by threatening to withdraw funding which was offered on the basis of keeping numbers at 2023 levels.",
      "A deal has just been struck with Glasgow City Council, which was planning on cutting 450 posts over a three-year period - which in turn had led to strike threats from unions.",
      "Groups representing teachers are predictably negative about the IFS's report, calling it a \"false economy\" and a \"race to the bottom\".",
      "The EIS and NASUWT say things aren't as straightforward in schools as the report might make out.",
      "Both make the point that the number of pupils with additional support needs has risen to record levels. They need more support, not less, and cutting teacher numbers would \"further entrench existing inequalities\" in their prospects.",
      "They also point to the fact teachers already have \"excessive workloads and working hours\", and face issues with anti-social behaviour and even violence in classrooms.",
      "It is absolutely fair to argue that long-term planning needs to be done, to take account of shifting demographics.",
      "The ever-increasing strain on care services provides a prime example of why we need to be ready for the ways in which society will change.",
      "Perhaps we do need to have a grown-up debate about the best and most cost-effective way to improve outcomes in schools.",
      "But when the headline is getting rid of teachers, it's always going to be difficult to sell the idea to politicians who face an election in just over a year.",
      "The Scottish government has already flatly rejected the idea, saying teachers play a central role in driving improvements in schools.",
      "And as noted above, opposition parties are chiefly interested in holding ministers to account on their promised increases. Nobody is going to put cutting teacher numbers on a leaflet.",
      "And it's particularly tough to get MSPs to stick their necks out when we're talking about something which will be an issue in 2040, which feels pretty distant.",
      "But a year is famously a long time in politics, and 15 of them is an eternity. Look back 15 years and Gordon Brown was prime minister and the SNP were being propped up by the Conservatives at Holyrood.",
      "If one thing is guaranteed, it's change; it's incredibly unlikely that we will reach 2040 with the current policy structure intact.",

      "BBC Verify looks at how the government is getting on with these pledges.",
      "The economy",
      "Starmer made a pledge to increase the amount of money that households have.",
      "The government is using several measures to track this.",
      "The first is GDP per head - that's the size of the economy divided by the population.",

      "When will we know? RHDI figures come out about three months after the end of each quarter of the year. GDP per capita figures are published about six weeks after the end of each quarter. Regional GDP per capita is only released once a year, about 16 months after the end of the year it measures.",

      "At a constant annual rate, that would equate to 300,000 per year,",
      "The most recent official data shows that 221,070 net additional dwellings were delivered in 2023-24, a decline of 6% on the previous year.",
      "Labour is bringing in new housing targets for local councils in England, which the previous government dropped and is reforming planning laws to try to accelerate building.",
      "But many housing experts remain sceptical about the feasibility of Labour\u2019s target given the lack of affordability of new housing, which has put off many buyers and deterred private developers from investing.",
      "Official data also shows that the number of housing projects given the go-ahead by councils in England reached a record low in the final months of the last government, mainly because of a decline in applications from builders.",

      "Sitting down to a watch a soap for the first time, I was unsure what to expect. I had never heard anyone my age talk about them before and navigating to ITVX and having to sit through three minutes of adverts was a very different experience from what I'm used to.",

      "\"The other award I won for this was the London Film Critics prize, so I must be living in the wrong country,\" he joked.",
      "\"My background is as a playwright, and when one of my plays transferred to the West End it was far more popular. I don't know what it is, maybe I'm a novelty here and in America I'm boring.\"",

      "\"That's the closeness with which you imagine we live.\"",
      "4. Zoe Salda\u00f1a enjoyed 'jumping into the unknown'",

      "(Everyone was feeling sweaty backstage by this point.)",
      "Asked about the moment he heard he was this year's winner, Davis said: \"I was on the toilet when I found out!",
      "\"[Bafta] notified me by email, and I do most of my administration work on the toilet. I might call it paperwork but then you'd get the wrong idea,\" he jokes.",
      "\"Then I got an email from Bafta saying I'd won the fellowship, and I got all excited, and then it suddenly dawned on me, is this a fake email? Some sort of scam?",

      "\"I'm just so grateful to have had this meaningful opportunity come my way, I've been yearning for this for a long time.",
      "\"I've been working very hard. It's not for a lack of hard work, but there are so many magical things that have to happen for a film to achieve greatness and I'm so happy that all of those things conspired on The Brutalist.\"",

      "He likens the cast of Pope drama Conclave, which includes Stanley Tucci, Ralph Fiennes and Isabella Rossellini, to an orchestra.",
      "\"No-one really knows [why a cast works so well], but you have a hunch, so there's a lot of discussion - we put pictures up on the wall and it just felt like a good combination,\" he explained.",

      "8. Brady Corbet is optimistic for the film industry",
      "The Brutalist's Brady Corbet might have won best director, but he said he was slightly too \"jet-lagged and exhausted\" to fully process it.",
      "As much as he's enjoying awards season, he notes: \"It'll be amazing when it's done, I'm looking forward to getting back to work.\"",
      "Corbet is not shy of hard work - making the Brutalist was famously a labour of love which took several years. \"We basically just didn't sleep,\" he says. \"I haven't had a day off in years.\"",
      "Now that awards campaigning is in its final phase however, with voting for the Oscars closing on Monday, he should finally get some down time. \"The week leading up to the Oscars is actually pretty quiet, I'm looking forward to it.\"",
      "The Brutalist, a 3.5-hour film with an intermission, has been a relative box office success despite its intimidating duration.",
      "\"I'm not trying to teach anyone a lesson or anything,\" he says, \"but I do think it's good for the ecosystem that a film like this which is completely uncompromised - I don't like too many cooks in my kitchen - for that to have made $30m globally so far, that's exciting.",
      "\"All the things you're told not to do, when those films are proven to be commercially viable, and people want original, daring movies, it makes me feel more optimistic than usual.'\"",

      "Pope drama Conclave and immigration epic The Brutalist walked away with some of the biggest prizes at the Bafta film awards on Sunday.",
      "Conclave, made by German director Edward Berger, picked up four awards in total including best film and best British film; the first time a movie has won both in the same year since the 2019 war drama, 1917. It also won best adapted screenplay and best editing.",
      "US filmmaker Brady Corbet's The Brutalist also won four - Corbet picked up best director while Adrien Brody won best actor for his portrayal of Hungarian architect and Holocaust survivor,  L\u00e1szl\u00f3 T\u00f3th. The film also won best original score and cinematography.",

      "Anora, about a New York stripper who has a whirlwind romance with the son of a Russian oligarch, had been picking up best picture momentum ahead of the Oscars next month - but instead came away with best actress and best casting.",
      "The best actress win for Madison was something of a surprise, despite her impressive performance in Sean Baker's film. Madison herself, on accepting the prize, said: \"Wow, I really wasn't expecting this. I probably should have listened to my publicist  and written a speech or something!\"",
      "The 25-year-old starred in US comedy series Better Things and also had roles in Quentin Tarantino's Once Upon a Time in Hollywood and horror film Scream. But her leading role in Anora has catapulted her into the spotlight.",
      "Madison added: \"I want to take a moment to recognise the sex worker community. I see you, you deserve respect and human decency. I will always be an ally and a friend.\"",
      "Demi Moore, who stars in body horror The Substance, has been picking up best actress prizes in the last couple of months, including at the Golden Globes and Critics Choice Awards.",
      "Many thought she would win the Bafta, too. She will still be a favourite at the Oscars although Madison's Bafta win does make things more interesting.",
      "The Substance only picked up one win on Sunday for make-up and hair. The film sees a TV aerobics presenter in her 50s (Moore) who takes a black-market drug to create a younger, more beautiful version of herself. Full of gory effects, the film is the favourite to pick up the same prize at next month's Oscars.",

      "Conclave, about a a gossipy and scheming group of cardinals who gather in Rome to elect a new Pope, which stars Ralph Fiennes, had led the charge with 12 nominations.",
      "Berger said he was \"deeply moved\" to win best film, and that winning outstanding British film, was \"a huge, huge honour\".",
      "\"Best British and I'm not even from here, so I feel so welcome in your midst,\" he added.",
      "Bafta rules state that films in this category \"must have significant creative involvement by individuals who are British\".",
      "Berger added that we \"live in a time of a crisis of democracy\", and ended his speech by quoting Leonard Cohen, saying: \"There's a crack in everything, that's how the light gets in.\"",
      "Brody, collecting his best actor win, told the audience The Brutalist \"is really about the pursuit of leaving something meaningful\", while Corbet said he was \"humbled and very grateful\".",
      "The ceremony was hosted by David Tennant at London's Royal Festival Hall. The actor wore a kilt and opened the ceremony by belting out The Proclaimers' classic song, I'm Gonna Be (500 Miles), joined by other stars including James McAvoy and Colman Domingo.",
      "In what has been an unpredictable awards season, the Baftas followed a similar pattern, with no single film sweeping the board, and several movies sharing the spoils.",
      "This was the third year in a row that no British stars won any of the four acting prizes at the most prestigious night in the British film calendar.",
      "Films that had multiple nominations but lost out on the night included A Complete Unknown, the Bob Dylan biopic starring Timoth\u00e9e Chalamet, Nosferatu, Blitz, Gladiator II and The Apprentice.",

      "Emilia P\u00e9rez, the French-made film, about a dangerous Mexican drug lord who decides to leave the world of crime and live a new life as a woman, has been the subject of controversy in recent weeks. Offensive social media posts by its star, Karla Sof\u00eda Gasc\u00f3n, were unearthed.",
      "Some wondered if the saga would affect its chances. With 11 nominations, it ended up winning best international film alongside Zoe Salda\u00f1a's win. She is now a favourite to replicate her Bafta win at next month's Oscars.",
      "On accepting the international film prize, the film's director, Jacques Audiard, thanked the cast, including Gascon, as did Salda\u00f1a.",
      "Kieran Culkin's win for a A Real Pain was widely expected. The award was collected by his co-star and the film's writer and director, Jesse Eisenberg.",
      "Eisenberg's film, about two cousins who explore their Jewish grandmother's roots in Poland, also picked up the award for best original screenplay.",
      "Actor and TV presenter Warwick Davis was awarded the Bafta Fellowship, the highest honour bestowed by the British Academy. He thanked his mother - his \"first agent\" and his \"wonderful wife Sammy who died almost a year ago\".",
      "The In Memoriam segment, which honours those from the film community who we have lost in the past year, paid tribute to the likes of Dame Maggie Smith, James Earl Jones, David Lynch, Dame Joan Plowright and Donald Sutherland.",
      "Other winners included Denis Villeneuve's Dune Part 2, which won special effects and sound.",
      "Blockbuster musical film Wicked won best production design for Brits Nathan Crowley and Lee Sandales. It was Crowley's first Bafta and his sixth nomination, although Sandales has won twice previously. It also picked up best costume design.",
      "Aardman's latest Wallace and Gromit film, Vengeance Most Fowl, won best animation - perhaps surprisingly, it's the first time they have won this award. They also picked up the inaugural award for best children and family film.",
      "West Belfast rap group Kneecap won the Bafta for outstanding debut by a British writer, director or producer.",
      "The Irish-language film is based on a semi-fictionalised account of how the band was formed.",
      "The film's English director, Rich Peppiatt, said on accepting the prize: \"Kneecap is more than a film, it's a movement,\" adding that everyone should have their language and culture respected.",
      "Super/Man: The Christopher Reeve story, a film about the life of the Superman star who was paralysed in a horse riding accident 10  years before his death in 2004, won best documentary. His children took to the stage to honour their late father.",

      "She added she hoped her silence would \"allow the film to be appreciated for what it is, a beautiful ode to love and difference\".",
      "Her statement followed an interview the film's director Jacques Audiard gave to Deadline, in which he condemned Gasc\u00f3n's tweets and said he was no longer in contact with her.",
      "Netflix had not publicly commented before Bajaria's interview, but the streamer had altered the film's awards campaign following the controversy.",
      "Changing the promotional posters",
      "At this time of year, film studios take out advertisements intended to make a particular film more visible to awards voters.",
      "The movie will have already have had a separate promotional push at the time of its release, targeted at the public in the hope of securing high box office or streaming numbers.",
      "But the For Your Consideration (FYC) adverts which run during awards season are specifically intended to draw awards voters' attention to the categories the film has been nominated in at events such as the Baftas and Oscars.",
      "Previously, Gasc\u00f3n featured prominently in Netflix's publicity material, which reminded voters that she was nominated for best leading actress.",
      "But an updated FYC poster released last week almost entirely erased Gasc\u00f3n, instead making her co-stars Zoe Salda\u00f1a and Selena Gomez much more prominent.",
      "\"The shift suggests Netflix is trying to minimize Gasc\u00f3n's contributions so that the controversy around her remarks won't overshadow the film or the work of her co-stars and collaborators,\" suggested Variety's Clayton Davis.",
      "The CNN interview",
      "Gasc\u00f3n released several statements following the controversy, mostly via her social media accounts.",
      "But she also gave an emotional, hour-long sit-down interview to CNN en Espa\u00f1ol.",
      "It has since come to light that Gasc\u00f3n took part in the interview without the involvement or agreement of the film's PR team.",
      "The Hollywood Reporter said it had learned that the actress \"set up the interview on her own without the involvement of anyone working on the film, which was distributed by Netflix\".",
      "The fact that this line has been briefed to US journalists suggests Netflix is not only distancing itself from Gasc\u00f3n, but that the streamer's own PR team would not have signed off on such an interview being granted.",
      "Often, publicity teams advise a celebrity in crisis not to give too many interviews and statements, as it can keep a negative story alive for longer or even make the situation worse.",
      "Pulling out of events",
      "Gasc\u00f3n had been due to appear at several events in the final phase of awards season.",
      "These included the AFI Awards luncheon, the Critics Choice Awards, the Directors Guild of America Awards, the Producers Guild of America Awards, and the Santa Barbara International Film Festival.",
      "However, the actress pulled out of appearing as the turmoil continued.",
      "And that's not all. According to Variety, Netflix and the film's PR team have stopped talking directly with Gasc\u00f3n and are only communicating through an agent.",
      "The publication also reported the streamer \"is no longer covering expenses for her travel to the various awards shows or her styling for any appearances at these events\".",
      "It remains to be seen whether Gasc\u00f3n will attend the Oscars, which are scheduled to take place on 2 March.",
      "What happens to the 'Fab Five' Oscars format?",
      "Many film fans (ourselves included) love the so-called \"Fab Five\" format, which has been employed at some recent Oscars ceremonies.",
      "This sees five previous winners of a particular category take to the stage to present the latest winner with the same prize.",
      "For example, last year, Emma Stone was presented with the best actress trophy by previous winners Michelle Yeoh, Jennifer Lawrence, Sally Field, Jessica Lange and Charlize Theron.",
      "Traditionally, this format sees each of the previous winners deliver a short speech, paying tribute to the current nominees, before revealing the winner.",
      "However, it's understood that the Academy has moved away from doing this in the acting categories this year, which means no actress will be asked to praise Gasc\u00f3n's performance from the stage.",
      "Despite speculation, the decision appears to have been unprompted by the recent controversy.",
      "Instead, Variety reports the Academy decided to ditch the fab five format for the acting categories several weeks ago, before the tweets came to light, and instead is deploying it in different categories this year, such as best director.",
      "How could this impact Gasc\u00f3n's co-stars",
      "Emilia P\u00e9rez, a bonkers Spanish-language musical about a Mexican drug lord who changes gender, received 13 Oscar nominations, although it was not necessarily expected to be the biggest winner on the night.",
      "It has stiff competition in several categories, including best picture, but it was thought to be a frontrunner in a few in particular, such as best original song, and best supporting actress for Zoe Salda\u00f1a.",
      "It was widely thought Salda\u00f1a would run away with the trophy, not just for her acclaimed performance, but also because there is a lot of goodwill from voters because of her roles in box office smashes such as the Avatar and Marvel movies.",
      "After Gasc\u00f3n's tweets came to light, Salda\u00f1a said: \"It makes me really sad because I don't support [it], and I don't have any tolerance for any negative rhetoric towards people of any group.",
      "\"I can only attest to the experience that I had with each and every individual that was a part, that is a part, of this film, and my experience and my interactions with them was about inclusivity and collaboration and racial, cultural and gender equity. And it just saddens me.\"",
      "Later, Salda\u00f1a used her speech at the London Critics Circle Awards to tell the audience to be \"abstract with your idea of redemption\".",
      "Oscar voters and awards pundits will be watching forthcoming events such as the Bafta Film Awards and SAG Awards to see whether Salda\u00f1a can still follow through with her expected win.",
      "Meanwhile, director Jacques Audiard told Deadline he has avoided getting in touch with Gasc\u00f3n because \"right now she needs space to reflect and take accountability for her actions\".",
      "\"Very unfortunately, it is taking up all the space, and that makes me very sad,\" he said.",
      "\"It's very hard for me to think back to the work I did with Karla Sof\u00eda. The trust we shared, the exceptional atmosphere that we had on the set that was indeed based on trust.",
      "\"And when you have that kind of relationship and suddenly you read something that that person has said, things that are absolutely hateful and worthy of being hated, of course that relationship is affected. It's as if you fall into a hole. Because what Karla Sof\u00eda said is inexcusable.\"",
      "After his comments, Gasc\u00f3n posted on Instagram: \"Following Jacques' interview that I understand, I decided, for the film, for Jacques, for the cast, for the incredible crew who deserves it, for the beautiful adventure we all had together, to let the work talk for itself.\"",
      "She also reiterated her regret for her original tweets, saying that she wanted to \"sincerely apologise to everyone who has been hurt along the way\".",

    "published": "Sun, 16 Feb 2025 00:00:34 GMT",
    "summary": "As clips from Spain's Temptation Island go viral, the BBC speaks to the show's executive producer.",
    "story": [
      "Reality TV gold has a new three-word definition: \"Montoya, por favor!\"",
      "If you've been anywhere near social media over the past fortnight, you'll know the raw drama setting the internet ablaze this award season hasn't come from Hollywood, but the love tragedy played out in clips posted from Spanish reality TV show Temptation Island.",
      "Contestant Jose Carlos Montoya's spiralling meltdown at watching his girlfriend Anita cheat with another man is like an uncensored Love Island on steroids.",
      "In Temptation Island, couples are taken to a tropical island, separated and sent to separate villas filled with attractive singles ready to test their loyalty. In a final twist, every move made is recorded for the other half to see.",
      "Forced to watch a graphic real-time stream of the betrayal, Montoya's emotions swell until he snaps, breaking all the show's rules.",
      "Blind to the now infamous pleas of host Sandra Barneda (\"Montoya, por favor!\"), he rampages down the beach to confront the pair, tugging at his shorts in anguish as lightning streaks across the sky.",
      "A second clip shows the resulting confrontation: Anita flips the script, calling out Montoya's own indiscretions before collapsing in tears, begging for forgiveness.",
      "\"This is cinema,\" wrote one X user, posting a clip that has now been watched on the platform a staggering 224 million times since 4 February.",
      "\"Montoya. The tension... you don't need to speak Spanish to understand, this is insane.\"",
      "Yet those behind Spain's Temptation Island see its success as more than just shock value. Executive producer Juanra Gonzalo tells me they are overjoyed by the \"completely unexpected\" global reaction, and he believes the show's appeal lies in its relatability.",
      "\"In Love Island, all the people are single. In Temptation Island, there are real couples, and they are putting their love at risk,\" he says. \"I think [audiences] know it too. These emotions and reactions cannot be faked.",
      "\"Everyone wants to know what their boyfriend or girlfriend is doing when they are not with them. We can imagine, but we don't know. Temptation Island lets the audience ask, what would I do in that situation?\"",
      "The magic ingredient to making this work is careful casting. \"Montoya and Anita were perfect - they are very emotive and expressive,\" he says.",
      "Gonzalo calls Montoya, a singer by trade with previous TV experience, a \"special man\". At 31, he told casters he'd \"never experienced love like this before\", having been with Anita \"every day for a year\".",
      "\"She's a strong woman with a lot of character,\" Gonzalo adds.",
      "The Sun's senior showbiz reporter Lottie Hulme says the programme's \"authentic emotion\" sets it apart from competitors like Love Island, Love Is Blind, Married At First Sight and Dating Naked.",
      "Seeing such unfettered and raw emotion may stand out to British and American viewers, who have become used to glossy and well-worn competitive reality formats like Love Island and semi-scripted reality shows like Made in Chelsea.",
      "\"It was refreshing and almost shocking to see something so raw, because it's something that we just don't see on the reality TV shows in Britain nowadays,\" Hulme says.",
      "\"We're at a point with reality TV culture where we're wondering 'what if' - are contestants really being their authentic self... or are they after followings and a brand deal?\"",
      "Alongside constructed storylines, the commercialised reality TV-to-influencer pipeline has made existing formats feel \"predictable\" adds Hulme.",
      "'Never allowed' on UK TV?",
      "A curious quirk of the Montoya phenomenon is that the Spanish show isn't available to watch in the UK - an irony that has only fuelled its illicit appeal on social media.",
      "A previous British version failed to take off, and production company Banijay says it does not presently plan to broadcast the Spanish version in the UK.",
      "After Montoya's meltdown caught the eye of Love Island host Maya Jama, she posted: \"They would never allow this on UK TV. For so many reasons. But it's one of the best things I've ever seen\".",
      "When asked why, she simply replied: \"people would complain\".",
      "Like Big Brother before it, Love Island has been the subject of complaints to Ofcom.",
      "A heated confrontation between 2021 Love Islanders Faye and Teddy over Teddy's behaviour in Casa Amor (a segment similar to Temptation Island's premise) sparked 25,000 Ofcom complaints.",
      "Despite the shocked reactions Gonzalo's show has provoked, he says it operates within strict boundaries, suitable for its primetime slot.",
      "\"Not everything we record is aired,\" he says. \"We are very careful - we only show a few seconds of sexual content.\"",
      "Temptation Island is just the latest in a string of particularly high-octane Spanish dating shows.",
      "Take Falso Amor (or Deep Fake Love) is another. Currently streaming on Netflix, it intensifies the premise of Temptation Island by asking couples to decide whether videos of each other are real or highly convincing AI deepfakes.",
      "So is content which British audiences find shocking viewed differently in Spain?",
      "When I raise Love Island's Zara Holland being stripped of her Miss Great Britain title after having sex on the show in 2016, Gonzalo is shocked and welcomes the internet's more light-hearted reaction to Anita's sexual scenes.",
      "\"As in other countries, things in Spain are progressing from the past - this is positive for our view of women and sexuality,\" he says, adding that no gender should face double standards.",
      "Montoya 'given the right help'",
      "In the UK, there has been heightened scrutiny and awareness of the impact reality TV can have on cast members' mental health, following the deaths of several former contestants.",
      "When I press Gonzalo on this, given the intensity of Montoya and Anita's experience, he says a team of psychologists monitor contestants before, during and after filming.",
      "Montoya received particular support after his beach escapade.",
      "\"We made sure he was not alone, that he had a safe space to process everything. It was important for us to provide him with the right help,\" he says.",
      "Looking ahead, Netflix is to relaunch a US version of the show next month.",
      "Gonzalo is up for the fight. He laughs at the internet's playful suggestion that the beach scene should win an Oscar, then adds: \"My team deserve all the awards!\""

    "published": "Sat, 15 Feb 2025 09:38:04 GMT",
    "summary": "After the star kicked two fans out, we speak to UK comics about the \"chaos\" and \"magic\" of heckling.",
    "story": [
      "Peter Kay made the news last weekend when he kicked two hecklers out of his show at the Manchester Arena.",
      "Kay defended the move afterwards, saying he'd done his \"best to address the situation and made light of it, as any comedian would, but unfortunately their interruptions continued\".",
      "One heckler was removed for loudly ordering the Bolton comic's favourite \"garlic bread\" one too many times. He went on to tell the Daily Mail he felt he'd been \"treated like a terrorist\".",
      "Another had announced \"we love you, Peter\" in the aftermath, resulting in Kay calling her Lisa Riley as she was ejected, because of her resemblance to the actress.",
      "The woman later said on TikTok that she felt \"humiliated\" and thought his reaction was a bit \"over the top\".",
      "BBC News journalist Ellen Kirwin told the BBC the \"vibe was good\" in the place before the red cards, which \"seemed unjustified\".",
      "The incidents prompted a week-long discussion about when piping up can be fun, and how it can quickly get out of hand.",
      "With this in mind, we asked an English, a Welsh and Scottish comedian for their thoughts on the subtle art of dealing with hecklers.",
      "'Most brutal heckle ever'",
      "Larry Dean, who starts his UK tour on Wednesday 19 February in Cardiff, tells the BBC he \"felt sorry for the audience, not just Peter Kay\".",
      "\"It's a really hard thing to do because no one wants to see a comic go serious, you feel like a teacher sometimes,\" he says.",
      "\"It changes the atmosphere when a heckler goes too far, but it really is about gauging do the people around me want me to keep going?\"",
      "Last year, Dean found himself the victim of what he has described as \"the most brutal heckle ever\".",
      "When discussing the topic of ghosts, he overheard a woman loudly talking to someone else in the audience and decided to ask if she was okay.",
      "\"My dad bought me these tickets because he's dying and he wanted me to have a laugh,\" came the reply.",
      "\"We're not laughing\", she added, \"so I've said to my pal we're going to leave.\"",
      "Dean recalls his shocked response.",
      "\"Obviously I'm not gonna make fun of that,\" he tells the BBC.",
      "The Glaswegian looked so discombobulated by the heckle that another audience member asked him if he was okay.",
      "\"Looking at it, perspective-wise, Chris Rock [who was slapped on stage at the Oscars by Will Smith] and Peter Kay - who have the two most famous show interruptions from the past few years - they've had it easy!",
      "\"They need to get this woman from Dundee to know what a heckle really is.\"",
      "His second-worst heckle involved a man on the front row repeating the same whispered swear word at him, so low that only he could hear it. \"I just had to ignore it,\" he says.",
      "Arenas, like the ones Kay performs in, bring in more people but they can also bring problems for stand-ups, he says.",
      "\"They're harder to play than a theatre or comedy club because the laughter goes up, it doesn't come towards the stage,\" says Dean, who has played support slots in arenas.",
      "He says it's difficult for comedians in Kay's situation to hear what audience members are actually saying, and that their interjections are also distracting for others watching in different parts of the arena.",
      "\"People say, 'he should have said this...', but usually people who say that have never been on stage before and they don't know how hard it can be thinking that quickly in the moment about what the best thing for the show is; because you just want everybody to have a good time.\"",
      "Another British comic James Acaster last year released a special entitled Hecklers Welcome, not because he particularly enjoys the experience, but to face his biggest fear and, as he told GQ, \"run towards the thing I was scared of\".",
      "Dean feels that \"nothing will ever catch people's attention more\" than watching a comedian get heckled.",
      "But, he warns, if you're going to take a pop at a professional then you have to expect something to come back your way.",
      "Heckling versus crowd work",
      "Abi Clarke, who has almost a million followers on TikTok, thinks most comedians will be on Kay's side of the argument.",
      "Crucially though, the Bristolian notes: \"There's a difference betwen heckling and crowd work.",
      "\"With crowd work a comedian is inviting it, you're asking a question, you're wanting a chat and that's very different from somebody shouting out a random thing.",
      "\"Once is fine, or twice but if the comedian stops engaging with you or says that's enough, then at that point you're ruining it.\"",
      "New comic superstar Paul Smith made his name roasting crowds as a comedy club MC/compere in Liverpool, while Jimmy Carr is also famed for inviting and actively engaging with interruptions.",
      "For Clarke, heckling comes into its own when comics are workshopping new material. If someone joins in, it can create new \"source material\" that can be used as a fresh joke at the next gig.",
      "\"I've had hecklers who have interrupted multiple times but if they're engaging, joining in with what you're saying and being positive, I don't mind that, it's quite fun.",
      "\"If they're just derailing the gig because they like the sound of their own voice, then I think you should just chuck them out!",
      "\"'Garlic bread' - there's not much you can do with that.\"",
      "'Spontaneous moments'",
      "Clarke thinks if you're going to someone's headline show that they've honed and crafted - \"they've perfected the rhythm, set-up and punchline\" - then the time to interject has passed.",
      "\"I promise you, It will be a better show if they get to perform it how it's meant to be performed.\"",
      "The other time that heckling comes in handy, she says, is for promotional purposes online, as comics don't want to give away their best written material for free, when a great bit of crowd banter will show off their skills just as well.",
      "\"The ones we will post are the wonderful one-off spontaneous moments because they'll never happen again, so they won't ruin the show.\"",
      "She's \"quite lucky so far\", she says, having had only \"two or three horrible instances\" of bad heckling, and in those cases the audience had her back.",
      "\"It's easy to win an argument against a person that no one in the room likes.\"",
      "Her new tour, Role Model, which kicks off on Thursday 17 April in Southampton, finds her keeping a humorous tally of bad behaviour, while questioning if she herself is a bad person for doing certain things.",
      "During these moments she finds other girls will supportively offer, \"no, it's fine\", which she really appreciates on a human level, but \"that's not what the joke is for!\".",
      "'Chaos and magic'",
      "Welsh comic Paul Hilleard, who won the BBC New Comedy Award last year, believes dealing with hecklers is \"part of the job\" and that Kay - a finalist in the same award in 1997 - may have \"thrown his toys out of the pram\" a bit, especially given he was playing to a room of \"people who love you\", he says.",
      "It's a bit different from some of the venues - or \"bear pits\" - that he plays as an up-and-coming comedian in Bristol, while also working as a teaching assistant.",
      "He sometimes performs in back rooms of pubs, where people don't always know that comedy is about to take place around them.",
      "\"Heckling is just part of the game, it's not fun... but it can be,\" he adds, mischievously.",
      "\"I've always been taught you've got to play the room. If it's chaotic, it doesn't matter if you've written the best 20 minutes ever, you've got to control that room of people who are intoxicated, and show them that you're funnier.\"",
      "Stag and hen dos, which tend to gravitate to comedy nights, can bring such chaos.",
      "Hilleard says he has spoken with other comics who agree that audiences \"are a little more feral\" since returning from the Covid lockdown, \"heightened\" by social media.",
      "\"One guy was on magic mushrooms, we found out, and it became part of the show, you lean into it,\" he says. \"That's the best thing you can do, until they become very abusive.\"",
      "\"There's a line,\" he continues. \"If you're ruining the show, that becomes the venue's problem.",
      "\"But it's our job as a comic to make that heckle part of the show, as that's where the magic is.\"",
      "He will perform at the Machynlleth Comedy Festival in May, and said there are \"tricks of the trade\" including certain \"jokes and comebacks\" that experienced comedians can lean on to deal with such situations.",
      "But it's all worth it, he says, \"if you can turn something on the fly that wasn't planned into something hilarous\".",
      "\"That's when people are like, 'oh my God, how did you do do that?'.\"",
      "Nine out of 10 hecklers, he believes, are not trying to ruin the show, they just think it's \"part of the fun\" or \"want to be acknowledged\".",
      "And the one that does, \"might have had a bad day, drank too much or they might just be an [idiot]!",
      "\"I think it's something within people, we like a bit of drama.\"",

    "published": "Sun, 16 Feb 2025 00:01:45 GMT",
    "summary": "Archive documents show Manchester and Birmingham were considered as alternative settings for the soap.",
    "story": [
      "For 40 years, EastEnders has shown us life in a fictional community in east London - but from the iconic characters to the theme tune, could it all have been very different?",
      "In the early research stages of EastEnders, multiple cities were considered for the new soap, from Manchester to London to Birmingham, according to BBC archive documents.",
      "But one audience report recommended that a serial set in a working-class neighbourhood in London would probably have the most widespread appeal.",
      "This would also set the soap apart from other big series of the time, like Coronation Street (set in Greater Manchester), Emmerdale Farm (set in Yorkshire) and Crossroads (set in a Midlands motel).",
      "Though EastEnders creators Julia Smith and Tony Holland would eventually settle on the fictional Walford with its E20 postcode, at this point the show had a working title of East 8 - and it was to be based on a real street in the London borough of Hackney.",
      "In March 1984, Smith and Holland headed to Lanzarote for a working holiday where they created 23 character biographies, three years of storyline overviews and 20 detailed story breakdowns.",
      "Despite all their planning, however, some of the most important elements of EastEnders were last-minute accidents, including the iconic drum \"doof doofs\" in the theme tune, which have since become shorthand for the show's dramatic cliffhangers.",
      "\"In those days, if a theme tune was popular, you'd often release it as a single. So I would make longer versions of the themes to allow for that,\" says Simon May, the theme tune's composer, who would go on to write EastEnders-related singles for cast members Anita Dobson and Nick Berry.",
      "\"The longer version gets a bit more Cockney, so I asked the drummer to play something to transition into the end theme. He played those 'doof doofs' and Tony and Julia happened to be in the studio at the time.",
      "\"They said: 'We love that drum thing.'\"",
      "Another key ingredient of the early years of EastEnders also happened at the last minute: the pairing of the actors behind Angie and her bad-boy husband Den Watts, played by Leslie Grantham.",
      "After a read-through of the first six episodes, the producers thought that original Angie Watts actress Jean Fennell was not quite working in the role. Anita Dobson took on the character at the last minute.",
      "Actor and stuntman Derek Martin, who joined the soap 15 years later as Charlie Slater, explains he was also up for the role of Den.",
      "\"Leslie got it, and he was very good, he was the ladies' man, and I was more the hard man,\" the 91-year-old actor says.",
      "This pairing of Angie and Den proved popular with the public - and the Christmas Day 1986 episode that sees Den serve Angie divorce papers remains the only scripted programme to have been watched by more than 30 million people in the UK, according to Barb figures.",
      "'We might have something here'",
      "The first episode of EastEnders was broadcast on 19 February 1985, with 17 million people watching - making it the second most-watched episode on the BBC that week behind The Two Ronnies.",
      "This compared with the 18 million who watched the same week's Coronation Street.",
      "The episode started with a kick, as Den broke down a door to find the nearly dead body of Reg Cox (played by Johnnie Clayton) - and ended with a punch, as suspect number one in the attack, Nick Cotton (John Altman), put his fist through the glass of the Queen Vic doors.",
      "Though the press was quick to set up a rivalry between EastEnders and Coronation Street, the cast had their eye on another ITV soap.",
      "Actor Adam Woodyat, who played Ian Beale in that first episode, says: \"We were going out at the same time as Emmerdale Farm at 7pm. It felt like Emmerdale Farm gave us an absolute kicking in the ratings until they shifted us to half past seven.\"",
      "Newspapers of the time suggested reactions were mixed. A Sunday People poll of 600 viewers showed 56% of respondents didn't like the first episode, with complaints over \"coarse\" and \"bawdy\" dialogue.",
      "The Guardian, however, was more measured, with their critic Hugh Hebert predicting it would \"probably take a year before anyone knows whether the BBC has got it right\".",
      "The show would prove itself earlier than that. On 25 July 1985, the programme was the most-watched on the BBC that week. This coincided with the show's first blockbuster storyline that saw Michelle (played by Susan Tully) become pregnant by a mystery man, eventually revealed to be Den Watts.",

      "The museum soon became home to a stunning array of works by luminaries including Picasso, Warhol and Salvador Dali, alongside pieces by leading Iranian modernists, and quickly established itself as a beacon of cultural exchange and artistic ambition.",
      "But then came the 1979 revolution. Iran became an Islamic republic as the monarchy was overthrown and clerics assumed political control under Ayatollah Khomeini.",
      "Many artworks were deemed inappropriate for public display because of nudity, religious sensitivities or political implications.",
      "Pierre-Auguste Renoir's Gabrielle with Open Blouse was deemed too scandalous. And Warhol's portrait of the former queen of Iran was too political. In fact, Pahlavi's portrait was vandalised and torn apart with a knife during the revolutionary turmoil.",
      "After the revolution, many of the artworks were locked away, collecting dust in a basement that became the stuff of art world legend.",
      "It was only in the late 1990s that the museum reclaimed its cultural significance during the reformist presidency of Mohammad Khatami.",
      "Suddenly the world remembered what it had been missing. Art lovers could not believe their eyes. Van Gogh, Dali, even Monet - all in Tehran.",
      "Some pieces were loaned to major exhibitions in Europe and the United States, briefly reconnecting the collection with the global art world.",
      "Hamid Keshmirshekan, an art historian based in London, has studied the collection and calls it \"one of the rarest treasure troves of modern art outside the West\".",
      "The collection includes Henry's Moore's Reclining Figure series - an iconic piece by one of Britain's most celebrated sculptors - and Jackson Pollock's Mural on Indian Red Ground, a vibrant example of the American's painting technique pulsing with energy and emotion.",
      "Picasso's The Painter and His Model - his largest canvas from 1927 - also features, a strong example of his abstract works from the post-cubism period.",
      "And there is Van Gogh's At Eternity's Gate - one of the very rare survivals of his first printmaking campaign during which he produced six lithographs in November 1882.",
      "But for art lovers in Britain, the collection is out of reach. The UK Foreign Office advises against all travel to Iran and says British and British-Iranian dual nationals are at significant risk of arrest, questioning or detention.",
      "Having a British passport or connections to the UK can be reason enough for detention by the Iranian authorities, it says.",
      "Challenges remain for the museum which operates under a tight budget. Shifting political priorities mean that it often functions more as a cultural hub than a traditional museum.",
      "Yet it continues to be a remarkable institution - an unlikely guardian of modern art masterpieces in the heart of Tehran."

      "Fekkai decided to collate the data after buying her own tickets for the Cowboy Carter tour. In her city, the ticket seller didn't have to advertise the base price or mark-ups, and she found the process overwhelming.",
      "\"I was on the page for hours, wondering what was a good deal,\" she tells the BBC.",
      "\"I saw online [that] there was a lot of discussion on who was paying what, but of course, nothing was organised. I've worked in business consulting for years, so I'm used to finding the takeaways in messy information.\"",

      "They were both part of the A$AP Mob hip-hop collective and have known one another since their time together at a New York high school.",
      "Their relationship eroded over time as A$AP Rocky's career took off and he became famous.",
      "It all led up to a disagreement between the pair in November 2021.",
      "Mr Ephron took the stand last week to describe their relationship and the moments of the alleged shooting.",
      "What is A$AP Rocky accused of doing?",
      "Authorities have said Mr Ephron met Mr Mayers on 6 November in 2021, a day after the pair got into a disagreement.",
      "They met outside a Hollywood hotel about a block from the iconic stars on the Hollywood Walk of Fame.",
      "Prosecutors say when the pair met things got physical. Mr Mayers is alleged to have whipped out a gun from his waistband and pointed it toward Mr Ephron, telling him \"I'll kill you right now\".",
      "Court documents outline that Mr Ephron told the rapper to fire the weapon, which Mr Mayers did not and instead started walking away.",
      "Mr Ephron followed behind and yelled at Mr Mayers about their disagreements, court documents show.",
      "That's when prosecutors allege Mr Mayers pulled out the gun again and opened fire.",
      "Court documents allege multiple bullets were fired, one of which is alleged to have grazed Mr Ephron's knuckles.",
      "Authorities say parts of the incident were captured on surveillance footage, including some footage that included audio of gunfire, although there is no video showing the shooting.",
      "Some of this footage has been played in court already for jurors.",
      "What is A$AP Rocky saying about the allegations?",
      "There are several key points of contention in the case: the weapon, police investigation and Mr Ephron's injuries.",
      "The rapper's lawyers have noted the weapon authorities say was the gun he pulled out was not usable - instead it was a prop weapon his security encouraged him to carry to ward off would-be attackers.",
      "His lawyers have also focused on Mr Ephron taking multiple days to report the incident to police, and how authorities found no trace of bullet casings or a shooting when they responded to the incident.",
      "Court documents detail that Mr Ephron returned to the scene later and gathered two shell casings he said he found in the area. He brought them when he reported the incident to police two days later.",
      "He also did not immediately go to hospital after the incident and instead sought medical treatment after flying back to New York.",
      "What's happened in court so far?",
      "Prosecutors finished presenting their case before jurors as to why they believe Mr Mayers is guilty.",
      "Prosecutors showed jurors footage of the incident, captured on surveillance, that included audio of gunfire but no video evidence showing the shooting itself.",
      "There were a number of tense and emotional exchanges, especially when Mr Ephron was on the stand and testified about being shot.",
      "At one point while on the witness stand, Mr Ephron called A$AP Rocky's attorney \"annoying,\" which led to a reprimand from the judge. Another tense moment came when A$AP Rocky screamed in court.",
      "Another associate of the pair, A$AP Twelvyy, was being questioned by prosecutors on the stand when they showed him a photo of Mr Mayers' bed with the letters \"AWGE\" emblazoned on furniture.",
      "When asked what the letters stood for, Mr Mayers interrupted and yelled out, \"Don't say!\"",
      "Twelvyy would only say, \"It means AWGE,\" which angered the prosecutor, who asked the judge to force the witness to be more forthcoming.",
      "Mr Mayers' defence attorney, Joe Tacopina, has asserted the case was one of \"extortion, plain and simple\".",
      "Mr Mayers' lawyer said Mr Ephron's claims were financially motivated and suggested that Mr Ephron sought monetary compensation in exchange for dropping the charges.",
      "The trial is nearly at its conclusion. Mr Tacopina told the judge on Monday that they expect to rest their arguments on Tuesday.",
      "After his defence is finished, both sides will be able to give their closing statements before a jury decides the rapper's fate.",
      "Will A$AP Rocky take the stand?",
      "The rapper waived his right to testify on Tuesday, meaning that he will not take the stand.",
      "Now, it is believed that the trial will conclude without comment from the famous rapper. Closing arguments are expected to begin on Thursday.",
      "The rapper is not legally obligated to testify, and it could have been a risky move. Taking the stand would have mean he would face questioning from prosecutors as well as his own lawyers.",
      "Speculation that he would speak at his own trial only arose when his attorney, Mr Tacopina, stated that the rapper was \"eager to tell his story\", and that \"he would love the opportunity to do so\".",
      "Had he testified, the rapper was expected to argue that the firearm involved in the 2021 fight was a starter pistol loaded with blanks, carried solely for security reasons.",
      "Could A$AP Rocky face prison time?",
      "Yes, the rapper could face up to 24 years in prison if found guilty in the trial, which is expected to go on for about three weeks.",
      "A panel of 12 jurors will decide his fate.",
      "Will Rihanna continue to be in court?",
      "Rihanna has continued to appear at the trial.",
      "Before the proceedings started, the rapper's lawyer had told the court that Mr Mayers had tried to keep his family away from all of this, but she has appeared multiple times during the trial to support him.",
      "At some points in the trial, she sat between the rapper's mother and sister in the courtroom, media reports indicate. The couple's two children have not appeared.",
      "During Rihanna's first appearance at the trial, news reporters and fans gathered outside the courthouse to try to catch a glimpse of the singer.",
      "She ended up using a non-public entrance used by judges and was already seated in the courtroom when media were allowed into the chamber.",
      "During jury selection, prosecutors questioned jurors about Rihanna and whether her connection to the case would affect their ability to deliver a fair verdict. While some described themselves as Rihanna fans, and many more had heard of Rihanna than A$AP Rocky, jurors said her presence in the courtroom would not influence their decision making.",
      "Rihanna's presence had attracted attention from jurors in a murder trial across the hall at the courthouse, with some commenting on her being so nearby.",
      "Rocky's trial is being televised, but Rihanna has sat out of view of cameras in the courtroom.",

      "As a young boy, film editor Nick Emerson's fascination with 1970s American political thrillers, and watching the unfolding peace talks in Northern Ireland, set him on a path that would lead to him working on one of the most acclaimed films of last year.",
      "Conclave, starring Ralph Fiennes, Stanley Tucci and Isabella Rossellini, is leading this year's Bafta nominations, receiving nods in 12 categories, including Best Editing.",
      "The film is also thought to be a strong contender for the best picture award at next month's Oscars, and several of its stars, and Emerson, could also be in contention for individual prizes.",
      "Growing up in Lisburn, County Antrim, Emerson told BBC News NI that the talks which brought about the Good Friday Agreement gave him an appetite for this depiction of the election of a new pope, and the skills to put it together.",
      "\"Working in the BBC newsroom at the start of my career was a really exciting place to be,\" he said.",

      "He describes Conclave - which follows a gossipy and scheming group of cardinals as they select the new Pope - in similar terms.",
      "\"It's essentially about the political machinations that go on... people with competing interests and competing ideologies.\"",
      "Emerson moved through the media industry, inspired by his experience in the BBC Newsroom in Belfast.",
      "\"I found myself doing factual TV and now feature films. Its the process, that's the joy of it for me.\"",
      "Conclave opens with the death of the Pope, prompting cardinals to gather in Rome to select a new head of the Catholic Church.",
      "But it comes with all the skullduggery, wheeling and dealing, and conspiracy one would expect, as the frontrunners try to improve their chances of becoming the Vicar of Christ.",

      "It's not the first time a papal conclave has been depicted on screen, and though the real world process is shrouded in mystery, there has been a number of notable attempts to dramatise what goes on.",
      "'Crisis of faith'",
      "Emerson told BBC News that he and Edward Berger - the acclaimed German-Austrian film-maker whose 2022 adaptation of All Quiet on the Western Front was nominated for nine Academy Awards - aspired to make something that would replicate the 70s thrillers they grew up on.",
      "\"Edward and I are big fans of films like All The President's Men and we both thought: 'Wouldn't it be great to aspire to something like that?'",

      "Emerson and Berger's Conclave has pacing and visual storytelling that have been lauded for the way they create suspense and intrigue, as the camera often holds on a subject slightly longer than expected.",
      "Emerson said: \"In our approach Edward was really keen to push boundaries on how long we could hold shots and maintain rigour but also keep an eye on the pace.",

      "From the late 1880s until the 1960s, so-called Jim Crow laws enforced segregation against black Americans and saw them treated as second-class citizens.",
      "It meant that they were separated from white people - often prevented from living in certain neighbourhoods, forced to attend different schools and banned from public spaces.",
      "During this era, black musicians and performers created their own network of live performance venues across the United States.",

      "The circuit was \"tremendously important to the development of black music\", says Mia Bay, Professor of American History at Cambridge University.",
      "\"The black stars of the day would travel the circuit,\" she tells BBC Newsbeat.",
      "\"It was very important to sustaining the careers of many important black performers - it allowed them to make a living in music.",
      "\"They were on the road all the time.\"",
      "Prof Bay says the presence of the circuit was also \"very helpful to black communities\".",
      "Performers were drawn to \"black vacation spots\" and the theatres at those locations, Prof Bay says.",

      "\"It was one of the more successful segregation-era businesses.\"",
      "Beyonc\u00e9 has often paid tribute to black performers, and Prof Bay feels the singer's Texas roots may have played a role in that.",

      "The government has met a key election pledge to deliver two million extra NHS appointments in England in its first year, the prime minister has said.",
      "The target was achieved between July and November last year, when there were almost 2.2 million more elective care appointments compared to the same period in 2023, the government said.",
      "That period was affected by doctor strikes, however, which would have suppressed the number of available appointments.",
      "Sir Keir Starmer said the \"milestone is a shot in the arm for our plan to get the NHS back on its feet and cut waiting times\", while Health Secretary Wes Streeting said there was still \"a hell of a lot more to do\".",

      "\"Look at the size of the waiting lists overall. It's come down four months in a row. That's progress, but there's still a lot more to do,\" he told the Today programme on BBC Radio 4.",

      "The additional appointments were delivered in part by extra evening and weekend working, the government said.",
      "Elective care covers a broad range of planned, non-emergency services, from diagnostic tests and scans to outpatient appointments, surgeries and cancer treatment.",
      "There were 31.3 million operations, appointments and tests between July and November 2024, compared to 29.1 million over the same period in 2023, during which there were over a dozen days of junior doctors strikes.",

      "And the numbers of A&E patients enduring long waits went up in January, with nearly 160,000 waiting longer than four hours for a bed to be found after a decision to admit them \u2013 many on chairs or trolleys.",

    "published": "Sun, 16 Feb 2025 00:00:42 GMT",
    "summary": "More young people are presenting to audiology teams in England with difficulty processing sound.",
    "story": [
      "Whether it's the echo of beeping tills in a supermarket or the hissing of a coffee machine in your local caf\u00e9, the brain is constantly working to decode hundreds of noises each day.",
      "But, for some, those background noises can become so overwhelming that they distract them from recognising voices or alerts.",
      "This is the reality for Sophie, a 25-year-old administration assistant from London, who is used to being told she doesn't listen, zones out, or is \"a bit ditsy\".",
      "\"Even though I can hear that there are noises going on, I can't listen to where the noise is coming from. I know it's the person's voice, I just can't really compute it quick enough,\" she said.",
      "After a hearing test came back normal, Sophie met a private audiologist for further testing. She was eventually diagnosed with auditory processing disorder (APD), a neurological condition where the brain finds it difficult to understand sounds and spoken words.",
      "Her audiologist and others in England are now calling for more research into whether the condition is linked to overuse of noise-cancelling headphones.",
      "'Words sound like gibberish'",
      "Having grown up on a peaceful farm in the countryside, it wasn't until a few years ago when Sophie started university in London that she noticed a change in her hearing - specifically trouble identifying where a sound was coming from.",
      "She rarely attended her university lectures in person, instead opting to watch them online and with subtitles.",
      "\"All the words sounded like gibberish when I was in the actual lecture, and I was trying to hear,\" she said.",
      "It affected her social life too and Sophie would leave bars and restaurants early because of the \"overwhelming noise\".",
      "The cause of Sophie's APD diagnosis is unknown, but her audiologist believes the overuse of noise-cancelling headphones, which Sophie wears for up to five hours a day, could have a part to play.",
      "Other audiologists agree, saying more research is needed into the potential effects of their prolonged use.",
      "Five NHS audiology departments have told the BBC that there has been an increase in the number of young people referred to them from GPs with hearing issues - only to find their hearing is normal when tested and it is their ability to process sound that is struggling.",
      "APD is more common in neurodiverse people, those who have suffered from a brain injury or had a middle-ear infection as a child. However, more patients with APD are presenting outside of those categories, leaving audiologists to question if external factors, such as noise-cancelling headphones, are contributing.",
      "Hearing vs listening",
      "Renee Almeida, an adult audiology clinical lead at Imperial College Healthcare NHS Trust, says it is important to hear a diversity of sounds so the brain can decide what is important to focus on.",
      "Her team has seen an increase in the amount of young people referred for hearing services in the last year. She said: \"There is a difference between hearing and listening. We can see that listening skills are suffering.\"",
      "Noise-cancelling headphones do have their benefits, particularly for long-term ear health where their soundproofing feature can prevent high frequency and loud noise from reaching and damaging the ear - even while listening to music.",
      "Lisa Barber, technology editor at Which?, said the devices had \"exploded in popularity\" in recent years. But the level of transparency can vary from model to model.",
      "\"Some simply offer passive noise cancelling, where the acoustic seal between the headphones and your ears reduces nearby noise,\" she said. Others have a transparency mode that allows you to hear partial background noise.",
      "A false reality?",
      "But Claire Benton, vice-president of the British Academy of Audiology, suggests that by blocking everyday sounds such as cars beeping, there is a possibility the brain can \"forget\" to filter out the noise.",
      "\"You have almost created this false environment by wearing those headphones of only listening to what you want to listen to. You are not having to work at it,\" she said.",
      "\"Those more complex, high-level listening skills in your brain only really finish developing towards your late teens. So, if you have only been wearing noise-cancelling headphones and been in this false world for your late teens then you are slightly delaying your ability to process speech and noise,\" Benton suggests.",
      "For those experiencing difficulties with sound processing in England, APD care in the NHS is limited.",
      "A UK-wide survey from 2024, distributed by the BAA and ENT UK, the professional body representing ear, nose and throat surgery, found that only 4% of audiologists consider themselves to be well-informed on APD.",
      "And, for those who are 16 years and over, the Royal National ENT and Eastman Hospital is the only NHS provider in England offering a full APD assessment and the waiting list is nine months long.",
      "Prof Doris-Eva Bamiou, who carries out the assessments there, says this is partially down to the time it takes to diagnose APD. \"It is a costly service because it is not just an audiogram, the test can take up to two hours and it requires additional assessments. In adults I also refer them for a cognitive assessment and in children I may also need to speak to an educational psychologist.\"",
      "Particularly after the pandemic, behaviours and engagement with visuals and audio has changed. This comes in part due to new products and technology, as well as increased anxiety in noisy environments after the lockdown.",
      "It is now common to see people walking outside wearing their noise-cancelling headphones and watching videos online with subtitles, despite perfectly hearing the sound. One YouGov survey showed that 61% of 18-24 year olds prefer to watch TV with the subtitles on.",
      "Dr Angela Alexander, audiologist and owner of APD Support, a private organisation, is among the audiologists calling for more research into the impact of noise-cancelling headphones on auditory processing, particularly in children.",
      "\"What does the future look like if we don't investigate this link? There are a lot of well-meaning parents and teachers who think the answer to children having problems with noise is to wear ear plugs or having noise-cancelling headphones on.\"",
      "Dr Amjad Mahmood, the head of audiology at Great Ormond Street Hospital supported the call for more research.",
      "He said there had been a \"significant increase in demand\" for assessments at the hospital's large APD clinic for under-16s. \"especially with difficulties noticed at school\".",

      "Could solar-powered headphones be the next must-have?",
      "Study finds 18m people in the UK have hearing loss",
      "Treatment for APD can make a significant positive difference, with some patients able to make a full recovery.",
      "So-called \"word in noise\" training exercises on mobile apps have become a popular way of practising pulling speech from background noise. But training can vary and includes practice with auditory discrimination too, such as how to distinguish separate sounds in words like seventy and seventeen, and free and three.",
      "Microphones and low-gain hearing aids can also be provided to help the patient in certain situations, such as a meeting or classroom work, but adults outside the education system are not entitled to these products on the NHS.",
      "\"Right now I can hear there is a fan above my head but my brain is telling me that is not something I need to worry about,\" says Dr Alexander, describing what is called auditory scene analysis.",
      "\"It's the way we identify threats in our environment, so it makes sense to me that there would be an increase in anxiety if a person's brain no longer has those inputs helping tell them what is a concern and what is not.\"",
      "To improve this, Dr Alexander suggests reducing headphone use time and using the transparency mode which can amplify the background noise as well as wearing headphones that don't completely occlude or block the ears.",
      "Limited research",
      "Wayne Wilson, an associate professor in the school of health and rehabilitation sciences at The University of Queensland, says more research needs to be done on the possible link.",
      "However, he points out that doing controlled research with so many variables could prove tricky.",

      "So how much could the NHS ultimately end up costing the nation? And is it possible to get better value for the money we collectively spend?",
      "BBC Verify has examined some of the key numbers.",
      "How much do we spend on health?",
      "Shortly after the NHS was founded, in 1949-50, total UK health spending was around \u00a317bn in today's money.",
      "By 2023\u201324 it had grown to \u00a3226bn.",
      "Health spending per person in 2022-23 was around \u00a33,300 in England and Scotland, \u00a33,600 in Wales and \u00a33,500 in Northern Ireland.",
      "In the Autumn Budget last year, Chancellor Rachel Reeves announced an additional \u00a326bn a year for the English health budget by 2025-26, which will automatically increase the resources available to the devolved nations.",
      "As a share of the overall economy - or GDP - spending on health has massively increased over the past 70 years.",
      "In 1949-50, health spending was only 3.6% of GDP. In 2023-24, it had more than doubled to 8.1% of GDP, after peaking at more than 10% in the Covid pandemic.",
      "Health spending jumped in the pandemic due to the costs of vaccinations and the \"test and trace\" programme.",
      "Around 80% of total health spending is funded by the government in the UK, mainly going to the NHS. The other 20% comes through private insurance schemes or out-of-pocket costs.",
      "That means health spending as a share of total government spending has also considerably increased.",
      "In the middle of the 1950s, health accounted for around \u00a31 in every \u00a38 the government spent.",
      "Today it's roughly \u00a31 in every \u00a33.",
      "How does that compare to other countries?",
      "Despite that surge in health spending in recent decades, the UK is by no means an outlier among rich countries.",
      "In 2022, using comparable data on public health spending, the UK was spending around 9.3% of GDP.",
      "That was higher than Canada (7.9%) and Italy (6.8%) as well as the EU average, but less than Germany (10.9%) and France (10.2%).",
      "The US was the real outlier, spending 14.1% of GDP on health, largely because America has a private insurance system with few of the cost controls of other nations.",
      "And those countries have, like the UK, seen health spending rise considerably in recent decades, driven up by growing demand for new medical treatments and ageing populations.",
      "What's going to happen to NHS spending in future?",
      "Last year, the Office for Budget Responsibility (OBR), the government's official forecaster, said there was every likelihood there would be continued upward pressure on UK public health spending, citing those same factors: an ageing population and more demand for new medicines and treatments.",
      "It also cites rising ill health among the population as one of the contributors to rising spending, albeit not the dominant one.",
      "The amount of health spending on an individual rises dramatically as they grow older. Average annual spending per person on those aged 45 is around \u00a32,000. For those aged 85 it is \u00a313,000 a year.",
      "The OBR projects that the proportion of the population aged 65 and over will rise from around one in five today to one in four by 2070.",
      "As people's incomes grow, research suggests they are typically willing to spend more of those incomes on healthcare, which in the UK is done mainly through the taxpayer-funded NHS.",
      "In its central forecast, the OBR projected UK public healthcare spending will rise by around 3% every year, after adjusting for inflation. This would be broadly in line with average growth over recent decades, although the rate has fluctuated under different governments.",
      "The OBR estimates this trend would add up to roughly an extra 1% of GDP going on public health spending every decade going forward.",
      "That would take public health spending from around 8% of GDP in 2024-25, up to 14.5% of GDP by 2073-74, equivalent to around \u00a3180bn in today's money.",
      "However, this would also depend on the long term growth rate of the economy. The OBR assumes public health spending will grow roughly twice as fast as the overall economy.",
      "If that path of spending transpired, it would also likely mean health spending accounting for an even larger share of total government public service spending.",
      "How do we get better value for money from health spending?",
      "Many politicians argue it's important for the NHS to deliver higher levels of productivity, in other words, to spend money more efficiently in order to keep the national bill under control.",
      "Productivity growth in the NHS has long lagged behind productivity growth in the rest of the UK economy.",
      "Last year, the OBR looked at what would happen if NHS productivity grew faster than currently expected in the coming decades.",
      "This, the OBR said, could curb the overall rise in public health spending. It might rise only to 11% of GDP by 2074, rather than to 14.5%.",
      "The recent indications of productivity growth in the NHS, however, are unclear.",
      "The latest estimates from the Office for National Statistics are that in the second half of 2024 NHS measured \"inputs\" - mainly in the form of more doctors and nurses hired - were 32% higher than they were before the pandemic in 2019.",
      "But measured \"outputs\" - things like operations completed and patients discharged - were only up by 7%.",
      "This meant that UK public sector health productivity was still around 19% lower than it was five years previously - and showing no signs of sustained growth.",
      "However, measuring productivity in the public services is far from simple and the ONS has stressed that these statistics are still only \"in development\".",
      "Other estimates from NHS England and the Institute for Fiscal Studies - the independent economic research institute - point to an improvement in productivity in hospitals in England more recently, suggesting a corner might have been turned in the delivery of health services after the shock of the pandemic.",
      "But regardless of the statistical discrepancy, most experts agree that improving productivity in the health sector in the medium and long term is an important objective. And the extent to which it is delivered will play a key part in determining how much the NHS ends up costing the nation in the coming years.",

      "Doctors are advising women to take care using menstrual cups, after one user developed temporary kidney problems because the cup was misaligned.",
      "The patient, in her 30s, had been experiencing intermittent pelvic pain and blood in her urine for months, but had not linked the symptoms to the menstrual cup, which is used to catch monthly blood flow.",
      "Although exceedingly rare, a poorly positioned cup inside the vaginal passage can press on other nearby structures, such as ureters - tubes carrying urine to the bladder, according to Danish doctors quoted in the British Medical Journal.",
      "Selecting the appropriate size cup is important, as well as inserting it properly, doctors have stressed.",
      "The patient made a complete recovery, but doctors have warned: \"Correct positioning, along with choosing the correct cup shape and size, is important to prevent negative effects on the upper urinary tract.",
      "\"Menstrual cups can be bought and used without clinical advice from a health professional, which emphasises the importance of detailed and clear patient information material.\"",
      "How to use a menstrual cup",
      "Reusable and sustainable, menstrual cups are an alternative to sanitary pads and tampons.",
      "They are made from soft, flexible silicone or rubber and, once correctly in place, can hold 20 to 30ml - around two tablespoons - of blood.",
      "They can be removed, emptied, washed and reinserted every four to eight hours, depending on flow.",
      "Different cup models may offer a better fit according to the individual.",
      "There are smaller size options, for girls and younger women who have not given birth to a baby, for example.",
      "If you are a virgin, you can still use one.",
      "Menstrual cups can be tricky for first-time users though, particularly when it comes to removal.",
      "A recent survey of 530 young people reported many found it difficult to remove the menstrual cup on their first attempt, with some saying they had to ask for help.",
      "Once inserted into the vagina, menstrual cups create a suction seal to stop any seepage of blood.",
      "When removing, users are warned not to simply pull on the stem. Instead, squeeze the bottom of the cup to break the seal and wiggle it off, says physiotherapist Dr Kate Lough, an expert in pelvic health.",
      "She says it may take women a few menstrual cycles to become accustomed to using one, and stresses wearing a cup should not hurt.",
      "She told BBC News: \"Generally, they are a very safe product.",
      "\"When it's in correctly, you shouldn't feel it.\"",
      "Menstrual cups vary in shape, size and firmness, so Dr Lough advises shopping around to find one that matches your requirements.",
      "If you have recently had a contraceptive coil put into your womb, there is a very small chance it could become dislodged, or even removed, by suction.",
      "If the threads cannot be located, or a woman thinks her coil has moved, manufacturers recommend using additional contraception and seeing a healthcare professional for advice.",

    "summary": "Officers appear to have rejected every application from former Afghan commandos who fought alongside them.",
    "story": [
      "UK Special Forces command rejected resettlement applications from more than 2,000 Afghan commandos who had shown credible evidence of service in units that fought alongside the SAS and SBS, the Ministry of Defence has confirmed for the first time.",
      "UK Special Forces officers appear to have rejected every application from a former Afghan commando referred to them for sponsorship, despite the Afghan units having fought with the British on life-threatening missions against the Taliban.",
      "The MoD had previously denied there was a blanket policy to reject members of the units - known as the Triples - but the BBC has not been able to find any evidence that UK Special Forces (UKSF) supported any resettlement applications.",
      "Asked if UKSF had supported any applications, the MoD declined to answer the question.",
      "The Triples - so-called because their designations were CF 333 and ATF 444 - were set up, trained, and paid by UK Special Forces and supported the SAS and SBS on operations in Afghanistan. When the country fell to the Taliban in 2021, they were judged to be in grave danger of reprisal and were entitled to apply for resettlement to the UK.",
      "The rejection of their applications was controversial because it came at a time when a public inquiry in the UK was investigating allegations that British Special Forces had committed war crimes on operations in Afghanistan where the Triples were present.",
      "The inquiry has the power to compel witnesses who are in the UK, but not non-UK nationals who are overseas. If resettled, former members of the Triples could be compelled by the inquiry to provide potentially significant evidence.",
      "BBC Panorama revealed last year that UK Special Forces command had been given veto power over their resettlement applications and denied them asylum in Britain. The revelation caused a wave of anger among some former members of the SAS and others who served with the Afghan units.",
      "The MoD initially denied the existence of the veto, suggesting that the BBC's reporting had been inaccurate, but then-Defence Minister Andrew Murrison was later forced to tell the House of Commons the government had misled parliament in its denials.",
      "The confirmation of the more than 2,000 rejections emerged in court hearings earlier this month during a legal challenge brought by a former member of the Triples. Lawyers for the MoD applied for a restriction order which temporarily prevented the BBC from reporting on the relevant parts of the proceedings, before withdrawing their application last week under challenge.",

      "Mike Martin MP, a member of the defence select committee and former British Army officer who served in Afghanistan, told the BBC the rejections were \"extremely concerning\".",
      "\"There is the appearance that UK Special Forces blocked the Afghan special forces applications because they were witnesses to the alleged UK war crimes currently being investigated in the Afghan inquiry,\" Martin said.",
      "\"If the MoD is unable to offer any explanation, then the matter should be included in the inquiry,\" he added.",
      "Johnny Mercer, the former Conservative MP for Plymouth Moor View, who served alongside the SBS in Afghanistan, testified to the Afghan inquiry that he had spoken to former members of the Triples and heard \"horrific\" allegations of murder by UK Special Forces.",
      "Mercer said it was \"very clear to me that there is a pool of evidence that exists within the Afghan [special forces] community that are now in the United Kingdom that should contribute to this Inquiry\".",
      "The MoD began a review last year of all 2,022 resettlement applications referred to and rejected by UK Special Forces. All contained what MoD caseworkers on the resettlement scheme regarded as \"credible\" evidence of service with the Triples units.",
      "The government said at the time that the review would take 12 weeks, but more than a year later it has yet to be completed. Some rejections have already been overturned, allowing former Triples to come to the UK. But the MoD has refused to inform the Afghan commandos whether they are in scope of the review or if their rejections were upheld, unless they write to the MoD.",
      "Many are in hiding in Afghanistan, making it difficult to obtain legal representation or pro-actively contact the MoD. Dozens have reportedly been beaten, tortured, or killed by the Taliban since the group regained control of the country.",
      "\"Although decisions have been overturned, it's too late for some people,\" said a former Triples officer. \"The delays have caused a lot of problems. People have been captured by the Taliban or lost their lives,\" he said.",
      "The officer said that the Afghan commandos worked alongside British Special Forces \"like brothers\" and felt \"betrayed\" by the widespread rejections.",
      "\"If Special Forces made these rejections they should say why. They should have to answer,\" he said.",
      "The MoD is now facing a legal challenge to aspects of the review, including the decision not to inform applicants whether their case is being reviewed or disclose the criteria used to select those in scope.",
      "The legal challenge is being brought by a former senior member of the Triples who is now in the UK, on behalf of commandos still in Afghanistan.",
      "\"Our client's focus is on his soldiers left behind in Afghanistan, some of whom have been killed while they wait for these heavily delayed protection decisions,\" said Dan Carey, a partner at the law firm Deighton Pierce Glynn.",
      "\"As things stand they have a right to request a reassessment of a decision they haven't even been told about. And there are others who think they are part of the Triples Review when the secret criteria would tell them that their cases aren't even being looked at.\"",
      "Lawyers acting for the former member of the Triples also heavily criticised the level of disclosure in the case by the MoD, which has not handed over any documentation from within UK Special Forces or government records about the decision-making process that led to the rejections.",
      "In court filings, they criticised the \"total inadequacy\" of the MoD's disclosure, calling it an \"an obvious failure to comply with the duty of candour and to provide necessary explanation\" of the process.",
      "New evidence that emerged last week in court also showed that the MoD appeared to have rejected out of hand some applicants who served with UK Special Forces in Afghanistan after 2014 - when Britain's conventional armed forces left Helmand province - without even referring them to UK Special Forces headquarters for sponsorship.",
      "The MoD has not explained the reasoning behind the policy, which was kept secret from applicants. A spokesperson for the MoD said that after 2014 the UK's role \"evolved from combat operations to primarily training, advising and assisting CF 333, who were under the command of the Afghan Ministry of Interior\".",
      "But officers who served with UK Special Forces told the BBC that the Triples continued to support British-led operations after 2014.",

    "story": [
      "Since BBC News reported on Thursday that Rachel Reeves had exaggerated her online CV and had been investigated over her use of expenses while working at Halifax Bank of Scotland (HBOS), Labour colleagues have mounted a robust defence of the chancellor.",
      "Sir Keir Starmer said she had \"dealt with any issues that arise\" from the questions about her CV, and Health Secretary Wes Streeting told BBC Newsnight that she was doing a \"brilliant and difficult job\".",
      "But Labour figures have questioned our reporting on the expenses investigation, with one cabinet minister calling it totally inaccurate.",
      "Here we examine the key Labour responses and look at the evidence that supports our journalism.",
      "What did we reveal about Reeves's expenses?",
      "The BBC News investigation revealed that concerns were raised about Reeves's expenses while working at HBOS between 2006 and 2009.",
      "A detailed six-page whistleblowing complaint was submitted, with dozens of pages of supporting documents including emails, receipts and memos.",
      "It accused Reeves and two other managers, one of whom was her boss, of using the bank's money to \"fund a lifestyle\", with spending on events, taxis and gifts, including for each other.",

      "The chancellor and her expenses before she became an MP",
      "The chancellor and her expenses before she became an MP",
      "What happened to the whistleblower's complaint?",
      "The complaint led to an internal investigation by the bank's risk department.",
      "This was passed to internal audit, which reviewed the allegations and concluded that they were substantiated and there appeared to be evidence of wrongdoing by Reeves and her two colleagues, according to a senior source with direct knowledge of the investigation.",
      "What we have not been able to establish is what happened next and whether the bank ever reached a formal conclusion.",
      "How are Labour defending Reeves?",
      "Reeves has said she was not aware of an investigation or issue with her expenses and said she left the bank on good terms.",
      "She said her expenses had always been signed off in the proper way. The person who signed off her expenses, her boss, was also subject to the internal investigation.",
      "Other Labour figures have criticised BBC News's reporting on the story, with two MPs repeating similar attacks.",
      "On Friday, Science Secretary Peter Kyle told BBC Radio 4's Today programme that the reporting was \"inaccurate\".",
      "Both he and Siobhain McDonagh, a Labour MP who appeared on BBC's Politics Live on Thursday, raised comments by a former HR manager, Jane Wayper - which, they said, disproved the BBC News's story.",
      "What did the HR manager say?",
      "Wayper spoke to the BBC after being given permission to do so by Reeves's team.",
      "She provided an on-the-record statement which said she \"would have been made aware of any investigation which concluded there was a case to answer\" on the basis that she \"would have been required to organise and oversee a disciplinary process\".",
      "However, the BBC has not reported that the case reached a formal conclusion, or that there was disciplinary action.",
      "Kyle incorrectly claimed that the quote had not been included in our report - but it had been in the article since it was first published on Thursday morning.",
      "He also incorrectly referred to Wayper as the head of HR at the bank.",
      "In reality she was an HR business partner working in the department where Reeves worked.",
      "What has Reeves said?",
      "On Friday, Reeves was asked about the expenses claims directly. She said: \"No-one ever raised any concerns about my expenses when I worked for Halifax Bank of Scotland.\"",
      "She said her expenses had been \"signed off in the proper way\" and \"no issues were ever raised\" during her time at the bank.",
      "Her expenses were signed off by her manager, who was also one of the three employees who were the subject of the expenses probe.",
      "Reeves left the bank in May 2009, as did her boss. The other senior manager was on sick leave in May and never returned to work at the bank.",
      "There is no suggestion any of the departures were linked to the investigation or spending issues and a spokesman for Reeves said the chancellor left the bank on good terms.",
      "What has BBC News established about her LinkedIn CV?",
      "Reeves has accepted the findings of another part of our investigation, this time over her CV.",
      "We established that the chancellor had exaggerated the length of time she worked at the Bank of England.",
      "Reeves has often said she spent the \"best part of a decade\" working at the bank when setting out her credentials to run the economy to voters.",
      "However, her LinkedIn profile said she only worked there for six years - from September 2000 to December 2006. A year of that time was spent studying at the London School of Economics (LSE).",
      "The BBC has now established that Reeves left the Bank of England in March 2006, meaning the time she spent working there amounts to five and a half years.",
      "A spokesman for Reeves confirmed that dates on her LinkedIn were inaccurate and said it was due to an administrative error by the team. Her profile on the social media site has since been updated.",
      "Who is Rachel Reeves?",

      "The government is rolling out a \u00a327m expansion of the scheme to 30 new hospitals, saying it could lead to an extra 1,900 people receiving earlier care for HIV each year.",
      "NHS England data showed a 40% rise in the detection of blood-borne infections after the last Conservative government began piloting the scheme in November 2023.",
      "NHS chief executive Amanda Pritchard said the \"expansion of this revolutionary opt-out testing\" will lead to the early detection of \"thousands more cases of HIV and Hepatitis B and C\".",

      "It is designed to catch cases of blood-borne viruses in people who would not usually get tested at a sexual health clinic.",

      "Previously expanding the scheme to 59 hospitals led to a 43% surge in detected infections over 10 months compared to the same time period two years earlier.",
      "HIV stands for Human Immunodeficiency Virus - the immunodeficiency is the weakening of the immune system by the virus. If untreated, it can lead to late-stage HIV or Aids, the name for a collection of illnesses caused by the virus.",
      "Hepatitis B and Hepatitis C cause inflammation of the liver and come from viral infections, according to the NHS. Both can be contracted through blood-to-blood contact with an infected person.",
      "Opt-out testing for blood-borne viruses has been seen by health officials and ministers as a resounding success for the NHS, which has not yet released the names of the latest hospitals added to the scheme.",

      "He added \"that means a transformation for the individual\" who can begin to take medication, which \"means the virus is no longer attacking their immune system and they can't pass it on if they're having sex or having a baby\".",
      "Mr Angell said early testing also makes \"good money sense for the NHS\" as it allows early treatment, which stops HIV progressing, preventing severe illness, emergency visits and more costly treatments.",

      "In response, the Scottish government said Vance's claim was \"incorrect\" and the law was \"carefully drafted to capture only intentional or reckless behaviour close to a small number of premises providing abortion services\".",

    "published": "Thu, 13 Feb 2025 14:56:19 GMT",
    "summary": "The BBC has established the Chancellor left the Bank of England nine months earlier than she states in her LinkedIn profile.",
    "story": [
      "Questions have been raised about the accuracy of the chancellor's online CV, and the use of expenses while working at a bank, in the wake of a BBC News investigation.",
      "Rachel Reeves and two colleagues were the subject of an expenses probe while she was a senior manager at Halifax Bank of Scotland (HBOS) in the late 2000s.",
      "It was also revealed that the chancellor's online CV exaggerated the length of time she worked at the Bank of England.",
      "Sir Keir Starmer said Reeves has \"dealt with any issues that arise\" when asked about her CV by a reporter.",
      "The initial stage of the investigation found that a whistleblower's complaint was substantiated at HBOS, and the three employees appeared to have broken the rules, according to a senior source with direct knowledge of the probe.",
      "We have not been able to establish what the final outcome of the investigation was. Indeed, it may not have concluded.",
      "A spokesman for Reeves said the chancellor had no knowledge of the investigation, always complied with expenses rules and left the bank on good terms.",
      "BBC News investigates the Chancellor's expenses before she became an MP",
      "In a brief interview with a reporter, Sir Keir was asked about Rachel Reeves's CV.",
      "The prime minister was asked whether he was \"comfortable that she exaggerated her relevant experience\".",
      "He said the issues were from \"many years ago\" but that he and the chancellor \"get up every day to... make sure that the economy in our country, which was badly damaged under the last government, is revived and we have growth, and that is felt in the pockets of working people across the country\".",
      "Conservative leader Kemi Badenoch said the investigation raised questions for the chancellor.",
      "She posted on X: \"Keir Starmer said 'restoring trust in politics is the great test of our era'. Until she [Reeves] comes clean - not just about her CV but about the circumstances in which she left HBOS, no one will take him seriously.\"",
      "Rachel Reeves has frequently cited her time at the Bank of England as part of the reason that voters can trust her with the public finances, and has repeatedly claimed to have spent up to 10 years there.",
      "The chancellor left the financial institution nine months earlier than she stated in her LinkedIn profile. This means she spent five and a half years working at the bank - including nearly a year studying - despite publicly claiming to have spent a decade there.",
      "On the professional networking site LinkedIn, the chancellor's profile claimed she worked at the Bank of England from September 2000 to December 2006.",
      "However, BBC News has established she had left by March 2006 when she began working for Halifax Bank of Scotland (HBOS) in West Yorkshire.",
      "A spokesman for Reeves confirmed that dates on her LinkedIn were inaccurate and said it was due to an administrative error by the team.",
      "They said the chancellor hadn't seen it before it was published.",
      "Speaking before the prime minister was interviewed, a Downing Street spokesman said the prime minister had no concerns about Reeves's conduct.",
      "Asked whether Sir Keir still thought the chancellor had integrity after she updated her career history on LinkedIn, his official spokesman said: \"Yes. The Chancellor and the prime minister are working hand in hand to deliver on the priorities, the plan for change, and to deliver the higher growth and the improvements in living standards that the country needs.\"",
      "The Number 10 official added that the chancellor had gone through the declaration process, which all members of Cabinet go through, when asked if she disclosed that there had been an investigation into her expenses before she was an MP.",
      "Reeves's profile was updated on Thursday morning just before the BBC broke the news, to reflect that the chancellor left the Bank of England in March 2006",
      "The rest of the profile was subsequently edited to clarify the dates she worked at HBOS.",
      "A photo taken in March 2006 shows her with other HBOS staff at the Council of Mortgage Lenders annual lunch.",
      "A former HR lead for the bank who helped with Reeves's relocation also said she could recall her first day and it was in March 2006.",
      "In a 2021 magazine interview, which she subsequently posted on X, she said: \"I spent a decade working as an economist at the Bank of England and loved it.\"",
      "In a speech to the Labour Party Business Conference in February last year, Reeves said: \"I spent the best part of a decade as an economist at the Bank of England.\"",
      "She said the same thing in a speech at a CEO summit in July 2022, and in a video posted on her Facebook page in the same month.",
      "The claim was also repeated in a Labour party document last year which stated that she spent \"most of the first decade of her career at the Bank of England\".",
      "As she had already started at HBOS by the spring of 2006, her time at the central bank only amounted to five and a half years. This included nearly a year studying for a Masters at the London School of Economics (LSE).",
      "Last year, during previous controversy about Reeves's CV, the Bank of England confirmed that Reeves had left in 2006 but refused to give the month of her departure saying it was a detailed staff record which they couldn't provide.",
      "Reeves also stood for election in Bromley in south-east London more than three months after she had taken a job in West Yorkshire.",
      "She stood in a by-election on 29 June 2006 but had taken up a role at HBOS in March that year and received a relocation package to move from London. It is understood she rented a flat in Leeds and kept a flat in London at this time.",
      "The chancellor's online CV gives incorrect dates for her time at HBOS as well, which her team also acknowledged. It states that she left in December 2009, five months before she was elected to parliament in May 2010.",
      "In fact, we have established, her employment at HBOS finished in mid-May 2009, when she signed a compromise agreement. An invoice for legal advice on the agreement stated that it arose \"from a decision by your employer to terminate your employment\".",
      "The bank was undergoing restructuring at the time of Reeves's departure and a spokesman for the chancellor said she had taken voluntary redundancy.",
      "A compromise agreement, now known as a settlement agreement, is a legal document between an employer and employee which HBOS used when senior managers were made redundant.",
      "Reeves was allowed to continue using a company car for six months, according to her spokesman.",
      "She then spent a year campaigning ahead of the May 2010 general election without seeking further employment.",
      "The MP for Leeds West and Pudsey has previously faced accusations that she has embellished her online CV.",
      "Her LinkedIn profile was changed last year to describe her role at HBOS as \"Retail Banking\".",
      "It had previously claimed she worked as an economist at the bank but she instead held a management role in the bank's Customer Relations department, which dealt with complaints.",
      "In November, several MPs raised the row in the House of Commons while putting questions to Deputy Prime Minister Angela Rayner.",
      "The prime minister's spokeswoman also faced questions at that time, with journalists asking if Sir Keir expected members of his Cabinet to tell the truth on their CV.",
      "The spokeswoman said the row related to \"the chancellor's time before she was the chancellor\".",
      "\"The prime minister is very clear that what is most important is having a chancellor who is able to balance the books and who is able to be straight with the public and restore the public finances,\" she added.",

    "published": "Fri, 14 Feb 2025 15:42:29 GMT",
    "summary": "The surprise inclusion of VAT to calculate tariffs prompts questions over the possible impact on British businesses.",
    "story": [
      "Concerns are growing the UK could be more exposed to US trade taxes after President Donald Trump announced he would target VAT in his latest move.",
      "Trump has instructed his staff to develop custom so-called \"reciprocal tariffs\" for individual countries based in part on trading agreements, including imports and exports, with the US.",
      "The UK's trading relationship with US had suggested it would be less exposed to tariffs than others, but the surprise inclusion of VAT to calculate potential tariffs has prompted questions over the impact on British businesses.",
      "Analysts have suggested tariffs of 20% or more could be placed on the UK as well as the European Union, but the outcome remains uncertain.",
      "The British Chambers of Commerce (BCC) business group warned that cars, pharmaceuticals, and food and drink were specific goods which could be \"significantly hit\" by the measures, which were announced by the White House on Thursday.",
      "The latest announcement by Trump administration was wide-ranging and threatened retaliation by the US for not just trade tariffs, but for other \"unfair or harmful acts, policies or practices\".",
      "One of the justifications Trump has given to date for imposing tariffs on countries is whether they have a trade surplus with the US - i.e. they sell more to the US than they import from the country.",
      "The use of tariffs is part of Trump's efforts to protect American businesses and boost manufacturing.",
      "Trump launches plan to target countries with new tariffs",
      "UK not planning to hit back at US on steel tariffs",
      "UK signals it will seek US steel tariff exemption",
      "Both the UK and US claim to have trade surpluses with each other due to discrepancies in how the countries collect data. It remains uncertain whether Trump would exempt the UK from tariffs, but the introduction of Value Added Tax (VAT) into the equation complicates matters.",
      "The president's latest announcement cited VAT as an \"unfair, discriminatory or extraterritorial tax\".",
      "VAT tax is the tax people have to pay when people buy most goods or services, apart from food and children's clothes. The standard rate in the UK is 20% and it is levied regardless of whether a product has been imported from overseas or not.",
      "George Saravelos, global head of FX research at Deutsche Bank, said if the US imposed taxes based on existing tariffs and VAT combined, British businesses exporting to the US could face charges of 21%.",
      "\"If reciprocal tariffs are applied on a VAT basis, European countries would be much higher on the list of impacted countries,\" he said.",
      "William Bain, head of trade policy at the BCC, said the UK had a \"level of insulation\" due to it not exporting as many goods to the US in comparison to other countries.",
      "But he warned Trump's proposals would \"create more cost and uncertainty\" and \"upend established trade norms\".",
      "Fiona Conor, managing director of Trust Electric Heating, a Leeds-based radiator manufacturer which has plans to expand into the US, said if tariffs applied to her products, she would not want to pass on the costs through higher prices to customers.",
      "But she told the BBC's World At One that she was looking at starting production in the US \"because there is real, huge tax breaks for innovative companies like us to set up manufacturing in the US\".",
      "She said the government should \"be strong negotiators\", adding that Prime Minister Sir Keir Starmer needed to \"strengthen our partnership\" with the US.",
      "Paul Ashworth, chief UK economist for Capital Economics, said that most people would regard VAT as a non-discriminatory tax as it is applied to all goods whether they were produced domestically or imported.",
      "But he noted one of Trump's advisers had argued that given the US applied a much lower average sales tax at state level, VAT was a \"form of discriminatory tariff\".",
      "Mr Ashworth said it appeared the US president now favoured tariffs to be imposed on a \"country-by-country basis\" as opposed to his original idea of introducing universal tax on all imports to the US.",
      "'Difficult to predict'",
      "A tariff is a tax on imports collected by a government and it is paid by the company importing the good. Countries typically erect tariffs in a bid to protect certain sectors from foreign competition.",
      "But in protecting domestic businesses, prices for consumers can go up if a company importing goods from abroad passes higher costs on, rather than absorbing them or reducing imports.",
      "Caroline Ramsay, partner and head of international trade at law firm TLT, said it was \"difficult to predict\" what the latest announcement would mean for the UK.",
      "She suggested the word \"reciprocal\" did not mean what people might have first assumed, adding an assessment by the US would be made on what it considers to be fair.",
      "\"It does not mean that the USA is going to check what the UK tariff is on paper imports and match that tariff percentage for paper exports to the US from the UK,\" she added.",
      "Mr Bain argued it was \"vital\" that the UK government negotiated with Trump and did not get \"sucked into a trade war of tit-for-tat tariffs\".",
      "Senior UK government minister Pat McFadden said the government would wait before reacting.",
      "\"The most sensible thing to do with all of these announcements is to digest them, see if they actually come to pass, and then decide what you do.\""

    "published": "Fri, 14 Feb 2025 11:23:07 GMT",
    "summary": "They say the US should re-evaluate its cyber-security partnership with the UK unless the \"dangerous\" request is withdrawn.",
    "story": [
      "Two US lawmakers have strongly condemned what they call the UK's \"dangerous\"  and \"shortsighted\" request to be able to access encrypted data stored by Apple users worldwide in its cloud service.",
      "Senator Ron Wyden and Congressman Andy Biggs have written to national intelligence director Tulsi Gabbard saying the demand threatens the privacy and security of the US.",
      "They urge her to give the UK an ultimatum: \"Back down from this dangerous attack on US cybersecurity, or face serious consequences.\"",
      "The BBC has contacted the UK government for comment.",
      "\"While the UK has been a trusted ally, the US government must not permit what is effectively a foreign cyberattack waged through political means\", the US politicians wrote.",
      "If the UK does not back down Ms Gabbard should \"reevaluate US-UK cybersecurity arrangements and programs as well as US intelligence sharing\", they suggest.",
      "What is the UK seeking?",
      "The request for the data emerged last week.",
      "It applies to all content stored using what Apple calls \"Advanced Data Protection\" (ADP).",
      "This uses end-to-end encryption, where only the account holder can access the data stored. Apple itself cannot see it.",
      "It is an opt-in service, and not all users choose to activate it.",
      "The demand was first reported by the Washington Post, quoting sources familiar with the matter, and the BBC has spoken to similar contacts.",
      "The Home Office said then: \"We do not comment on operational matters, including for example confirming or denying the existence of any such notices.\"",
      "Apple declined to comment, but says on its website that it views privacy as a \"fundamental human right\".",
      "The order has been served by the Home Office under the Investigatory Powers Act, which compels firms to provide information to law enforcement agencies.",
      "Under the law, the demand by the Home Office cannot be made public.",
      "Senator Wyden and Congressman Biggs say agreeing to the request would \"undermine Americans' privacy rights and expose them to espionage by China, Russia and other adversaries\".",
      "They state that Apple does not make different versions of its encryption software for each country it operates in and, therefore, Apple customers in the UK will use the same software as Americans.",
      "\"If Apple is forced to build a backdoor in its products, that backdoor will end up in Americans' phones, tablets, and computers, undermining the security of Americans' data, as well as of the countless federal, state and local government agencies that entrust sensitive data to Apple products.\"",
      "The move by the UK government has stunned experts and worried privacy campaigners, with Privacy International calling it  an \"unprecedented attack\" on the private data of individuals.",
      "However the US government has previously asked Apple to break its encryption as part of criminal investigations.",
      "In 2016, Apple resisted a court order to write software which would allow US officials to access the iPhone of a gunman - though this was resolved after the FBI were able to successfully access the device.",
      "That same year, the US dropped a similar case after it was able to gain access by discovering the passcode of an alleged drug dealer.",
      "Similar cases have followed, including in 2020, when Apple refused to unlock iPhones of a man who carried out a mass shooting at a US air base. The FBI later said it had been able to \"gain access\" to the phones.",
      "It is understood that the UK government does not want to start combing through everybody's data.",
      "Rather it would want to access it if there were a risk to national security - in other words, it would be targeting an individual, rather than using it for mass surveillance.",
      "Authorities would still have to follow a legal process, have a good reason and request permission for a specific account in order to access data - just as they do now with unencrypted data.",
      "Apple has previously said it would pull encryption services like ADP from the UK market rather than comply with such government demands - telling Parliament it would \"never build a back door\" in its products.",
      "WhatsApp, owned by Meta, has also previously said it would choose being blocked over weakening message security.",
      "But even withdrawing the product from the UK might not be enough to ensure compliance - the Investigatory Powers Act applies worldwide to any tech firm with a UK market, even if they are not based there."

    "story": [
      "Work on a number of new towns will begin before the next general election after more than 100 locations across England were put forward, Housing Minister Matthew Pennycook has pledged.",
      "The government says most proposals are to extend existing towns or cities, alongside a \"smaller number\" of new standalone settlements.",
      "The aim is for each new town to have at least 10,000 homes, contributing towards Labour's 1.5 million five-year housebuilding target.",
      "Each should include infrastructure like public transport and schools, alongside affordable housing, ministers say.",
      "A visit to Milton Keynes by the PM to promote the policy was cut short earlier when farmers driving tractors staged a noisy protest.",
      "Ministers desperately want more housing - but are their plans radical enough?",
      "What's the new government's housebuilding target?",
      "Labour to select new town sites by end of first year",
      "The tractors' musical horns could be heard blaring across the building site shortly after Sir Keir Starmer arrived.",
      "It is the latest in a series of protests mounted by farmers against changes to inheritance tax on farms announced at October's Budget.",
      "Creating a new generation of new towns is a key element of the government's long-term plan for housebuilding, and part of its efforts to unlock economic growth.",
      "More than 100 potential sites across England have been suggested to a special taskforce set up to examine the options, after the government asked for expressions of interest from councils, housing developers and landowners.",
      "The sites have not been revealed, but London, the South East, the South West and the east of England have proved the most popular \u2013 though there were expressions of interest from every region.",
      "The taskforce will identify specific locations - as well as funding options - by the summer, with a view to construction on the first sites beginning by the time of the next election.",
      "Pennycook told BBC Radio 4's Today programme the aim was to build \"well-designed, affordable, attractive homes\" that would \"eventually house millions of people, just as the post-War waves of new towns did\".",
      "He described it as a \"transformational programme\" that he expected to \"make a contribution to housing numbers in this parliament\".",
      "However, speaking on Sky News, he conceded: \"These things take time to get off the ground. No one's pretending that the new towns programme is going to make up the bulk of that 1.5 million number.",
      "\"We're relying on the other changes we've made, including overhauling the national planning policy framework to get new sites coming through.\"",
      "He said he expected some of the construction to take place on greenfield - or undeveloped - land, but there would also be \"big expansions of existing towns and cities where that is appropriate\".",
      "\"There's got to be sustainable places, as I say, they've got to be well-connected, well-designed.\"",
      "The plan envisages an initial injection of government funding to buy land, which would be returned when sites were sold for a higher price to private developers, and would help pay for local infrastructure.",
      "Sir Keir said the construction of new towns would form part of \"the largest housebuilding programme since the post-war era\", and help offer \"working people...  the security and stability that owning your own home bring\".",

      "Spending review",
      "When the policy was originally unveiled at the party's conference in 2023, Labour set out a plan to use state-backed companies to construct a wave of new towns near English cities, echoing those built by Labour after World War Two.",
      "However, it is not clear how much public money will be allocated to the initiative.",
      "Pennycook told Today this would be decided in the government's spending review which will conclude in June and set spending plans for the next three years.",
      "The review, which is being conducted in a period of minimal economic growth against the backdrop of Labour's self-imposed fiscal constraints, will see ministers haggle for money for their departments.",
      "Chancellor Rachel Reeves has told departments to identify 5% \"efficiency savings\" as part of the process, to ensure key services are prioritised for funding.",
      "Polly Neate, chief executive of housing and homelessness charity Shelter, urged the government to provide \"serious investment\" in affordable social housing \"to drive up building to the scale the country desperately needs\".",
      "\"New towns are a huge opportunity for the government to tackle housing need and provide local communities with homes they can actually afford to live in. The government must commit serious investment at the Spending Review in June to drive up building to the scale the country desperately needs.\"",
      "Clement Attlee's 1945-51 government planned the first wave of new towns to relocate people from poor or bombed-out housing, with development corporations assigned responsibility for building them.",
      "Stevenage in Hertfordshire was the first such town created, with 10 others following by 1955, including Crawley in Sussex, Harlow in Essex, and Newton Aycliffe in County Durham.",

      "The UK economy unexpectedly grew in the final three months of last year following a boost to the construction and services sectors.",
      "The economy expanded by 0.1% between October and December, according to official figures, despite analysts predicting it would contract.",
      "Growth in the quarter was driven by a range of industries, from pubs and bars to machinery manufacturers, having a strong December.",
      "However, the figures also indicated living standards last year were slightly lower than in 2023 on average.",
      "With tax rises coming into force in April, concerns remain that economic growth will remain sluggish for sometime.",
      "Businesses have warned that paying more in National Insurance, along with minimum wages rising and business rates relief being reduced, could affect the economy's ability to grow, with employers expecting to have less cash to give pay rises and create new jobs.",

      "They began with scrutiny of her online CV late last year.",

      "Rachel Reeves's online CV exaggerated how long she spent working at the Bank of England",
      "Gillett also made another claim about Reeves's time at the bank from 2006 to 2009, writing that she: \"Nearly got sacked due to an expenses scandal where the 3 senior managers were all signing off each others expenses.\"",
      "Reeves's team vigorously denied the allegations.",
      "However, Labour's imminent victory in last summer's general election prompted a post on a private Facebook group for former HBOS employees that BBC News has seen asking if anyone remembered Reeves.",
      "One former employee replied: \"the expenses dept certainly do!\"",
      "Several others made reference to Reeves being investigated over her expenses spending.",
      "BBC News has been seeking the truth behind these suggestions, speaking to more than 20 people, many of whom were former colleagues, and gaining access to receipts, emails and other documents.",
      "We have learnt that there was an expenses investigation into Reeves and two other senior managers.",
      "A detailed six-page whistleblowing complaint and dozens of pages of attached evidence, which we have seen, raised concerns that the three managers were using the bank's money to \"fund a lifestyle\" with allegedly inappropriate spending on dinners, events, taxis and gifts, including for each other.",
      "We have not been able to establish what the final outcome of the investigation was. Indeed it may not have concluded.",
      "But the initial part of the investigation, which was conducted by Internal Audit at the request of the bank's risk department, found that the three managers appeared to have broken the rules and the whistleblower's allegations were substantiated, according to a senior source with knowledge of the investigation.",
      "A spokesman for Reeves said the Chancellor had no knowledge of the investigation, always complied with expenses rules and left the bank on good terms.",
      "Banking career",
      "Reeves was in her 20s and trying to become an MP when she took up a job at Halifax Bank of Scotland in West Yorkshire in 2006.",
      "The role required her to move north from London, where she had unsuccessfully stood as Labour's parliamentary candidate in what had been a safe Conservative seat.",
      "She initially worked in the mortgage department, but in late 2007 moved to become Head of Business Planning in the Customer Relations department, which handled complaints.",
      "Her career at HBOS coincided with what would prove to be a tumultuous time for the bank.",
      "The global financial crisis which began in late summer of 2007 would force the sector to embark on a massive programme of job cuts and cost savings.",
      "In September 2008, HBOS itself came close to collapse, requiring a government-brokered takeover by Lloyds and an emergency bailout which would total \u00a320.5bn of taxpayers' money.",
      "It was shortly after this near-collapse, by early 2009, that a whistleblower from her department raised concerns about the spending habits of Reeves and two other managers, one of whom was Reeves's boss.",

      "Rachel Reeves: Playing Labour's first big gambit",
      "Before this, in late 2008, a memo was circulated to Reeves and others which called for tighter cost control in the department.",
      "Written by a planning and strategy manager, the document, \"Financial Risk Control within Customer Relations\", raised concerns about \"spending on travel\" and on corporate spending cards, including Motivation cards which were used to reward staff.",
      "It laid out proposals to \"improve cost controls\" which included monthly discussions with Reeves and another of the senior managers who the whistleblower claimed had mis-used expenses to \"give visibility of claims, invoices, Thanks card use and reports\".",
      "Separately, Reeves was emailed in mid-December 2008 about proposals for a presentation setting out how much had been spent on Motivation cards, recognising top performers and on taxi travel, to \"focus attention on particular aspects of travel that are costly and perhaps need more consideration\".",
      "Reeves replied to say that she was not sure a \"huge analysis\" was needed and she wanted to see the papers before they went any further.",
      "Whistleblower complaint and investigation",
      "The whistleblower's complaint submitted by early 2009 was a six-page document laying out a range of concerns about an alleged spending culture in the Customer Relations department.",
      "It focused on the behaviour of three individuals: Reeves, Reeves's boss, and another senior manager in the department. Reeves's boss, who we are not naming, was responsible for signing off the expenses of the other two managers.",
      "The report and attached receipts and other documents seen by BBC News show Reeves was accused of spending hundreds of pounds on handbags, perfume, earrings and wine for colleagues, including one gift for her boss. Concern was also expressed about her spending on taxis and on a Christmas party. The whistleblower believed the spending to be excessive.",
      "After a call to the whistleblowing hotline, the whistleblower was instructed to hand in a physical copy of their report and supporting evidence, two sources said.",
      "A separate source, who contacted BBC News themselves in the wake of an article on the furore around Reeves's CV last year, was also aware that someone had blown the whistle on Reeves and another colleague.",
      "The report was passed to the bank's risk department and, at their request, was taken on by the Internal Audit department.",
      "A source who worked in risk at the bank told us: \"Given the nature of the allegations \u2013 claiming expenses for things you wouldn't normally claim expenses for \u2013 and the relative seniority of the individuals, the matter was referred for investigation by a team outside of that department.\"",
      "The Internal Audit department, which had access to expenses claims and sign-offs, then assessed the complaint and supporting documents, according to two sources.",
      "It found that there was evidence of apparent wrongdoing by the three senior managers including Reeves, a senior source with direct knowledge of the investigation told BBC News.",
      "Internal Audit completed its involvement in the investigation and passed its findings to an investigative part of the Risk department in around April 2009. The normal process would then have been for the managers to be interviewed about the allegations. There would then be an assessment of potential disciplinary action if necessary.",
      "However it does not appear that this next interview stage took place, or that the investigation ever reached a formal conclusion. Reeves insisted she was never interviewed, as did her boss, who said she was \"not aware of an expenses probe and my departure was not related to any alleged investigation\". The other senior manager declined to comment.",
      "There is no evidence of which we are aware that the bank's internal investigation was completed, or that there was ever a concluding finding of any wrongdoing.",
      "Reeves left the bank in May 2009, as did her boss. The other senior manager was on sick leave in May and never returned to work at the bank.",
      "There is no suggestion any of the departures were linked to the investigation or spending issues and a spokesman for Reeves said the Chancellor left the bank on good terms.",
      "They also provided a statement from the lawyer who provided legal advice on the compromise agreement - a voluntary legal document ending an employee's employment - she signed on her departure.",
      "He said it was a \"standard-style agreement adopted by the company when a mutually agreed exit was made during the bank's restructure\".",
      "\"Absolutely no allegations of wrongdoing or misconduct were mentioned by the HBOS HR team during this process,\" he said.",
      "Expenses allegations",
      "What lay behind the whistleblower's complaint and the grumbles of other colleagues was unhappiness relating to several different areas of spending.",
      "One concern was the use of bank payment cards to pay for Christmas and birthday gifts.",
      "\"A culture developed among senior managers in Customer Relations where gifts were given freely to direct reports  - both upwards and downwards,\" one former colleague of Reeves claimed.",
      "\"[They had] a very cavalier attitude regarding the budget in the department.\"",
      "Reeves and the other senior managers had both a corporate credit card and another payment card known as a 'Motivation' or 'Thanks' card.",
      "The Motivation card was intended to be used to reward high-performers for good work.",
      "There was guidance about its use. In February 2008 a memo instructed HBOS employees on the correct use of Motivation cards, which were widely used within the Customer Relations department.",
      "It stated that the cards were to be used to \"reward/acknowledge colleagues who have gone the extra mile\".",
      "Suggested gifts included \"chocolates, flowers, wine, vouchers or you could simply log on and send a free e-card to say 'Thanks' for a job well done\", the memo said.",
      "It warned that managers would be \"responsible for all transactions on your card and will be held accountable if spending on your statement cannot be verified\".",
      "Spending in this area was scrutinised because the company incurred tax on it.",
      "The memo doesn't explicitly prohibit Christmas and birthday gifts.",
      "But 11 former employees told us they had never heard of colleagues being bought birthday gifts with the bank's money, and believed that doing so was in breach of the rules. Several said any birthday gifts were bought with their own money.",
      "However, one ex-staff member, Jane Wayper, a former HR business partner who was given permission to speak to us by Reeves's team, claimed that \"birthday gifts and Christmas presents could be purchased using Motivation cards\" and \"staff were encouraged to do so for their teams\".",
      "Reeves bought birthday presents for colleagues with HBOS's money throughout her time in Customer Relations, receipts show, with purchases including wine and cosmetics. Some were bought using a Motivation card, while others were reimbursed through an expenses claim.",
      "She also spent \u00a3152 on a handbag and perfume as a present for her boss using the bank's money, according to the whistleblower's report. The present was a joint gift from Reeves and one of the other managers who was later investigated alongside her.",
      "And she bought earrings as a present for her PA, which she claimed back on expenses.",
      "Her PA, Linda Barrowclough, said she had received Christmas and birthday gifts from Reeves but had assumed they were \"personal gifts [and] they'd have come out of her own pocket\".",
      "Reeves also used her Motivation card to spend more than \u00a3400 on a leaving meal for a colleague, which the whistleblowing complaint claimed was not a permitted use.",
      "Christmas gifts",
      "The situation around Christmas gifts, which Reeves also bought for her PA and others, was more complicated.",
      "That's because, according to internal bank guidance we have seen, these could be bought on expenses providing they were small gifts of \u00a325 or less and they were not bought using the Motivation card.",
      "The \u00a325 limit was based on tax advice as anything more substantial would attract tax.",
      "It appeared to her colleagues that Reeves had broken these rules.",
      "But there does appear to have been confusion about the policy. We have also seen emails showing that Reeves was encouraged by her boss to buy more expensive Christmas presents, and to pay for them with her Motivation card.",
      "In late October 2008, Reeves's manager wrote that \"after checking with other departments, it looks like the standard practice of buying\u202fChristmas\u202fgifts for direct reports using motivation bank will continue this year\", emails seen by the BBC show.",
      "She suggested spending \u00a350 to \u00a375 per person on the presents.",
      "A reminder titled \"further clarity\" about how to buy Christmas gifts and how much to spend was circulated by another HBOS employee in early December, emails show.",
      "Reeves and the other managers who were later investigated were all among the recipients of this email confirming the rules on Christmas gifts.",
      "While seasonal gifts, such as at Christmas, were allowed, the managers were explicitly told they could not use Motivation cards for these purchases. The cost of these \"trivial\" gifts was also not allowed to exceed \u00a325, in line with\u202fHMRC guidance, the email said.",
      "This is because rewards for performance at work are taxable whereas seasonal gifts such as those given for Christmas, providing they are not too costly, are exempt.",
      "Replying to the email, Reeves wrote that she didn't understand why the \"goal posts are shifting\" and said she had already ordered and paid for her presents using \"Motivation Bank/Thanks, and I do not intend to cancel them,\" claiming this would cost more time and money.",
      "A colleague responsible for finance acknowledged that the message on paying for Christmas gifts hadn't always been clear but said: \"I don't believe that the goalposts are being moved.\"",
      "Receipts show that gifts bought by Reeves at Christmas 2008 included a \u00a349 handbag for her PA, while she herself received \u00a355 worth of wine from her boss.",
      "Open secret?",
      "There was a widespread belief at the bank that there had been an expenses investigation into Reeves and two colleagues.",
      "But Reeves has said that she has no recollection of being investigated or having questions raised over her expenses.",
      "A spokesman for Reeves said she was \"proud of the work she did at HBOS\" and was not aware of the claims about her expenses until approached by the BBC.",
      "\"She was not aware of an investigation nor was she interviewed, and she did not face any disciplinary action on this or any other matters. All expenses were submitted and signed off in the proper way,\" she said.",
      "The spokesman also said Reeves left in 2009 \"on good terms and received a severance payment, including her full notice pay and bonus\".",
      "\"HBOS allowed her to keep a company car for six months after she left and she was given a favourable reference.\"",
      "Reeves's team put forward several former HBOS employees for interview who they said corroborated her account that she had not been investigated.",
      "One said she hadn't seen evidence of senior managers misusing expenses and the bank had controls to prevent it but she left in February 2008, more than a year before Reeves departed. She also said that she had never heard of giving birthday and Christmas gifts at HBOS's expense as being part of the bank's policies.",
      "Another, Jane Wayper, the former HR business partner, said in a statement that she didn't recognise the accusations against Reeves and \"would have been aware of any investigation which concluded there was a case to answer\" as she would have been involved in the disciplinary process.",
      "She said there was \"extensive oversight of all expenses policies\" and claimed that \"birthday gifts and Christmas presents could be purchased using Motivation cards\". But this is at odds with a document seen by BBC News and the testimony of 11 sources we have spoken to.",
      "Many of Reeves' former HBOS colleagues were worried about the consequences of sharing confidential information with BBC News but believe it is in the public interest for what happened, and their concerns about the now-Chancellor's spending of the bank's money, to be reported.",
      "But, given their concerns about speaking out publicly, we have agreed not to name them.",
      "A Downing Street spokesman said the prime minister had no concerns about Reeves's conduct.",
      "Asked whether Sir Keir Starmer still thought the Chancellor had integrity after she updated her career history on LinkedIn, his official spokesman said: \"Yes. The Chancellor and the prime minister are working hand in hand to deliver on the priorities, the plan for change, and to deliver the higher growth and the improvements in living standards that the country needs.\"",
      "The Number 10 official added that the chancellor had gone through the declaration process, which all members of Cabinet go through, when asked if she disclosed that there had been an investigation into her expenses before she was an MP.",
      "Conservative leader Kemi Badenoch said the investigation raised questions for the chancellor.",
      "She posted on X: \"Keir Starmer said 'restoring trust in politics is the great test of our era'. Until she [Reeves] comes clean - not just about her CV but about the circumstances in which she left HBOS, no one will take him seriously.\"",
      "The investigation at HBOS was not the last time Reeves would face scrutiny over her expenses.",
      "In 2015, it emerged that she was among 19 MPs who had had their official credit cards suspended by the parliamentary expenses watchdog after failing to show their spending was valid.",
      "Reeves owed more than \u00a34,000 in spending at the time when her card was blocked. She subsequently cleared her debt.",

      "Her parents separated when she was at primary school, and she and younger sister Ellie, also a Labour MP, were shuttled between separate homes.",
      "During the school holidays, the sisters would spend time with their grandparents in the Northamptonshire town of Kettering.",
      "They would be taken to do the rounds of relatives' houses, who would give them a 20p or 50p piece each. At the end of their week, they were taken to the local toy shop to choose their goodies. While Ellie would spend all her cash, the young Rachel would allow herself a smaller treat and save most of the money.",
      "Decades later, Chancellor Reeves would say that kind of restraint defines her, and she has very much modelled herself on Gordon Brown\u2019s \"prudence\" in the lead-up to Labour\u2019s 1997 election win.",
      "Chess talent",
      "Reeves played chess from an early age, with her father teaching her the key moves. She became a national under-14 champion, and would \"quietly thrash\" any boys who might think they were in for an easy game, according to Ellie.",
      "She has credited chess with teaching her \"to think ahead, to plan a strategy\".",
      "A keen flute player, she took her music GCSE a year early at Beckenham's Cator Park School for Girls, a comprehensive, and would go on to gain four A grades at A-level.",
      "Seeing the extent of cuts at her school, where the library had been turned into a classroom and the sixth form consisted of \"two pre-fab huts in the playground\", she has said she was politicised by her own experience of public services. At the age of 16, she joined the Labour Party.",
      "She went on to study Philosophy, Politics and Economics at Oxford University. As a student, she would host others before college discos, blasting out Destiny's Child songs and dressing up in her room.",
      "Despite her serious demeanour, colleagues and friends have suggested the Labour MP's public persona does not reflect her human side, including a loud laugh and a deep love of Beyonc\u00e9 tracks.",

      "The initial stage of the HBOS investigation found that a whistleblower's complaint was substantiated, and the three employees appeared to have broken the rules, according to a senior source with direct knowledge of the probe.",
      "The BBC has not been able to establish what the final outcome of the investigation was and it might not have concluded.",
      "A spokesman for Reeves said the chancellor had no knowledge of the investigation, always complied with expenses rules and left the bank on good terms.",
      "Reeves has also faced questions about the accuracy of her online CV, which the BBC found exaggerated the length of time she worked at the Bank of England.",
      "A spokesman for Reeves confirmed that dates on her LinkedIn were inaccurate and blamed an administrative error by the team.",
      "Last year, her LinkedIn profile was also changed to describe her role at HBOS as \"Retail Banking\".",

      "Throughout Jeremy Corbyn's four and a half years as Labour leader, she remained on the backbenches because she felt she could not endorse his policies. Called a \"Red Tory\" by some in the party, she described this as a \"very unpleasant period\" in an interview with the BBC's Nick Robinson.",
      "A former editor of the BBC's Newsnight programme was forced to issue a written apology to Reeves after calling her \"boring snoring\" on social media in a post that was meant to be a private message.",
      "While she said the incident was \"deeply humiliating\", her key objective after Sir Keir Starmer appointed her shadow chancellor was to portray Labour as a steady, pro-business hand on the economy.",
      "In October 2023, she admitted she \"should have done better\" after it emerged some passages in her book, The Women Who Made Modern Economics, had been lifted from other sources without acknowledgment.",
      "She told the BBC some sentences \"were not properly referenced\" and this would be corrected in future reprints.",

      "Despite Labour's attempts to win over businesses during the election campaign, many were disappointed they bore the brunt of the \u00a340bn in tax rises announced in her first Budget.",
      "Before winning power, Reeves promised she would govern with \"iron discipline\" and bring stability to the public finances, leading to comparisons with Conservative \"Iron Chancellor\" Margaret Thatcher.",

    "published": "Sat, 15 Feb 2025 00:45:06 GMT",
    "summary": "The world's frozen oceans keep the planet cool, but they currently have less ice than ever recorded before.",
    "story": [
      "The world's frozen oceans, which help to keep the planet cool, currently have less ice than ever previously recorded, satellite data shows.",
      "Sea-ice around the north and south poles acts like a giant mirror by reflecting much of the Sun's energy back into space.",
      "But as rising temperatures cause this bright layer to shrink, the dark ocean below can absorb more heat, warming the planet further.",
      "This latest sea-ice low appears to have been driven by a combination of warm air, warm seas and winds breaking apart the ice.",
      "Over the 5 days to 13 February, the combined extent of Arctic and Antarctic sea-ice was 15.76 million sq km (6.08 million sq miles), according to BBC analysis of data from the US National Snow and Ice Data Center (NSIDC).",
      "This breaks the previous 5-day record low of 15.93 million sq km (6.15 million sq miles) from January-February 2023.",
      "Arctic sea-ice is currently at its smallest recorded extent for the time of year, while Antarctic sea-ice is close to a new low in satellite records going back to the late 1970s.",
      "The decline of Arctic sea-ice in response to a warming planet is well-established. Its end-of-summer extent fell from an average of 7 million sq km in the 1980s to 4.5 million sq km in the 2010s.",
      "But until the mid-2010s, Antarctic sea-ice had been remarkably resilient, defying predictions that it would shrink.",
      "Since then, Antarctica has shown a series of very low sea-ice extents, although there is still lots of natural variability.",
      "\"Every year, every data point that we get suggests that this isn't a temporary shift, but something more permanent, like what we've seen in the Arctic,\" Walter Meier, senior research scientist at NSIDC, told BBC News.",
      "\"It is indicating that the Antarctic has moved into a new regime of lower ice extents.\"",
      "Antarctic sea-ice is relatively thin and mobile - being surrounded by ocean rather than continents like the Arctic - so it can be particularly sensitive to winds breaking up the ice.",
      "But warmer air and warmer waters look to have played a key role in this latest 2025 low, towards the end of the southern hemisphere summer.",
      "The Antarctic ice-shelves \u2013 ice flowing off the Antarctic continent, rather than sea-ice \u2013 appear to have had a particularly extreme season of surface melting, driven by high air temperatures.",
      "\"Atmospheric conditions in December and January looked like they were strongly promoting surface melting on the ice-shelves,\" said Tom Bracegirdle, research scientist at the British Antarctic Survey.",
      "\"That could also have contributed to what we've seen in Antarctic sea-ice, and ongoing ocean warming is setting the backdrop to all of this as well.\"",
      "Antarctica's record sea-ice low of 2023 would have been a one-in-2,000 year event without climate change, according to a recent study. Yet 2025 is not far from eclipsing it.",
      "At the other end of the planet, the Arctic should be reaching its annual maximum, with cold winter temperatures helping the oceans to freeze over.",
      "But current sea-ice extent is nearly 0.2 million sq km below anything previously recorded for the time of year, and has been tracking very low since late 2024.",
      "This is partly as a result of a late freeze-up of ice around Hudson Bay, with unusually warm ocean waters taking a long time to cool down.",
      "As well as warmer seas, some storms also disrupted ice around the Barents and Bering Seas, with the consequences likely amplified by long-term reductions in sea-ice thickness.",
      "\"A thinner ice cover is more responsive to weather [\u2026 so] weather events can have a stronger impact than they used to,\" said Julienne Stroeve, professor of polar observation and modelling at University College London.",
      "In recent weeks, Arctic sea-ice has moved even further below average. Temperatures around the north pole were about 20C above normal in early February, leading to melting conditions in places like Svalbard.",
      "This \"is quite astonishing\" for the time of year, according to Dr Bracegirdle.",
      "This very low winter extent doesn't necessarily mean the Arctic will end up with record conditions throughout 2025, as conditions can change quickly at the poles.",
      "But, with the Arctic warming nearly four times faster than the global average, declines over the coming decades are almost inevitable.",
      "The Arctic is expected to be essentially free of sea-ice at the end of its summer at least once before 2050, according to the UN's Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change. Some recent studies suggest it could happen sooner.",
      "Declining sea-ice at both poles not only has implications for local wildlife like polar bears and penguins, but also the Earth's climate.",
      "Polar sea-ice has already lost around 14% of its natural cooling effect since the early-to-mid 1980s, as the area of bright, reflective ice has declined, according to a study published last year.",
      "\"If you significantly change the sea ice distribution in and around Antarctica, you modify that part of the planet which is actually helping us fight against climate change,\" said Simon Josey, a professor at the National Oceanography Centre.",
      "Sea-ice also plays an important role in the great ocean conveyor, the mass movement of water that helps distribute heat around the planet and keeps places like the UK and north-west Europe relatively mild.",
      "\"If we see another strong winter loss [of Antarctic sea-ice], people are going to start to worry about what it's doing to the ocean circulation,\" said Prof Josey.",

      "Nearly 700 foreign seasonal agricultural labourers complained to the Worker Support Centre (WSC) charity in 2024 they were being treated unfairly by farmers who had brought them over to work, compared to just over 400 in 2023.",
      "One former fruit picker told the BBC more must be done to protect migrants from being treated like slaves.",
      "The UK government said it always took \"decisive action\" if abusive practices were found on farms.",
      "Bolivian Julia Quecano Casimiro came to the UK on a seasonal worker visa to pick cherries for Haygrove, a Herefordshire-based farm business.",
      "Ms Casimiro is currently taking the company to an employment tribunal over claims of unfair dismissal, discrimination and underpayment of wages, and now campaigns for better protection for seasonal farm workers.",
      "In an initial ruling, the Home Office found there were reasonable grounds to believe that Ms Casimiro could have been a victim of modern slavery.",
      "She told the BBC she feared the true scale of exploitation of workers was a \"hidden problem\", adding: \"Many seasonal workers continue to have their rights violated at this very moment.",
      "\"What is happening is very serious because we don't have access to any assistance or support.",
      "\"If the UK government does not take action to stop what is happening there will continue to be more victims of modern slavery.\"",
      "A spokeswoman for Haygrove said Ms Casimiro's discontent was prompted by a discrepancy in the face value of flight tickets and the amount loaned to workers for the tickets, and lower than typical hours of work available in the month of July, as a result of extraordinary weather conditions.",
      "The company added that her allegations are \"materially incorrect and misleading\" and that it has \"never had accusations of this nature before in the history of our business\".",
      "It told the BBC that its practices \"are routinely audited by a range of third-party bodies, including by the Gangmasters and Labour Abuse Authority (GLAA), the Home Office, the British Retail Consortium, Red Tractor/Assured Produce, LEAF, Soil Association and SEDEX\".",
      "The company said Ms Casimiro worked at Hayford for 11 days before leaving with a free air ticket home, and her claims were based on a \"short-lived, snapshot, atypical experience\".",
      "\"We take great care in ensuring fairness and equality in our recruitment and working processes,\" the spokeswoman added.",
      "'Deeply concerned'",
      "The company said it is also co-operating with a nationwide GLAA investigation into how companies recruited 20 Indonesian workers.",

      "The Haygrove spokeswoman said: \"We are deeply concerned by claims that Indonesian workers were charged illegal fees by recruitment agents, which is strictly against our policy and principles.\"",
      "She added that the company took any allegations of misconduct \"very seriously\" and had \"co-operated fully with investigations by the GLAA\".",

      "However, the WSC, which works to prevent abuses of marginalised workers, said it dealt with a rise in complaints about the scheme during 2024.",
      "One man, from Kyrgyzstan, who worked on different farms in England and Scotland on and off over three years, told the WSC he had been expected to live in poor conditions, been discriminated against and been unfairly dismissed.",
      "The worker, who wanted to remain anonymous to protect future job opportunities, told the BBC through a translator that he felt standards had got worse over that time and farm employers did not care about workers' wellbeing, or level of pay.",
      "The WSC said its caseworkers dealt with 158 farm labourers in one month last summer and referred 19 cases involving 101 individuals to enforcement agencies. The workers were mainly Kazakh, Kyrgyz, Tajik and Uzbek.",
      "The charity wants a review of the seasonal agricultural worker scheme and of any risks of exploitation it presents.",
      "A Home Office spokeswoman said its staff had visited 318 farms and carried out more than 2,100 worker interviews, with improvements made every year to stop exploitation and poor working conditions.",

      "A discovery underneath the basement of an office block has been described as one of the most important pieces of Roman history unearthed in the city of London.",
      "Archaeologists have found a substantial piece of the ancient city's first basilica - a 2,000 year old public building where major political, economic and administrative decisions were made.",
      "The excavation has so far revealed sections of stone wall that formed the base of the basilica, which would have been two-and-a-half storeys high.",
      "The site, which will eventually be opened to the public, sheds light on the city's beginnings.",
      "\"This is so significant - this is the heart of Roman London,\" said Sophie Jackson, from the Museum of London Archaeology (Mola), who revealed the new find exclusively to BBC News.",
      "\"This building will tell us so much about the origins of London, why London grew and why it was chosen as the capital of Britain. It's just amazing.\"",
      "The site was discovered at 85 Gracechurch Street, an office building that's about to be demolished and redeveloped.",
      "Earlier archaeological investigations revealed the ancient basilica's approximate location, so the team created several small test pits to see what was hidden beneath the concrete floor.",
      "On the third attempt, digging between the filing cabinets, they struck lucky.",
      "\"You can see a huge chunk of Roman masonry, and it's incredible that it survives this well. We're absolutely thrilled that there's so much of it here,\" said Sophie Jackson.",
      "The wall is made from a type of limestone from Kent, and formed an imposing building - the basilica would have been about 40m long, 20m wide and 12m high.",
      "Other artefacts have been found too, including a roof tile imprinted with the stamp of an official from the ancient city.",
      "The basilica was part of London's forum, a social and commercial hub with a courtyard that was about the size of a football pitch.",
      "\"The basilica is the town hall, and then in front of it was a big open market square with a range of shops and offices around the outside,\" explained Ms Jackson.",
      "\"It's the place you came to do business, to get your court case sorted out, it's where laws were made, and it's where decisions were made about London, but also about the rest of the country.\"",
      "It was built around 80 AD, just a few decades after the Romans invaded Britain and founded Londinium - the Roman name for the city.",
      "But the first basilica and forum were only in use for about 20 years. They were replaced by a much larger second forum, perhaps reflecting how quickly the city was growing in size and importance.",
      "The discovery has meant a change of plans for the building's owners, Hertshten Properties.",
      "The Roman remains, which will now be fully excavated, are to be incorporated into the new offices - pending planning approval - and opened up to the public.",
      "For the architects, redesigning a building around an archaeological site has had some technical challenges.",
      "\"The scheme has been comprehensively adjusted,\" explained James Taylor from architecture firm Woods Bagot.",
      "\"Simple things like the columns have had to literally move position, so you're not destroying all these special stones that we found in the ground.\"",
      "And so as not to disturb what's there, fewer lifts can now be installed - and this has meant that the team has had to reduce the height of the building.",
      "But Mr Taylor said the effort will be worth it.",
      "\"To actually see people using and enjoying the space, moving through the public hall and down to see the remains, will be absolutely incredible.\"",
      "This is the latest piece of Roman history to be discovered lying beneath the streets of London's Square Mile. And there's a growing effort to find innovative ways to show these sites to the public.",
      "Parts of an amphitheatre are on display under a glass floor at the Guildhall Art Gallery, and at Bloomberg's offices, people can visit the Temple of Mithras, which has been brought to life with an immersive sound and light installation.",
      "Chris Hayward from the City of London Corporation says he wants more people to experience the link between the past and the present.",
      "\"The fact that Roman London is beneath your feet is, frankly, quite a remarkable emotion to experience,\" he said.",
      "\"You can actually see and visualise how Roman London would have been in those times. And then you can walk outside and you can say, 'now look at the skyscrapers, now look at the office blocks', this is progress, but at the same time, progress combined with preservation.\""

    "story": [
      "The world's frozen oceans, which help to keep the planet cool, currently have less ice than ever previously recorded, satellite data shows.",
      "Sea-ice around the north and south poles acts like a giant mirror by reflecting much of the Sun's energy back into space.",
      "But as rising temperatures cause this bright layer to shrink, the dark ocean below can absorb more heat, warming the planet further.",
      "This latest sea-ice low appears to have been driven by a combination of warm air, warm seas and winds breaking apart the ice.",
      "Over the 5 days to 13 February, the combined extent of Arctic and Antarctic sea-ice was 15.76 million sq km (6.08 million sq miles), according to BBC analysis of data from the US National Snow and Ice Data Center (NSIDC).",
      "This breaks the previous 5-day record low of 15.93 million sq km (6.15 million sq miles) from January-February 2023.",
      "Arctic sea-ice is currently at its smallest recorded extent for the time of year, while Antarctic sea-ice is close to a new low in satellite records going back to the late 1970s.",
      "The decline of Arctic sea-ice in response to a warming planet is well-established. Its end-of-summer extent fell from an average of 7 million sq km in the 1980s to 4.5 million sq km in the 2010s.",
      "But until the mid-2010s, Antarctic sea-ice had been remarkably resilient, defying predictions that it would shrink.",
      "Since then, Antarctica has shown a series of very low sea-ice extents, although there is still lots of natural variability.",
      "\"Every year, every data point that we get suggests that this isn't a temporary shift, but something more permanent, like what we've seen in the Arctic,\" Walter Meier, senior research scientist at NSIDC, told BBC News.",
      "\"It is indicating that the Antarctic has moved into a new regime of lower ice extents.\"",
      "Antarctic sea-ice is relatively thin and mobile - being surrounded by ocean rather than continents like the Arctic - so it can be particularly sensitive to winds breaking up the ice.",
      "But warmer air and warmer waters look to have played a key role in this latest 2025 low, towards the end of the southern hemisphere summer.",
      "The Antarctic ice-shelves \u2013 ice flowing off the Antarctic continent, rather than sea-ice \u2013 appear to have had a particularly extreme season of surface melting, driven by high air temperatures.",
      "\"Atmospheric conditions in December and January looked like they were strongly promoting surface melting on the ice-shelves,\" said Tom Bracegirdle, research scientist at the British Antarctic Survey.",
      "\"That could also have contributed to what we've seen in Antarctic sea-ice, and ongoing ocean warming is setting the backdrop to all of this as well.\"",
      "Antarctica's record sea-ice low of 2023 would have been a one-in-2,000 year event without climate change, according to a recent study. Yet 2025 is not far from eclipsing it.",
      "At the other end of the planet, the Arctic should be reaching its annual maximum, with cold winter temperatures helping the oceans to freeze over.",
      "But current sea-ice extent is nearly 0.2 million sq km below anything previously recorded for the time of year, and has been tracking very low since late 2024.",
      "This is partly as a result of a late freeze-up of ice around Hudson Bay, with unusually warm ocean waters taking a long time to cool down.",
      "As well as warmer seas, some storms also disrupted ice around the Barents and Bering Seas, with the consequences likely amplified by long-term reductions in sea-ice thickness.",
      "\"A thinner ice cover is more responsive to weather [\u2026 so] weather events can have a stronger impact than they used to,\" said Julienne Stroeve, professor of polar observation and modelling at University College London.",
      "In recent weeks, Arctic sea-ice has moved even further below average. Temperatures around the north pole were about 20C above normal in early February, leading to melting conditions in places like Svalbard.",

      "Oil giant BP has said it will \"fundamentally reset\" its strategy as profits dropped sharply last year.",
      "It is widely expected to say later this month that it will scale back renewable projects and increase oil and gas production following similar moves from rivals including Shell and Equinor.",
      "BP's net income fell to $8.9bn (\u00a37.2bn) in 2024, down from $13.8bn the previous year.",
      "It said lower oil and gas prices, plus lower profits from its refineries, had dented how much money it had made.",
      "Five years ago BP set a target of 50GW of renewables generation capacity by 2030.",
      "That is expected to be abandoned on 26 February in a major change of strategy.",
      "BP has already been scaling back on renewables.",
      "In December it put the majority of its offshore wind assets into a joint venture with Japanese company Jera to separate them from the company's core fossil fuel business.",
      "It is expected to cut its previous $10bn commitment in renewables until 2030 by up to a half.",
      "BP also froze new wind projects in June last year.",
      "Activist shareholder Elliott Management has bought a stake in BP to push for more investment in oil and gas, with investors anticipating board changes.",
      "AJ Bell analyst Russ Mould said the sharp drop in profit \"provided plenty of fodder\" for hedge fund Elliott, with BP having done \"little to reassure other shareholders that the current plan is working\".",
      "He added that \"a clear and credible plan is desperately needed if BP is going to remain the master of its own destiny\".",
      "Profit-driven",
      "There is a scientific consensus that there is clear link between emissions from burning fossil fuels and climate change.",
      "But recently oil and gas firms have been making plans to ramp up production.",

      "Last week Norwegian energy giant Equinor said it would halve investment in renewable energy over the next two years while increasing oil and gas production.",
      "Chief executive Anders Opedal said \"we don't see the necessary profitability in the future\" in renewables.",

      "In December, Shell stepped back from new offshore wind investments.",
      "Paris withdrawal",
      "US President Donald Trump has repeatedly expressed support for fossil fuels.",

      "Jeanne Martin from ShareAction, which campaigns for responsible investment, said it was \"deeply concerning\" that energy companies were walking back on renewable commitments as the effects of global heating, such as flooding and heatwaves, intensify.",

      "Archaeologists have found a substantial piece of the ancient city's first basilica - a 2,000 year old public building where major political, economic and administrative decisions were made.",
      "The excavation has so far revealed sections of stone wall that formed the base of the basilica, which would have been two-and-a-half storeys high.",
      "The site, which will eventually be opened to the public, sheds light on the city's beginnings.",
      "\"This is so significant - this is the heart of Roman London,\" said Sophie Jackson, from the Museum of London Archaeology (Mola), who revealed the new find exclusively to BBC News.",
      "\"This building will tell us so much about the origins of London, why London grew and why it was chosen as the capital of Britain. It's just amazing.\"",
      "The site was discovered at 85 Gracechurch Street, an office building that's about to be demolished and redeveloped.",
      "Earlier archaeological investigations revealed the ancient basilica's approximate location, so the team created several small test pits to see what was hidden beneath the concrete floor.",
      "On the third attempt, digging between the filing cabinets, they struck lucky.",
      "\"You can see a huge chunk of Roman masonry, and it's incredible that it survives this well. We're absolutely thrilled that there's so much of it here,\" said Sophie Jackson.",
      "The wall is made from a type of limestone from Kent, and formed an imposing building - the basilica would have been about 40m long, 20m wide and 12m high.",
      "Other artefacts have been found too, including a roof tile imprinted with the stamp of an official from the ancient city.",
      "The basilica was part of London's forum, a social and commercial hub with a courtyard that was about the size of a football pitch.",
      "\"The basilica is the town hall, and then in front of it was a big open market square with a range of shops and offices around the outside,\" explained Ms Jackson.",
      "\"It's the place you came to do business, to get your court case sorted out, it's where laws were made, and it's where decisions were made about London, but also about the rest of the country.\"",
      "It was built around 80 AD, just a few decades after the Romans invaded Britain and founded Londinium - the Roman name for the city.",
      "But the first basilica and forum were only in use for about 20 years. They were replaced by a much larger second forum, perhaps reflecting how quickly the city was growing in size and importance.",
      "The discovery has meant a change of plans for the building's owners, Hertshten Properties.",
      "The Roman remains, which will now be fully excavated, are to be incorporated into the new offices - pending planning approval - and opened up to the public.",
      "For the architects, redesigning a building around an archaeological site has had some technical challenges.",
      "\"The scheme has been comprehensively adjusted,\" explained James Taylor from architecture firm Woods Bagot.",
      "\"Simple things like the columns have had to literally move position, so you're not destroying all these special stones that we found in the ground.\"",
      "And so as not to disturb what's there, fewer lifts can now be installed - and this has meant that the team has had to reduce the height of the building.",
      "But Mr Taylor said the effort will be worth it.",
      "\"To actually see people using and enjoying the space, moving through the public hall and down to see the remains, will be absolutely incredible.\"",
      "This is the latest piece of Roman history to be discovered lying beneath the streets of London's Square Mile. And there's a growing effort to find innovative ways to show these sites to the public.",
      "Parts of an amphitheatre are on display under a glass floor at the Guildhall Art Gallery, and at Bloomberg's offices, people can visit the Temple of Mithras, which has been brought to life with an immersive sound and light installation.",
      "Chris Hayward from the City of London Corporation says he wants more people to experience the link between the past and the present.",
      "\"The fact that Roman London is beneath your feet is, frankly, quite a remarkable emotion to experience,\" he said.",
      "\"You can actually see and visualise how Roman London would have been in those times. And then you can walk outside and you can say, 'now look at the skyscrapers, now look at the office blocks', this is progress, but at the same time, progress combined with preservation.\""

      "But the unsolicited bid might not be a failure - at least as far as Musk is concerned, experts say.",
      "That's because the offer could still complicate CEO Sam Altman's plans to transform OpenAI from a non-profit controlled entity to a for-profit company.",
      "Musk is \"basically trying to stymie OpenAI's growth trajectory,\" said University of Cambridge associate teaching professor Johnnie Penn in an interview with the BBC.",
      "Profit & non-profit",
      "Last week, Musk and a consortium of investors including Hollywood superagent Ari Emanuel tabled a $97.4bn (\u00a378.4bn) offer for all of OpenAI's assets.",
      "It was a huge sum - but less than the $157bn the firm was valued at in a funding round just four months ago, and much lower than the $300bn that some think it is worth now.",

      "That involves costs which Mr Musk is seemingly trying to inflate.",
      "\"What Musk is trying to do here is raise the perceived value of the non-profit arm of OpenAI, so that OpenAI has to pay more to get out of the obligations it has to its own non-profit,\" said Dr Penn.",

      "Changes which come in on Sunday permit so-called \"fingerprinting\", which allows online advertisers to collect more data about users including their IP addresses and information about their devices.",
      "Google says this data is already widely used by other companies, and it continues to encourage responsible data use.",
      "However the company had previously come out strongly against this kind of data collection, saying in a 2019 blog that fingerprinting \"subverts user choice and is wrong.\"",
      "But in a post announcing the new rule changes, Google said the way people used the internet - such as devices like smart TVs and consoles - meant it was harder to target ads to users using conventional data collection, which users control with cookie consent.",
      "It also says more privacy options provide safety to users.",
      "Google told the BBC in a statement: \"Privacy-enhancing technologies offer new ways for our partners to succeed on emerging platforms... without compromising on user privacy.\"",
      "But opponents to the change say fingerprinting and IP address collection are a blow to privacy because it is harder for users to control what data is collected about them.",
      "\"By allowing fingerprinting, Google has given itself - and the advertising industry it dominates - permission to use a form of tracking that people can't do much to stop,\" said Martin Thomson, distinguished engineer at Mozilla, a rival to Google.",
      "What is fingerprinting?",
      "Fingerprinting collects information about a person's device and browser and puts it together to create a profile of that person.",
      "The information is not explicitly collected in order to advertise to people, but it can be used to target specific ads based on that user's data.",
      "For example, a person's screen size or language settings are legitimately needed in order to display a website properly.",
      "But when that is combined with their time zone, browser type, battery level - and many other data points - it can create a unique combination of settings which makes it easier to work out who is using a web service.",
      "These details along with someone's IP address - the unique identifier used by internet devices - were previously prohibited by Google for ad targeting.",
      "Privacy campaigners say that unlike cookies, which are small files stored on a local device, users have little control over whether they send fingerprinting information to advertisers.",
      "\"By explicitly allowing a tracking technique that they previously described as incompatible with user control, Google highlights its ongoing prioritisation of profits over privacy,\" said Lena Cohen, staff technologist at the Electronic Frontier Foundation.",
      "\"The same tracking techniques that Google claims are essential for online advertising also expose individuals' sensitive information to data brokers, surveillance companies, and law enforcement,\" she added.",

      "\"Should people feel comfortable staying in a grey area of privacy? I'd say no,\" he adds.",
      "GumGum, which has worked with the BBC on ad campaigns before, relies on something called contextual advertising, which uses other data points to target adverts to online users, such as keywords on the website they are on - rather than their personal data.",
      "Mr Wallace says allowing fingerprinting represents a shift in the industry.",
      "\"Fingerprinting feels like it's taking a much more business-centric approach to the use of consumer data rather than a consumer-centric approach,\" he says.",
      "\"This sort of flip-flopping is, in my opinion, detrimental to that route that the industry seemed to be taking towards this idea of really putting consumer privacy at the forefront.\"",
      "He adds that he hopes ad tech companies conclude \"that it isn't the appropriate way to use consumer data,\" but expects them to look at fingerprinting as an option in order to better target adverts.",
      "Advertising is the lifeblood of the internet business model, and allow many websites to be freely available to users without them having to directly pay to access them.",
      "But in return, users often have to give up private information about themselves so that advertisers can show them relevant adverts.",
      "The UK's data watchdog, the Information Commissioner's Office (ICO), says \"fingerprinting is not a fair means of tracking users online because it is likely to reduce people's choice and control over how their information is collected.\"",
      "In a blog post in December, the ICO's Executive Director of Regulatory Risk Stephen Almond wrote: \"We think this change is irresponsible.\"",

      "This uses end-to-end encryption, where only the account holder can access the data stored. Apple itself cannot see it.",
      "It is an opt-in service, and not all users choose to activate it.",
      "The demand was first reported by the Washington Post, quoting sources familiar with the matter, and the BBC has spoken to similar contacts.",
      "The Home Office said then: \"We do not comment on operational matters, including for example confirming or denying the existence of any such notices.\"",
      "Apple declined to comment, but says on its website that it views privacy as a \"fundamental human right\".",
      "The order has been served by the Home Office under the Investigatory Powers Act, which compels firms to provide information to law enforcement agencies.",
      "Under the law, the demand by the Home Office cannot be made public.",
      "Senator Wyden and Congressman Biggs say agreeing to the request would \"undermine Americans' privacy rights and expose them to espionage by China, Russia and other adversaries\".",

      "It is understood that the UK government does not want to start combing through everybody's data.",
      "Rather it would want to access it if there were a risk to national security - in other words, it would be targeting an individual, rather than using it for mass surveillance.",
      "Authorities would still have to follow a legal process, have a good reason and request permission for a specific account in order to access data - just as they do now with unencrypted data.",
      "Apple has previously said it would pull encryption services like ADP from the UK market rather than comply with such government demands - telling Parliament it would \"never build a back door\" in its products.",
      "WhatsApp, owned by Meta, has also previously said it would choose being blocked over weakening message security.",
      "But even withdrawing the product from the UK might not be enough to ensure compliance - the Investigatory Powers Act applies worldwide to any tech firm with a UK market, even if they are not based there."

    "summary": "Researchers have given a robot a powerful radio-based vision system which can see through smoke.",
    "story": [
      "If you want to find out whether your robot can see through smoke, well, you're going to need some smoke.",
      "But a University of Pennsylvania student got a shock when they began setting up a late night experiment to test such a robot.",
      "Shortly after flicking the switch on the smoke machine, a loud fire alarm went off.",
      "\"The whole building got triggered,\" says Mingmin Zhao of the University of Pennsylvania, smiling. \"My student called me. He was very surprised.\"",
      "The incident was a minor setback for the team developing a robot equipped with a innovative radio-based sensing system.",
      "Radio waves could allow robots or autonomous vehicles to see through thick smoke, intense rain \u2013 or even around corners. Such waves can even detect concealed weapons.",
      "But simulating visual imagery based on radio waves is an unusual approach for robots and autonomous vehicles. Much more established in those fields are regular optical cameras, light detection and ranging (Lidar), and other sensors.",
      "However, Prof Zhao and his students have developed a potentially powerful way for robots to see using radio waves.",
      "Of course radar, which uses radio waves, has been used for decades to track aircraft, ships and the weather.",
      "But the spinning array on Prof Zhao's robot throws radio waves in all directions.",
      "An on-board artificial intelligence (AI) system then builds a 3D view of the environment with this information.",
      "\"What we have been trying to do here is basically help robots obtain superhuman vision \u2013 to see in scenarios where human eyes or traditional visual sensors cannot,\" explains Prof Zhao.",
      "He suggests the technology could help a future search-and-rescue robot save people from a burning building.",
      "Subsequent tests of the bot used a clear plastic box full of smoke placed around the its spinning equipment, in order to avoid triggering any nearby fire alarms.",
      "Although humans can't see them, radio waves are a form of light in the sense that they are part of the electromagnetic spectrum, which also includes X-rays and gamma rays. Only a small part the spectrum is classed as visible light.",
      "Being light, radio waves can reflect off surfaces and materials, though in a slightly different way to visible light. Prof Zhao and his colleagues have designed their robot so that it can sense these radio wave reflections.",
      "The crucial factor here is that radio waves are much longer than visible light waves meaning they are not blocked by tiny smoke particles.",
      "Prof Zhao says he has also been working on adapting the technology so that the robot can see part of the way round a corner. Think of it like a hall of mirrors, he suggests, just for radio waves rather than visible light.",
      "\"It's really very interesting work and quite impressive,\" says Friedemann Reinhard at the University of Rostock in Germany, who was not involved in the work. In 2017, Prof Reinhard and colleagues described how Wi-Fi signals could allow spies to see into private rooms.",
      "One slight limitation is that the spinning array cannot, by definition, see in all directions at once. Prof Reinhard says that a lot of data processing carried out by the system appears necessary to clean up the image that results from this spinning device.",
      "However, the robot sends out radio waves in the millimetre wave band (waves that are between one and ten millimetres long). This is the same technology used for some 5G installations.",
      "\"That's potentially very attractive, it's a very well understood, cheap technology,\" says Prof Reinhard. \"I certainly would love to see a self-driving car driving only on radar.\"",
      "But it is possible to avoid using spinning radio-emitting devices to get a full picture, says Fabio da Silva, founder and chief executive of US firm Wavsens, which is also developing radio-based sensing technology.",
      "\"We created an algorithm that allows you to sense the entire space instantaneously and continuously so we don't have to spin our antennas,\" he says.",
      "He describes the system as akin to echolocation, used by bats. It sends out radio waves and \"listens\" to how the waves come back, which reveals the shape of whatever they have hit.",
      "Some researchers have used radio waves to detect concealed weapons such as hidden handguns and knives.",
      "Radio waves can even \"fingerprint\" the details of a room. Then, if scanned again later, this would reveal whether any objects in the room have been moved.",
      "Last year, scientists in Germany proposed that countries use this method to scrutinise other countries' management of their nuclear weapons stockpiles. It would be one way of knowing whether someone had been moving the warheads around, for example.",
      "Separately, Luana Olivieri at Loughborough University has explored using a different form of non-visible electromagnetic radiation, terahertz waves. These are shorter than radio waves but longer than visible light waves. \"This wavelength is particularly unexplored,\" says Dr Olivieri.",
      "It is possible to see through objects and analyse materials using this form of radiation, she adds. Such a system could even, in theory, identify specific drugs by detecting their chemical structure.",
      "But while seeing through materials could help a rescue bot find a trapped person in some future disaster, it also has other applications. Police forces and militaries have access to radio-based technology that allows them to see through doors and walls, to some extent.",
      "\"Warfighting is definitely one market that it caters to. It can be used to find and kill someone,\" says Mr da Silva. He has exhibited Wavsens' technology to the US Department of Defense and the Israeli Ministry of Defense, he says.",
      "And yet these applications are not entirely surprising, suggests Prof Reinhard, who points out that a range of emerging technologies have, in principle, made it easier to detect and attack people.",
      "\"Maybe radar sounds scary \u2013 but drones and cheap cameras are the much more dangerous thing,\" he says."

      "Growing up, Samuel Weidenhofer struggled with his mental health after losing his aunt to suicide when he was nine, experiencing a speech impediment, and being bullied.",
      "The trauma of it all made him want to end his own life, he says. When he was 17, he says he decided to turn to social media to spread a positive message.",
      "\"It started with simple things like giving people hugs in public and giving out roses and flowers and things that would make people smile,\" says Weidenhofer, now 21, and living in Melbourne, Australia.",
      "The difference was Weidenhofer filmed these acts and shared them across his social media accounts. The content spiralled and four years later, on Instagram alone he has amassed 1.7 million followers, where he can be seen surprising a person with a serious illness with money or a visit from a celebrity such as Jake Paul or Kristen Bell.",
      "\"I hope my videos inspire someone just a little bit,\" he says.",
      "Kindness content creators, or influencers as they're often called, are increasing in numbers on social media.",
      "Their approaches differ but a common tactic is to secretly film someone being given money, or tickets to a gig or sports match, or perhaps a free haircut.",
      "\"Kindness is cool,\" says Zachery Dereniowski, 31, in the bio of his Instagram account where he has 5.7 million followers.",
      "Mr Dereniowski's videos often involve him telling a stranger that he is hungry and asking for food. When the person helps him out, he rewards the person with a gift, such as a laptop, or money.",
      "\"I suppose I want to really emphasise that every single person you come across has a story\u2026 and often the people who have the least give the most,\" says Mr Dereniowski, who lives in Windsor, near Toronto in Canada, and started the account after giving free hugs to strangers.",
      "Like many influencers, the kindness creators make money from adverts and sponsorship from the brands they work with. For example they might do a deal that involves giving away a particular brand's product.",
      "The videos of kindness content creators attract millions of views. Why are they so popular?",
      "Saoirse Cleary, creative strategy director at marketing agency MG Empower, says they incorporate many of the elements that both social media algorithms and audiences favour: strong hooks, engaging captions, heartfelt narratives, and authentic, unscripted moments.",
      "\"Audiences are captivated by raw, real interactions with everyday people, offering an emotional connection from the comfort of their own screens. People increasingly seek positivity, authenticity, and emotional resonance in their online experiences, especially in spaces often saturated with entertainment-driven content.\"",
      "On the face of it the acts seem well meaning, so why do they attract criticism?",
      "\"\"While these influencers may be genuinely generous... the generosity can sometimes feel performative, as it often serves as a way to attract more views, engagement, and ultimately financial reward, rather than purely altruistic motives,\" says Ms Cleary.",
      "Others go further, questing whether focussing on one, usually vulnerable person, is the right way to help out.",
      "\"I find the typical set up of many of the scenes quite disturbing,\" says Hilda Burke, a psychotherapist, accredited with the British Association for Counselling and Psychotherapy.",
      "She explains that the videos often involve someone being identified as \"in need\". They are then asked for a favour. It might be spare money for a bus fare or help with something.",
      "She argues the participant is being \"lured\" into valuing the needs of someone else, who appears richer, more highly than their own.",
      "Only if they do that are they rewarded.",
      "\"I wonder what happens to those who don't play the game?,\" asks Ms Burke.",
      "The influencers defend themselves by arguing that using social media this way is an effective strategy.",
      "\"I can raise more money, so I can help more people if I post it online,\" says Mr Weidenhofer.",
      "And how about filming people without their consent?",
      "\"If you are doing a video where you're giving a hug to someone, if you tell them beforehand, it just takes away that authenticity,\" says Mr Weidenhofer.",
      "But he adds that these days he avoids filming people without consent as it was making him \"feel weird\".",
      "Sometimes large amounts of money are given to vulnerable people, which they might not be in a position to manage.",
      "Mr Dereniowski realised that this might be an issue when he raised $240,000 overnight for a father and son who were living in their car.",
      "After that, more thought goes into longer term help.",
      "\"We've started setting up financial advisors. We've started getting these people jobs. We've helped allocate the funds properly to pay off their debt, their car, helping them get a home and [pay their] rent,\" he says.",

      "By Harry Farley, Political Correspondent in London",
      "Sir Keir Starmer is hoping to be a bridge between European leaders and Trump's White House berating them about their defence spending.",
      "Starmer's offer to put UK troops on the ground in Ukraine is part of that role he wants to play.",
      "The government used to say the terms of any peace deal was up to Ukraine. That has shifted with the new US administration signalling that a return to 2014 borders was \"unrealistic\".",
      "Instead Sir Keir will be hoping more European nations in Paris join him in offering their forces to secure a deal \u2013 and prevent Russia invading again.",

      "It is a sign of how rattled German leaders are by Trump's approach to Ukraine that just days before a national election Chancellor Olaf Scholz is also in Paris.",
      "All mainstream parties have condemned American suggestions that a peace deal be brokered without Ukraine or the EU. Far-right and populist-left politicians welcome talks with Putin and want to stop arming Kyiv. But they will not get into power.",
      "So, whatever the next German government looks like, Berlin's support for Ukraine will remain strong. That is because Berlin's political elite recognises that a bad deal - one that undermines Ukrainian sovereignty - would be disastrous for Germany.",
      "But with Germany's war-torn 20th century in mind, voters here are wary of militarisation.",
      "Over the past three years the country has successfully pivoted away from Russian energy and massively upped defence spending. But this has hit the German economy hard and the subsequent budget rows sparked the collapse of the German government.",

      "It is also a loud voice arguing that Russia cannot be allowed to win the war it launched \u2013 because the whole of Europe's security is at stake. So there is consternation that the US looks like it is conceding to Moscow's key demands, even before talks begin, when Poland very clearly sees Russia as the aggressor and as dangerous.",
      "Russia is why Poland spends big on its own military \u2013 up to almost 5% of GDP now - and agrees with the US that the rest of Europe should do the same.",
      "On his way to the talks in Paris, Poland Prime Minister Donald Tusk wrote on X: \"If we, Europeans, fail to spend big on defence now, we will be forced to spend 10 times more if we don't prevent a wider war.\"",

      "Moscow's priority is clearly the meeting in Saudi Arabia. Russian Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov has said he would \"first and foremost like to listen\" to the American proposals on ending the conflict in Ukraine.",
      "As for Europe, Moscow sees no point in inviting it to the negotiating table.",
      "It is no secret that for many years Putin has sought dialogue specifically with the US \u2013 a country he both blames for starting the war in Ukraine and considers the only power equal to Russia.",
      "Moscow may take note of Starmer's statements about being ready to send peacekeepers to the Ukraine \u2013 for the first time in a week, the discussion is about potential Russian, rather than Ukrainian, concessions.",

      "Despite Trump's public engagements in recent days, it is clear that the negotiations with Russia over the fate of Ukraine have been his focus behind the scenes.",
      "On Sunday, Trump told reporters he had been kept abreast of the latest developments and the talks are \"moving along\".",
      "His short-term goal is to stop the fighting in Ukraine. Longer term, he appears to want less American involvement, given that the US has sent tens of billions of dollars' worth of weapons to Kyiv.",
      "Trump has also pushed for access to rare minerals in Ukraine in return for aid, or even as compensation for the support the US has already provided.",
      "But he has not yet said what a post-war Ukraine would look like, setting off alarm bells in Europe.",
      "He also notably said that he expects Ukraine's Volodymyr Zelensky to be a part of the \"conversation\", but not the talks in Riyadh. Rubio has said the talks in Saudi Arabia are only the start of a longer process that will \"obviously\" include Europe and Ukraine.",
      "Those remarks are likely to provide little comfort for US allies who have been listening to Trump's remarks over the last several days.",

      "Russia occupies almost 25% of Ukraine's territory. Ukraine's defence has cost tens of thousands of lives of its citizens.",
      "The country has in the past insisted that any peace deal include the full withdrawal of Russian troops from Ukrainian territory. That includes not only areas Russia has seized in its full-scale offensive, but also the Black Sea peninsula of Crimea, which Russia annexed after 2014, and the regions of Donetsk and Luhansk, where Russia has backed separatists in fighting, also after 2014.",

      "Instead Trump picked his personal friend, golf buddy and billionaire real estate developer Steve Witkoff.",

      "Witkoff also played a part in brokering the current ceasefire agreement between Israel and Hamas, for which both Trump and his predecessor Joe Biden took credit.",

      "\"The president sees Steve as one of the world's great dealmakers,\" a White House official told Axios. Witkoff's preferred negotiating tactic was to use charm, according to another associate, but he could also turn up the pressure.",

The powerful 2,000-pound bombs have a wide blast radius and can rip through concrete and metal, destroying entire buildings.",

    "story": [
      "German voters decide on 23 February who will run their next government, with Friedrich Merz's conservative Christian Democrats favourite to become the biggest party in power.",
      "Controlling immigration and reviving the European Union's biggest economy are the main issues in this snap election, triggered by the collapse of centre-left Chancellor Olaf Scholz's coalition late last year.",
      "We assess what and who you need to know ahead of the vote for Germany's next parliament, the Bundestag.",
      "Why this vote matters",
      "This election is taking place against a backdrop of a series of deadly attacks which have heightened pressure on the mainstream parties to reform immigration and asylum rules.",
      "Germans were already reeling from four fatal attacks, in Mannheim, Solingen, Magdeburg and Afschaffenburg, when a mother and her two-year-old daughter were fatally injured in a car-ramming attack in Munich, allegedly by an Afghan national, 10 days before the election.",
      "These attacks have boosted support for the far-right Alternative for Germany (AfD).",
      "Although no other party is prepared to let the AfD into government, if they come second and attract 20% of the vote, they could double their number of seats in the Bundestag.",
      "Germany is also Europe's biggest economy and after two years of decline, the onus is on the next government to turn it around and revive German industry. Germany has been hit by high energy prices and stiff Chinese competition.",
      "Germans aged 18 and over will decide on their next parliament from 08:00-18:00 on 23 February.",
      "There are five candidates for chancellor.",
      "If the biggest party can secure a coalition deal with one or two other parties, the president will usually nominate its leader as chancellor. Then parliament will hold a secret ballot to decide.",
      "Who are the five candidates for German chancellor?",
      "The frontrunner in the race to run Germany is Friedrich Merz, whose Christian Democrats (CDU) are up to 10 points ahead in the polls. He was chosen as candidate for chancellor ahead of Markus S\u00f6der, the leader of their sister party in Bavaria the Christian Social Union.",
      "Aged 69 and 198cm (6ft 6in) in height, Merz is a plain-talking, pro-business, social conservative who has spent years waiting in the wings.",
      "Eclipsed in the CDU by Angela Merkel in 2002, he eventually left politics, served on the boards of investment banks and took up flying as an amateur pilot.",
      "Merz's first two bids to win the CDU leadership failed, against Merkel in 2018 and then Armin Laschet who went on to lose the German election in 2021.",
      "Merz then took over the CDU and is running under the slogan \"A Germany we can be proud of again\".",
      "He has promised permanent border controls and faster asylum rules to restrict immigration, and to cut taxes and slash \u20ac50bn in welfare spending in a bid to kickstart Germany's faltering economy. He has also promised to bolster aid for Ukraine.",
      "But he provoked a furious backlash ahead of the election when he sought to tighten immigration rules by relying on the votes of the far-right AfD, and he ultimately failed.",
      "Although Merz has ruled out working with the AfD, former CDU chancellor Angela Merkel said he was \"wrong\" to accept AfD votes and he has faced big protests.",

      "Germany became Ukraine's biggest aid-provider in Europe. Scholz spoke of a Zeitenwende (turning point) in boosting German defence policy and military spending - but he was accused of acting too slowly or too late. He now promises European support for Ukraine \"for as long as necessary\" and rejects the idea of any dictated peace.",

He rejects any return to nuclear energy, and calls for more affordable access to renewable energy which by the end of last year supplied 63.4% of Germany's electricity needs.",
      "Habeck, 55, has taken a strong line on aid for Ukraine, and he has forcefully criticised Friedrich Merz for relying on votes from the AfD in parliament.",
      "Relations with Friedrich Merz are awkward, after he accused the CDU leader of disqualifying himself as chancellor, but the Greens could still return to government.",
      "Like Alice Weidel's AfD, Sahra Wagenknecht and her BSW party back closer relations with Russia and has built a strong support base in eastern Germany.",
      "Wagenknecht calls her politics \"left conservativism\" and presents herself as an alternative to the AfD, backing strict limits on asylum and immigration.",

      "Elections to the Bundestag usually take place every four years - this one had been due on 28 September 2025 but was brought forward because of the collapse of the Scholz government.",
      "Over-18s get two votes.",
      "One is to elect members of the Bundestag directly in 299 constituencies. The second is to choose a political party in one of the 16 states that you live in.",
      "Any party that wins 5% of that second vote is allowed to enter the Bundestag, and they then use their state lists to pick their MPs.",
      "Complex voting rules that meant the outgoing parliament had 733 seats have now been abolished. That means Germany's next Bundestag will have a total of 630 seats - a reduction of more than 100 seats.",
      "However, one of the old rules will remain. Any party that fails to poll 5% of the vote can still get in, if they win in three of the 299 constituencies.",
      "Which parties could form Germany's next government?",
      "The conservative CDU and CSU parties are favourite to win the most seats, but by ruling out a coalition with the AfD Merz has narrowed their options of potential partners in government.",
      "That makes a deal most likely with either or both the SPD and the Greens.",
      "Many in the SPD are reluctant to work with Merz after the migration row, but a so-called grand coalition of the two parties is considered possible."

    "story": [
      "Privacy campaigners have called Google's new rules on tracking people online \"a blatant disregard for user privacy.\"",
      "Changes which come in on Sunday permit so-called \"fingerprinting\", which allows online advertisers to collect more data about users including their IP addresses and information about their devices.",
      "Google says this data is already widely used by other companies, and it continues to encourage responsible data use.",
      "However the company had previously come out strongly against this kind of data collection, saying in a 2019 blog that fingerprinting \"subverts user choice and is wrong.\"",
      "But in a post announcing the new rule changes, Google said the way people used the internet - such as devices like smart TVs and consoles - meant it was harder to target ads to users using conventional data collection, which users control with cookie consent.",

      "Google told the BBC in a statement: \"Privacy-enhancing technologies offer new ways for our partners to succeed on emerging platforms... without compromising on user privacy.\"",

      "\"By allowing fingerprinting, Google has given itself - and the advertising industry it dominates - permission to use a form of tracking that people can't do much to stop,\" said Martin Thomson, distinguished engineer at Mozilla, a rival to Google.",
      "What is fingerprinting?",
      "Fingerprinting collects information about a person's device and browser and puts it together to create a profile of that person.",
      "The information is not explicitly collected in order to advertise to people, but it can be used to target specific ads based on that user's data.",
      "For example, a person's screen size or language settings are legitimately needed in order to display a website properly.",
      "But when that is combined with their time zone, browser type, battery level - and many other data points - it can create a unique combination of settings which makes it easier to work out who is using a web service.",
      "These details along with someone's IP address - the unique identifier used by internet devices - were previously prohibited by Google for ad targeting.",
      "Privacy campaigners say that unlike cookies, which are small files stored on a local device, users have little control over whether they send fingerprinting information to advertisers.",
      "\"By explicitly allowing a tracking technique that they previously described as incompatible with user control, Google highlights its ongoing prioritisation of profits over privacy,\" said Lena Cohen, staff technologist at the Electronic Frontier Foundation.",
      "\"The same tracking techniques that Google claims are essential for online advertising also expose individuals' sensitive information to data brokers, surveillance companies, and law enforcement,\" she added.",

      "\"Should people feel comfortable staying in a grey area of privacy? I'd say no,\" he adds.",
      "GumGum, which has worked with the BBC on ad campaigns before, relies on something called contextual advertising, which uses other data points to target adverts to online users, such as keywords on the website they are on - rather than their personal data.",
      "Mr Wallace says allowing fingerprinting represents a shift in the industry.",
      "\"Fingerprinting feels like it's taking a much more business-centric approach to the use of consumer data rather than a consumer-centric approach,\" he says.",
      "\"This sort of flip-flopping is, in my opinion, detrimental to that route that the industry seemed to be taking towards this idea of really putting consumer privacy at the forefront.\"",
      "He adds that he hopes ad tech companies conclude \"that it isn't the appropriate way to use consumer data,\" but expects them to look at fingerprinting as an option in order to better target adverts.",
      "Advertising is the lifeblood of the internet business model, and allow many websites to be freely available to users without them having to directly pay to access them.",
      "But in return, users often have to give up private information about themselves so that advertisers can show them relevant adverts.",
      "The UK's data watchdog, the Information Commissioner's Office (ICO), says \"fingerprinting is not a fair means of tracking users online because it is likely to reduce people's choice and control over how their information is collected.\"",

      "Instead, they will meet in Paris on Monday for an emergency summit to discuss the conflict and the continent's security.",
      "Here are five takeaways from Munich.",
      "1. End of an era",
      "Nato, the North Atlantic Treaty Organization, was formed in 1949 with the primary aim of blocking expansion in Europe by the former Soviet Union.",
      "Now numbering 32 members, including several Eastern European countries, members agree that if one of them is attacked, the others should help defend it.",

      "In Brussels, US Defence Secretary Pete Hegseth called on Nato's European members to spend much more on defence, saying they would have to provide the \"overwhelming\" share of military funding for Ukraine.",
      "2. Ukraine policy upended",

      "Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky, who has repeatedly said he would not accept any deal struck without his country's input, said Kyiv had not been invited to the talks.",
      "3. Spend more now",
      "Europe, everyone agrees, needs to rapidly raise its defence spending if it has any hope of deterring a newly emboldened Russia.",
      "The current Nato-mandated minimum of 2% of GDP is likely to rise to 3%. Russia currently spends more than twice that on defence in percentage terms.",
      "In January, Trump urged Nato's European members to spend 5% of their national income on defence. Nato Secretary-General Mark Rutte has also urged member states to boost their defence spending.",
      "But Europe as a whole has already overtaken the US in terms of aid to Ukraine. In total, it has allocated \u20ac70bn ($73bn; \u00a358bn) in financial and humanitarian aid as well as \u20ac62bn in military aid. This compares to \u20ac64bn in military aid from the US as well as \u20ac50bn in financial and humanitarian allocations.",
      "4. That JD Vance speech",
      "US Vice President JD Vance's blistering attack on Europe's policies on Friday was called \"ill-judged\" and \"insulting\" by many of the delegates at the Munich Security Conference.",
      "They had hoped he would reassure them the US was not abandoning Ukraine.",
      "Instead, he spent the majority accusing European governments - including the UK's - of retreating from their values, and ignoring voter concerns on migration and free speech.",
      "The address was met by silence in the hall, and later denounced by several politicians at the conference.",
      "But the speech appealed to others on both sides of the Atlantic and Donald Trump  called it \"brilliant\".",
      "5. Disunity and discord",
      "While the Munich conference was occupied by the geopolitical, Donald Trump announced plans to bring in a 25% tariff on all steel and aluminium imports from March.",
      "It was evidence there are now very obvious rifts between Washington's positions and Europe's on several issues, from trade to dealing with Russia.",
      "It is a divide that the UK is struggling to bridge, with Prime Minister Sir Keir Starmer telling reporters both relationships were important and Britain was \"not choosing between the US and the EU\".",
      "But the Trump team's own messaging is sometimes contradictory, rowing back on grand pronouncements the day after they have been made.",

    "story": [
      "Europe's leaders are scrambling. Their hastily convened security summit in Paris on Monday is proof of that.",
      "They are still reeling from not being invited by the US to talks with Russia over the future of Ukraine. US President Donald Trump said on Sunday he could be meeting Russian President Vladimir Putin \"very soon\".",
      "Can Europe, under pressure, put political differences and domestic economic concerns aside, and come up with a united front on security spending and on Ukraine's future, including potentially sending troops there - to force themselves a spot at the negotiating table?",
      "They are going to try.",
      "On Monday morning, UK prime minister Sir Keir Starmer said the UK was \"ready and willing to put troops on the ground\". Even in Germany, ahead of a heated election, the foreign policy spokesman of the CDU party, expected to win the most seats, said Europe's largest country would also be willing to commit troops within an international framework.",
      "The Trump administration is clearly not 100% sure what it wants to do about Ukraine. There were a number of mixed messages over the weekend.",
      "This allows Europe a tiny window of opportunity to try to persuade the American president it's an invaluable partner.",
      "It hopes to do that via this Paris meeting, getting the ball rolling on two major issues demanded by Donald Trump: That Europe spend and do more for its own defence, and that Europe send troops to Ukraine after a ceasefire.",
      "Europe's leaders insist Kyiv be directly involved in ceasefire talks too. They've long maintained the view that \"there can be no decisions about Ukraine, without Ukraine\".",
      "But it's about even more than that for Europe.",
      "It is the cold realisation - much dreaded, but not entirely unexpected - that the Trump administration does not prioritise relations either with European partners, or their defence.",
      "Europe has relied on a security umbrella provided by the US since World War Two.",
      "Depending on the parameters of the Russia-US talks over Ukraine, and how emboldened Putin feels by them, there is also a European fear this could end up changing their continent's security architecture.",
      "Putin historically resents the spread of Nato eastwards. Russian neighbours - the tiny, former Soviet Baltic States and also Poland - now feel particularly exposed.",
      "Ukraine not invited to US-Russia peace talks, source tells BBC",
      "Five takeaways from the Munich Security Conference",
      "Trump administration's mixed messaging on foreign policy leaves world guessing",
      "Not all European countries will be at Monday's summit. Just those with military heft: the UK, France, Germany, Italy, Poland, Spain and Denmark - which is expected to represent the Baltic and Nordic nations, plus the EU Council president and the secretary general of the defence alliance, Nato.",
      "Other countries will reportedly have later, follow-up meetings.",
      "Even at the small Paris gathering, it will be hard, if not impossible, to agree concrete defence spending increases. Poland plans to spend 4.47% of its GDP on defence in 2025. The UK is struggling towards, and hasn't yet reached, 2.5% of its GDP.",
      "But leaders can pledge to coordinate better, spend more inside Nato and shoulder most of Ukraine's post-war reconstruction. The EU is expected to bolster its defence effort too.",
      "A large part of the Paris meeting will also focus on the question of sending troops to Ukraine after a ceasefire.",
      "The idea being discussed is not for peacekeeping troops but rather a \"reassurance force\", stationed behind, rather than on, any eventual ceasefire line.",
      "The aim of a European troop presence would be three-fold. To send a message to Ukrainians: that they are not alone. Another message to the US, to show that Europe is \"doing its bit\" for defence of its own continent, and the last message to Moscow, to warn that if it breaks the terms of an eventual ceasefire, it won't be dealing with Kyiv alone.",
      "But it's a controversial concept and may not be popular with voters. In Italy for example, 50% of people asked don't want to send any more weapons to Ukraine, never mind sending sons and daughters, sisters and brothers there.",
      "There are so many as yet unanswered questions:",
      "How many troops would each European country have to send, for how long, and under whose command? What would their mission statement be - for example if Russia broke the terms of an agreed ceasefire, would that mean European soldiers would be directly at war with Russia? Would the US have their back if so?",
      "Europe would want a US security guarantee before deploying soldiers to Ukraine. It may not get one.",
      "It's far too much to be decided on Monday. And leaders, including UK Prime Minister Keir Starmer, come to Paris with their own domestic concerns - can they afford extra defence spending, do they have the troops to send to Ukraine?",
      "Richard \u2013 now Lord \u2013 Dannatt is the former head of the British Army. He told the BBC that the UK military is too depleted to provide a significant proportion of troops for Ukraine. He said around 100,000 troops would probably be needed in total and the UK would be expected to provide a considerable number of those. The British Army insists it has earned a worldwide reputation for excellence.",
      "But this summit is more broad brushstrokes than fine print. The conversation can at least get started publicly.",
      "Will Donald Trump be paying attention?",
      "Hard to know.",
      "There's talk of sending an envoy to Washington after the Paris meeting to make Europe's case. Italy's Prime Minister, Giorgia Meloni, is close to the Trump administration, for example.",
      "Sir Keir Starmer has a planned visit to Washington in a few days. This could be his chance to act as a bridge between Europe and the US.",
      "The Paris meeting also offers an opportunity for the UK and other European leaders to further mend relations after the bitterness of Brexit.",
      "Mark Leonard, head of the European Council on Foreign Relations, notes that Starmer could \"demonstrate that Britain is a responsible stakeholder for European security ... Something that will be noticed and translate into goodwill when it comes to negotiations on other issues\".",
      "Issues like trade relations and law enforcement co-operation which the UK hopes to improve with the EU going forward.",
      "Host nation France is feeling confident. President Macron has long advocated that Europe be less reliant on outside countries for supply chains, tech capabilities and very much so when it comes to defence. He made headlines a year ago by first mooting the idea of troops on the ground in Ukraine.",
      "France is \"fiercely proud\" that its intelligence  and security services are not intertwined with the US, unlike the UK, says Georgina Wright, deputy director for international studies at the Institut Montaigne. That makes it less complicated to untangle, now that Trump is in the White House, demanding that Europe take care of itself.",
      "The US has sent a document to European allies consisting of six points and questions, such as which countries would be willing to deploy troops to Ukraine as part of a peace settlement, and which governments would be prepared to increase sanctions on Russia, including more strictly enforcing existing ones.",
      "But Julianne Smith, until recently the US ambassador to Nato, says this kind of complicated diplomatic work normally takes weeks of meetings and can't be organised by filled-in forms.",
      "She adds that whatever Europe's leaders achieve in Paris, if they use that to demand a seat at the negotiating table over Ukraine, their hand is weak.",
      "\"If Trump blinks and says no, does Europe refuse to help altogether? They can't cut off their nose to spite their face.\"",
      "Essentially, if the US plans to turn away from Ukraine and from Europe more broadly in terms of security, they will have to significantly up their defence game anyway.",
      "If Donald Trump isn't watching, Vladimir Putin certainly is."

      "What is happening at the moment?",
      "After a rapid advance in the east, fighters from the M23 rebel group have captured a number of key cities and towns.",
      "Their first major coup was at the end of January with the taking of Goma \u2013 a city in the North Kivu province that is home to more than a million people.",

      "When the rebels took over Goma, UN aid agencies warned of a major humanitarian crisis with shortages of food and water, hospitals overwhelmed by casualties and bodies lying on the streets.",
      "The M23 have also seized another key city in the region, South Kivu provincial capital Bukavu.",
      "Other locations now under M23 control include Masisi, Rutshuru and Katale.",
      "The rebels previously threatened to continue their offensive to the capital, Kinshasa, although analysts say this may be unlikely, as the city is 2,600km (1,600 miles) away, on the other side of this vast country.",
      "Who are the M23?",
      "The M23 are led by ethnic Tutsis, who say they needed to take up arms to protect the rights of the minority group.",

      "It has been dubbed one of the world's rarest treasure troves of art but few people outside its host country know about it.",
      "For decades, masterpieces by the likes of Pablo Picasso, Vincent Van Gogh, Andy Warhol and Jackson Pollock have been kept in the basement of a museum in Iran's capital Tehran, shrouded in mystery.",
      "According to estimates in 2018, the collection is worth as much as $3bn.",
      "Only a small portion of the work has been exhibited since the 1979 Iranian Revolution but in recent years, the Tehran Museum of Contemporary Art has been showcasing some of its most captivating pieces.",
      "The Eye to Eye exhibition at the Tehran Museum of Contemporary Art, which opened in October 2024, was extended twice due to overwhelming public demand, running until January 2025.",
      "The display was widely regarded as one of the most significant exhibitions in the history of the museum, and it also became its most visited.",
      "The showcase featured more than 15 works unveiled for the first time, including a sculpture by Jean Dubuffet - marking its first-ever appearance in an Iranian exhibition.",
      "From abstract expressionism to pop art, the collection at the museum serves as a time capsule of pivotal artistic movements.",
      "Among the artwork is Warhol's portrait of Farah Pahlavi - Iran's last queen - a rare piece blending his pop art flair with Iranian cultural history.",
      "Elsewhere, Francis Bacon's work called Two Figures Lying on a Bed with Attendants shows figures appearing to spy on two naked men lying on a bed.",
      "On the opposite wall in the basement of the museum, a portrait of Ayatollah Ruhollah Khomeini, the founder of the Islamic Republic of Iran, is on display in juxtaposition.",
      "The museum was built in 1977 under the patronage of Pahlavi, the exiled widow of the last Shah of Iran who was overthrown during the revolution.",
      "Pahlavi was a passionate art advocate and her cousin, architect Kamran Diba, designed the museum.",
      "It was established to introduce modern art to Iranians and to bridge Iran closer to the international art scene.",
      "The museum soon became home to a stunning array of works by luminaries including Picasso, Warhol and Salvador Dali, alongside pieces by leading Iranian modernists, and quickly established itself as a beacon of cultural exchange and artistic ambition.",
      "But then came the 1979 revolution. Iran became an Islamic republic as the monarchy was overthrown and clerics assumed political control under Ayatollah Khomeini.",
      "Many artworks were deemed inappropriate for public display because of nudity, religious sensitivities or political implications.",
      "Pierre-Auguste Renoir's Gabrielle with Open Blouse was deemed too scandalous. And Warhol's portrait of the former queen of Iran was too political. In fact, Pahlavi's portrait was vandalised and torn apart with a knife during the revolutionary turmoil.",
      "After the revolution, many of the artworks were locked away, collecting dust in a basement that became the stuff of art world legend.",
      "It was only in the late 1990s that the museum reclaimed its cultural significance during the reformist presidency of Mohammad Khatami.",
      "Suddenly the world remembered what it had been missing. Art lovers could not believe their eyes. Van Gogh, Dali, even Monet - all in Tehran.",
      "Some pieces were loaned to major exhibitions in Europe and the United States, briefly reconnecting the collection with the global art world.",
      "Hamid Keshmirshekan, an art historian based in London, has studied the collection and calls it \"one of the rarest treasure troves of modern art outside the West\".",
      "The collection includes Henry's Moore's Reclining Figure series - an iconic piece by one of Britain's most celebrated sculptors - and Jackson Pollock's Mural on Indian Red Ground, a vibrant example of the American's painting technique pulsing with energy and emotion.",
      "Picasso's The Painter and His Model - his largest canvas from 1927 - also features, a strong example of his abstract works from the post-cubism period.",
      "And there is Van Gogh's At Eternity's Gate - one of the very rare survivals of his first printmaking campaign during which he produced six lithographs in November 1882.",
      "But for art lovers in Britain, the collection is out of reach. The UK Foreign Office advises against all travel to Iran and says British and British-Iranian dual nationals are at significant risk of arrest, questioning or detention.",
      "Having a British passport or connections to the UK can be reason enough for detention by the Iranian authorities, it says.",
      "Challenges remain for the museum which operates under a tight budget. Shifting political priorities mean that it often functions more as a cultural hub than a traditional museum.",
      "Yet it continues to be a remarkable institution - an unlikely guardian of modern art masterpieces in the heart of Tehran."

      "Unauthorised immigrants make up 3% of the US population and 22% of the foreign-born population.",
      "The number of undocumented Indians among them is contested however, with estimates varying widely due to differing calculation methods.",
      "Pew Research Center and Center for Migration Studies of New York (CMS) estimate some 700,000 people as of 2022, making them the third-largest group after Mexico and El Salvador.",
      "In contrast, the Migration Policy Institute (MPI) puts the figure at 375,000, ranking India fifth among origin countries.",
      "The official government data from the Department of Homeland Security (DHS)  offers yet another picture, reporting 220,000 unauthorised Indians in 2022.",
      "The vast differences in estimates highlight the uncertainty surrounding the true size of the undocumented Indian population, according to the study.",
      "Yet numbers have dropped from their peak",
      "Indian migrants make up only a small share of the overall unauthorised migrant population in the US.",
      "If Pew and CMS estimates are accurate, nearly one in four Indian immigrants in the US is undocumented - an unlikely scenario given migration patterns, the study says. (Indian immigrants are one of the fastest-growing groups in the US, surging from 600,000 in 1990 to 3.2 million in 2022.)",
      "The DHS estimated in 2022 that the undocumented Indian population in the US dropped 60% from its 2016 peak, falling from 560,000 to 220,000.",
      "How did the number of undocumented Indians drop so steeply from 2016 to 2022? Mr Kapur says the data doesn't provide a clear answer, but plausible explanations could be that some obtained legal status while others returned, particularly due to COVID-related hardships.",
      "However, this estimate doesn't reflect a 2023 surge in Indians at US borders, meaning the actual number could now be higher.",
      "Despite rising border encounters, US government estimates show no clear increase in the overall undocumented Indian population from the US financial year (FY) 2020 to 2022, according to the study.",
      "Encounters refer to instances where non-citizens are stopped by US authorities while attempting to cross the country's borders with Mexico or Canada.",
      "Visa overstays by Indians have remained steady at 1.5% since 2016.",
      "The number of Indian recipients of Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals (Daca) has also declined from 2,600 in 2017 to 1,600 in 2024. The Daca programme protects migrants who came to the US as children.",
      "To sum up: the undocumented Indian population grew both in numbers and as a share of all unauthorised migrants, rising from 0.8% in 1990 to 3.9% in 2015 before dropping to 2% in 2022.",
      "A surge - and shifting migration routes",
      "The US has two main land borders.",
      "The southern border along the states of Arizona, California, New Mexico and Texas bordering Mexico sees the most migrant crossings. Then there's the US-Canada border spanning 11 states.",
      "Before 2010, encounters involving Indians at the two borders were minimal, never exceeding 1,000.",
      "Since 2010, nearly all encounters involving Indians occurred along the US-Mexico southern border.",
      "In FY 2024, encounters of Indian nationals on the northern border surged to 36% of all Indian crossings, up from just 4% the previous year.",
      "Canada had become a more accessible entry point for Indians, with shorter visitor visa processing times than the US.",
      "Also, there was a surge in attempted border crossings from 2021 onwards, and the encounters at the Mexico border peaked in 2023.",
      "\"This is not specific to Indians. It is part of a larger surge of migrants trying to come into the US after Biden was elected. It is as if there was a high tide of migrants and Indians were a part of it,\" Mr Kapur told the BBC.",
      "Where are the illegal Indians staying?",
      "The study finds that the states with the largest Indian immigrant populations -California (112,000), Texas (61,000), New Jersey (55,000), New York (43,000) and Illinois (31,000) - also have the highest numbers of unauthorised Indian immigrants.",
      "Indians make up a significant share of the total unauthorised population in Ohio (16%), Michigan (14%), New Jersey (12%) and Pennsylvania (11%).",
      "Meanwhile, states where more than 20% of Indian immigrants are unauthorised include Tennessee, Indiana, Georgia, Wisconsin and California.",
      "\"We expect this because it's easier to blend in and find work in an ethnic business - like a Gujarati working for a Gujarati-American or a Punjabi/Sikh in a similar setup,\" Mr Kapur said.",
      "Who are the Indians seeking asylum?",
      "The US immigration system allows people who are detained at the border who fear persecution in their home countries to undergo credible \"fear screenings\". Those who pass can seek asylum in court, leading to a rise in asylum applications alongside rising border apprehensions.",
      "Administrative data doesn't reveal the exact demographics of Indian asylum seekers, but court records on spoken languages provide some insight.",
      "Punjabi-speakers from India have dominated Indian asylum claims since 2001. After Punjabi, Indian asylum seekers spoke Hindi (14%), English (8%) and Gujarati (7%).",
      "They have filed 66% of asylum cases from FY 2001\u20132022, suggesting Punjab and the neighbouring state of Haryana as key migrant sources.",
      "Punjabi speakers from India also had the highest asylum approval rate (63%), followed by Hindi speakers (58%). In contrast, only a quarter of Gujarati speakers' cases were approved.",
      "'Gaming the system' - why asylum claims are rising",
      "US data collected by Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) shows Indian asylum requests in the US have skyrocketed.",
      "The requests jumped tenfold in just two years, rising from about 5,000 in 2021 to over 51,000 in 2023.",
      "While this spike is most dramatic in the US, similar trends are seen in Canada, the UK and Australia, where Indians are among the largest asylum-seeking groups, the study says.",
      "Mr Kapur believes this is \"largely a way to game the asylum system rather than an objective fear of persecution, as processing takes years\".",
      "Given the large number of Punjabi-speakers who seek asylum, it's unclear what has changed in the northern Indian state ruled by the Congress party (2017-22) and latterly the Aam Aadmi Party (2022\u2013present) to drive this surge.",
      "Under Trump's second presidency, asylum requests are set to plummet.",
      "Within his first week, a key app for migrants was shut down and removed from app stores, cancelling nearly 300,000 pending appointments, including asylum cases already in progress.",
      "What do asylum seekers tell us about India?",
      "US data shows most Indian asylum seekers are Punjabi and Gujarati - groups from India's wealthier states, better able to afford high migration costs.",
      "In contrast, Indian Muslims and marginalised communities and people from conflict zones like the regions affected by Maoist violence and Kashmir, rarely seek asylum, the study says.",
      "So most Indian asylum seekers are economic migrants, not from the country's poorest or conflict-hit regions.",
      "The arduous journey to the US - whether via Latin America or as \"fake\" students in Canada - costs 30-100 times India's per capita income, making it accessible only to those with assets to sell or pledge, the study says.",
      "Not surprisingly, Punjab and Gujarat - top origin states for unauthorised Indians -  are among India's wealthier regions, where land values far exceed returns from farming.",
      "\"Even illegality takes a lot of money to pursue,\" the study says.",
      "What's fuelling illegal Indian migration?",
      "While rising asylum claims may seem linked to \"democratic backsliding\" in India, correlation isn't causation, the authors say .",
      "Punjab and Gujarat have long histories of emigration, with migrants heading not just to the US but also the UK, Canada and Australia.",
      "Remittances - India received an estimated $120bn in 2023 - fuel aspirations for a better life, driven not by poverty but \"relative deprivation\", as families seek to match the success of others abroad, the study says.",
      "A parallel industry of agents and brokers in India has cashed in on this demand.",
      "The Indian government, says the study, \"has looked the other way, likely because the issue of illegal migration is much more a burden for receiving than sending countries\".",
      "How many Indians have been deported?",
      "Between 2009 and 2024, around 16,000 Indians were deported, according to India's ministry of external affairs.",
      "These deportations averaged 750 per year under Obama, 1,550 under Trump's first term, and 900 under Biden.",
      "Indian migrant removals spiked between FY 2023 and 2024, but the peak was in 2020 with nearly 2,300 deportations.",

    "story": [
      "Mouldy half-finished food on bunk beds, discarded military uniforms and abandoned weapons - these are the remnants of an abrupt retreat from this base that once belonged to Iran and its affiliated groups in Syria.",
      "The scene tells a story of panic. The forces stationed here fled with little warning, leaving behind a decade-long presence that unravelled in mere weeks.",
      "Iran was Syrian President Bashar al-Assad's most critical ally for more than 10 years. It deployed military advisers, mobilised foreign militias, and invested heavily in Syria's war.",
      "Its elite Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps (IRGC) built deep networks of underground bases, supplying arms and training to thousands of fighters. For Iran, this was also part of its \"security belt\" against Israel.",
      "We are near Khan Shaykhun town in Idlib province. Before Assad's regime fell on 8 December, it was one of the key strategic locations for the IRGC and its allied groups.",
      "From the main road, the entrance is barely visible, hidden behind piles of sand and rocks. A watchtower on a hilltop, still painted in the colours of the Iranian flag, overlooks the base.",
      "A receipt notebook confirms the base's name: The Position of Martyr Zahedi -  named after Mohammad Reza Zahedi, a top IRGC commander who was assassinated in an alleged Israeli airstrike on Iran's consulate in Syria on 1 April, 2024.",
      "The supplies recently ordered - we found receipts for chocolates, rice, cooking oil - suggest daily life continued here until the last moments. But now the base has new occupants - two armed Uyghur fighters from Hayaat Tahrir al-Sham (HTS), the Islamist militant group whose leader Ahmed al-Sharaa has become the new interim president of Syria.",
      "The Uyghurs arrived suddenly in a military vehicle, asking for our media accreditation.",
      "\"Iranians were here. They all fled,\" one of them says, speaking in his mother tongue, a dialect of Turkish. \"Whatever you see here is from them. Even these onions and the leftover foods.\"",
      "Boxes full of fresh onions in the courtyard have now germinated.",
      "The base is a labyrinth of tunnels dug deep into white rocky hills. There are bunk beds in some rooms with no windows. The roof of one of the corridors is draped in fabric in the colours of the Iranian flag and there are a few Persian books on a rocky shelf.",
      "They left behind documents containing sensitive information. All in Persian, they have details of fighters' personal information, military personnel codes, home addresses, spouses' names and mobile phone numbers in Iran. From the names, it's clear that several fighters in this base were from the Afghan brigade that was formed by Iran to fight in Syria.",
      "Sources linked to Iran-backed groups told BBC Persian that the base houses mainly Afghan forces accompanied by Iranian \"military advisers\" and their Iranian commanders.",

      "Multiple sources close to the IRGC told the BBC that most of the forces had to flee to Iraq, and some were ordered to go to Lebanon or Russian bases to be evacuated from Syria by the Russians.",

      "He says they thought their operation would take \"about a year\" and best, they'd \"capture Aleppo in three to six months\". But to their surprise, they entered Aleppo in a matter of days.",
      "The regime's rapid downfall was brought about by a chain of events after Hamas's 7 October attack on Israel.",
      "That attack led to an escalation of Israeli air strikes against the IRGC and Iran-backed groups in Syria and a war against another key Iranian ally \u2013 the Lebanese militant group Hezbollah, whose leader was killed in an air strike.",
      "This \"situation of psychological collapse\" for Iran and Hezbollah was central to their downfall, says 35-year-old fighter Rabbat.",
      "But the most crucial blow came from within: there was a rift between Assad and his Iran-linked allies, he says.",
      "\"There was a complete breakdown of trust and military co-operation between them. IRGC-linked groups were blaming Assad of betrayal and believing that he is giving up their locations to Israel.\"",
      "As we pass through Khan Shaykhun, we come across a street painted in the colours of the Iranian flag. It leads to a school building that was being used as an Iranian headquarters.",
      "On the wall at the entrance of the toilets, slogans read: \"Down with Israel\" and \"Down with the USA\".",

      "Abdullah's wife Jourieh says she is happy that the \"Iranian militias\" have left, but still remembers the \"stressful\" moment before their withdrawal. She had thought they would be trapped in crossfire as Iran-backed groups were fortifying their positions and getting ready to fight, but then \"they just vanished in a few hours\".",
      "\"This was an occupation. Iranian occupation,\" says Abdo who, like others, has just returned here with his family after 10 years. His house had also become a military base.",
      "I observed this anger towards Iran and a softer attitude towards Russia in many conversations with Syrians.",
      "I asked Rabbat, the HTS fighter, why this was.",
      "\"Russians were dropping bombs from the sky and other than that, they were in their bases while Iranians and their militias were on the ground interacting. People were feeling their presence, and many weren't happy with it,\" he explained.",

      "\"You can get a criminal charge now, just for lifting a finger,\" Ksenia Fadeeva points out, although the latest film was seen almost two million times in 10 days.",
      "Ksenia is sure most of that audience is in Russia.",
      "\"People haven't changed their views, they're still there. They definitely read and follow and watch,\" she says. \"But they can't protest. They're just surviving.\"",
      "That's a word I hear often from activists: they describe Russian opposition forces in a kind of holding pattern.",
      "\"We can stick to our basic pro-democracy values and try to keep people safe for the future Russia,\" Anastasia Burakova argues, and her own \"Ark\" project tries to do just that.",
      "\"But nobody knows how to successfully finish this dictatorship.\"",
      "Failing to convince",
      "But is there actually demand for that?",
      "\"Imagine asking: 'Do you support Vladimir Putin or do you want to go to jail for 15 years,'\" says Ksenia Fadeeva, mocking the value of conducting polling in an authoritarian regime.",
      "Others believe researchers do still have ways to take the social pulse, and they confirm that it's not set racing by Yulia Navalnaya and co.",
      "Navalny's widow has moral authority but nowhere near his political skills.",
      "\"All these\u2026 liberal figures have extremely low approval ratings,\" says academic Tatiana Stanovaya. Instead, she detects a consolidation of support for the Kremlin which she links to a surge in Ukrainian drone strikes on Russia.",
      "\"People see that we are very vulnerable and they have to choose the strongest player to rely on,\" the analyst explains. \"It's not because they like Putin or consider him a positive hero. It's because he can protect Russia in a very hostile environment.\"",
      "No matter that Putin created that environment himself by going to war.",
      "It helps that Donald Trump now appears to be siding with Moscow: the US president once said he \"understood\" Russia's veto on Ukraine joining Nato. He now seems to have conceded that major condition, even before any peace talks.",
      "\"I think the war has further entrenched anti-Western sentiment,\" Dr Jade McGlynn of King's College suggests. \"I also don't really see evidence there's even a strong minority of Russians who are desirous of a liberal, Western-allied type of democracy.\"",
      "\"I think the liberals\u2026 ultimately failed to convince.\"",
      "There's a whole lot wrapped up in that line, including the economic pain and massive corruption Russians experienced as the USSR fell apart. It all helped make democracy a dirty word.",
      "For years, state TV has also been shouting into every living room that critics of Russia are its enemies, and Western agents.",
      "\"The Kremlin plays on a real fear, ingrained in Russian minds, that the West has been trying to ruin Russia, weaken and divide it,\" Tatiana Stanovaya argues.",
      "\"There is good soil for the Kremlin to work on.\"",
      "Divided dissent",
      "Opposition forces are also deeply divided.",
      "Fierce rivalries and personality clashes that go back many years have intensified in exile and now frequently erupt into vicious and very public fights.",
      "\"We can debate after democracy in Russia begins, but for now we have the same goal and the same enemy: he's in the Kremlin,\" Anastasia Burakova voices the frustration of many that such scrapping is a dangerous distraction.",
      "That division is part of why Jade McGlynn thinks Russia's exiled activists might better be called \"dissidents\" than a political opposition.",
      "\"Politics is about practicality, otherwise you are a philosopher,\" she argues \u2013 and challenging those in power is impossible in Russia right now.",
      "Anastasia Shevchenko agrees. But just surviving Putinism isn't good enough for her. \"I hate when people still talk about the 'beautiful Russia of the future',\" the Russian activist quoted Alexei Navalny, when we met in a Kyiv coffee shop last month.",
      "\"You can't be happy next to destroyed cities where so many people were killed.\"",
      "Other opposition figures insist on referring to \"Putin's war\", to suggest that most Russians are against the invasion - which infuriates Ukrainians.",
      "\"I think to claim that it's one man's war when you have 600,000 troops there and over three million in the defence industry, not including all the propagandists, is not convincing,\" Jade McGlynn is firm.",
      "Other ways to help",
      "But Anastasia Shevchenko struggles to focus on anything else. Whilst change within Russia remains \"very far away\", she sees Ukraine is in trouble now and she can help.",
      "She's become a one-woman telephone exchange for Ukrainian soldiers held captive in Russia: prisoners of war, who can't call Ukrainian numbers from Russian jails, dial Anastasia's Russian mobile. She gets their mother or wife on another line and places the phones together so they can talk.",
      "\"If you can help Ukraine, you should do that,\" she believes. \"But we Russians are focused only on Russia and I don't understand it.\"",
      "Still readjusting to life out of prison, and out of her country, Ksenia Fadeeva has shifted her own focus from politics to human rights for now, helping political prisoners.",
      "\"I still believe Russia has every chance of becoming a normal, free, peaceful European country,\" Ksenia Fadeeva insists. \"But the regime is far harsher now, more authoritarian.\"",
      "Anastasia Shevchenko agrees, though she remembers the collapse of the USSR and concedes that history is unpredictable.",
      "\"You never know what happens. Things can change quickly. So you have to be ready.\"",
      "But ready for what?",
      "Spectre of nationalism",
      "The idea of Russia leaping from Putinism to liberal democracy looks less likely than ever.",
      "Jade McGlynn sees no prospect at all, unless the vision that led to the invasion of Ukraine - \"this imperial, chauvinist vision of Russia\" \u2013 is defeated.",
      "\"I think that's where we will see real opposition,\" she thinks. \"From disgruntled nationalists,\" especially in a country with tens of thousands of war veterans and all their trauma.",
      "\"What will the authorities 'sell' to the people then? What idea?,\" Ksenia Fadeeva wonders, when the war is finally over.",
      "All agree the political repression will remain intense. As the analyst Tatiana Stanovaya puts it: \"The state, especially the repressive apparatus, do not have the skills to retreat.\"",
      "On Sunday, Navalny's supporters plan memorials from Argentina to Australia to mark the anniversary of his death. In Moscow, some will visit his graveside. A few may dare to chant for change.

      "America's top diplomat, his senior officials and the travelling press returned to Andrews Air Force Base near Washington DC on Thursday night.",
      "But despite the mid-air scare the news was already firmly elsewhere. In Europe, US Defence Secretary Pete Hegseth had stunned America's allies with a speech setting out what many saw as a series of concessions Ukraine would have to make to sign any peace deal with Russia brokered by President Trump.",
      "Hegseth said it was \"unrealistic\" to think Ukraine could win back its sovereign territory occupied by Russia, as was its demand for Nato membership, adding it was up to European and not US troops to keep the peace.",
      "Critics, including some Republicans in Washington, castigated the speech, saying it gave away all of Ukraine's leverage ahead of any negotiations. It was, they argued, a US capitulation to Russian President Vladimir Putin.",
      "\"It's certainly an innovative approach to a negotiation to make very major concessions even before they have started,\" said former Swedish Prime Minister Carl Bildt, who co-chairs the European Council on Foreign Relation, a think tank.",

      "Ukraine end game: What each side wants from a peace deal",
      "Ukraine in maps: Tracking the war with Russia",
      "The following day, Hegseth wound back some of what he had said. He clarified that all options were in fact still on the table for Trump to use as leverage between Putin and Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky.",
      "\"What he decides to allow or not allow is at the purview of the leader of the free world, President Trump,\" said Hegseth. However he added he had been \"simply pointing out realism\" and rejected the idea he had offered any undue concessions to Moscow.",
      "As for Rubio, the broken-down plane delayed his arrival in Munich, where his officials were briefing about his own priorities for the trip.",
      "The United States would work for a \"just and lasting peace\" in which European countries would take the lead in creating a \"durable security framework\", they said.",
      "European leaders are expected to meet in Paris on Monday for urgent talks aimed at ensuring that their countries are fully involved in any Ukraine peace negotiations.",
      "The US secretary of state's position contained no trace of laying out limits for Ukraine in the way the defence secretary had done. Then, also in the German city, Vice-President JD Vance said the US could use \"military tools of leverage\" to compel Russia to do a deal, appearing to contradict Hegseth who had said no US troops would be deployed to Ukraine.",
      "Later in the Oval Office, the fallout from Hegseth's speech was put to President Trump - along with the commentary of a Republican senator who described it as a \"rookie mistake\", like something a pro-Putin pundit could have written.",
      "Had Trump been aware of what Hegseth was going to say? \"Generally speaking, yeah, generally speaking I was,\" said the president. \"I'll speak to Pete, I'll find out,\" he added.",
      "The three days of to and fro gave some of the first major insights into Trump's evolving position on one of the most consequential issues he faces - Russia's full-scale invasion of Ukraine and his vow to end the war - and also into how his administration is formulating and messaging its foreign policy.",
      "On the substance, Hegseth's speech \u2013 alongside Trump's lengthy statement about an apparently warm phone call with Putin aimed at starting negotiations with Ukraine - sent shockwaves through European capitals, despite Hegseth's attempts to row back.",
      "\"Any quick fix is a dirty deal,\" said the European Union foreign policy chief Kaja Kallas of the prospect of a US-led deal with Russia that might leave Ukraine's voice on the sidelines.",
      "Then there is the question of the way US foreign policy under Trump was being communicated. What happened in Munich seemed to be partly an attempt by his senior officials to interpret and relay Trump's positions, but that effort resulted in sometimes explosive and often contradictory statements - some of which were then partly diluted or reversed.",
      "JD Vance's blast at Europe ignores Ukraine and defence agendaTrump wants peace. Ukrainians fear what that might look like",
      "JD Vance's blast at Europe ignores Ukraine and defence agenda",
      "Trump wants peace. Ukrainians fear what that might look like",
      "It is not yet clear how much this is the result of a new but ill-coordinated administration still clarifying its lines to take internally, as opposed to a deliberate feature of a presidency less concerned about officials freelancing with rhetoric, even if it sows some confusion, so long as they remain loyal to his final word.",
      "Trump's first term saw a series of high-profile sackings or resignations of top officials who contradicted or disagreed with him, including three national security advisers, two defence secretaries and a secretary of state.",
      "This time around, his appointments have been characterised more frequently by a willingness to show loyalty. Pete Hegseth, who had no previous experience running a military or government or agency, was a Fox News weekend presenter and former National Guard major who aligns strongly with Trump's thinking and agenda.",
      "His appointment was highly contested and scraped through its confirmation process with three Republican senators voting against him, seeing the result tied 50-50 with JD Vance casting the tie-breaking vote.",
      "As Trump said himself this week he was \"OK\" with the idea of taking Ukraine joining Nato off the negotiating table, calling it \"not practical\".",
      "Hegseth's comments were hardly out of line with the president's position - rather they were an amplification of it to an audience anxious to shore up Ukraine's negotiating position not weaken it.",
      "The challenge for those affected is that the precise position of US foreign policy is having to be defined. One of its features is uncertainty. This may well be deliberate - Donald Trump using the \"madman\" theory of foreign relations - often attributed to former Republican President Richard Nixon.",
      "This suggests that being powerful but unpredictable is a way to make allies stay close while coercing adversaries. It would also explain a sense of his own officials going rogue but within the parameters of Trump's broadly known positions.",
      "But as this theory's name suggests, it also carries considerable risks of mistakes or miscalculation in an already violent and uncertain world.",
      "Trump's recent proposals for Gaza \u2013 emptying it of its Palestinian population to build the \"Riviera of the Middle East\" under US ownership - were similarly permeated with confusion and contradiction.",

    "published": "Sun, 16 Feb 2025 01:23:40 GMT",
    "summary": "Two of India\u2019s top visually impaired female athletes share the challenges of finding the perfect guide runner.",
    "story": [
      "\"When I was growing up, everyone in my village would say: 'She is blind, she is a waste',\" says Rakshitha Raju. Now, aged 24, she is one of India's top middle distance para athletes. \"It makes me so proud,\" she says.",
      "Rakshitha was born blind in a remote village in southern India and had lost both her parents by the age of 10. She was raised by her grandmother who is hearing and speech impaired.",
      "\"Both of us are disabled, so my grandma understood me,\" she says.",
      "When Rakshitha was about 13, the sports teacher at her school took her aside and told her she had the potential to be a great athlete.",
      "\"I wondered: 'How? I am blind, so how do I run on a track I can't see?'\" she recalls.",
      "Her teacher explained that visually impaired runners can have a guide, who runs alongside them. The athletes are joined by a tether - a short strap with a loop on both ends for each of them to hold on to.",
      "For a while, other pupils acted as guide runners for Rakshitha. Then in 2016, when she was 15, she competed in the National Games, where a man called Rahul Balakrishna spotted her.",
      "A middle-distance runner, Rahul had previously competed in the 1500m himself. He had been introduced to para athletics by a coach at the Paralympic Committee of India (PCI) a few years earlier, while recovering from an injury.",
      "There was a shortage of guides and coaches and Rahul decided to take on both roles. The government pays him a salary for the coaching side of his work, but it does not pay guide runners.",
      "However, if a visually impaired runner wins an international competition, their guide also gets a medal - something Rahul had not achieved in his own running career. \"I felt proud that I could do this for myself and my country,\" he says.",
      "He invested his own time and money to support Rakshitha, helping her move to Bangalore in 2018 so she could have access to better training facilities.",
      "When they are running \"it's the small things that matter\", says Rahul. \"When they are approaching a curve, the guide has to alert the athlete or when a competitor is overtaking, he has to tell the athlete so they can put in a little more effort.\"",
      "Competition rules mean they can't hold hands - they can only be connected by the tether, and the guide-runner is not allowed to push, pull or otherwise propel the visually impaired athlete.",
      "Over time, the pair have built up a strong bond and now \"I believe in my guide runner more than myself\", says Rakshitha.",
      "They won gold medals at the 2018 and 2023 Asian Games, returning to a resounding welcome in Rakshitha's village. She smiles as she describes how the people who used to taunt her organised a procession for her, cheering and waving flags.",
      "Rakshitha became the first blind Indian woman to qualify for the 1500m in the Paralympics and she competed with Rahul in Paris in 2024.",
      "They missed out on a medal in France, but India's only other visually impaired female athlete to qualify for Paris, sprinter Simran Sharma, did make it to the podium, bringing home a bronze.",
      "Simran is partially sighted and when she started running, she ran alone.",
      "But in 2021, when Simran competed in the Tokyo Paralympics, she strayed out of her lane and realised that she would need a guide if she wanted to carry on running.",
      "But the search proved challenging. \"It can't be any athlete. You need someone whose technique matches yours and who runs as fast as you do,\" she explains.",
      "Simran finally spotted a young athlete called Abhay Kumar, who was training at the same place as her. The 18-year-old was between competitions and guiding Simran was an opportunity for him to get experience at international events.",
      "\"They sent me videos and after watching them I thought: 'I am a fast learner, this is going to be easy',\" he says. \"But when I ran for the first time, it turned out to be very difficult.\" Every movement has to be synchronised.",
      "Simran and Abhay did not have time to practice together for long before their first international competition - the 2024 World Para Athletics Championships in Japan - just a few weeks after they met.",
      "Their first race, the 100m, ended in disaster.",
      "\"Neither of us knew the rules properly,\" says Simran. Abhay \"thought he had to stop to let me cross the line first, so he stopped completely\". They were disqualified as he should have kept going and crossed the line just behind her.",
      "But by the time they got to the 200m race, they knew what they were doing and struck gold. Simran became the World Champion in the T12 category.",
      "Riding on that high, they went to the Paralympics in Paris. They came fourth in the 100m, but won bronze in the 200m race and Simran became the first Indian woman with a visual impairment to win a Paralympic medal.",
      "But Simran is worried how long Abhay will stay as her guide. He has his own career to think of too.",
      "Although guide runners get a medal when a pair wins, the Paralympic Committee of India (PCI) says it cannot support guides with salaries, cash prizes or offer a long-term career path.",
      "\"All we can do is support short-term needs like their food, accommodation, transport and training facilities,\" says the PCI's national athletics coach Mr Satyanarayana, who goes by one name.",
      "Both Rakshitha and Simran now have sponsorship deals which help fund their training. They pay their guides themselves and give them a share of any prize money they win. But Rahul and Abhay would like more support from the state and want to be allowed to apply for public sector jobs reserved for sportsmen and women - like the athletes they work with.",
      "Despite the uncertainty around her future with Abhay, Simran is already looking ahead to the next Paralympic Games in Los Angeles. \"I won't rest till I change the colour of this medal,\" she says, hoping that next time she will win gold.",
      "Rakshitha is hoping for a medal next time too, with Rahul at her side. \"She must win a medal,\" he says. \"There are many like her in villages. They don't know about sports and the possibilities. Rakshitha would be a role model for them.\"",

    "published": "Sun, 16 Feb 2025 02:48:15 GMT",
    "summary": "The population of the national bird is declining partly due to encroachment on wetlands by farmers.",
    "story": [
      "With its distinctive golden crown, red throat pouch and slender black legs, the crested crane is beloved in Uganda - featuring on the East African nation's flag and coat of arms.",
      "All the country's national sports teams are also nicknamed after the iconic bird, but in recent years it has gone into decline and conservationists say it may face extinction if more is not done to protect it.",
      "The bird is protected by law - it stipulates a life sentence and/or a fine of 20bn Ugandan shillings ($5m; \u00a34m) for those found to have killed one.",
      "Going back centuries, local Buganda cultural superstition also protected the elegant fowl, which was seen as a symbol of wealth, good fortune and longevity.",
      "It was believed that if one killed a crane, its kith and kin would flock to the killer's home, hold vigil and mourn by collectively honking until the person went mad or even died.",
      "\"Such stories instilled fear, and cranes would be respected and revered and not killed,\" Jimmy Muheebwa, a senior conservationist at Nature Uganda, a local non-governmental organisation (NGO), told the BBC.",
      "But for farmers in western Uganda, where the cranes mostly hang out, that fear has dissipated and often it is only conservationists who appear to know about the ban on killing them.",
      "\"I really don't see any value in these birds because all they do is raid our plantations and eat our crops. We are worried about food security in this area,\" Tom Mucunguzi, a maize farmer from a village near Mbarara city in Western Region, told the BBC.",
      "Another farmer near Mbarara, Fausita Aritua, agreed, saying when she goes to her maize plot she spends the whole day chasing away the cranes - and if she cannot get there, she tries to get someone else to stand guard.",
      "\"We no longer harvest as much as we used to do because these birds eat everything,\" she told the BBC.",
      "Also known as grey-crowned cranes, the birds are predominantly found in Uganda but are also in Kenya, Tanzania, Rwanda, Burundi, Democratic Republic of Congo, Mozambique, South Africa and Zimbabwe.",
      "They are non-migratory, but make local and seasonal movements depending on food resources, nest site availability and the weather.",
      "Standing at about 1m (3.2ft) tall, the waterfowl mostly live in wetland areas - riverbanks, around dams and open grassland - where they breed and feed on grass seeds, small toads, frogs, insects and other invertebrates.",
      "But with the increasing human population, the high demand for food is pushing farmers to cultivate in wetlands, leaving crested cranes with diminishing areas to call home.",
      "\"In eastern Africa, the population has declined terribly by over 80% in the last 25 years,\" Adalbert Ainomucunguzi, who leads the International Crane Foundation (ICF) in East Africa, told BBC.",
      "In the1970s, Uganda boasted a population of more than 100,000 crested cranes, but today that number has dwindled to a mere 10,000, according to Nature Uganda.",
      "This decline saw the International Union for the Conservation of Nature (IUCN) put the crested crane on its red list of endangered bird species in 2012.",
      "\"Despite its serenity, beauty and popularity, the bird is facing a serious threat. It means that if no urgent measures are taken to reverse this trend, we might see the cranes pushed to extinction,\" Dan Sseruge, a Ugandan ornithologist, told the BBC.",
      "Around Mbarara we found it was difficult to track down the birds - and only saw them early in the morning just after dawn.",
      "Conservationists say they used to be much easier to find in the landscape surrounding Mbarara.",
      "Dozens of cranes have in recent years been found dead after they were poisoned by rice and maize farmers in Lwengo district, in south-central Uganda.",
      "\"One of the biggest threats against cranes is poisoning by the farmers. This is because the birds are causing a lot of crop damage,\" Gilbert Tayebwa, a conservation officer at ICF, told BBC.",
      "Mr Tayebwa said he has been engaging farmers to use different deterrent methods like scarecrows to protect their crops from invading cranes.",
      "Farmers like Philip Ntare, from Lwengo, said the cranes were sometimes mistakenly poisoned after eating crops sprayed with agro-chemicals and other pesticides.",
      "\"I just chase them, because I grew up knowing the crested crane is not supposed to be killed. But government should consider compensating farmers for crop damage,\" he told the BBC.",
      "However, John Makombo, director of conservation at the Uganda Wildlife Authority (UWA), said this was not possible.",
      "\"It is one of those precious species that have freedom to go anywhere and so unfortunately the government is not liable for any damage done by the cranes,\" he told the BBC.",
      "Sarah Kugonza, an ICF conservationist, said the cranes also face a host of other threats - not just from farmers. Without the protective cover of the wetlands, their chicks are more likely to be captured by eagles.",
      "Cranes are finding day by day that they are living in an increasingly hostile environment.",
      "\"Sometimes breeding areas are flooded and nowadays some cranes are killed by electricity lines when flying,\" Ms Kugonza told BBC.",
      "Their exceptional beauty has also put them at risk as people are increasingly capturing them to be pets, according to Mr Ainomucunguzi.",
      "But crested cranes, who can live for just over two decades, hardly ever breed in captivity as the birds are famously faithful.",
      "\"It is a highly monogamous bird as it pairs once, for life. This means that if one of them is killed or domesticated, the likelihood of finding a new mating partner is almost zero,\" said Mr Muheebwa.",
      "They attract a mate by dancing, bowing and jumping - and are often seen walking as couples or families. A pair will define their own territory and can be very aggressive to defend it.",
      "Scientifically called Balearica regulorum gibbericeps, the cranes also have unique nesting patterns as they usually return to the same location annually, often laying between two and five eggs that are incubated by both sexes for anywhere between 28 and 31 days.",
      "Any destruction to these nesting areas impacts on these breeding patterns.",
      "Their monogamy has also attracted the unwelcome attention of local traditional healers, who claim that the parts of crested crane may bring faithfulness from a partner - or good luck.",
      "\"Some people have been caught hunting cranes to take some of their body parts to witch doctors in a belief that they will get rich. Or, if you are a woman, your husband will never leave you,\" Mr Tayebwa from ICF said.",
      "This is also something conservationists are trying to counter - as well as alerting people to the law protecting cranes.",
      "And in an effort to reverse declining numbers, the Ugandan government and conservationist groups are now rallying communities to restore wetlands.",
      "President Yoweri Museveni, who comes from the Western Region, has been urging encroachers to vacate wetland areas and, according to local media, has declared 2025 a year of wetland conservation.",
      "The ICF has also recruited custodians to monitor and ensure that the cranes' breeding grounds are protected.",
      "Nature Uganda's Mr Muheebwa said these efforts were slowly helping to stabilise the situation but crane numbers remained \"very low\".",
      "For Mr Makombo, the UWA's future emphasis is going to be on setting an example when it comes to the law.",
      "\"We shall arrest and prosecute those who are poisoning the cranes,\" he said.",

    "published": "Mon, 17 Feb 2025 14:21:25 -0500",
    "summary": "Meta appears unable to keep up with the spread of sexualized, deepfake images of stars including Miranda Cosgrave and Scarlett Johansson on Facebook.",
    "story": [
      "Meta has removed over a dozen fraudulent, sexualized images of famous female actors and athletes after a CBS News investigation found a high prevalence of AI-manipulated deepfake images on the company's Facebook platform.",
      "Dozens of fake, highly sexualized images of the actors Miranda Cosgrove, Jeanette McCurdy, Ariana Grande, Scarlett Johansson and former tennis star Maria Sharapova have been shared widely by multiple Facebook accounts, garnering hundreds of thousands of likes and many reshares on the platform.",
      "\"We've removed these images for violating our policies and will continue monitoring for other violating posts. This is an industry-wide challenge, and we're continually working to improve our detection and enforcement technology,\" Meta spokesperson Erin Logan told CBS News in a statement emailed on Friday.",

      "How to spot deepfake images online",
      "An analysis of over a dozen of these images by Reality Defender, a platform that works to detect AI-generated media, showed that many of the photos were deepfake images \u2014 with AI-generated, underwear-clad bodies replacing the bodies of celebrities in otherwise real photographs. A few of the images were likely created using image stitching tools that do not involve AI, according to Reality Defender's analysis.",
      "\"Almost all deepfake pornography does not have the consent of the subject being deepfaked,\" Ben Colman, co-founder and CEO of Reality Defender told CBS News on Sunday. \"Such content is growing at a dizzying rate, especially as existing measures to stop such content are seldom implemented.\"",
      "CBS News has sought comments from Miranda Cosgrove, Jeanette McCurdy, Ariana Grande, and Maria Sharapova on this story. Johansson declined to issue any comment, according to a representative for the actor.",
      "Under Meta's Bullying and Harassment policy, the company prohibits \"derogatory sexualized photoshop or drawings\" on its platforms. The company also bans adult nudity, sexual activity and adult sexual exploitation, and its regulations are intended to block users from sharing or threatening to share non-consensual intimate imagery. Meta has also rolled out the use of \"AI info\" labels to clearly mark content that is AI manipulated.",
      "But questions remain over the effectiveness of the tech company's policing of such content. CBS News found dozens of AI-generated, sexualized images of Cosgrave and McCurdy still publicly available on Facebook even after the widespread sharing of such content, in violation of the company's terms, was flagged to Meta.",
      "One such deepfake image of Cosgrave that was still up over the weekend had been shared by an account with 2.8 million followers.",
      "The two actors \u2014 both former child stars on the Nickelodeon show iCarly, which is owned by CBS News' parent company Paramount Global \u2014 are the most prolifically targeted for deepfake content, based on the images of public figures that CBS News has analyzed.",
      "Meta's Oversight Board, a quasi-independent body that consists of experts in the field of human rights and freedom of speech, and makes recommendations for content moderation on Meta's platforms, told CBS News in an emailed statement that the company's current regulations around sexualized deepfake content are insufficient.",
      "The Oversight Board cited recommendations it has made to Meta over the past year,\u00a0 including urging the company to make its rules clearer by updating its prohibition against \"derogatory sexualized photoshop\" to specifically include the word \"non-consensual\" and to encompass other photo manipulation techniques such as AI.",
      "The board has also recommended that Meta fold its ban on \"derogatory sexualized photoshop\" into the company's Adult Sexual Exploitation regulations, so moderation of such content would be more rigorously enforced.",
      "Asked Monday by CBS News about the board's recommendations, Meta pointed to the guidelines on its transparency website, which show the company is assessing the feasibility of three of four recommendations from the oversight board and is implementing one of its suggestions, though Meta noted in its statement on its site that it is currently ruling out changing the language of its \"derogatory sexualized photoshop\" policy to include the phrase \"non consensual.\" Meta also says it is currently unlikely   to move its \"derogatory sexualized photoshop\" policy to within its Adult Sexual Exploitation regulations.",
      "Meta noted in its statement that it was still considering ways to signal a lack of consent in AI-generated images. Meta also said it was considering reforms to its Adult Sexual Exploitation policies, to \"capture the spirit\" of the board's recommendations.",
      "\"The Oversight Board has made clear that non-consensual deepfake intimate images are a serious violation of privacy and personal dignity, disproportionately harming women and girls. These images are not just a misuse of technology \u2014 they are a form of abuse that can have lasting consequences,\" Michael McConnell, an Oversight Board co-chair, told CBS News on Friday.",
      "\"The Board is actively monitoring Meta's response and will continue to push for stronger safeguards, faster enforcement, and greater accountability,\" McConnell said.",
      "Meta is not the only social media company to face the issue of widespread, sexualized deepfake content.",
      "Last year, Elon Musk's platform X temporarily blocked Taylor Swift-related searches after AI-generated fake pornographic images in the likeness of the singer circulated widely on the platform and garnered millions of views and impressions.",
      "\"Posting Non-Consensual Nudity (NCN) images is strictly prohibited on X and we have a zero-tolerance policy towards such content,\" the platform's safety team said in a post at the time.",
      "A study published earlier this month by the U.K. government found the number of deepfake images on social media platforms expanding at a rapid rate, with the government projecting that 8 million deepfakes would be shared this year, up from 500,000 in 2023.",

      "From hunting of dangerous predators to surviving treacherous seas, Spencer Dutton's journey in \"1923\" has been anything but ordinary. Now, actor Brandon Sklenar is promising even darker waters ahead for the troubled Dutton heir in the hit series' second season premiering this Sunday on Paramount +, which is part of the same corporate family as CBS News.",
      "Sklenar  told \"CBS Mornings\" on Monday that creator Taylor Sheridan foreshadowed the depth of Spencer's story in Season 1. Sheridan was also the director of the series \"Yellowstone.\" \"1923\" is the \"Yellowstone\" prequel.",
      "\"You're kind of giving glimpses into what Spencer's capable of, and what demons he's sort of running from, and what he's fighting for. And I think he [Sheridan] really lets the cat out of the bag in Season 2,\" said Sklenar.",
      "The actor also praised the emotional impact of the season finale, describing it as \"profoundly beautiful.\" The second season promises more hurdles for Dutton and his love interest, Alex, as they continue their struggle to be reunited.",
      "Sklenar also discussed his experience working with Hollywood legends Harrison Ford and Helen Mirren, who play his parents in the show. Though Sklenar couldn't confirm whether they share the screen in the new season, he spoke highly of the two, describing them as \"living icons.\"",
      "\"They're just so sweet, so kind, and they're human beings before all else, and it's a testament to why they have lasted as long as they have,\" Sklenar said.",
      "The actor also opened up about his own background, sharing how his blue-collar upbringing and background in martial arts helped him connect with Dutton. \"Spencer has like a physicality to him, that he uses his body and he's not afraid to take it to extreme places, and I can relate to that for sure,\" he said.",

      "Sklenar, who is also known for his role in \"It Ends With Us,\" said despite a legal battle between actress Blake Lively and director and actor Justin Baldoni, he remains focused on the movie's intended message.",
      "\"I just want people to remember why we made the movie in the first place, and what it stands for, and just keeping the focus on that,\" Sklenar said. \"That movie meant so much to me, and I have someone very, very close to me in my life who's gone through what Lily's going through for a long time, and I've been on the front lines helping her navigate that space, so that movie meant a lot to me, and it means a lot to her, this person in my life.\"",
      "\"It's unfortunate that things get taken away from what the ethos of that thing is and it gets convoluted,\" he said.",
      "As far as whether he is Team Blake or Team Justin, Skelnar said he is Team \"It Ends With Us.\"",

      "The show had its typical ending, with all involved looking exhilarated and exhausted on the studio stage. This night it was so crowded with luminaries it looked like it might break. Led by Short, they all applauded in tribute to Michaels, who created the show and has run it for 45 of its 50 years.",

    "story": [
      "The fires that ravaged Southern California last month turned too many of Malibu's most treasured places to ash. But some, like the legendary Shangri-La Studios, still stand. Over the years, Shangri-La has been used by some of the biggest names in the music business, like Eric Clapton and Adele. But it's also known as the house that Bob Dylan built. Even the old bus out back, legend has it, was used by Dylan on tour.",
      "Dylan even camped out on the lawn. \"I actually think it's in Clapton's biography that there was a period where Dylan had a tent in the rose garden here,\" said actor Edward Norton.",
      "For him, this is hallowed ground \u2013 and in a way, so is his latest movie role. In \"A Complete Unknown,\" Norton is folk music legend Pete Seeger, playing opposite Timoth\u00e9e Chalamet as the young Bob Dylan.",
      "Norton says playing a music legend like Seeger was both sublime, and terrifying. \"I think every actor, some part of 'em wants to be a rock star, you know?\" he said. \"I think every actor holds the dream in some sense. I mean, I almost started crying at the idea of it, because, well, I was nervous about it. I was nervous about the whole enterprise. Because I thought the idea of a biopic about Dylan \u2013 if you just said it that way, I was, like, Oooh, like, I'm not sure. 'Cause to me, it has a mythical kind of place in me, and I thought, this could be really, really a bad idea.\"",
      "And here's just one of the challenges: Pete Seeger was an accomplished banjo player, so Norton had to become one as well, and the banjo's a tough one to learn.",
      "I said, \"We did an interview with Steve Martin, and he played the banjo for us, and watching him play the banjo, I mean, it's so complex and it's so fast.\"",
      "\"Yeah, I made the joke that I googled, you know, 'Is there an AI that can replace my hands with Steve Martin's?'\" Norton laughed. \"Or, you know, that thing where you put your arms behind your back and Steve Martin puts his hands under my armpits and does the playing for me? Which I'm not saying is not what happened, you know? It might have. Who knows?\"",
      "In the finished film, his playing looks and sounds authentic, because it is:",
      "That authenticity is something that Norton has always worked for, starting with his very first movie role, as a calculating killer in the 1996 thriller \"Primal Fear.\" Norton, who was raised in Maryland, cultivated an Appalachian accent so real that people thought he was actually from Kentucky, and he wound up with his first Oscar nomination. Three years later he was fighting it out with Brad Pitt in \"Fight Club,\" a film that has now become embedded in our culture.",
      "And although it has a huge following now, it was not successful when it was released. \"No, not at all,\" Norton said. \"And it was polarizing. I would say, there were those who absolutely, like, it hit them right in the center of their sense of their own selves. And then there were people who just absolutely thought it was garbage \u2013 panned it.\"",
      "In fact, it was roundly booed at the Venice Film Festival. But that didn't bother Norton, or his co-star Pitt. \"As the credits rolled, Brad looked at me in the dark crying, and he said, 'That's the best film we'll ever be in.' And I said, 'Me, too, and I think so, too.' And we were hugging each other and crying because we were so happy with, like, boos rising around us, you know what I mean? I think sometimes you just gotta, you know, let your own freak flag fly, and people will figure it out, or not.\"",
      "Norton has let his own freak flag fly in more than 40 films, like a mild-mannered police captain in \"The Grand Budapest Hotel.\" He was an ego-driven Broadway actor in \"Birdman\"; and he nailed the eccentric billionaire part in \"Glass Onion.\"",
      "Watching him on-screen, it's hard to believe Norton was once told he didn't have what it takes to make it as an actor. There was once a casting director who told him, \"Find another profession.\"",
      "\"Yeah, I had one of those, like, someone sits you down and says, 'You should do something else,'\" he said. \"Very, very, very well-known casting director in New York. One of the ones you hoped to get in front of. But look, if you don't run into moments where people lay some fundamental uncertainty around you [about] the path you've chosen, and you can't push through it, then you probably don't belong.\"",
      "There's little doubt he belongs in all of this: Norton has an Oscar nomination for every decade of his career, and he's in the running now for his work in \"A Complete Unknown.\" But he says that, for him, it's not about the awards or the money, but the chance to channel greatness.",
      "He said, \"If channeling their frequency gets people refocused on what it looked like when people were using the talents they had to further ideas and values that were bigger than themselves, then that is what makes it worth doing. Can we get people to re-engage with and be moved by and inspired by the idea of artists as agents of change?\"",

      "\"Lorne: The Man Who Invented Saturday Night Live,\"\u00a0by New Yorker articles editor Susan Morrison (to be published February 18 by Random House), is a biography of late-night comedy producer Lorne Michaels, who has guided \"Saturday Night Live\" for most of its 50 years. But it is also the history of a pop culture institution that has introduced phenomenal comic talents, rewritten the rules of live television, and captured or challenged the zeitgeist for a half-century.",

      "Prologue",
      "Every week at Saturday Night Live is just like every other week. Every week is the same because it's always intense, fueled by insanely hard work, full of triumphs and failures and backstage explosions, and because it's built around a guest host\u2014Jennifer Lopez or Lizzo or Elon Musk\u2014who often has no idea what they are doing. It has been Lorne Michaels's job for the last fifty years to make it seem as if they do, and to corral the egos and the talents on his staff into getting the show on the air, live. Since he created the show, in 1975, he has periodically tweaked and fine-tuned it, paying attention to how the cultural winds are drifting. But the formula has essentially remained the same. Michaels compares it to a Snickers bar: viewers expect a certain amount of peanuts, a certain amount of caramel, and a certain amount of chocolate. (\"There's a comfort level,\" he says.) The show has good years and bad years, like the New York Yankees, or the Dow, and the audience has come to feel something like ownership of it. Just about every person who has ever watched SNL believes that its funniest years were the ones when they were in high school. Michaels likes to say that everyone in the entertainment business has two jobs: their actual job and figuring out how to fix SNL. (When J. D. Salinger died, in 2010, letters surfaced in which even he griped about what was wrong with the show.)",
      "The show's cast members and writers have speculated for years about the secret behind Michaels's extraordinary tenure. \"It's him and Hitchcock,\" John Mulaney says. \"No one else has had this kind of longevity.\" Half of them believe that Michaels has repeatedly been able to remake the show for a new audience because he's a once-in-a-lifetime talent, a producer nonpareil. The other half wonders whether Michaels, gnomic and almost comically elusive, is a blank screen onto which they've all projected a lifetime of hopes and fears and dark jokes; whether he, like the cramped stages in SNL's Studio 8H, is just a backdrop for the ever-shifting brilliance of the country's best comic minds.",

    "title": "Looking back at 50 years of \"Saturday Night Live\"",
    "published": "Sun, 16 Feb 2025 10:14:56 -0500",
    "summary": "On October 11, 1975, people tuning into the debut of a late-night comedy show saw something unlike any TV variety extravaganza they'd ever seen. Today, \"Saturday Night Live,\" produced by Lorne Michaels, is now an entrenched part of pop culture.",
    "story": [
      "On Saturday night, October 11, 1975, television viewers tuned in for a comedy variety show that looked nothing like they were used to. \"It's a sketch, a very unusual sketch, kind of in a minor key, [with] John Belushi as a kind of rumpled guy with a grocery sack,\" said writer Susan Morrison. \"He's supposed to be an immigrant trying to learn English.\"",
      "Instructor (Michael O'Donoghue): \"I would like\u2026\"Belushi: \"I would like\u2026\"Instructor: \"\u2026to feed your fingertips\u2026\"Belushi: \"\u2026to feed your fingertips\u2026\"Instructor: \"\u2026to the wolverines.\"Belushi: \"\u2026to the wolverines.\"",
      "When the instructor succumbs to a heart attack and falls to the floor, Belushi mimics him. \"It's about death,\" Morrison laughed. \"And that was something that variety shows did not traffic in in 1975!\"",
      "Morrison is the author of \"Lorne\" (that would be Lorne Michaels, the man behind \"Saturday Night Live\"). For 50 years now, \"Saturday Night Live\" has been putting on a 90-minute mix of live comedy sketches, beloved commercial parodies, and musical acts, each episode headlined by a celebrity host.",
      "So, what did variety shows look like before SNL? \"They took place on a big, wide stage; it was very shiny, very blank,\" said Morrison. \"And the content of these variety shows also was kind of a throwback \u2013 very hammy, almost vaudevillian, kind of Catskill comics doing seltzer-in-the-pants bits.\"",
      "Michaels worked on several of those shows, including \"Laugh-In.\" Morrison said, \"'Laugh-In' was really the first variety show that seemed to care about youth culture and being hip. But politically, that show was relatively toothless. What passed for political humor on 'Laugh-In' was Goldie Hawn doing kind of a dumb blonde bit.\"",
      "Michaels learned a different lesson working on a cornball comedy show hosted by Phyllis Diller.\u00a0 Its premiere episode in 1968 went up against a Barbra Streisand special. \"Streisand was the hottest thing out there,\" said Morrison. \"'Funny Girl' was about to come out. And Lorne thought, 'Oh my God, we're dead. Everybody's gonna watch Streisand.' But as it turned out, the Diller show beat Streisand in the ratings by a mile.",
      "\"And Lorne recognized, I think he said, 'You know, I realized there are two audiences. You know, there's the people I know, and then there's the wider American audience.' And to this day, he's always telling his young writers and performers, 'We have audience in all 50 states. We have to remember this is broadcast. It takes in the whole country.'\"",
      "Keeping all this in mind, Michaels set about creating a show for his own generation. As it happened, NBC's then-president was thinking along the same lines. And while it's fun to knock network executives, one of the revelations in \"Lorne\" is the role that Herb Schlosser played.",
      "\"He was a visionary president of NBC who was looking to fill a hole on Saturday night, when the network had been running Johnny Carson reruns,\" said Morrison. \"And he dictated a memo that pretty much hit all the points of what SNL was to be. He wanted to do a show out of Studio 8H at 30 Rock, which had basically been dormant, you know, since the '50s. He wanted it to be live. He wanted it to be on at 11:30 Saturday night. He wanted it to have rotating hosts.\"",
      "Before Michaels even hired his cast, he hired the writers, among them, Alan Zweibel. \"If you look at those early days of SNL, the logo for the show was 'Saturday Night Live' spray-painted on the outside wall of what was then called the RCA Building,\" he said. \"It was like graffiti. And I thought it spoke volumes. Here these kids came along besmirching whatever the standard was, whatever the establishment was.\"",
      "Zweibel had been working in a deli when he got the gig: \"I gave him a book with my jokes in it. The first joke that I put, saying that the post office is about to issue a stamp commemorating prostitution in the United States. 'It's a 10-cent stamp. But if you want to lick it, it's a quarter.' And they laughed, and it was great. I was now a professional comedy writer.\"",
      "The writers were young, and the cast were unknowns. Morrison said, \"He really wanted the show to feel like it was speaking in the voice of everybody's funny, sarcastic friend, you know, grousing, wisecracking, just the way people are when they're trying to make their friends laugh.\"",
      "And over the past five decades, America has become friends with more than a hundred different cast members and the characters they've created, not to mention all those catchphrases that have seeped into our conversation, like \"Well, isn't that special,\" or \"I gotta have more cowbell.\"",
      "The writers and actors know that the best way to make the audience laugh is to make each other laugh.",
      "Rachel Dratch was on the show from 1999 to 2006. She and longtime writer Paula Pell created Debbie Downer \u2013 that friend we all have who always manages to bring the party down.",
      "Dratch recalled, \"I think it was Paula said, like, 'Let's set it somewhere really happy. So, let's put it at Disney World.' And then it started to flow. And then as we were writing we were making each other laugh a lot, but then we started going, like, wah-wah. Like, just to each other. I think it was Paula who said, like, 'What if we just put the trombone in the scene?'\"",
      "Pell said, \"And then we did it for that first time, and it was where everyone lost their minds laughing on \u2013 they were wiping their eyes with waffles. And I remember being in a dressing room watching it on the thing, and just tears coming down my d\u00e9colletage and laughing so ungodly hard. It was such a lightning-in-a-bottle moment at that show where you're, like, I will never forget this five minutes ever in my life!\"",
      "For material, the staff is encouraged to draw from their own lives. \"I was always, always wanting to be a cheerleader,\" said Pell. \"And every year, every summer, I worked on my back handsprings. I was a little chubby girl. I was very strong. I was nice and loud. I was really good at cheerleading. And every year, I didn't get it.\"",
      "So, Pell collaborated with Cheri Oteri and Will Ferrell on their Spartan cheerleaders sketch:",
      "\"So, the Spartan cheerleaders, that comes from a real place?\" I asked.",
      "\"Yeah, it comes from the place of, like, joyful loser existence,\" said Pell. \"You go, 'Oh, I didn't make it. Let's go cheer anyway. We're gonna get costumes. Let's go cheer for things nobody is gonna kick us out on,' and they still get to be dramatic cheerleaders.\"",
      "Over the run of the show, the tone of SNL has shifted away from gritty and dark, towards colorful and more, well, cheerful. Morrison writes that Lorne Michaels began directing his staff to \"do it in sunshine.\" She explained: \"Do it in sunshine means first of all, everyone should look pretty good, you know? You want the costumes to be flattering, the colors to be bright. You don't want anger. He very often counsels writers to avoid writing anger. People don't put on a television to see people yelling at each other. Fred Armisen told me that Lorne said once, 'There's enough misery in the world. People huddle around the television as if they're huddling around a fire.'\"",
      "Armisen played Libyan dictator Muammar Qaddafi. \"I try to keep it, you know, even with the dictators I've played, I've even approached them with \u2013 I can't believe I'm saying this \u2013 like, love and kindness. So, for Qaddafi I'm like, 'I'm gonna love this character. Whoever this guy is, I'm gonna love him and just imagine him as an eccentric at his very worst.'\"",
      "Armisen spent 12 seasons on \"Saturday Night Live.\" To hear him tell it, it wasn't nearly enough. \"I loved it. It was just the best existence,\" he said. \"If you're sitting out three sketches in a row and you're like, 'Oh, I'm not in these,' it is awesome to watch your castmates put something together and see that magic happen. It's fantastic.\"",

    "published": "Sun, 16 Feb 2025 09:26:15 -0500",
    "summary": "The author has spent more than 50 years finding ways to explain things, via his humorous and intricately illustrated books featuring wooly mammoth guides \u2013 his attempt to hook young readers on the wonders right before their eyes.",
    "story": [
      "Confession: I'm just mad about the mammoth, the one that wandered out of the Ice Age into one of author-illustrator David Macaulay's books \u2013 where he found his purpose in life (if that's a mammoth thing) helping Macaulay explain the way things work to kids.",
      "\"I was desperate to find a humorous way of explaining levers,\" said Macaulay, who realized levers have probably been around for a long time. \"So, I put the mammoth on the end of the log, and put the log on the rock to have a fulcrum, and the villagers on this end of the lever. The problem that had to be solved was, what does the mammoth weigh? So, it's as simple as that!\"",
      "Since it came out in 1988, \"The Way Things Work\" has sold more than a million copies around the world. Mammoth (and a whole herd of his friends) have made their way into other Macaulay books as well.",
      "Asked how many mammoths he thinks he's drawn, Macaulay replied, \"It's like 43,272, I believe. That's just a guess.\"",
      "With or without the help of mammoths, but always with a sense of humor, Macaulay has come to be known as \"America's Explainer-in-chief.\" He is a multi-award-winning star in the children's picture book world and a Macarthur \"genius grant\" recipient, having explained all kinds of things in more than two dozen books over the course of his 50+ year career: the human body \u2026 cathedrals \u2026 castles \u2026 toilets \u2026 the pyramids \u2026 ships \u2026 the city of Rome.",
      "\"I miss Rome,\" he said. \"I think about it often, and I think about particular streets and places in Rome.\"",
      "As an architecture student at the Rhode Island School of Design, Macaulay spent a year there. Born in England, he moved to the United States at the age of ten with his family.",
      "An ongoing exhibit at the National Building Museum in Washington, D.C., explores the messiness of creating a book. It is toplined, literally, as chaos: \"Chaos, that's where this process started, and in fact it's where all my books start,\" he said. \"This whole thing [depicts] the inside of my brain, and those clouds floating overhead were an attempt to sort of suggest some of that, you know, the things that go through your mind when you think, This is not going to work.\"",
      "\"Some of these look like procrastination,\" I said.",
      "\"Oh, procrastination is my gift,\" said Macaulay. \"I always find that in the end, if I'm using my imagination, if I'm asking the right questions, then the procrastination is working in my favor. I just have to keep drawing.\"",
      "And drawing \u2026 and drawing. The exhibits features just some of the drawings he produced while he was figuring out who would be the ideal tour guide of Rome with the perfect point of view. \"Why not a pigeon carrying a message from somebody who lives outside the city to someone who lives inside the city? And it took the scenic route, which was ideal.\"",
      "Early one fall morning, Macaulay brought us to the Ledyard Bridge. On one aside, Vermont; over there, New Hampshire, the Connecticut River in-between. He began sketching the bridge: \"The weight of all of this is supported on this arch, and transferred into these piers,\" he said.",
      "He wanted us to realize that, for him, sketching is seeing. Sketching is a language for understanding. \"We look at things, but do we actually see them?\" he said. \"What better way to spend time with a structure like this than with a sketchbook in your hand, looking at specific details? I think that's my goal in a way, is to have people open their eyes to the ordinary, to the everyday, to the things they take for granted.\"",
      "Like the sorts of things, both man-made and natural, that Macaulay sees when he walks his dogs, Maya and Minnow, in Norwich, Vt., where he lives.",
      "His storyboard details the objects that hold his fascination: \"Once she's stopped and I'm holding the leash, I think, 'I wonder how many pieces of wood are in that fence? Wonder how it's fastened together?'\"",
      "Walks with Stella, his beloved previous dog, are the basis for the book he's working on now. What's starting to take shape on his wall is David Macaulay's stealth attempt to hook kids on the wonder right before their eyes.\u00a0 \"I thought maybe I can create a book that will help them connect,\" he said. \"What better way to do that than to maybe use myself as an example?\"",
      "It's the first time his work has ever been this personal and introspective. At 78, this time, the point of view is his own.",
      "But why? And why now? \"My sort of conscience, perhaps a little bit, a little payback here after all these years of being able to do what I want, really, and be successful at it, be rewarded for it,\" he said. \"It's time to maybe pay that off.\"",

      "Wendy's Frosty's is a beloved treat \u2014 and a new addition to the lineup will combine the familiar frozen dairy dessert with a beloved Girl Scout cookie.",
      "Frosty's have been a staple of the Wendy's menu since the late 1960s when founder Dave Thomas decided to add a frozen treat to it. The drink has only grown in popularity. Last year, the chain served 500 per minute in the United States. The Frosty falls somewhere between soft serve and hard-packed ice cream, creating a frozen creamy treat that's stood the test of time.",
      "For decades, just one flavor \u2014 chocolate \u2014 was available. In 2006, vanilla joined the lineup. In 2022, the fast-food chain started trying new limited-edition flavors.",
      "On Feb. 21, the fast food chain will start selling Thin Mint-flavored Frostys. Fans are excited about the idea, which will combine the smooth Frosty with the mint-chocolate-chip flavors of a Thin Mint, but designing the treat was harder than people may think.",
      "The cookie didn't lend itself to a frozen treat, so the recipe had to be tweaked, according to John Li, Wendy's Vice President of Research and Development. Instead of frozen pieces or chunks of cookie, Li and his team wound up developing a fudge-like cookie butter that can be swirled into a Frosty.",
      "The cookie butter adds the flavor of a Thin Mint but makes it possible for customers to still get their Frosty quickly. The way it's swirled into the frozen treat ensures that customers get a taste of Thin Mint in every sip or bite. The swirl can be added to either chocolate or vanilla Frosty's. Li said they initially thought about only offering one flavor, but decided that the swirl worked well in both.",
      "\"You can't get more nostalgic than a Wendy Frosty and the Girls Scouts,\" said Li. \"The fact that they're coming together really pulls at the heartstrings of food lovers in this country.\"",

      "\"Morgiane\" is believed to be the oldest existing opera written by a Black American -- but despite its historic significance, the show was only performed for audiences for the first time in 2025.",
      "\"Morgiane\" was the magnum opus of New Orleans-born composer Edmond Dede. The opera, based on themes from \"Ali Baba and the 40 Thieves,\" tells the story of a mother, Morgaine, and her daughter, Amine, who fight a tyrannical ruling sultan. Behind the curtain is Dede's remarkable story.",
      "Dede was born a free Black man in New Orleans in 1827. He was educated and moved to France in 1855, leaving just before the Civil War. In France, he studied music at the Paris Conservatoire and performed at Bordeaux's Grand Theatre. He also traveled to Algeria, then a French colony, and was inspired by the struggle of the people there.",
      "Dede returned to the U.S. once, during the height of the Jim Crow era. He was not permitted to perform in theaters, and went back to Europe, vowing that he would never return to his home country.",
      "Dede went on to write 250 songs, ballets and orchestral pieces. The 545-page \"Morgaine\" was his magnum opus, but it was never performed during his lifetime.",
      "In 2014, New Orleans Opera Creole founders Givonna Joseph and Aria Mason found a digital copy of \"Morgaine.\" Opera Creole shares music by composers of African descent, and when they found the piece, they knew they needed to bring it to an audience.",
      "\"I had, you know how you get, a gut feeling that this was important,\" Joseph said. \"I didn't know exactly how.\"",
      "Patrick Quigley, the artistic director designate of Washington, D.C.'s Opera Lafayette, was eager to join the mission. He and Joseph connected in 2023, and they began working with musicians and historians from across the country to bring the never-performed opera to life. First, they transcribed almost 6,000 measures of music into modern notation. When the process was done, they heard music that hadn't been played in over a century.",
      "\"It's this fabulous combination of so many different styles of music, both European and American all together in one place,\" Quigley said.",
      "Excerpts from \"Morgaine\" were played at New Orleans' St. Louis Cathedral on January 24. The church was likely the site of Dede's baptism. The entire opera was performed at Opera Lafayette for the first time on Feb. 3.",

      "They married in 2011, but it wasn't until three years later that they started singing together.",

    "summary": "The NGO Doctors for America argued that HHS, CDC and FDA violated federal law in removing medical information from public-facing websites.",
    "story": [
      "Washington \u2014 A federal judge on Tuesday ordered the Department of Health and Human Services, Centers for Disease Control and Prevention and Food and Drug Administration to restore webpages and data that had been scrubbed in compliance with President Trump's executive order on gender ideology\u00a0while litigation moves forward.",
      "U.S. District Judge John Bates agreed to grant a temporary restraining order sought by the group Doctors for America, which argued that its members used the websites when treating patients and conducting research. The nonprofit organization said that the removal of the webpages by the Department of Health and Human Services and its components violated federal law.",
      "Bates found that the challengers were likely to succeed in their claims that the Department Health and Human Services, CDC and FDA acted unlawfully when they stripped medical information from public-facing websites.",
      "\"It bears emphasizing who ultimately bears the harm of defendants' actions: everyday Americans, and most acutely, underprivileged Americans, seeking healthcare,\" he wrote. Citing declarations from two doctors filed in the case, Bates said if they \"cannot provide these individuals the care they need (and deserve) within the scheduled and often limited time frame, there is a chance that some individuals will not receive treatment, including for severe, life-threatening conditions. The public thus has a strong interest in avoiding these serious injuries to the public health.\"",
      "His order directs the agencies to restore earlier versions of their websites by 11:59 p.m. Tuesday. It comes after Bates held a hearing on the matter Monday.",
      "Signed on his first day in office, Mr. Trump's executive order on gender ideology stated that the U.S. recognizes two sexes, male and female, and it directed agencies to remove \"all statements, policies, regulations, forms, communications, or other internal and external messages that promote or otherwise inculcate gender ideology.\"",
      "Days after the president issued his order, the Office of Personnel Management issued a memorandum ordering all agencies by 5 p.m. on Jan. 31 to take down all websites, social media accounts and other public-facing media \"that inculcate or promote gender ideology.\" In response to the memo, the CDC and FDA took offline numerous webpages and data sets, including recommendations on how physicians should treat sexually transmitted infections and adult immunization guidance.",
      "While the wording on some websites was adjusted to adhere to Mr. Trump's directive, allowing them to stay online, other information, like data from the CDC's Youth Risk Behavior Surveillance System, was removed completely.",
      "The agency said in a banner on its main website that it was \"being modified to comply with President Trump's executive orders.\"",
      "Doctors for America filed its lawsuit against the health agencies on Feb. 4, alleging they violated a federal law that governs the agency rulemaking process and another that requires federal agencies to ensure the public has \"timely and equitable access\" to their public information.",
      "The group argued in court papers that its members relied on the scrubbed information to provide treatment, conduct research and inform public health responses on topics like youth risk behaviors, adolescent health and HIV.",
      "Doctors for America said some of its members were already experiencing challenges as a result of losing access to information from the CDC. In one instance, it said a Chicago-based physician who works at a clinic serving low-income immigrant families could not consult the CDC's website for resources on how to address a chlamydia outbreak at a local high school and bolster STI testing and prevention efforts.",
      "Another doctor, who is also a researcher at the Yale School of Medicine, said in a declaration that she lost the ability to consult CDC resources about prescribing treatments.",
      "\"These doctors' time and effort are valuable, scarce resources, and being forced to spend them elsewhere makes their jobs harder and their treatment less effective,\" Bates wrote.",
      "He said that the Department of Health and Human Services, CDC and FDA face a minimal burden if required to store access to health resources, which have been available to the public for years.",
      "\"There is nothing in either the OPM memorandum or the record, and indeed defendants proffered no information at the hearing, to suggest the restoration of the removed webpages would pose a burden on the agencies' ability to engage in their work,\" Bates wrote. \"Similarly, there is no information to suggest that restoring public access would even interfere with the agencies' ongoing efforts to conform those resources with the president's executive orders.\"",
      "The order from Bates comes as Mr. Trump has faced numerous setbacks in the courts stemming from lawsuits targeting his administration's actions. On Monday alone, five different judges took action that favored challenges to Mr. Trump's directives on birthright citizenship, a freeze on federal funding, cuts to how medical research grants are funded and his deferred resignation program.",

    "summary": "Pertussis cases are on the rise again, after a dip following the winter holidays.",
    "story": [
      "The U.S. confirmed at least a dozen deaths from whooping cough last year, according to preliminary figures released this week by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. That marks the most fatalities from the bacterial infection since a 2017 surge of the illness, which is also known as pertussis.",
      "Over the last month, pertussis infections have been rising again. While cases reported to the CDC by health departments dipped over the winter holidays, weekly infections have accelerated for a month straight since then.",
      "At least 360 pertussis cases were reported nationwide in last week's update to the CDC's tally of infections. Cases are up 27% from the week before.",
      "Weekly cases peaked at 577 late last year, before plummeting to less than 200 over the New Year's holiday.",
      "Florida reported 44 cases last week, the most of any state. That displaces Ohio, which had been the state with the most pertussis infections for many recent weeks.",
      "Cases have been reported in counties throughout Florida, according to data from the state's health department, with the largest tallies around Miami and Tampa.",
      "Similar to other states, most cases reported in Florida have been in children under 5 years old. More than a third of whooping cough cases have been in older kids.",
      "\"People of all ages are at risk for getting pertussis (whooping cough). Everyone who is not up to date with whooping cough vaccination should get vaccinated,\" CDC spokesperson Paul Prince said in a statement.",
      "Whooping cough can initially be difficult to separate from other cold-causing germs that surge over the colder months. Pertussis infections are called whooping cough because of the sound of severe coughing attacks, which can linger for weeks.",
      "Some people are at higher risk of life-threatening complications from whooping cough infections, including babies and people who are not up to date on their vaccines.",
      "Prince, the CDC spokesperson, said data on pertussis deaths for January 2025 was not available. Whooping cough deaths can take several weeks to be confirmed.",
      "A local health department earlier this month in Washington announced the first whooping cough death in the state since 2011. A 5-year-old had died in November 2024, but was only confirmed as a pertussis death by the CDC in recent weeks.",
      "The child had not completed the pertussis vaccine series, the Spokane Regional Health District said in a release, and also had \"other health factors that contributed\" to their death.",
      "\"This death serves as a stark reminder of the importance of vaccination, especially for those who are most vulnerable, including infants and young children,\" Dr. Francisco Velazquez, the county's health officer, said in a statement.",
      "Officials have warned for months that the U.S. was likely on track to see a major wave in whooping cough cases. While infections usually climb every three to five years, pertussis was among many germs that were disrupted during the COVID-19 pandemic.",
      "Other changes have also driven up pertussis cases in recent years, including a change in 2020 intended to cut down on missed cases by epidemiologists and waning immunity from pertussis vaccines.",
      "\"We have been seeing some increase in pertussis cases that are coming through our emergency departments. Not necessarily requiring admission, but coming in for evaluation and treatment,\" said Dr. Marcos Mestre, chief clinical operations officer at Nicklaus Children's Health System in Miami.",
      "He said it had been many years since they had seen a major outbreak of pertussis infections, as opposed to \"little pockets of increases\" around their system.",
      "Mestre said older pertussis patients often come into the emergency room after facing a persistent cough that does not go away after a week or so. Younger babies come in to get evaluated sooner and are at higher risk.",
      "\"They're coughing to the point that they can't catch their breath. And those are the children we really worry about, when infants are getting infected and that could cause more severe illness,\" said Mestre.",
      "Caregivers are urged to get up to date on their vaccines because that can reduce the risk of passing on an infection to young children, Mestre said. Pregnant moms who get vaccinated also pass on immunity to their children, protecting them as soon as they are born.",
      "\"It's important that people understand that immunity wanes, even if you are vaccinated as a child. And if you are going to be around infants, we recommend vaccination every 10 years,\" he said.",

      "\"We've removed these images for violating our policies and will continue monitoring for other violating posts.

      "How to spot deepfake images online",
      "An analysis of over a dozen of these images by Reality Defender, a platform that works to detect AI-generated media, showed that many of the photos were deepfake images \u2014 with AI-generated, underwear-clad bodies replacing the bodies of celebrities in otherwise real photographs. A few of the images were likely created using image stitching tools that do not involve AI, according to Reality Defender's analysis.",
      "\"Almost all deepfake pornography does not have the consent of the subject being deepfaked,\" Ben Colman, co-founder and CEO of Reality Defender told CBS News on Sunday. \"Such content is growing at a dizzying rate, especially as existing measures to stop such content are seldom implemented.\"",

      "Under Meta's Bullying and Harassment policy, the company prohibits \"derogatory sexualized photoshop or drawings\" on its platforms. The company also bans adult nudity, sexual activity and adult sexual exploitation, and its regulations are intended to block users from sharing or threatening to share non-consensual intimate imagery. Meta has also rolled out the use of \"AI info\" labels to clearly mark content that is AI manipulated.",
      "But questions remain over the effectiveness of the tech company's policing of such content.

      "Meta's Oversight Board, a quasi-independent body that consists of experts in the field of human rights and freedom of speech, and makes recommendations for content moderation on Meta's platforms, told CBS News in an emailed statement that the company's current regulations around sexualized deepfake content are insufficient.",
      "The Oversight Board cited recommendations it has made to Meta over the past year,\u00a0 including urging the company to make its rules clearer by updating its prohibition against \"derogatory sexualized photoshop\" to specifically include the word \"non-consensual\" and to encompass other photo manipulation techniques such as AI.",
      "The board has also recommended that Meta fold its ban on \"derogatory sexualized photoshop\" into the company's Adult Sexual Exploitation regulations, so moderation of such content would be more rigorously enforced.",
      "Asked Monday by CBS News about the board's recommendations, Meta pointed to the guidelines on its transparency website, which show the company is assessing the feasibility of three of four recommendations from the oversight board and is implementing one of its suggestions, though Meta noted in its statement on its site that it is currently ruling out changing the language of its \"derogatory sexualized photoshop\" policy to include the phrase \"non consensual.\" Meta also says it is currently unlikely   to move its \"derogatory sexualized photoshop\" policy to within its Adult Sexual Exploitation regulations.",
      "Meta noted in its statement that it was still considering ways to signal a lack of consent in AI-generated images. Meta also said it was considering reforms to its Adult Sexual Exploitation policies, to \"capture the spirit\" of the board's recommendations.",

    "summary": "Some Democratic lawmakers are raising concerns about the security of taxpayer data as Musk's cost-cutting task force moves to the IRS.",
    "story": [
      "The presence of Elon Musk's cost-cutting task force, the Department of Government Efficiency, at the IRS is sparking fresh concerns from Democratic lawmakers about the safety of taxpayer information, and whether the group's work could cause delays in taxpayers receiving their refunds.",
      "In a Feb. 17 letter to the IRS, Senators Ron Wyden and Elizabeth Warren, both Democrats, cited reports that DOGE is \"pressuring the IRS to agree to a memorandum of understanding (\"the MOU\") which would give software engineers working for Elon Musk at DOGE broad access to IRS systems, property and datasets which include the private tax return information of hundreds of millions of American citizens and businesses.\"",
      "DOGE is reportedly requesting access to the IRS' Integrated Data Retrieval System, or IDRS, which would provide the group with access to tax data for individuals and businesses, according to the Washington Post. DOGE is currently at the IRS, a White House official confirmed to CBS News. The IRS didn't immediately return a request for comment.",
      "Supporters of DOGE view its efforts as a way to cut what they see as bloated federal spending at a time when the nation's outlays are outstripping its tax revenue, pushing the federal debt to an all-time high of\u00a0$36 trillion. But the group's efforts have also sparked several lawsuits, with consumer advocates and Democratic lawmakers raising alarms earlier this month after DOGE gained access to the Treasury Department's\u00a0payment system, which stores personal data for most Americans.",
      "IRS data is particularly sensitive, given that it reflects financial details for millions of Americans and businesses, ranging from their income, employers, losses, investments, dependents and other items. Under the IRS taxpayers' bill of rights, \"information [taxpayers] provide to the IRS will not be disclosed unless authorized by the taxpayer or by law.\"",
      "\"Software engineers working for Musk seeking to gain access to tax return information have no right to hoover up taxpayer data and send that data back to any other part of the federal government and may be breaking the law if they are doing so,\" Wyden and Warren wrote in the Feb. 17 letter.",
      "The senators pointed to privacy regulations in the tax code that they said provide \"strong legal protections\" for taxpayer data, noting that violation of those laws can result in incarceration or other criminal penalties. They added that even if the DOGE employees are employed at the Treasury Department, which oversees the IRS, they may still be violating the law by accessing taxpayer data.",
      "\"There are serious statutory and regulatory restrictions on when employees outside the Treasury Department may gain access to tax return information,\" the letter said.",
      "It added, \"To date, no information on DOGE employees or any others executing orders on Musk's behalf have revealed any clear, stated purpose as to why they need access to return information, whether they have followed all required laws to gain access to IRS systems, and what steps the IRS has taken to ensure that inspection of tax return is contained to authorized personnel and not disclosed to any unauthorized parties.\"",
      "Delays to IRS tax refunds?",
      "Wyden and Warren also raised concerns about DOGE's impact on tax refunds this year.",
      "DOGE's work at the IRS comes as the tax agency is in the middle of the current tax season, when about 140 million individual tax returns are expected to be filed before the April 15 deadline. For many households, their tax refund check \u2014 which last year averaged more than $3,100 \u2014 is often their biggest cash influx of the year.",
      "\"We are also extremely concerned that DOGE personnel meddling with IRS systems in the middle of tax filing season could, inadvertently or otherwise, cause breakdowns that may delay the issuance of tax refunds indefinitely,\" the Feb. 17 letter said. \"Any delay in refunds could be financially devastating to millions of Americans who plan their budgets around timely refunds every spring.\"",
      "In the meantime, the IRS is preparing to fire thousands of probationary workers in the middle of tax season, the Associated Press reported, citing two sources familiar with the agency's plans. It's unclear how many IRS workers could be impacted, however, the AP noted. Federal workers in a probationary period typically have less than one year on the job and have not yet gained civil service protection.",
      "The cuts would come even as IRS employees were told they would not be able to participate in the Trump administration's earlier \"deferred resignation\" offer until after the tax filing deadline had passed.",
      "A letter sent earlier this month to IRS workers said that \"critical filing season positions in Taxpayer Services, Information Technology and the Taxpayer Advocate Service are exempt\" from the administration's buyout plan until May 15.",

      "Probational federal employees who lost their jobs on Thursday as part of the Trump administration's mass\u00a0firing of government workers\u00a0expressed shock and anger at the terminations, which they contend will hurt the government's ability to provide services.",
      "President Trump is moving quickly to shrink the U.S. federal government \u2014 the nation's largest employer \u2014 saying he is slashing wasteful spending and pushing to make the nation's civil workforce more responsive to his administration's policies. Federal workers in a probationary period typically have less than one year on the job and have not yet gained civil service protection.",
      "Federal workers who received termination notices on Thursday described receiving nonpersonalized emails informing them they had been removed from their position, with little communication from their supervisors. The workers said they had entered public service because of a commitment to serve the public interest, whether by helping protect consumers from predatory financial services or by supporting veterans.",
      "\"We had all received these notices that cites probationary regulations and says we're being let go because 'you are not fit for continued employment because your ability and skills do not fit the agency's needs,'\" Elizabeth Aniskevich, an attorney with the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau, told CBS News.",
      "A termination letter provided to CBS News by a former employee at the Department of Veterans Affairs informed the worker that his job was ending because \"you have not demonstrated that your further employment at the agency would be in the public interest.\"",
      "The VA worker, who had previously held federal jobs across different agencies for more than a decade, said he was dismayed to learn that he was considered a probationary worker after taking the Veterans Affairs job last fall, as it reset his government employment.",
      "\"Basically the gist [of the termination letter] is laying out I was a probationary employee, what my rights of appeal are, but my continued employment was no longer in the public interest,\" said the VA worker, who spoke on condition of anonymity out of concern that speaking publicly could jeopardize his chances of finding another government job. \"I came into the house \u2014 probably for a couple weeks my wife and I joked, 'Did I still have a job?' \u2014 I told her, and I lost it. It's devastating.\"",
      "Another VA employee, who told CBS News his work was rated as \"outstanding\" in his most recent performance review, said receiving an impersonal termination letter was hurtful.",
      "\"It feels like a copy/paste mass firing that takes nothing into account of the people, the human cost,\" said Greg House, 34, a disabled veteran who was terminated from his job at the VA's public affairs office in Salt Lake City, a job that he started in March 2024. He added, \"The idea that the federal workforce is too bloated feels like a scapegoat more than anything else. Nobody joins the federal government to get rich.\"",
      "The U.S. Office of Personnel Management (OPM) has instructed agencies to report their final numbers of fired probationary employees by 8 p.m Eastern time on Tuesday, according to a source familiar with the matter.",

      "Unions claim firings are illegal",
      "Five unions for government employees have sued Mr. Trump and other officials in his administration over the firing of probationary workers, alleging the move is illegal because it violates procedures for making \"reductions in force,\" a formal process used by government agencies to dismiss employees.",
      "Reductions in force, or RIFs, can be made based on a number of issues, such as if there's not enough work or funding for federal workers, according to OPM.",
      "Mr. Trump's order \"directs agencies to promptly engage in RIFs for none of the specified, allowable reasons, but instead for the purpose of 'eliminating waste, bloat and insularity,'\" the lawsuit claims, citing the president's Feb. 11 executive order for widespread layoffs of government workers.",
      "Some experts are pushing back on the idea that the government workforce is too large, pointing out that federal employment has grown little since 1980. Prior to the firings, some agencies and services had already been grappling with staffing shortages, including the Veterans Health Administration.",
      "Impact on services",
      "The VA employee who was fired Thursday said he took exception to Mr. Trump's claim that the terminations would make the government more efficient, noting that his group, which had been trying to fill several empty positions, had more work than they could handle.",
      "\"We are under-resourced as it is, so cutting jobs won't do it,\" he said, adding that the firings will directly impact veterans. \"We have ongoing projects to try to construct and repair facilities to help veterans \u2014 we're already behind.\"",
      "A Food and Drug Administration employee \u2014 who also requested anonymity because she's in a probationary period in her job but hasn't received a termination letter \u2014 expressed concern that the firings would slow essential work, both because of the loss of skilled employees and a hit to employee morale.",
      "\"We're rather leanly staffed \u2014 the people on some of these teams have a tremendous workload,\" she said. \"It'll slow down things like drugs approvals ... it'll have a tremendous, terrible impact on access to drugs and generic drugs.\"",
      "Because many of the probationary workers are younger employees, the firings could add to long-term problems facing the federal workforce, where twice as many workers are over age 60 than under 30, said Elizabeth Linos, the Emma Bloomberg associate professor of public policy and management at Harvard's Kennedy School.",
      "\"This will exacerbate the existing human capital crisis if probationary employees are more likely to be young, and more likely to have the skills that a 21st century government operation needs,\" she said.",
      "Where jobs are getting cut",
      "As of May 2024, the most recent data available, about 216,000 federal employees had been in their jobs for less than one year, according to government data from the U.S. Office of Personnel Management.",
      "The government agency with the most probationary employees is the VA, with about 56,000 workers bearing that designation, OPM data shows. The VA on Friday said it had fired more than 1,000 employees. The agency didn't respond to a request for comment about whether more firings could be coming.",
      "\"Make no mistake \u2014 Trump is looking to fire probationary employees because it is easy, not because it is good for veterans or cost-effective,\" Sen. Richard Blumenthal, a Democrat from Connecticut who serves on the Senate Committee on Veterans' Affairs, told CBS News in a statement. \"In fact, it is a massive waste of taxpayer dollars to fire employees the department just invested months into recruiting, vetting and training.\"",

      "Elon Musk, to whom the president has given wide leeway to slash government spending with his Department of Government Efficiency, called Thursday for the elimination of whole agencies.",
      "\"I think we do need to delete entire agencies as opposed to leave a lot of them behind,\" Musk said via a videocall to the World Governments Summit in Dubai, United Arab Emirates. \"If we don't remove the roots of the weed, then it's easy for the weed to grow back.\"",
      "Everett Kelley, the president of the American Federation of Government Employees representing federal workers, said the administration \"abused\" the probation status of workers \"to conduct a politically driven mass firing spree, targeting employees not because of performance, but because they were hired before Trump took office.\"",
      "Thursday's order was an expansion of previous directions from OPM, which told agencies earlier this week that probationary employees should be fired if they weren't meeting high standards. It's not clear how many workers are currently in a probationary period. According to government data maintained by OPM, as of March 2024, 220,000 workers had less than a year on the job \u2014 the most recent data available.",
      "The firing of probationary employees began earlier this week and has included the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau and the Department of Education workers.",
      "At least 39 were fired from the Education Department on Wednesday, according to a union that represents agency workers, including civil rights workers, special education specialists and student aid officials.",
      "The layoffs also hit Department of Veterans Affairs researchers working on cancer treatment, opioid addiction, prosthetics and burn pit exposure, Sen. Patty Murray, a Washington state Democrat, said Thursday.",
      "Murray said in a statement that she heard from VA researchers in her state who were told to stop their research immediately, \"not because their work isn't desperately needed, but because Trump and Elon have decided to fire these researchers on a whim.\"",
      "The VA announced Thursday that it had laid off more than 1,000 non-\"mission critical\" probationary workers and the move would \"save the department more than $98 million per year, and VA will redirect all of those resources back toward health care, benefits and services for VA beneficiaries.\"",
      "Half of the Centers of Disease Control and Prevention's Epidemic Intelligence Service officers \u2014 a group known as\u00a0the CDC's \"disease detectives\" \u2014 were among the cuts made Friday, multiple health officials tell CBS News.",
      "The Trump administration also moved Friday to fire more than 400 employees at the Department of Homeland Security.",
      "Public Employees for Environmental Responsibility, a group that defends government workers, said the Agriculture Department's Food Safety and Inspection Service would be hit especially hard by laying off probationary employees because it has trouble recruiting inspectors required to be present at all times at most slaughterhouses.",
      "The civilian federal workforce, not including military personnel and postal workers, is made up of about 2.4 million people. While about 20% of the workers are in Washington D.C. and the neighboring states of Maryland and Virginia, more than 80% live outside the Capitol region.",
      "Layoffs are unlikely to yield significant deficit savings. When the Congressional Budget Office looked at the issue, it found the government spent $271 billion annually compensating civilian federal workers, with about 60% of that total going to workers employed by the departments of Defense, Homeland Security and Veterans Affairs.",
      "The government could, in theory, cut all those workers and still run a deficit of over $1 trillion that would continue to grow as tax revenues are needed to keep up with the growing costs of Social Security and Medicare.",
      "Elaine Kamarck, a senior fellow at the Brookings Institution, said firing employees on probation is flawed because it targets younger workers.",
      "\"Baby Boomers are retiring right and left, so actually the people you want to keep are probably most of the people who are right now on probation,\" said Kamarck, who worked in former President Bill Clinton's Democratic administration when about 426,000 federal jobs were cut over more than eight years in a deliberative effort aimed at reinventing government. \"They're younger and presumably have better skills, and that's who you want.\"",
      "Mr, Trump's initial attempt to downsize the workforce was the deferred resignation program, commonly described as a \"buyout,: which offered to pay people until Sept. 30 if they agreed to quit. The White House said 75,000 people signed up, and a federal judge cleared a legal roadblock for the program Wednesday.",
      "However, the number of workers who took the offer was less than the administration's target, and Mr. Trump has made it clear he would take further steps.",
      "Employees at the National Science Foundation and Housing and Urban Development Department were told this week that large reductions, in some cases a halving of the workforce, would be coming, according to a person familiar with the situation who spoke on condition of anonymity because they were not authorized to discuss it.",
      "The order the president signed Tuesday stipulated that government functions not required by law would be prioritized for cuts and hiring will be restricted. With exceptions for functions such as public safety, only one employee can be added for every four who leave. In addition, new hires would generally need approval from a representative of the DOGE, expanding the influence of Musk's team.",
      "Mr. Trump has praised Musk's work to slash federal spending.",
      "The Republican president has also been sharply critical of federal workers, especially those who want to keep working remotely, though his administration is simultaneously working to cut federal office space and ordering the termination of worksite leases throughout the government.",
      "\"Nobody is gonna work from home,\" Mr. Trump said Monday. \"They are gonna be going out, they're gonna play tennis, they're gonna play golf, they're gonna do a lot of things. They're not working.\"",

      "The daughters of one of the cofounders of Target are expressing their alarm and shock at the discounter's recent moves to roll back its diversity, equity and inclusion initiatives that have come under attack from conservative activists and as of last month, the White House.",
      "In letters to the editor published Thursday in The Financial Times and the Los Angeles Times, Anne and Lucy Dayton said their father, Bruce Dayton, along with his four other brothers, expanded the Minneapolis department store into a massive brand that became Target that was built on two principles: a focus on the customer and the well-being of the community.",
      "Bruce Dayton died in 2015 at 97.",
      "\"We are alarmed how quickly the business community has given in to the current administration's retaliatory threats,\" the daughters wrote. \"It is not 'illegal' for a company to create a business model based on what it believes to be important ethical and business standards.\"",

      "Target, which operates nearly 2,000 stores nationwide and employs more than 400,000 people, said it already had planned to end the racial program this year. The company also said that it would conclude the diversity, equity and inclusion, or DEI, goals it previously set in three-year cycles.",

    "summary": "The federal government is the nation's largest employer, yet the size of its workforce hasn't kept up with U.S. population growth, experts say.",
    "story": [
      "President Trump is moving swiftly to shrink the U.S. federal government \u2014 the nation's largest employer \u2014 a move that he has said will slash wasteful spending and make the nation's civil workforce more responsive to his administration's dictates.",
      "Mr. Trump has described the federal government as \"bloated\" and filled with \"people that are unnecessary.\" While the federal government has inefficiencies, as do all large and complex organizations, some experts are pointing out that the government workforce has grown little since 1980, and that some agencies and services had already been grappling with staffing shortages, including the Veterans Health Administration and the FAA's air traffic control centers.",
      "\"There's no indication that the government is particularly bloated in terms of numbers of federal workers \u2014 that number hasn't really changed over the past decades,\" Elizabeth Linos, the Emma Bloomberg associate professor of public policy and management at Harvard's Kennedy School, told CBS MoneyWatch. \"The problem we were facing over the past decades isn't one of bloat, but of vacancies.\"",
      "On Thursday, the Trump administration ordered agencies to lay off nearly all probationary employees\u00a0\u2014 who generally have less than a year on the job and who aren't yet covered by civil service protections \u2014 potentially affecting hundreds of thousands of workers.",
      "As Mr. Trump and Elon Musk's Department of Government Efficiency push to slash spending, here's what to know about the nation's federal workforce and the potential impact on Americans of scaling back government.",
      "What are Trump and Musk doing to shrink the federal workforce?",
      "Working with billionaire Elon Musk, Mr. Trump has offered a \"deferred resignation\" plan to more than 2 million federal employees, that would grant pay through the end of September while not working, in exchange for agreeing to step down. A federal judge on Tuesday cleared the program to proceed after it had been paused.",
      "About 75,000 workers have accepted the offer, and the Trump administration said that the deferred resignation program was closed as of 7 p.m. Feb. 12. The offer excludes members of the armed forces, U.S. Postal Service workers, and those who work in jobs related to immigration enforcement and national security.",
      "In another move aimed at remaking the federal workforce, Mr. Trump this week also signed an executive order to reduce the number of government employees and limit hiring.",
      "The administration's order on Thursday to cut probationary workers is expected to be the first step in sweeping layoffs. According to federal data, there are about 220,000 federal workers with less than a year on the job, representing about 9% of the government workforce.",
      "\"I think we do need to delete entire agencies as opposed to leave a lot of them behind,\" Musk said via a videocall to the World Governments Summit in Dubai, United Arab Emirates. \"If we don't remove the roots of the weed, then it's easy for the weed to grow back.\"",
      "Is the federal workforce growing?",
      "As Mr. Trump and Musk charge ahead, some policy experts note that the federal workforce has decreased relative to the U.S. population when compared with earlier decades. The upshot: There are fewer government workers providing services to more U.S. residents than in prior years, according to new research from the Center for Economic and Policy Research.",
      "The federal workforce has waxed and waned over the years, but its size today puts it on the same footing as during the 1980s, when the U.S. population was about 220 million. Today, there are more than 330 million U.S. residents.",
      "How big is the federal workforce?",
      "The U.S. has more than 2.4 million federal workers, excluding those who work for the U.S. Postal Service, according to data from the Bureau of Labor Statistics. (As a self-funded agency, the USPS relies on sales of stamps and other products and services to support its operations.)",
      "\"In absolute terms, the federal workforce is slightly smaller than it was 50 years ago, even though the U.S. population has increased by two-thirds during that time period,\" noted Elaine Kamarck, a senior fellow at the Brookings Institution who managed the Clinton Administration's National Performance Review, an effort to cut government spending in the 1990s, in a Jan. 28 report.",
      "In the 1940s, the federal workforce represented 4.5% of non-farm workers, a share that's dwindled to 1.5% today, according to CEPR's analysis.",
      "How efficient is the federal workforce?",
      "There's no overarching measure of the efficiency of the federal workforce, Linos of Harvard's Kennedy School noted. But agencies typically review their own operations to identify gaps that affect their ability to provide services.",
      "The federal workforce's efficiency should be measured on whether agencies are delivering the services they've been tasked to handle, she added. In recent years, many agencies have added data-driven measurements to determine whether they are providing those services to Americans.",
      "For instance, the Social Security Administration's most recent annual performance report identified long wait times for callers as a trouble spot, and added that it would like to shave the hold times to 12 minutes on average from its 34 minute on-hold time for fiscal year 2024. But that \"aspirational goal\" was being evaluated amid a hiring freeze, the report added.",
      "The Social Security Administration, which last year served a record 68 million beneficiaries, is working with its smallest staff in 50 years, former Social Security Commissioner Martin O'Malley said in November congressional testimony.",
      "To be sure, the U.S. government suffers from various types of inefficiencies, with a 2024 U.S. Government Accountability Office\u00a0report\u00a0estimating that as much as $521 billion annually is lost to fraud, or about 8% of federal spending.",
      "Federal spending also has ballooned in recent years, although much of the increase is due to higher spending on Social Security and paying interest on federal debt,\u00a0according\u00a0to the Committee for a Responsible Federal Budget.",
      "What agencies have the most federal workers?",
      "The U.S. Department of Veterans Affairs has the most federal workers, with more than 487,000 employees, according to data from the U.S. Office of Personnel Management, or OPM. That's followed by the Department of Homeland Security, with more than 222,000 workers; and the U.S. Army, with 221,000 employees.",
      "Some of the agencies that have been targeted by Mr. Trump are relatively small by comparison. For instance, the president is considering an executive order to dismantle the U.S. Department of Education, which has about 4,200 employees.",
      "Where are federal workers based geographically?",
      "Only about 7% of federal workers are located in Washington, D.C., proper, according to a 2024 Congressional Research Service report. But when adding the federal workers located in Virginia and Maryland, the larger Washington, D.C., metro area represents about 20% of the entire government workforce.",
      "Roughly 80% of federal workers are located outside the Washington, D.C., metropolitan area, and civil service employees are employed in every U.S. state, the CRS report noted.",
      "While Washington, D.C., proper has the largest number of federal workers, at about 162,000, other states aren't far behind: California employs about 147,000 federal workers, while Texas has about 130,000.",
      "Additional states with sizable federal workforces include Florida, at about 94,000, and Georgia, with almost 80,000 federal workers, the analysis found.",
      "What does the typical federal worker earn?",
      "The average annual salary of federal workers tops $106,000, Pew Research Center found, citing OPM data.",
      "Federal salaries skew into the six figures because many civil service workers hold college or professional degrees, and are highly trained. The largest share of federal workers are employed in the medical field \u2014 physicians and nurses who work for the VA, for instance.",
      "Others are professionals such as accountants and attorneys who might be able to earn more if they worked for private employers. For instance, the Commodity Future Trading Commission, which regulates futures contracts and other derivatives, pays its employees an average of $235,910. About 40% of its workforce is comprised of attorneys, Pew found.",
      "How could a much smaller federal workforce affect Americans?",
      "Services could degrade if enough federal workers are cut or resign, Harvard's Linos said. But Americans would still expect a certain level of service, such as getting their benefits paid on time or getting a passport on a timely basis.",
      "To address that issue, the federal government could turn to private-sector contractors to pick up the slack, she added. \"That's more costly \u2014 you end up paying a higher wage to private sector workers with less accountability,\" she noted.",
      "A hit to public services could heighten negative public sentiment about the federal government, Linos added. Public trust in the federal government has declined for decades, falling from about 77% of people in the 1960s who trust the government to do what is right to about 22% today, according to the Pew Research Center.",
      "\"We tell people the government is bloated, the day-to-day experience gets worse, and that feeds the narrative that the government is useless,\" she said.",

      "Tariffs, which act as a tax on foreign goods, could lead to higher prices, which are rarely if every welcomed by Americans, and having more import duties on the horizon comes against a backdrop of inflation flaring up once again. Consumer prices in January\u00a0accelerated\u00a0to 3% on an annual basis, signaling the Federal Federal's push to drive inflation down to a 2% annual rate has petered out, at least for now.",

A senior White House official who spoke to the wire service on condition of anonymity said the reviews required to move forward with the tariffs could be finished within a number of weeks, although the process could take longer.",
      "The plan \"will seek to correct long-standing imbalances in international trade and ensure fairness across the board,\" the White House said in a statement about the tariffs. \"Gone are the days of America being taken advantage of: this plan will put the American worker first, improve our competitiveness in every area of industry, reduce our trade deficit, and bolster our economic and national security,\" it proclaimed.",
      "The announcement came before a meeting between Mr. Trump and Narendra Modi, prime minister of India, a country that could be targeted by U.S. tariffs. Modi has recently sought to assuage the Trump administration's concerns regarding trade issues, moving to cut import India's tariffs on some motorbikes and bourbon whiskey, while also agreeing to receive planes carrying undocumented migrants.",

    "published": "Thu, 13 Feb 2025 18:04:28 -0500",
    "summary": "As many as three-quarters of U.S. homeowners could be underinsured, a significant risk as weather disasters intensify.",
    "story": [
      "Thousands of Californians who lost their homes in the Los Angeles fires last month are now grappling with insurance claims. And with research showing that extreme weather today\u00a0poses a threat to nearly half of all U.S. homes, it's important to know exactly how much coverage you have so that when disaster strikes, you're not left standing in the rubble.",
      "Indeed, as many as 3 in 4 U.S. homeowners could be underinsured, reports CBS News national consumer correspondent Ash-har Quraishi. That means more Americans should get to know their insurance policies, said Jennifer Gray Thompson, CEO of the nonprofit After the Fire USA.",
      "\"Well, the first thing you have to do is actually read your policy, and most of us don't do that, and so really encourage you to either sit down with somebody who is an expert in insurance \u2014 your underwriter [the insurance company] will be able to do this with you,\" Thompson told Quraishi.",
      "How much coverage do I need?",
      "Determining how much insurance you have, versus what you need to rebuild your a home in case of a disaster, is relatively straighforward. Start by taking the dollar amount of your policy coverage limit and dividing that by the square footage of your house or apartment.",
      "The resulting figure should equal the average construction cost per square foot in your area \u2014 a dollar amount Quraishi said you can find by doing an online search for \"construction cast per square foot,\" along with your zip code.",
      "For those who discover they have no protection of any kind of natural disaster, or after doing the math find that they're not sufficiently covered, the next step should be to get the maximum amount of coverage they can.",
      "\"Do go to your underwriter and ask,\" Thompson said. \"Max out on your insurance \u2014 it does cost us a little bit more every single month, but it's just incredibly important. Some people won't call because they're afraid of being dropped. Do not do that.\"",
      "Make a list of all your things",
      "Your home insurance policy should also cover possessions, also known as contents insurance. To be sure you're fully covered, make a list of all of your belongings, along with their estimated value. Update the list every year and let your agent know about any large purchases, from jewelry to cars.",
      "\"Most people don't even know they have contents insurance as part of their insurance policy,\" Thompson said. \"See how much it is.\"",
      "When to call Fema",
      "If you find yourself in the middle of a crisis while underinsured, you can contact the Federal Emergency Management Agency at 800-621-3362 from 7 a.m. to 10 p.m. Pacific time seven days a week. The U.S. Department of Homeland Security also may be able to provide assistance and negotiate with your insurance company.",
      "What if you think you're underinsured?",
      "If after reading your policy and calculating your coverage you determine you're underinsured, but your insurance provider insists that you're fine, Thompson suggests having them put that in writing.",
      "\"Ask them to actually put it in writing \u2014 an email or something back to you that is official saying that you are adequately insured,\" she said. \"You must have it in writing and in some way that you can easily access it.\"",

    "story": [
      "Egg prices continue to soar \u2014 if shoppers can even find them in grocery stores.",
      "In January alone, the cost of eggs around the U.S.\u00a0jumped more than 15%\u00a0from a year ago, to roughly $4.95 a dozen. That's\u00a0five times the overall U.S. inflation rate of 3%, Consumer Price Index data showed on Wednesday. In 2019, consumers could pick up a dozen eggs for around $1.54, but by last year the price had soared to $4.15 \u2014 a 170% increase, according to CBS News' price tracker\u00a0of everyday goods.",
      "The spike in egg prices last month underscores the devastating impact of avian flu, which killed more than 40 million egg-laying birds last year. Including ducks and chickens, 148 million birds have been ordered euthanized since the current strain of bird flu, H5N1, began spreading around the U.S. in 2022.",
      "If there's any good news, it's that egg prices are at least expected to rise more slowly over the course of the year. The January surge \"is likely a one-off,\" said EY Chief Economist Gregory Daco. But that may come as small consolation for the millions of consumers who continue to grapple with higher food costs both at home and in restaurants due to record-high egg prices.",
      "Why are egg prices so high?",
      "The price spike in eggs is largely driven by the bird flu, which continues to hit farms and wipe out flocks. When demand remains steady for a product that isn't easily substituted and supply diminishes, prices tend to rise.",
      "\"If you don't have a bird you don't have an egg,\" Sharon Linsenbardt, founder and owner of Barn Buddies Rescue and Sanctuary in Las Vegas, told CBS News reporter Andres Gutierrez. The millions of egg-laying hens killed by avian influenza can't be replaced easily and quickly, added Linsenhardt, who has limited sales to two dozen eggs a family.",
      "\"High egg prices are due to the avian flu issue, which cuts the supply in the available eggs for sale,\" Columbia Business School professor Yiming Ma told CBS MoneyWatch. \"If you have less supply, that drives up the prices.\"",
      "Egg supplies are likely to remain constrained as long as bird flu outbreaks continue, according to David Anderson, an agricultural economics professor at Texas A&M University.",
      "Anderson, noting a cultural shift that may be exacerbating the problem, also said he has noticed that Americans are leaning toward more protein-heavy diets, driving demand for eggs.",
      "\"We have this nutritional trend, and as people incorporate more protein in their diets, that increases overall egg demand and sets a higher base for demand,\" he said. \"Then when we get this supply shock, low and behold, we get higher prices.\"",
      "Retailers rationing eggs",
      "Ongoing egg shortages and rising prices recently prompted 24-hour breakfast chain Waffle House to add a 50 cent surcharge per egg, while some major grocery chains are imposing limits on how many eggs shoppers can buy at a time.",
      "Walmart is curtailing purchases of 60-count cartons to two per purchase \"to ensure more customers can have access to eggs,\" a spokesperson for the retailer said.",
      "\"Although supply is very tight, we're working with suppliers to try and help meet customer demand, while striving to keep prices as low as possible,\" the spokesperson added. At Sam's Club, a division of Walmart, the warehouse club is limiting the number of egg purchases to two per item at its nearly 600 stores across the U.S.",
      "As of Wednesday, most of Target's nearly 2,000 U.S. stores had eggs in stock, and the retailer only has purchase limits in place in its Hawaii stores, according to a spokesperson for the retailer. \"We'll continue to monitor and adjust as needed,\" they added.",
      "Kroger, which operates about 2,700 U.S. grocery stores, hasn't imposed a company-wide cap on egg purchases, though some stores are limiting customers to buying two dozen per visit.",
      "Giant Eagle said it was selling conventional shelled eggs \"at or below our cost across all our supermarkets\" to limit the impact of rising egg prices on its customers. The regional grocery, which operates more than 470 stores in Indiana, Maryland, Ohio, Pennsylvania and West Virginia, is encouraging shoppers to limit their purchase to a maximum of three egg cartons per visit.",
      "Amazon-owned Whole Foods and Costco did not respond to requests for comment.",
      "When will egg prices drop?",
      "Egg prices are expected to rise a total of 20% in 2025, according\u00a0to the U.S. Department of Agriculture. Despite the rising costs, consumer demand remains firm and could even increase as Easter approaches, offering little hope for respite on prices.",
      "Two things have to happen for prices to ease, according to experts. The U.S. must contain the bird flu, and older chickens that are past their productive primes, as well as diseased chickens, have to be replaced. Exactly how long all of this will take is uncertain.",
      "\"it's not clear that we've fully controlled the spread of bird flu. That's the first step, and it'll be a few months after that before you can breed and replace the laying population,\" Bryan Spillane, Bank of America senior food and beverage analyst, told CBS MoneyWatch.",
      "He expects it will be at least another three to six months before prices moderate. If restaurants continue to implement surcharges for eggs, that could eventually put a damper on demand.",
      "In the near-term, Anderson expects eggs to continue hitting consumers' wallets. \"I wouldn't be surprised to see prices continue to go up, because we continue to have outbreaks,\" he said.",
      "Cost-conscious consumers can comparison shop among grocery stores, noted NerdWallet spokesperson Sara Rathner, but be aware that if price differences aren't substantial, you could eat up any cost savings on gas.",

      "\"This is not a good number,\" Brian Coulton, chief economist at Fitch Ratings, said in an email of January's CPI data. \"This is almost starting to look like a re-run of the first half of 2024, when inflation surprised everyone (including the Fed) on the upside.\"",
      "He added, \"And it illustrates how the Fed has not completed the job of getting inflation back down just as new inflation risks - from tariff hikes and a squeeze on labor supply growth - start to emerge.\"",
      "The new data shows that inflation picked up speed at the start of the President Trump's second administration, which has signaled its intention to enact broad-based tariffs, including newly announced 25% tariffs on all steel and aluminum imports.",

    "story": [
      "Supporters of the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act (FCPA) praise it as an important anti-bribery statute that keeps corporations honest when doing business outside the U.S. By contrast, the law's detractors say it unfairly hobbles American companies, giving an advantage to foreign players.",
      "On Monday, President Trump took a side. \"It sounds good on paper but in practicality, it's a disaster,\" he said while signing an executive order \u00a0freezing enforcement of the 1977 law. \"It's going to mean a lot more business for America.\"",
      "Mr. Trump can't overturn the law, but as head of the executive branch he can change the way it is enforced and shift resources to other Justice Department priorities.",
      "His order puts in place a 180-day \"pause\" to all investigations under the FCPA while they are being reviewed. He also ordered no new ones be opened during that period. The order also says it will halt other Justice Department \"actions\" under the law, which might mean ongoing prosecutions though that is unclear.",
      "President Trump said the pause is also necessary to give his administration time to come up with new \"reasonable\" guidelines on how to enforce the law that don't put U.S. companies at a disadvantage in striking foreign deals.",
      "The consequences could be dramatic, depending on Mr. Trump's next move, experts say.",
      "If he halts many prosecutions, essentially defanging the law, it could help U.S. businesses win deals abroad. However, doing so could also tarnish America's image as a safe place to do business, and also send a green light to corrupt autocrats ruling over impoverished people to get even richer. France, Britain, Japan and other wealthy countries could also in turn weaken their own anti-bribery laws so their companies can make payments, too.",
      "\"We are facing a Wild West situation,\" said Mark Pieth, a criminal law professor at the University of Basel in Switzerland and anti-bribery law expert. \"It will be everyone against everyone.\"",
      "Specifically, Mr. Trump said the law is being enforced in \"excessive, unpredictable\" ways that U.S. companies are competing on an uneven \"playing field\" with foreign rivals. He also said the law was \"draining resources\" from law enforcement and harming U.S. national interests because companies were being held back from deals that would give the U.S. access to deep water ports, critical minerals and other assets.",
      "Duncan Levin, a criminal defense attorney, said he expects Mr. Trump to essentially kill the law by neglect.",
      "\"He can't get rid of the law, but he can refuse to enforce it,\" said Levin, who has represented high profile defendants Harvey Weinstein and Russian oligarch Oleg Deripaska. \"I don't think this is just a pause.\"",
      "What is the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act?",
      "The FCPA is a federal law that makes it illegal for U.S. companies and individuals to make payments to foreign government officials \"to secure any improper advantage\" in order to win or retain business. It was enacted in the 1970s to address concerns of global corruption after investigators at the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission found hundreds of American companies making questionable or illegal payments to foreign officials to win business. The law doesn't require that the bribe is actually paid, but only offered.",
      "Over the past nearly 50 years, prosecutions under the law have brought to light a long and varied list of bribes.",
      "Last year, the military contractor RTX, formerly Raytheon, paid more than $300 million to settle charges it had allegedly bribed officials in Qatar by using a sham contract and other devices to hide its tracks.",
      "In 2019, Walmart paid $282 million to settle charges from a seven-year investigation into allegations it won approval to open stores in Mexico, India and Brazil by bribing local officials, including one contact called the \"sorceress\" who had an uncanny ability to make permitting problems disappear.",
      "Who enforces the FCPA?",
      "The FCPA is jointly enforced by the Securities and Exchange Commission, which handles civil enforcement of bribery-related acts, and the Department of Justice, which is responsible for civil and criminal enforcement for the law.",
      "Only criminal cases carry the threat of prison time, according to the National Whistleblower Association, adding that the burden of proof is lower for civil cases. In criminal bribery cases, punishment for conviction is imprisonment of up to 20 years, and companies face fines double their profits from the illicit deal.",
      "Why is the FCPA important?",
      "The FCPA was enacted to protect U.S businesses from global corruption costs as a result of bribery.",
      "By prohibiting companies from unfair advantages through the illegal payment of foreign officials, and by requiring that companies covered by the law to keep accurate records of payment transactions and devise and maintain an adequate internal accounting controls, the FCPA protects U.S. businesses from global corruption costs stemming from bribery and helps ensure fair competition.",
      "Criticisms against the FCPA",
      "President Trump said the law is being enforced in \"excessive, unpredictable\" ways that U.S. companies are competing on an uneven \"playing field\" with foreign rivals. He also said the law was \"draining resources\" from law enforcement and harming U.S. national interests because companies were being held back from deals that would give the U.S. access to deep water ports, critical minerals and other assets.",
      "Since the FCPA was enacted nearly 50 years ago, U.S. businesses have complained that it was hurting more than helping and unfair because bribes were commonplace in some countries. Then under U.S. pressure, allies in the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development started enacting their own laws, especially after the Berlin Wall fell in 1989 and African and Asian countries formerly in the communist orbit opened their borders to business.",
      "Eventually, 40 wealthy countries adopted anti-bribery laws based on the FCPA, according to University of Basel's Pieth, including the ability to prosecute foreign companies operating in their countries for acts committed in a third country.",
      "Therein lies another danger of Mr. Trump weakening the FCPA, according to Pieth.\"If a U.S. company bribes because Trump is giving them the green light, the French and the British will jump on that company,\" he said. \"It will be a mess.\"",

The economic spiral that followed the subprime mortgage meltdown, dubbed the Great Recession, proved devastating for millions of Americans and caused cascading economic problems around the world. The disaster\u00a0wiped out\u00a0almost $8 trillion in stock market wealth and $6 trillion in home value.",
      "Set up to protect consumers from questionable financial products, corporate fraud and scams, the CFPB was created as part of the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act that was signed into law by Obama in 2010.",
      "What does the CFPB do?",
      "The CFPB implements and enforces a range of consumer finance laws, such as the Fair Credit Reporting\u00a0Act, which among other things helps ensure the accuracy and privacy of people's credit reports. The agency also issues and enforces financial regulations.",
      "As part of its duties, the CFPB also issues refunds to consumers harmed by financial firms, works to arrange loan and debt relief for eligible borrowers, and imposes fines on companies found to have broken the rules. Some of the agency's achievements, according to the CFPB and consumer advocates:",
      "Securing $20 billion in relief for consumers, including reducing loan balances and erasing debt, since the agency's launchImposing $5 billion in civil monetary penalties against businesses and individuals who violate consumer protection lawsPenalizing banks and other companies for activities such as opening fake accounts and improperly charging \"junk\" feesBanning excessive credit card late-payment fees (a federal judge in 2024 moved to block that CFPB rule)Tightening rules for \"buy now, pay later\" loans, ensuring that consumers who use this increasingly form of credit are protectedSafeguarding U.S. servicemembers from illegal loansBanning medical debt from from consumers' credit report",

      "Safeguarding U.S. servicemembers from illegal loans",
      "Banning medical debt from from consumers' credit report",
      "\"It's a law enforcement agency. It takes big financial institutions to court who cheat consumers, whether it's a credit reporting agency, or a large bank or a credit card giant,\" Rohit Chopra, who was\u00a0fired by President Trump as director of CFPB earlier this month, said in an interview\u00a0aired\u00a0on NPR on Monday. \"The CFPB has been recovering billions of dollars for consumers who were wronged.\"",
      "In the weeks leading up to Chopra's departure, the CFPB targeted a number of large institutions in a flurry of legal actions. That included suing Capital One for\u00a0allegedly misleading people\u00a0about its offerings for high-interest savings accounts and accusing Experian of\u00a0improperly investigating consumer complaints of errors in credit reports. Both Capital one Experian dispute the allegations.",
      "The CFPB in December also said that more than 4 million Americans\u00a0allegedly gouged by credit repair companies including Lexington Law and CreditRepair.com would soon collectively be refunded $1.8 billion.",
      "What do the CFPB's critics say?",
      "Funded by the Federal Reserve, the CFPB has weathered multiple legal challenges from opponents over its short life as a regulatory agency. The Supreme Court\u00a0in May upheld\u00a0its funding structure, which had been challenged by the payday lending industry.",
      "The CFPB had been \"a woke & weaponized agency against disfavored industries and individuals for a long time. This must end,\" acting CFPB director Russ Vought wrote in a Feb. 9 social media post. Vought previously served as Office of Management and Budget director in the first Trump administration and was involved in writing the Heritage Foundation's Project 2025, which called for\u00a0eliminating the agency.",
      "According to a slew of published reports, Mr. Trump on Tuesday picked Jonathan McKernan to head the agency. McKernan on Monday resigned from the board of the Federal Deposit Insurance Corp. Vought will continue to lead the agency until the Senate confirms a nominee.",
      "That said, what the president has in mind for the agency is unclear, as Mr. Trump signaled a willingness to shut the CFPB down one day earlier.",
      "\"That was a very important thing to get rid of,\" Mr. Trump told reporters on Monday from the Oval Office. Asked if his intention was to eliminate the agency, he Trump replied, \"I would say, yeah, because we're trying to get rid of waste, fraud and abuse.\"",
      "The White House press office declined further comment. Spokespeople at the CFPB and the Heritage Foundation also didn't respond to requests for comment.",
      "If one is looking to root out redundancy in federal government, the CFPB is a \"great place to start,\" Norbert Michel, vice president and director of the Cato Institute's Center for Monetary and Financial Alternatives, told CBS MoneyWatch. \"It's completely untrue that there was no consumer protection in financial markets prior to the CFPB,\" said Michel, who lists the Federal Trade Commission, the Federal Reserve and the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation as among the regulators already on hand.",
      "Still, while long an advocate of pulling the plug on the agency's operations, Michel was unclear on the White House's tactics.",
      "\"Congress created this thing, and I don't understand how that's possible for the executive branch to truly get rid of a federal agency that Congress created, whether I like it or not,\" said Michel. \"I don't know what the end game is \u2014 I don't know what they are trying to do,\" the economist and statistician said of the Trump administration's efforts at pulling the plug on the CFPB's work.",
      "What could happen to the CFPB?",
      "One financial analyst believes the CFPB will survive, even as it drops its defense of rule changes now being challenged in the courts.",
      "\"We expect to see the repeal of the credit card late fee, the overdraft late fee, the open banking and the credit bureau rules reversed by the courts,\" Jaret Seiberg wrote, an analyst at TD Cowen Washington Research Group, said in a report on Tuesday, referencing consumer protection rules adopted by the CFPB during Chopra's time at the agency's helm.",
      "A union representing employees at dozens of federal agencies is suing to block the agency's shutdown. Democrats including Sen. Elizabeth Warren of Massachusetts, who proposed the idea of the CFPB before entering Congress when she was still a law professor at Harvard University, are pushing to keep the CFPB running.",
      "\"If you have a bank account, or credit card or mortgage or student loan, this is code red. I am ringing the alarm bell. Elon Musk and the guy who wrote Project 2025, Russ Vought, are trying to kill the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau. If they succeed, CEOs and Wall Street will once again be free to trick, trap and cheat you,\" Warren stated in a videotaped post.",

    "published": "Wed, 12 Feb 2025 07:07:00 -0500",
    "summary": "Tesla has sued its own customers and journalists in China for defamation \u2013 and won just about every time. Elon Musk's company has pioneered an aggressive legal strategy there.",
    "story": [
      "Beijing \u2014 Zhang Yazhou was sitting in the passenger seat of her Tesla Model 3 when she said she heard her father's panicked voice: The brakes don't work! Approaching a red light, her father swerved around two cars before plowing into an SUV and a sedan and crashing into a large concrete barrier.",
      "Stunned, Zhang gazed at the deflating airbag in front of her. She could never have imagined what was to come: Tesla sued her for defamation for complaining publicly about the car's brakes \u2014 and won. A Chinese court ordered Zhang to pay more than $23,000 in damages and publicly apologize to the $1.1 trillion company.",
      "Zhang isn't the only one to find herself in the crosshairs of Tesla, which is led by Elon Musk,\u00a0among the richest men in the world\u00a0and a self-described \"free speech absolutist.\" Over the last four years, Tesla has sued at least six car owners in China who had sudden vehicle malfunctions, quality complaints or accidents they claimed were caused by mechanical failures.",
      "The company has also sued at least six bloggers and two Chinese media outlets that wrote critically about the company, according to a review by The Associated Press  of public court documents and Chinese media reports. Tesla won all eleven cases for which the AP could track down the verdicts. Two judgments, including Zhang's, are on appeal. One case was settled out of court.",
      "It isn't common practice for automakers \u2014 in China or elsewhere \u2014 to sue their customers. But Tesla has pioneered an aggressive legal strategy and leveraged the patronage of powerful leaders in China's ruling Communist Party to silence critics, reap financial rewards and limit its accountability.",
      "The AP review of Tesla's record in China comes as Musk is wielding significant influence in President Trump's new administration, leading an effort to rapidly shrink the size of the federal government and oust employees deemed disloyal to the president. His actions have raised concerns that Musk is weakening the U.S. system of checks and balances, in part, to benefit Tesla and his other companies.",
      "In the United States, Musk has found a powerful ally in Mr. Trump. Together, they have ransacked the federal government, freezing spending, suspending programs and dismissing prosecutors, government watchdogs and others who've traditionally acted as guardrails.",
      "Tesla officials in China and the United States didn't reply to requests for comment.",
      "Tesla's hospitable business dynamics in China",
      "Tesla's record in China shows how Musk has thrived in a system in which regulators, the media and the courts \u2014 which must all ultimately answer to the ruling Communist Party are, by design, somewhat intertwined.",
      "Tesla has profited from the largesse of the Chinese state, winning unprecedented regulatory benefits, below-market rate loans and large tax breaks. With a few pointed exceptions, Tesla has enjoyed largely ingratiating coverage in the Chinese press, and journalists told the AP they've been instructed to avoid negative coverage of the automaker.",
      "Tesla's windfall has extended to the courts \u2014 and not just in legal actions Tesla has brought against customers. In a review of public court documents, the AP found that Tesla won nearly 90% of civil cases over safety, quality or contract disputes brought by customers.",
      "\"The government gave Tesla a super status that put consumers in a very vulnerable position,\" said Qiao Yudong, a former lawyer for American sports car company Saleen Automotive in China. \"That's why some consumers had to resort to extreme actions.\"",
      "Customer's tough times",
      "One of those desperate customers was Zhang.",
      "The February 2021 crash in central China's Henan province sent Zhang's mother and father, who had a concussion, to the hospital for four days, medical records show. Zhang \u2014 who was unharmed in the accident, as was her baby niece \u2014 wanted to understand what had happened: How could her dream car have turned into such a nightmare?",
      "Traffic police determined that the crash was her dad's fault because he hadn't maintained a safe following distance. Zhang, however, insisted that the brakes had malfunctioned, sending the car out of control. She filed a complaint with a local market regulator, requesting a refund and compensation. Teslas are among the most computerized cars on the market, so Zhang asked the automaker to turn over the full pre-crash data from her car, hoping it might help explain what went wrong. Tesla refused.",
      "\"Tesla's employees were very arrogant and tough in dealing with my complaints,\" Zhang said in an interview. \"I was burning with anger.\"",
      "After weeks of stewing, she draped her damaged car with a banner proclaiming \"Tesla brake failure\" in front of the Tesla dealership in Zhengzhou, the capital of Henan province, some 124 miles from her home. She sat on the Tesla's roof and blared her protest through a bullhorn: \"Tesla Model 3 brakes failed,\" she said. \"A family of four almost died.\" The next month, she parked her damaged car outside an auto show in Zhengzhou. It was all to no avail \u2014 Tesla refused to turn over the full data and mediation went nowhere.",
      "Figuring that top Tesla officials would attend an April auto show in Shanghai, she and a friend \u2014 who had also had a problem with her Tesla \u2014 donned matching T-shirts with the phrase \"Brakes fail\" and headed for Tesla's booth, determined to buttonhole executives. The automaker's officials avoided them, Zhang said, and they couldn't get anyone to hear them out.",
      "Her friend, who was six months pregnant, started shouting, \"Tesla brakes fail!\"",
      "Zhang clambered on top of a shiny red display model and started hollering, too.",
      "\"Things escalated,\" said Zhang.",
      "The moment \u2014 captured on cell phone videos shot by onlookers \u2014 went viral on Chinese social media. Burly security guards hauled Zhang out and she was detained for five days.",
      "Some observers speculated that Zhang's protest had been orchestrated \u2014 perhaps by a competitor or by the Chinese government itself to pressure Tesla to conform with Chinese regulations. Tesla alleged that Zhang hadn't acted on her own. A top executive speculated to Chinese media that she \"had someone behind her\" and said Zhang was making a fuss because she just wanted higher compensation.",
      "Zhang insisted she acted on her own \u2014 and out of anguish. Outraged, she sued Tesla for defamation, arguing that the executive's comments unjustly cast her as a troublemaker to deflect attention from the company's own shortcomings.",
      "And then she found herself on the receiving end of a lawsuit filed by Tesla.",
      "Tesla said Zhang had deliberately spread false information that damaged the brand and asked for 5 million yuan ($684,000) in damages.",
      "The case, which a court took up in October 2021, came as Tesla faced a barrage of criticism in China.",
      "Tesla's numerous alleged issues",
      "Dozens of Tesla owners had been publicly complaining about alleged brake failures, battery fires, unintended acceleration and other defects, as well as what they claimed were misleading sales practices. The same month as Zhang's crash, Chinese regulators summoned Tesla to respond to quality concerns raised by such reports.",
      "Zhang's emotional protest sparked a rare burst of criticism of Tesla in Chinese media. Under pressure from regulators, Tesla finally released the data from her car, which the company said showed her father had been driving nearly 120 km per hour (75 mph) and that the brakes had functioned to reduce the magnitude of the collision.",
      "Tesla had finally given Zhang what she'd been asking for, but they'd published the data publicly and included her vehicle identification number. She said she and her family started getting threatened and doxed online. Besides, she wondered, how could she be sure Tesla hadn't modified or redacted the data from her car? It was less than the victory she'd hoped for. Feeling besieged, she sued Tesla a second time, in March 2022, for invading her privacy.",
      "Zhang lost both cases she brought against Tesla.",
      "Meanwhile, the defamation case against her was grinding along. Back in court as a defendant, Zhang was unable to prove that the brakes on her Tesla had indeed failed. In a closed trial, a Shanghai court ruled in May 2024 that Zhang's public complaints went beyond what magistrates considered reasonable, factual criticism and ordered her to publicly apologize and pay 170,000 RMB ($23,000) to cover damages and the legal costs of the world's most valuable car company.",
      "Zhang appealed the ruling. She maintains that her lawsuit is a cry for transparency and accountability and that a company as rich and powerful as Tesla should be able to tolerate legitimate criticism from its customers.",
      "\"I refuse to accept it,\" Zhang told the Associated Press, \"As a consumer, even if I said something wrong, I have the right to comment and criticize. I spoke about my feelings as a user of the car. It has nothing to do with damaging their reputation.\"",
      "Odds stacked against Tesla owners in court",
      "Her odds of winning the appeal against Tesla do not look good. Tesla has not only won the defamation cases it brought against unhappy car owners and critical journalists, it's also prevailed in lawsuits customers have filed against it.",
      "An AP review of a Chinese government database of court filings published online found 81 civil judgements in which car owners sued Tesla over safety and quality issues or contract disputes. Car owners won in only nine of those cases.",
      "In a statement to AP, the Shanghai High People's Court said that judgments are the result of a \"fair trial\" based on \"the objective facts of the case.\"",
      "\"It cannot be assumed that the party has received 'special protection' or 'special treatment' because of their victory,\" the court wrote.",
      "While some auto industry experts in China say it's generally difficult for customers to win cases against car companies, others say it's remarkable for a foreign company to enjoy such blazing success in Chinese courts.",
      "\"For Tesla to win that percentage of the time is an anomaly,\" said Bill Russo, founder of Automobility Ltd., an advisory firm based in Shanghai, who also used to be regional head of Chrysler in northeast Asia. \"The odds are stacked against you. It's like going to the casino and winning every hand.\"",
      "Tesla and Bejing's win-win",
      "Tesla's commercial and political success in China has hinged on the support of a powerful patron: Li Qiang, the former party boss of Shanghai who is now China's premier, second in rank only to President Xi Jinping. It was under his watch, in 2019, that Tesla built its first overseas factory on the outskirts of China's financial capital.",
      "With Li's support, Tesla became the first foreign automaker allowed to retain complete control over its China venture and got low-interest loans and generous tax breaks. China also adopted an emissions credit scheme modeled after a U.S. program that's generated billions in income for Tesla.",
      "In January 2020, one year after breaking ground, Elon Musk unveiled the first Chinese-made Teslas on a stage in Shanghai. Tesla turned an annual profit for the first time in its history that year, and Musk was declared the world's richest person in January 2021.",
      "China got what it wanted, too: Tesla was a potent catalyst for domestic production and consumption. Before Tesla's arrival, new energy vehicles accounted for around five percent of China's auto market. Today, analysts say, more than half of passenger vehicles sold retail in China are powered by an electric motor. Chinese battery maker CATL, a key Tesla supplier, has embedded itself in global supply chains to become the world's largest EV-battery maker. China's BYD is now the world's largest electric vehicle manufacturer and a growing competitive threat to legacy carmakers in the West.",
      "\"Tesla had a large part to play in that,\" said Tu Le, the managing director of Sino Auto Insights, a consulting firm. Tu said the way the government smoothed the way for Musk's factory was critical. \"It was a swampy field on the outskirts of Shanghai. A year later, they're rolling cars off the line,\" he said. \"I don't know if that happens anywhere else in the world.\"",
      "Requests for comment to the State Council, which is run by Li Qiang and oversees China's government ministries, went unanswered.",
      "Musk's enormous influence in China and U.S.",
      "Musk still swings by to meet Li when he goes to China. Their encounters underscore the complexity of Musk's overlapping interests as a businessman and the most China-friendly member of Mr. Trump's inner circle.",
      "Musk's \"greater objective was winning influence over the people that mattered for him, that enabled him to get things done,\" said Russo, the auto strategist in Shanghai. \"He's done a good job of it in China and he's done it now with the influence he purchased with his relationship with Trump.\"",
      "Safety advocates worry about the implications of Musk's proximity to power in the United States. Federal investigations and safety initiatives Musk has long railed against could be easily snuffed out by the new administration.",
      "In the U.S., Tesla also has been subject to a raft of customer safety complaints and lawsuits over autopilot function, battery charging, alleged suspension defects, sudden braking or acceleration, faulty airbags and allegedly monopolistic practices on repairs and parts. Judges have dismissed some cases. In others, Tesla settled out of court or paid hefty settlements.",
      "Tesla hasn't publicly sued any of its U.S. customers for speaking out, though in January, Musk said on X that \"maybe it is time\" to sue media outlets for coverage that could stain Tesla's brand. His post has been viewed more than 22 million times.",
      "Tesla has already successfully done that in China.",
      "Tesla targets journalists in China",
      "Two Chinese journalists based in Shanghai told the AP there is an unwritten rule to avoid critical coverage of Tesla. Both spoke on condition of anonymity, fearing retaliation.",
      "\"We were told by our editor that we should not write negatively about Tesla because it is a key company that was introduced and protected by the Shanghai government,\" a tech reporter told AP.",
      "Those who have strayed have found themselves in court. Musk's company sued media outlets PingWest and ifeng.com over negative coverage. It was unhappy about PingWest's report that claimed Tesla's Shanghai factory was a \"sweatshop.\" The news website ifeng.com drew Tesla's ire over a story that explored the tribulations of car owners who fought Tesla. PingWest had to apologize and pay Tesla 100,000 yuan ($13,700). AP couldn't determine the outcome of the case against ifeng.com.",
      "Tesla isn't the only company in its industry to sue its critics. BYD has also aggressively pursued media in court, including an unsuccessful lawsuit against Vice Media in the United States. More recently, electric vehicle makers Nio and Li Auto have stepped up defamation cases against bloggers in China who allegedly spread false information about their companies.",
      "Tesla, however, stands out even among its cut-throat Chinese competitors \u2014 in going after car owners who suffered crashes.",
      "\"Tesla used their legal advantages to bully Chinese car owners and people who speak up for them,\" said Feng Shiming, an auto blogger and Tesla owner who was ordered by a Shanghai court last year to pay Tesla 250,000 yuan ($34,200) after he wrote about Tesla's alleged brake failures. He has appealed the verdict. \"Tesla wants to have a chilling effect on society and terrify people so they will be scared to say anything negative about Tesla.\"",
      "Chen Junyi got the message. He lost control of his Model 3 and plowed into a dozen cars in a parking lot at high speed in August 2020. He claimed the brakes had failed. He told Chinese media at the time that he broke his back and four ribs and had to have 12 inches of his small intestine removed. Chen took to social media and warned people not to buy Tesla, raising his shirt to reveal the long, gnarled scar that runs up his abdomen.",
      "Tesla maintained the accident was Chen's fault, citing a technical review that found the car was accelerating and not braking in the seconds before the crash, and sued him for making false claims.",
      "\"Tesla should proactively respond to consumers instead of using its superior resources and filing lawsuits against consumers who are at a disadvantage,\" Chen said in a court statement reviewed by the AP. \"I almost lost my life because of the car accident. I lost my job and income. I am under tremendous economic pressure.\"",
      "Chen declined to speak with the AP, citing fear of retaliation. A Chinese court ordered Chen to pay the carmaker 50,000 yuan ($6,800) as compensation \u2014 and to issue an apology.",
      "\"I deeply regret the serious negative impacts I have had on Tesla and its cars,\" he wrote. \"I hereby sincerely apologize to Tesla and to the people who were misled by my remarks.\"",
      "A month later, he apologized for his apology, saying the words were not his own.",

    "story": [
      "Starbucks faces a new lawsuit filed by Missouri's attorney general alleging the restaurant chain relies on \"race-and-sex-based hiring practices\" that violate federal and state laws. The complaint\u00a0also claims the coffee chain's hiring policies have led to slower service and higher prices for consumers because it isn't recruiting the most qualified workers.",
      "The lawsuit, filed Tuesday by Missouri Attorney General Andrew Bailey, claims Starbucks' diversity, equity and inclusion, or DEI, policies are \"mere pretext for its actual commitment to unlawful discrimination.\"",
      "The litigation comes just weeks after President Trump signed an executive order\u00a0banning diversity, equity and inclusion\u00a0programs across the U.S. government, while also directing the U.S. attorney general to \"encourage the private sector to end illegal discrimination and preferences, including DEI.\"",
      "A number of major retailers and other companies, along with other organizations, have recently rolled back their DEI initiatives amid pushback from conservative activists, including Ford, Google, McDonald's, Meta, Target and Walmart.",
      "In a statement to CBS News responding to Missouri's suit, Starbucks said, \"We disagree with the attorney general, and these allegations are inaccurate. We are deeply committed to creating opportunity for every single one of our partners (employees). Our programs and benefits are open to everyone and lawful.\"",
      "The company added, \"Our hiring practices are inclusive fair and competitive and designed to ensure the strongest candidate for every job every time.\"",
      "Critics of DEI say employers should make their hiring decisions based on merit alone without regard to race, color, gender and other legally protected categories. The Missouri lawsuit echoes those arguments, alleging that Starbucks' hiring practices discriminates against residents of the state.",
      "\"Starbucks' policies harm the many Missourians whom work, or would like to work, at Starbucks, but have been, are being or will be discriminated against as future victims on the basis of their race, sex, or inclusion in other protected groups,\" the complaint alleges.",
      "While Starbucks' prices and wait times have been a focus of consumer complaints in recent years, experts haven't generally blamed hiring practices for the chain's problems. Instead, analysts have pointed to inflation, which has pushed up the prices of ingredients like coffee and milk, as well as Starbucks' vast number of drink customizations, which can slow orders.",
      "Starbucks CEO Brian Niccol has vowed to tackle some of those issues, pledging last year to simplify beverage customizations and saying customers should receive their drinks in four minutes or less.",
      "Niccol, who was hired from Chipotle last year to revitalize the struggling coffee chain, has also said he wants to make Starbucks' locations \"inviting places to linger.\"",
      "As part of that goal, Starbucks reversed its open-door policy last month after almost seven years, now requiring that people make a purchase if they want to hang out in its stores or use restrooms. The company adopted those policies in 2018 after two Black men were arrested at a Philadelphia Starbucks where they had gone for a business meeting.",

      "Ahead of the meeting, Britain's Prime Minister Keir Starmer said for the first time that the U.K. could deploy troops to Ukraine to help secure an eventual peace. He said he'd stress to other European leaders that, \"we have got to show we are truly serious about our own defense and bearing our own burden.\"",
      "\"We are facing a once-in-a-generation moment for the collective security of our continent,\" Starmer said in a weekend editorial in Britain's Telegraph newspaper. \"This is not only a question about the future of Ukraine \u2014 it is existential for Europe as a whole.\"",
      "He said the U.K. was prepared to \"play a leading role in accelerating work on security guarantees for Ukraine,\" including more military support and putting British troops on the ground as part of a peacekeeping force if necessary.",
      "\"I do not say that lightly. I feel very deeply the responsibility that comes with potentially putting British servicemen and women in harm's way. But any role in helping to guarantee Ukraine's security is helping to guarantee the security of our continent, and the security of this country,\" Starmer said, adding that \"U.S. support will remain critical and a U.S. security guarantee is essential for a lasting peace.\"",

      "Sweden also indicated a willingness Monday to deploy forces to Ukraine to keep an eventual peace, with the country's Foreign Minister Maria Malmer Stenergard stressing in a radio interview the need to first \"negotiate a fair and sustainable peace that respects international law, that respects Ukraine and that ensures above all else that Russia can't just withdraw and regroup and attack Ukraine or another country within a few years.\"",

      "Washington \u2014 The Trump administration has begun firing several hundred Federal Aviation Administration employees, upending staff on a busy air travel weekend just weeks after a fatal mid-air collision at Ronald Reagan Washington National Airport in January.",
      "Probationary workers were targeted in late night emails on Friday notifying them they had been fired, David Spero, president of the Professional Aviation Safety Specialists union, said in a statement.",
      "\"It is shameful to toss aside dedicated public servants who have chosen to work on behalf of their fellow Americans,\" Spero said. \"These employees were devoted to their jobs and the safety critical mission of the FAA. This draconian action will increase the workload and place new responsibilities on a workforce that is already stretched thin.\"",
      "The impacted workers include systems specialists, safety inspectors, maintenance mechanics, administrative staff and more, the union said.",
      "Spero said messages began arriving after 7 p.m. on Friday and continued late into the night. More might be notified over the long weekend or barred from entering FAA buildings on Tuesday, he said.",
      "The employees were fired \"without cause nor based on performance or conduct,\" Spero said, and the emails were \"from an 'exec order' Microsoft email address\" \u2014 not a government email address.",
      "The firings hit the FAA when it faces a shortfall in controllers. Federal officials have been raising concerns about an overtaxed and understaffed air traffic control system for years, especially after a series of close calls between planes at U.S. airports. Among the reasons they have cited for staffing shortages are noncompetitive pay, long shifts, intensive training and mandatory retirements.",
      "In the Jan. 29 fatal crash between a U.S. Army Black Hawk helicopter and American Airlines passenger jet, which is still under investigation, one controller was handing both commercial airline and helicopter traffic at the busy airport.",
      "Just days before the collision, President Trump had already fired all the members of the Aviation Security Advisory Committee, a panel mandated by Congress after the 1988 PanAm 103 bombing over Lockerbie, Scotland. The committee is charged with examining safety issues at airlines and airports.",
      "One FAA employee who was fired over the weekend suggested he was targeted for his views on Tesla and X, formerly Twitter, not as part of a general probationary-level sweep. Both are owned by Elon Musk, who is leading the president's effort to cut the federal government.",
      "Charles Spitzer-Stadtlander posted on LinkedIn that he was fired just after midnight Saturday, days after he started getting harassing messages on Facebook.",
      "\"The official DOGE Facebook page started harassing me on my personal Facebook account after I criticized Tesla and Twitter,\" Spitzer-Stadtlander wrote. \"Less than a week later, I was fired, despite my position allegedly being exempted due to national security.\"",
      "He added: \"When DOGE fired me, they turned off my computer and wiped all of my files without warning.\"",
      "Spitzer-Stadtlander said he was supposed to be exempted from the probationary firings because the FAA office he worked in focused on national security threats such as attacks on the national airspace by drones.",
      "The Musk-led Department of Government Efficiency did not immediately respond to the AP's request for comment.",
      "Transportation Secretary Sean Duffy wrote on X on Sunday that a team from Musk's SpaceX will visit the FAA's command center in Virginia on Tuesday to get a first-hand look at the current system.

    "summary": "The Trump administration has halted DOGE's firings of hundreds of federal employees working on the nation's nuclear weapons programs.",
    "story": [
      "The Trump administration has paused the firings of hundreds of federal employees working on the nation's nuclear weapons programs, in a reversal that has left workers confused and experts cautioning that DOGE's blind cost cutting will put communities at risk.",
      "Late Thursday afternoon, a number\u00a0probationary employees of the National Nuclear Security Administration were fired, a source in the Energy Department confirmed. This is the entity within the department that manages the nation's nuclear weapons stockpile, among other responsibilities. Three U.S. officials told The Associated Press up to 350 employees at the NNSA were abruptly laid off, with some losing access to email even before they'd learned they were fired, only to try to enter their offices on Friday morning to find they had been locked out. The officials spoke on the condition of anonymity for fear of retaliation.",
      "One of the hardest hit offices was the Pantex Plant near Amarillo, Texas, which saw about 30% of the cuts. Those employees work on reassembling warheads, one of the most sensitive jobs across the nuclear weapons enterprise, with the highest levels of clearance.",
      "The hundreds let go at NNSA were part of a DOGE purge across the Department of Energy that targeted about 2,000 employees.",
      "\"The DOGE people are coming in with absolutely no knowledge of what these departments are responsible for,\" said Daryl Kimball, executive director of the Arms Control Association, referencing Elon Musk's Department of Government Efficiency team. \"They don't seem to realize that it's actually the department of nuclear weapons more than it is the Department of Energy.\"",
      "By late Friday night, the agency's acting director, Teresa Robbins, issued a memo rescinding the firings for all but 28 of those hundreds of fired staff members.",
      "\"This letter serves as formal notification that the termination decision issued to you on Feb. 13, 2025 has been rescinded, effective immediately,\" said the memo, which was obtained by the AP.",
      "The accounts from the three officials contradict an official statement from the Department of Energy, which said fewer than 50 National Nuclear Security Administration staffers had been let go, referring to them as \"probationary employees\" who \"held primarily administrative and clerical roles.\"",
      "But that wasn't the case. The firings prompted one NNSA senior staffer to post a warning and call to action.",
      "\"This is a pivotal moment. We must decide whether we are truly committed to leading on the world stage or if we are content with undermining the very systems that secure our nation's future,\" deputy division director Rob Plonski posted to LinkedIn. \"Cutting the federal workforce responsible for these functions may be seen as reckless at best and adversarily opportunistic at worst.\"",
      "While some of the Energy Department employees who were fired dealt with energy efficiency and the effects of climate change, issues not seen as priorities by the Trump administration, many others dealt with nuclear issues, even if they didn't directly work on weapons programs. This included managing massive radioactive waste sites and ensuring the material there doesn't further contaminate nearby communities.",
      "That incudes the Savannah River National Laboratory in Jackson, South Carolina; the Hanford Nuclear Site in Washington state, where workers secure 177 high-level waste tanks from the site's previous work producing plutonium for the atomic bomb; and the Oak Ridge Reservation in Tennessee, a Superfund contamination site where much of the early work on the Manhattan Project was done, among others.",
      "Rep. Marcy Kaptur of Ohio and Sen. Patty Murray of Washington, both Democrats, called the firings last week \"utterly callous and dangerous.\"",
      "Not all of the NNSA staff who had been reinstated could be reached after they were fired, and some were reconsidering whether to return to work, given the uncertainty created by DOGE.",
      "Many federal employees who had worked on the nation's nuclear programs had spent their entire careers there, and there was a wave of retirements in recent years that cost the agency years of institutional knowledge.",
      "But it's now in the midst of a major $750 billion nuclear weapons modernization effort \u2014 including new land-based intercontinental ballistic missiles, new stealth bombers and new submarine-launched warheads. In response, the labs have aggressively hired over the past few years: In 2023, 60% of the workforce had been there five years or less.",
      "Edwin Lyman, director of nuclear power safety at the Union of Concerned Scientists, said the firings could disrupt the day-to-day workings of the agency and create a sense of instability over the nuclear program both at home and abroad.",
      "\"I think the signal to U.S. adversaries is pretty clear: throw a monkey wrench in the whole national security apparatus and cause disarray,\" he said. \"That can only benefit the adversaries of this country.\"",

    "published": "Mon, 17 Feb 2025 09:11:47 -0500",
    "summary": "President Trump has terminated the heads of the National Labor Relations Board and the Merit Systems Protection Board, sparking legal challenges over their removal.",
    "story": [
      "Washington \u2014 President Trump's firings of the members of independent agencies and boards have prompted a string of legal fights that could set the Supreme Court up to reconsider and potentially overturn a 90-year-old decision that shields certain executive branch officials from being removed after political shifts in the White House.",
      "Since returning to the presidency, Mr. Trump has terminated the heads of the National Labor Relations Board and the Merit Systems Protection Board, as well as the director of the Office of Government Ethics and the special counsel, Hampton Dellinger, who oversees the office that investigates whistleblower complaints.",
      "The officials learned of their firings through emails stating that they had been removed from their respective positions at their agencies, according to court filings.",
      "But in subsequent lawsuits challenging their removal, some of the officials have alleged that Mr. Trump violated federal laws passed by Congress that created the agencies and limited the president to removing their members only for cause \u2014 in cases of neglect of duty or malfeasance.",
      "The president has said the heads of executive branch agencies should share his administration's objectives, but the firings may have also been aimed at provoking these very legal challenges, with the ultimate goal of addressing the question to the Supreme Court.",
      "\"It really was kind of a matter of time before a test case made its way to the court, where the court would have a chance to overrule Humphrey's,\" Joel Alicea, a law professor at the Catholic University of America, told CBS News.",
      "Alicea was referring to the Supreme Court's 1935 decision in the case Humphrey's Executor v. United States, in which the court carved out an exception to the president's power to remove executive officers. William Humphrey, appointed to a second term on the Federal Trade Commission by President Herbert Hoover, was asked to resign by President Franklin Roosevelt. The new president then fired him, citing their policy differences, rather than dismissing him for cause. The case is referred to a Humphrey's Executor because he died not long after his firing, but the executors of his estate brought the case to pursue his back pay.",
      "In Humphrey's Executor, the Supreme Court found that Congress could impose for-cause removal protections to multi-member commissions of experts that are balanced along partisan lines and do not exercise any executive power. The high court recognized another exception in 1988, which applies to certain inferior officers who have limited duties and lack policymaking or significant administrative authority.",
      "In recent years, though, the Supreme Court has chipped away at its 1935 ruling and reasserted the president's power to remove executive branch officers at will. Most notably in 2020, the Supreme Court ruled that the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau's structure of a single leader removable only for inefficiency, neglect or malfeasance is unconstitutional.",
      "\"In our constitutional system, the executive power belongs to the president, and that power generally includes the ability to supervise and remove the agents who wield executive power in his stead,\" Chief Justice John Roberts wrote for the court's conservative majority. \"While we have previously upheld limits on the president's removal authority in certain contexts, we decline to do so when it comes to principal officers who, acting alone, wield significant executive power.\"",
      "Now, nearly five years later, the high court is on track to revisit the issue of the president's removal power and could overturn the nearly century-old ruling allowing Congress to protect the members of independent agencies from being fired at will.",
      "In what is likely to be the Trump administration's first\u00a0Supreme Court\u00a0emergency appeal of his second term, the solicitor general is expected to ask the high court to\u00a0permit Dellinger's firing, according to documents obtained Sunday.",
      "Two justices, Clarence Thomas and Neil Gorsuch, who was appointed by Mr. Trump, have already indicated that it's time for the Supreme Court to scrap its 1935 precedent.",
      "\"The decision in Humphrey's Executor poses a direct threat to our constitutional structure and, as a result, the liberty of the American people,\" Thomas wrote in a concurring opinion to its 2020 decision on the CFPB, which was joined by Gorsuch.",
      "Thomas, the longest-serving member of the court, said that in a future case, he \"would repudiate what is left of this erroneous precedent.\"",
      "Three more members of the court, Roberts and Justices Brett Kavanaugh and Samuel Alito, all have experience working in the executive branch that could have shaped their views on executive power.",
      "\"This has nothing to do with the justices' ideological leanings or which president appointed them,\" Alicea said. \"This has to do with deeply held views about the nature of presidential removal under Article II of the Constitution, and these are views that some of these justices have had for decades.\"",
      "At least one of the officials fired by Mr. Trump recognized that she may be part of a broader plan to target the Supreme Court's 1935 ruling. Gwynne Wilcox, the chair of the National Labor Relations Board, received an email on behalf of the president on Jan. 27 informing her and the agency's general counsel that they had been \"removed from the office of members of the National Labor Relations Board.\"",
      "But the National Labor Relations Act, passed by Congress in 1935, restricts the reasons for removal of board members to \"neglect of duty or malfeasance in office,\" and requires that they receive \"notice and hearing.\"",
      "Mr. Trump's firing of Wilcox was a \"blatant violation\" of that law, she wrote in a lawsuit challenging her removal. But Wilcox also said that the president's action was \"apparently designed to test Congress's power to create independent agencies like the board.\"",
      "\"Although Ms. Wilcox has no desire to aid the president in establishing a test case, she is also cognizant of the fact that, if no challenge is made, the president will have effectively succeeded in rendering the NLRA's protections \u2014 and, by extension, that of other independent agencies \u2014 nugatory,\" her lawyers wrote.",
      "Citing Humphrey's Executor, Wilcox's legal team wrote that Congress has relied on that decision for decades when structuring independent agencies and warned that \"abandoning it now could cast a cloud over a wide variety of agency decision-making.\"",
      "But Alicea said that if Humphrey's Executor is reversed, it would bring these agencies under the direction of the president.",
      "\"The American people will have more control over their own government by having a president who they elect that superintends the entire federal bureaucracy, and I think that's a much better and much healthier constitutional structure than what we've had since the New Deal, where you have agencies that are largely insulated from direct presidential control and oversight, and therefore less politically accountable to the American people,\" he said.",
      "The Trump administration, too, has laid out its roadmap: It plans to urge the Supreme Court to overrule Humphrey's Executor.",
      "In a letter to Sen. Dick Durbin, the top Democrat on the Judiciary Committee, dated Wednesday, acting Solicitor General Sarah Harris said the Justice Department believes certain for-cause removal provisions that apply to members of multi-member commissions are unconstitutional.",
      "The department, she wrote, will no longer defend the constitutionality of those provisions. Harris specifically pointed to the protections for members of three agencies that the Trump administration believes violate the Constitution: the Federal Trade Commission, the National Labor Relations Board and the Consumer Product Safety Commission.",
      "\"To the extent that Humphrey's Executor requires otherwise, the department intends to urge the Supreme Court to overrule that decision, which prevents the president from adequately supervising principal officers in the executive branch who execute the laws on the president's behalf, and which has already been severely eroded by recent Supreme Court decisions,\" Harris wrote.",
      "As acting solicitor general, Harris represents the federal government before the Supreme Court. Mr. Trump has nominated D. John Sauer, his former defense attorney, for the role but he has not yet been confirmed.",
      "Durbin, an Illinois Democrat, said in response to Harris' letter that it's been the law of the land for decades that members of bipartisan, independent agencies are protected from removal by the president and can only be terminated for cause.",
      "\"But under President Trump, the Justice Department will no longer defend these duly-enacted laws and will instead push the Supreme Court to overturn a nearly-century-old Supreme Court precedent upholding the constitutionality of these statutes,\" he said in a statement. \"This is a striking reversal of the Justice Department's longstanding position under Republican and Democratic presidents alike, but not surprising from an administration that is only looking out for wealthy special interests \u2014 not the American people.\"",

He was joined by national security adviser Mike Waltz and Steve Witkoff, Mr. Trump's Middle East envoy.",
      "The secretary of state said Putin had \"expressed his interest in peace\" during his call with Mr. Trump, whom he said had made clear, \"his desire to see an end of this conflict in a way that was enduring and that protected Ukrainian sovereignty.\"",
      "On Sunday, Mr. Trump told reporters that\u00a0Putin wants to end the war, adding that he was expecting to meet with the Russian leader in Saudi Arabia \"very soon.\"",
      "Asked whether he believes Putin is ready to negotiate and make concessions to bring an end to the fighting, Rubio said the call must be followed by action, and that \"the next few weeks and days will determine whether it's serious or not.\"",

      "Secretary of State Marco Rubio, national security adviser\u00a0Mike Waltz\u00a0and Mr. Trump's special envoy to the Middle East, Steve Witkoff, will head to Saudi Arabia for the meeting, the official said. The news comes after Mr. Trump disclosed that he held separate phone calls\u00a0last week with Russian President Vladimir Putin and Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy.",
      "\"We are moving along we are trying to get a peace with Russia-Ukraine. We are working very hard on it,\" Mr. Trump told reporters on Sunday after saying that he spoke to Secretary Rubio about the negotiations in Saudi Arabia.",
      "When asked whether President Zelensky will be involved in peace negotiations amid concerns that Ukraine and Europe are left out of the conversation, Mr. Trump said yes, adding that he would allow Europeans to buy U.S.-made weapons for Ukrainians. He also noted that Putin wants to end the war, and disagreed with Zelenskyy who told NBC News on Sunday that Russia will wage war on NATO if the U.S. withdraws from the alliance.",
      "In an interview that aired on CBS' \"Face the Nation\" on Sunday, Rubio said the president \"will know very quickly\" whether peace conversations with Russia \"is a real thing or whether this is an effort to buy time.\"",
      "\"I don't want to foreclose the opportunity to end a conflict that's already cost the lives of hundreds of thousands and continues every single day to be increasingly a war of attrition on both sides,\" Rubio said.",

      "Zelenskyy told the conference of world leaders that Ukraine would not accept a deal made \"behind our backs without our involvement,\" and called for the creation of\u00a0\"armed forces of Europe\" amid the possibility of a changing relationship between Europe and the U.S.",
      "Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth said Thursday that \"everything is on the table\" when it comes to negotiations, but he suggested it was unrealistic for Ukraine to expect NATO membership.",
      "\"As far as NATO is concerned, from many years before President Putin, I will tell you that I've heard that Russia would never accept that,\" Mr. Trump said when asked what Russia should give up in the negotiations. \"So that's the way it is, and I think that's the way it's going to have to be.\"",

      "The Trump administration wants the Supreme Court to permit the firing of the head of the federal agency dedicated to protecting whistleblowers, according to documents obtained Sunday that would mark the first appeal to the justices since President Donald Trump took office.",

      "Dellinger has argued that the law says he can only be dismissed for problems with the performance of his job, none of which were cited in the email dismissing him.",
      "The petition came hours after a divided appeals court panel refused on procedural grounds to lift the order, which was filed Wednesday and expires on Feb. 26.",
      "The case is not expected to be docketed until after the Supreme Court returns from the Presidents Day holiday weekend. The justices would not act until Tuesday at the earliest.",

      "The case began last week when Dellinger sued over his removal as head of the Office of Special Counsel, which is responsible for guarding the federal workforce from illegal personnel actions, such as retaliation for whistleblowing. He was appointed by Democratic President Joe Biden and confirmed by the Senate to a five-year term in 2024.",
      "Dellinger said the office's work \"needed now more than ever,\" noting the \"unprecedented\" number of firings, without cause, of federal employees with civil service protections in recent weeks by the Trump administration.",
      "The administration argues that the order reinstating Dellinger for two weeks while the judge considers the case is an unacceptable intrusion on executive power. The brief cites the Supreme Court decision that gave Trump immunity from criminal prosecution and reflected a muscular view of executive power.",

      "We want to begin today with Secretary of State Marco Rubio, who is in Jerusalem on the second leg of his trip through Europe and the Middle East.",
      "Mr. Secretary, I know it's the evening hours there, and you've had a long day. We appreciate your time. You've got quite a busy schedule.",
      "You met earlier with Prime Minister Netanyahu. He said he's lockstep with the Trump administration, but he can't share details on \u2013 quote \u2013 \"when the gates of hell will be open if all our hostages are not released.\"",
      "Did he tell you he wants to keep talks going to get to phase two of this hostage deal?",
      "MARCO RUBIO (U.S. Secretary of State): Well, I think we share a common goal. We want to see every hostage released.",
      "Frankly, I think \u2013 and the president has said this \u2013 we want to see them out as soon as we possibly can. And \u2013 and, certainly, you know, the world has watched these images of people \u2013 and it's just heartbreaking to remember that some of them have been now almost two years there. It's a horrifying situation.",
      "So we coordinate and work very close with them. We share the goal that every hostage needs to come home, every single one, without delay. Obviously, the \u2013 there are details of how we're pursuing that and coordinating that we're not going to share publicly because we don't want to endanger the hostages and we don't want to endanger this process.",
      "But suffice it to say that, if it was up to us, every one of these hostages would be home right now, and we want it to happen as soon as possible.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: OK. So, the deal stands?",
      "SECRETARY MARCO RUBIO: Again, we want every hostage out as soon as possible.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: OK.",
      "SECRETARY MARCO RUBIO: We will \u2013 and we want to see them home.",
      "There are some that are supposed to \u2013 under the deal, there are some that are supposed to be released coming up next weekend. We expect that to happen, but we'd like to see them all come out. We're not going to \u2013 we're not in favor of waiting weeks and weeks.",
      "Now, that may be the process that's in place because of the deal, but we would like to see them all out as soon as possible, and we continue to coordinate. And that \u2013 that's what we'd like to see as the outcome.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Yes.",
      "SECRETARY MARCO RUBIO: Who wouldn't want all these hostages to be home and with their families?",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Understood.",
      "Want to ask you about Iran as well. President Trump has said he wants a diplomatic deal with Iran. Are you reaching out to them? And alongside that, does the U.S. support a preemptive strike by Israel on Iran to take out its nuclear program?",
      "SECRETARY MARCO RUBIO: Well, first of all, Israel will always have to act in what they believe is their national interest and their national defense.",
      "And so I'm not going to speak about whatever strategies they may have on this or any other topic. I will say that we don't have any outreach from Iran. We haven't seen any. And, ultimately, we've seen in the past that efforts that Iran has undertaken diplomatically have been only about how to extend the time frame that \u2013 but continue to enrich and re \u2013 and \u2013 and in addition to sponsor terrorism, in addition to build these long-range weapons, in addition to sow instability throughout the region.",
      "But let's be clear. There's been zero outreach or interest to date from Iran about any negotiated deal. Ideally, yes, I would love to wake up one day and hear the news that Iran has decided not to pursue a nuclear weapon, not to sponsor terrorism, and reengage in the world as a \u2013 as a \u2013 as a normal government.",
      "We've had no indication of any of that, not just now, but for 30 years.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: So you head from Israel to Saudi Arabia next. I know you'll be talking about Gaza, but we've also learned that Saudi Arabia is trying to facilitate this diplomacy with Russia about Ukraine.",
      "Which Russian officials do you expect to be meeting with? And what will the focus of your talks there be? Do you actually believe Vladimir Putin is ready to negotiate and make concessions?",
      "SECRETARY MARCO RUBIO: Well, here's what I know.",
      "I know President Trump spoke to Vladimir Putin last week. And, in it, Vladimir Putin expressed his interest in peace, and the president expressed his desire to see an end to this conflict in a way that was enduring and that protected Ukrainian sovereignty, and that was an enduring peace, not that we're going to have another invasion in three or four years.",
      "That's a good call. Now, obviously, it has to be followed up by action. So, the next few weeks and days will determine whether it's serious or not. Ultimately, one phone call does not make peace. One phone call does not solve a war as complex as this one.",
      "But I can tell you that Donald Trump is the only leader in the world that could potentially begin that process. Other leaders have tried. They have not been able to do so. When he ran in his campaign and he was elected as president, one of his promises was, he would work to bring an end to this conflict in a way that's sustainable and fair.",
      "And, obviously, you know, this is the first step in that process, but we have a long ways to go. Again, one call doesn't make it. One meeting wouldn't make it. This \u2013 there's a lot of work to be done. But I \u2013 I thought it has \u2013 you know, even the longest journey begins with the first step.",
      "So we'll see what happens from here, hopefully good things.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Who will you be meeting with?",
      "SECRETARY MARCO RUBIO: Well, nothing's been finalized yet. I was scheduled to be in Saudi Arabia anyways.",
      "We invited \u2013 we announced that trip a week ago, and \u2013 a week-and-a-half ago. So, ultimately, look, if at any point in time there's an opportunity to continue the work that President Trump started last week to begin to create an opening for a broader conversation, that it would involve Ukraine and would involve the end of the war, and would involve our allies all over the world, particularly in Europe, we're going to explore it, if that opportunity presents itself.",
      "I don't have any details for you this morning, other than to say that we stand ready to follow the president's lead on this and begin to explore ways, if those opportunities present itself, to begin a process towards peace.",
      "Now, a process towards peace is not a one-meeting thing. This war has been going on for a while.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Right.",
      "SECRETARY MARCO RUBIO: It's difficult. It's complicated. It's been bloody. It's been costly. So it will not be easy to end the conflict in this.",
      "And there are other parties at stake that have opinions on this as well. The European Union has sanctions as well. The Ukrainians are obviously fighting this war. It's their country, and they're on the front lines. So, one meeting isn't going to solve it.",
      "But I want to reiterate the president made clear he wants to end this war, and if opportunities present themselves to further that, we're going to take them if they present themselves. We'll see what happens over the next few days.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: But, to be clear, Keith Kellogg, who is the envoy appointed to help with these talks, says these are going to be parallel negotiations, meaning the Ukrainians and Russians aren't talking to each other yet.",
      "When you meet with your Russian counterpart, whoever that is, are you going to be sitting there arguing Ukraine's position?",
      "SECRETARY MARCO RUBIO: Well, first of all, I think that we have to understand is, right now, there is no process.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Right.",
      "SECRETARY MARCO RUBIO: What \u2013 what we have right now is a call between Putin and President Trump in which both sides expressed an interest in ending this conflict.",
      "I imagine there will be follow-up conversations to figure out what a process to talk about that would look like. And then, at that point, perhaps we can begin to share more details. So it's a bit premature. I know there's been a lot of reaction to it, because there's been no conversation about it, any serious conversation.",
      "But I want to go back to the point I made. President Trump ran. He was very clear. He thinks this war needs to end. And if he sees an opportunity to end it, which is what he's looking for, whether there is an opportunity or not, we're going to pursue it.",
      "Ultimately, it will reach a point when you are \u2013 if it's real negotiations, and we're not there yet, but if that were to happen, Ukraine will have to be involved, because they're the one that were invaded, and the Europeans will have to be involved because they're the \u2013 they have sanctions on Putin and Russia as well, and \u2013 and they've contributed to this effort.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Yes.",
      "SECRETARY MARCO RUBIO: We're just not there yet. We really aren't, but hopefully we will be, because we'd all like to see this war end.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: No doubt.",
      "The last administration did have contact through the intelligence agencies with Russia, but they didn't believe there was any proof that Vladimir Putin was interested in talks. You know the history with Vladimir Putin. He likes to use diplomacy as a cover to distract while he continues to wage war.",
      "Do you trust that this time is different?",
      "SECRETARY MARCO RUBIO: Yes, I don't think, in geopolitics, anyone should trust anyone. I think these things have to be verified through actions.",
      "I said yesterday that peace is not a noun. It's a verb. It's an action. You have to take concrete steps towards it. What I can tell you is, I know of no better negotiator in American politics than President Trump.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Yes.",
      "SECRETARY MARCO RUBIO: I don't \u2013 I think President Trump will know very quickly whether to say, is this a real thing or whether this is an effort to buy time.",
      "But I don't want to prejudge that. I don't want to foreclose the opportunity to end a conflict that's already cost the lives of hundreds of thousands and continues every single day to be increasingly a war of attrition on both sides.",
      "I think everyone should be celebrating the fact that we have an American president that is seeking to promote peace in the world, not start wars, but end them, in a way that's enduring.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Right.",
      "SECRETARY MARCO RUBIO: That's something we should be happy about. Whether it's possible or not, we're certainly willing, but it's not entirely up to us, obviously, but we'll find out.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Well, you did speak in a phone call with Russia's top diplomat, Sergey Lavrov. The Russian side claimed that you discussed restoring trade, which seemed to be a nod to sanctions, easing restrictions on diplomats, and other gestures like a high-level leaders meeting.",
      "Are you actually considering, is the Trump administration considering lifting sanctions on Russia?",
      "SECRETARY MARCO RUBIO: Well, the phone call was to establish communications that are consistent with the call the president made last week with Vladimir Putin, because if we are \u2013 if there is going to be the possibility of \u2013 of progress here towards peace, we are going to need to talk to the Russians.",
      "I mean, that is going to have to happen, and we're going to have to be able to be able to do it across our channels.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: About lifting sanctions, though?",
      "SECRETARY MARCO RUBIO: I also raised in that conversation concerns that \u2013 well, we didn't go into any details.",
      "I mean, what we just discussed is basically the ability to begin communicating. I had never spoken to Mr. Lavrov in my life, so it was an opportunity for us to begin to open that channel of communication, which, again, if there's the potential for peace here, that's a channel that has to exist.",
      "But let me add one more thing. I also raised the issue of our embassy in Moscow, which operates under very difficult conditions. I raised that because it's important. It's going to be very difficult to engage in communication with Russia about anything if our embassy is not functioning. And he raised concerns about his diplomatic mission in the United States.",
      "So, at a very basic level, if, in fact, there is going to be an opportunity here to pursue peace by engaging with the Russians, we're going to need to have functional embassies in Moscow and in Washington, D.C., and that's certainly something foreign ministers would talk about as a matter of normal course.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: I want to ask you about what happened in Munich, Germany, at the Security Conference.",
      "Vice President Vance gave a speech, and he told U.S. allies that the threat he worries about the most is not Russia. It is not China. He called it the threat from within, and he lectured about what he described as censorship, mainly focusing, though, on including more views from the right.",
      "He also met with the leader of a far-right party known as the AfD, which, as you know, is under investigation and monitoring by German intelligence because of extremism. What did all of this accomplish, other than irritating our allies?",
      "SECRETARY MARCO RUBIO: Why would our allies or anybody be irritated by free speech and by someone giving their opinion?",
      "We are, after all, democracies. The Munich \u2013 Munich Security Conference is largely a conference of democracies, in which one of the things that we cherish and value is the ability to speak freely and provide your opinions.",
      "And so I think if anyone's angry about his words, they don't have to agree with him, but to be angry about it, I think, actually makes his point. I thought it was actually a pretty historic speech. Whether you agree with him or not, I think the valid points he's making to Europe is, we are concerned that the true values that we share, the values that bind us together with Europe are things like free speech and democracy and our shared history in winning two World Wars and defeating Soviet communism and the like.",
      "These are the values that we shared in common. And, in that Cold War, we fought against things like censorship and oppression and so forth.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Right.",
      "SECRETARY MARCO RUBIO: And when you see backsliding, and you raise that, that's a very valid concern.",
      "We can't tell them how to run their countries. We are \u2013 he simply expressed in a speech his view of it, which a lot of people, frankly, share. And I thought he said a lot of things in that speech that needed to be said. And, honestly, I don't know why anybody would be upset about it.",
      "People are allowed \u2013 you know, you don't have to agree on someone's speech. I happen to agree with a lot of what he said, but you don't have to agree with someone's speech to \u2013 to at least appreciate the fact they have a right to say it and that you should listen to it and see whether those criticisms are valid.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Yes.",
      "SECRETARY MARCO RUBIO: I assure you, the United States has come under withering criticism on many occasions from many leaders in Europe, and we don't go around throwing temper tantrums about it.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Well, he was standing in a country where free speech was weaponized to conduct a genocide.",
      "And he met with the head of a political party that has far right views and some historic ties to extreme groups. The context of that was changing the tone of it. And you know that, that the censorship was specifically about the right.",
      "SECRETARY MARCO RUBIO: Well, I have to disagree with you. No, I have \u2013 I have to disagree with you.",
      "Free speech was not used to conduct a genocide. The genocide was conducted by an authoritarian Nazi regime that happened to also be genocidal because they hated Jews and they hated minorities and they hated those that they \u2013 they had a list of people they hated, but primarily the Jews. There was no free speech in Nazi Germany. There was none.",
      "There was also no opposition in Nazi Germany. They were a sole and only party that governed that country. So that's not an accurate reflection of history.",
      "I also think it's wrong \u2013 again, I go back to the point of his speech. The point of his speech was basically that there is an erosion in free speech and intolerance for opposing points of view within Europe, and that's of concern, because that is eroding. That's not an erosion of your military capabilities. That's not an erosion of your economic standing.",
      "That's an erosion of the actual values that bind us together in this transatlantic union that everybody talks about. And I think allies and friends and partners that have worked together now for 80 years should be able to speak frankly to one another in open forums without being offended, insulted, or upset.",
      "And I spoke to Foreign Ministers from multiple countries throughout Europe. Many of them probably didn't like the speech or didn't agree with it, but they were continuing to engage with us on all sorts of issues that unite us.",
      "So, again, at the end of the day, I think that, you know, people give all - - that is a forum in which you're supposed to be inviting people to give speeches, not basically a chorus where everyone is saying the exact same thing. That's not always going to be the case when it's a collection of democracies where leaders have the right and the privilege to speak their minds in forums such as these.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Mr. Secretary, I'm told that we are out of time. A lot to get through with you. We appreciate you making time today.",
      "SECRETARY MARCO RUBIO: Yes.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: We'll be back in a minute.",

      "KEVIN HASSETT (Director, National Economic Council): Good morning, Margaret. Good morning.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: So, I don't have to tell you, but the rest of the country saw their egg prices at the grocery store go up. We're now at a record high due to that bird flu outbreak, but also labor costs, and that's contributing to food costs overall.",
      "When will the administration get that outbreak under control?",

      "Well, what's going on, right, as you know, is that there is an inflation problem that's very large. We saw the Consumer Price Index come out, and we found out that the stagflation that was created by the policies of President Biden was way worse than we thought.",
      "Over the last three months, across all goods, including eggs, the average inflation rate was 4.6 percent, way above target, and an acceleration at the end of the Biden term.",
      "And, you know, this is really not just us. You could go look at Jason Furman, Larry Summers, economic advisers of President Biden kept saying, don't do this. You're going to cause massive inflation. In fact, Jason Furman has a very thought-provoking peace in \"Foreign Affairs\" right now calling the Biden economic record a tragedy.",
      "And this is them, not us, right? It's \u2013 so, now we've got a lot of things that we're doing to get ahold of it.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: You're talking about fiscal spending there.",
      "KEVIN HASSETT: Excuse me. Yes, that's right.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: You were talking about fiscal spending there. But\u2026",
      "KEVIN HASSETT: Well, where does inflation come from, right? And so what we're doing now is, we've \u2013 we've got, really, a multi-multi-faceted plan to end inflation.",
      "And I will go quickly, because I want to end with what we're doing with egg prices. But we're going to have a macroeconomic change that has supply-side tax cuts, so we have more supply, and we're going to reduce government spending, both through what DOGE is doing, and through congressional action.",
      "And so, therefore, the macroeconomic forces that Jason Furman said were a tragedy are going to be reversed. That's a good thing. Then we're also going to have a lot of energy production, a lot of deregulation. And then, finally, when needed, we're going to focus on the individual thing-by-thing pieces.",
      "And so, for example, you mentioned avian flu. President Biden didn't really have a plan for avian flu. Well, Brooke Rollins and I have been working with all the best people in government, including academics around the country and around the world, to have a plan ready for the president next week on what we're going to do with avian flu.",
      "In fact, I was editing the thing with them tomorrow. But \u2013 but the final thing \u2013 and then I will give it back to you. I promise not to filibuster.",
      "(LAUGHTER)",
      "KEVIN HASSETT: The question is, like, why did we do this? Why did we do this? That's what everybody's talking about.",
      "But the thing that I always start with when I'm looking at what we're doing, what the president wants us to do, is, why did they do that? Why did they do that?",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Right. Right.",
      "KEVIN HASSETT: And \u2013 and there are too many times where it feels like nobody thought about that in the press, or maybe\u2026",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Oh, gosh.",
      "KEVIN HASSETT: \u2026 the left wing economists. Why did they do that? Why did Biden print so much money and cause so much inflation? Why did he do it?",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Oh, Kevin.",
      "KEVIN HASSETT: That's \u2013 that's what I'm thinking about.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Kevin, you know, we talked about that on Face the Nation quite a lot. Quite a lot.",
      "KEVIN HASSETT: I don't want \u2013 mean to criticize you. OK, good for you.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: No, no, no.",
      "KEVIN HASSETT: Yes.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: So, next week, we'll see the plan on how to get avian flu \u2013 how to get bird flu, under\u2026",
      "KEVIN HASSETT: I could talk about it right now if you'd like to, yes.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Well, sure. What \u2013 what is the plan? Are you going to - - what are you going to do?",
      "KEVIN HASSETT: Yes, so \u2013 so, again, the \u2013 the Biden plan was to just, you know, kill chickens. And they spent billions of dollars just randomly killing chickens within a perimeter where they found a sick chicken.",
      "And so you go \u2013 I just went to the grocery store. I shop for our family, in part because I love to look at prices. And there were no eggs at the store yesterday, just a few. And \u2013 and so that happened because they killed all the chickens.",
      "And so what we need to do is have better ways, with biosecurity and medication and so on, to make sure that the perimeter doesn't have to kill the chickens, have a better, smarter perimeter. And so having a smart perimeter is what we're working on. And we're finalizing the ideas about how to do that with the best scientists in government.",
      "And that's the kind of thing that should have happened a year ago. And if it had, then egg prices would be, you know, a lot better than they are now.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: OK.",
      "KEVIN HASSETT: But the avian flu is a real thing.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Yes.",
      "KEVIN HASSETT: And, by the way, it's spread mostly by ducks and geese. And so think about it. They're killing chickens to stop the spread, but chickens don't really fly. The \u2013 the spread is happening from the geese and the ducks.",
      "And so why does it make any sense to have a big perimeter of dead chickens, when it's the \u2013 the ducks and the geese that are spreading it?",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Well, the Department of Agriculture policy has been to kill those chickens, as you know.",
      "KEVIN HASSETT: Right.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: But we'll watch the details of that.",
      "KEVIN HASSETT: Sure.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: But let's get back to something the president said.",
      "Higher interest rates, as you know, are part of that battle against inflation that the Federal Reserve has been waging. But, this past week, the president called for interest rates to be lowered. Why does he think that's going to lower your grocery prices?",
      "KEVIN HASSETT: Well, first of all, I \u2013 I want to say that I, just this weekend, have arranged to begin once again regular lunches with Jay Powell at the Federal Reserve.",
      "And Jay and I have a long and collegial relationship. And I'm going to go over there with him and the other governors. So we're going to talk about our views about what's going on, and listen to his. And that collegiality has been going on for four years when I was here before, and the president very much values that.",
      "I think that the \u2013 the thing about\u2026",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: But that's not to influence?",
      "KEVIN HASSETT: \u2026 lower interest rates \u2013 no, I'm going to talk about \u2013 well, Jay is going to \u2013 Jay is an independent person.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Right.",
      "KEVIN HASSETT: The Fed independence is respected. And \u2013 and the point is, the president's opinion is also \u2013 can be heard. He's the president of the United States.",
      "But here's the thing that I think is interesting, that if we get inflation under control, then that takes the pressure off the Fed. And one way to tell whether markets think, are we getting inflation under control, is to look at longer-term interest rates that the Fed doesn't affect directly.",
      "And if you look at it, the 10-year Treasury rate has dropped about 40 basis points\u2026",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Yes.",
      "KEVIN HASSETT: \u2026 over the last couple of weeks while we announced our plan to control inflation.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Well\u2026",
      "KEVIN HASSETT: That saved the American people about $40 billion, about $40 billion, just from talking about the stuff that we're about to do.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: OK.",
      "KEVIN HASSETT: That's pretty good.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Right, but the president's statement contradicts economic policy. As you know\u2026",
      "KEVIN HASSETT: No. Inflation \u2013 no. Inflation rates are already \u2013 I'm saying the interest rates are already lower by 40 basis points. So, Interest rates are lower. The one that matters\u2026",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: You're briefing the president on it. OK.",
      "KEVIN HASSETT: \u2026 the most for the economy is maybe the 5- or 10- year rate.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: But on\u2026",
      "KEVIN HASSETT: Those the ones that matter the most. And those are down already. So the president's right about that.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Before we run out of time, I really want to make sure I get to you on tariffs.",
      "KEVIN HASSETT: OK, sure.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Because there's concern that that will add to prices.",
      "KEVIN HASSETT: Sure.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Because they'll be added on to consumers and what they pay.",
      "How are these reciprocal tariffs going to work? The president was tweeting he wants to put them on, like, 175 different countries that have a VAT tax, a value-added tax.",
      "KEVIN HASSETT: You know, we're talking to leaders of other countries all the time.",
      "Last night, into the wee hours of their morning and kind of a late night for me, I was talking to Minister Reynolds from the U.K. about this very matter. But here's the way I would like to think about it, that, right now, U.S. companies are spending \u2013 are paying foreign governments about $370 billion a year in tax, and foreign companies are paying the U.S. government about $57 billion in tax.",
      "And a lot of it is because of the VAT. But if we didn't have to pay the foreign governments tax, over 10 years, it'd be about $5 trillion of tax that U.S. citizens don't have to pay. That would more than pay for the tax cuts that we're debating right now.",
      "And so if we get some of that money back, either through tariffs, or for \u2013 obviously, if they reduce the tariffs of that, then that's good for Americans. It's going to put more money in their pockets.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Yes.",
      "KEVIN HASSETT: And \u2013 and that's what President Trump is \u2013 is trying to do.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Kevin Hassett, I would like to have you come back, sit at the table\u2026",
      "KEVIN HASSETT: Always.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: \u2026 and talk through this in \u2013 in more detail at another time. We have to leave it there for today.",
      "KEVIN HASSETT: Thanks. Happy \u2013 happy to be here.",

      "The Munich Security Conference is an annual gathering of heads of state and international security policymakers. It's one of the biggest conferences. And one of the biggest topics this year was the war in Ukraine.",
      "We spoke to two lawmakers earlier from Munich, including House Intelligence Committee Republican Dan Crenshaw. We asked him about President Zelenskyy's views regarding what's needed in a potential peace deal.",
      "(BEGIN VT)",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: I understand that he has asked not just for continued military support now, but security assurances in the event of a peace deal. What can you tell him about what to expect from America?",
      "REPRESENTATIVE DAN CRENSHAW (R-TX): Well, I just - I just came from a lunch where General Kellogg spoke. He's the special envoy leading this effort to establish peace. And he's very clear that the kind of peace we're talking about is a lasting peace, which, of course, involves security assurances.",
      "And part of that process is figuring out exactly what that means. Even the Ukrainians are talking about what that means. There's a variety of options, per se.",
      "I think the Europeans have to play a huge role in that. One of the things that gets talked about a lot is where do - European forces actually acting as a peacekeeping force.",
      "The Ukrainians clearly have a seat at the table and then the United States will be the intermediary as we try to establish a peace deal.",
      "But the Europeans need to demand a seat at the table by being uncomfortably aggressive, which is something they haven't done. You should be threatening things to Putin that actually make you uncomfortable because that's how - that's the only language Putin speaks is power. And when General Kellogg is at that table with Putin, he's only got a finite amount of leverage. And there's only so much more leverage that the U.S. can - can impose. And if anybody can do it, I think it's Donald Trump. And he's already - he's already said that, that nothing is off the table. Vice President Vance said that, nothing is off the table, economic, military. They will use the amount of leverage they can.",
      "My message to European leaders is, if we want to win, if we want a better outcome for Ukraine at the end of these peace talks, you need to be uncomfortably aggressive. You need to, not just bolster your own defense spending, I mean because that's a long-term issue, that's a long-term investment -",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Yes.",
      "REPRESENTATIVE DAN CRENSHAW: You need to be talking about where you're going to be putting actual troops on the ground. Stop following our lead and actually take the lead. Let us be actually holding you back. That would be an ideal situation and vastly change the power dynamic when dealing with Putin.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: There already is a military security alliance known as NATO. You are saying you think there should be something else or some other entity providing security assurances for Ukraine?",
      "REPRESENTATIVE DAN CRENSHAW: European soldiers. I mean, look, Europeans send aid, right? They send weapons. They do the same things we do. They - they - they match it, barely. My argument to them is you shouldn't be matching it, you should be doubling it. You should be tripling it. It's your continent.",
      "Zelenskyy had a - gave a speech today. He talked about a European army, right? So, there's - there's a lot of talk about this. Of course, there's NATO. That's - that's a security - that's a - that's a defensive alliance.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Right.",
      "REPRESENTATIVE DAN CRENSHAW: That's - that's - that's some - that's not an army. That's - they did this - we're talking about different things here.",
      "The Europeans need to come together, in my opinion, and have just a much stronger message towards Putin instead of finger wagging at us about what we're willing to give or not give in a peace deal.",
      "Again, I tell them, look, if you want a seat at the table, earn it. The Ukrainians have earned it. The Ukrainians have impressed everybody for the last three years. They've fought valiantly and courageously. They've earned my respect. They earned that seat at the table. We need to listen to their - to what they want. We listened to Zelenskyy.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: OK. You said that both President Trump and Vice President Vance were clear, nothing is off the table. However, the defense secretary, Pete Hegseth, did seem, in Brussels, to take things quite explicitly off the table. He said the U.S. does not want Ukraine in NATO and that Ukraine would not return to its pre-2014 borders, which acknowledges giving up some of Crimea and potentially the east.",
      "Do you think offering concessions before negotiations begin is a good strategy here?",
      "REPRESENTATIVE DAN CRENSHAW: Yes, the - I think you have to listen to the White House as a whole. They walked - they walked those back and -",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Yes.",
      "REPRESENTATIVE DAN CRENSHAW: And - and made it clear that nothing is off the - nothing is off the table. So, no, you walk into a negotiation with everything on the table and I think that's exactly what this White House is doing.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Yes.",
      "REPRESENTATIVE DAN CRENSHAW: It's less than a month since this administration has been in power and they want to move fast. And everybody's a little nervous. But I think they should be much more optimistic than they should be nervous.",
      "You needed a seismic shift here. This was not a sustainable operation in Ukraine. If Kamala Harris had been president, you'd be going along the same lines, which is basically funding this war until every Ukrainian is dead. That's not an end that we can accept.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: So -",
      "REPRESENTATIVE DAN CRENSHAW: There has to be some talk of negotiation. And I'll remind the American people, too, from our perspective, from American strategic deterrent's perspective, even getting Putin to that table to talk about an end to the war is -",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Yes.",
      "REPRESENTATIVE DAN CRENSHAW: Is a massive strategic win for us because it establishes back our deterrents over time.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Well, do you know that he is actually committing to come to the table? We don't have a commitment to actually negotiate from Vladimir Putin.",
      "REPRESENTATIVE DAN CRENSHAW: No, we don't.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: OK.",
      "REPRESENTATIVE DAN CRENSHAW: You know what would be really helpful? What I said before, if the EU was uncomfortably aggressive about it.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: OK. Got it.",
      "REPRESENTATIVE DAN CRENSHAW: Again, Putin only responds to power. And this is - this is what I remind western leaders here, too. Western - westerners don't speak that language. Westerns talk about negotiations and, you know, and good moral values that we share and we believe each other.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Yes.",
      "REPRESENTATIVE DAN CRENSHAW: That's not how the east works. They only respond to power.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: So, OK, on that point, Vladimir Putin, it sounds like you would agree, is an accused war criminal. He is a dictator. There is a warrant out for his arrest, as you know. He invaded Ukraine. He is clearly a U.S. adversary.",
      "But this past week President Trump said he'd love to have Putin back in the G-8, which would make him, again, a peer global leader. President Trump floated inviting him to the U.S. or even visiting Russia himself. Do you think any of that is appropriate?",
      "REPRESENTATIVE DAN CRENSHAW: It's more appropriate than not talking to him for the last two years, which is what President Biden did. Who did that help? It hasn't - it hasn't gotten us anywhere.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Talking is different than inviting him to the United States.",
      "REPRESENTATIVE DAN CRENSHAW: Right. Sure. I mean, you can parse it out however you like. But the reality is, is you're going to have to get him to the table somehow, right? And there's a carrot and a stick approach. Trump can use a lot - can use a lot of leverage. And then the Europeans can use a lot more leverage. But you also have that carrot approach. And Trump is good at that. He's good at flattering people in order to get them to the table. That is what we need. Whether we like it or not, that's what we need.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: But flattering a very brutal dictator who is pretty cunning, frankly, you really think that's a winning strategy?",
      "REPRESENTATIVE DAN CRENSHAW: I mean, he's not that cunning. He's fought a - it was a war that has destroyed his society, killed hundreds of thousands of Russians. He's made a massive mistake and miscalculation. He's not - he's not as clever as maybe we are giving him credit for.",
      "I think let Trump do his campaign promise and play this out. Look, nobody is going to take advantage of Donald Trump. And General Kellogg made that very clear because that was a question Europeans asked him, you know, are we - are you going to sell out just to get a deal, just to get a deal because of the campaign promise. Kellogg just laughed at that. He's like, there is no way. There is absolutely no way that Donald Trump will be seen - he will not let himself go down in history as having sold out to Putin. He will not let that happen. He believes - just for the sake of his own legacy.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Right.",
      "REPRESENTATIVE DAN CRENSHAW: But he does care about lasting peace here and lasting European peace.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: But I think you know some of the things Europeans point to is the fact that the United States cut out our allied government in Afghanistan from the negotiation Donald Trump cut with the Taliban. They point back to that and say, don't do this again.",
      "REPRESENTATIVE DAN CRENSHAW: Sure. And I criticized that decision, too.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: OK.",
      "REPRESENTATIVE DAN CRENSHAW: But that's just not what's happening now. This is a vastly different situation. I mean Europeans have all sorts of opinions. The Ukrainians, I think, are very optimistic, as they should be. We've had some very good conversations. Some very realistic conversations. And I'm very excite and optimistic about what can happen here.",

      "(BEGIN VT)",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: In terms of negotiations, there were some comments made by President Trump this week. The defense secretary said returning to Ukraine's pre-2014 borders is unrealistic. He's suggesting that maybe the east and another part of Ukraine and Crimea will be taken by Russia. Why do you think there was this plan to give concessions before talks begin?",
      "SENATOR JEANNE SHAHEEN (D-NH): Well, I think it was a mixed message coming from the administration. On the one hand you heard Secretary Hegseth saying they were going to take NATO off the table, that Ukraine needed to give up territory, and on the other hand you had Vice President Vance saying that everything should be on the table, including the possibility of putting boots on the ground in Ukraine.",
      "So, it's a mixed message. I hope that the upshot of that is that we are going to do everything we can to support Ukraine.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: In terms of what Congress can do, are your hands tied here or are some of your Republican colleagues willing to put something, perhaps, in an upcoming defense bill, for example, that might help Ukraine?",
      "SENATOR JEANNE SHAHEEN: Well, I think that's one option. One of the things that we're talking about doing right away is making some statements on the - the repossession of assets by Russia that are held in the United States and in Europe and the importance of having those assets go to Ukraine to help both with the execution of the military conflict, but also to think about rebuilding.",
      "Again, there's bipartisan support. There was bipartisan support for the bill and there's bipartisan support to continue to try and ensure that those assets from Russia get repaid to Ukraine because Russia is really the aggressor here and we need to hold Vladimir Putin accountable.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: You know, your Republican counterpart, Roger Wicker, he is the chair of the Armed Services Committee, was really sharp in his comments at Munich. He was saying, he was puzzled, he was disturbed by what the defense secretary, a member of his own party, had said about Ukraine. He was very clear that what Vladimir Putin is doing, he said, is absolutely out of Adolf Hitler's playbook. Those are sharp words considering the president of the United States says he wants to meet face-to-face to Vladimir Putin and possibly bring him to the White House.",
      "SENATOR JEANNE SHAHEEN: Well, they are sharp words and they are very much justified. Regardless of what President Trump may be doing to try and lay the groundwork for any future negotiations, the fact is there is strong bipartisan support in Congress to help Ukraine in this unfair war that Russia has initiated. And I think Senator Wicker's comments are very important.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: At the conference you're at, you were able to speak with European leaders. What are they saying to you about their view of America now?",
      "SENATOR JEANNE SHAHEEN: Well, we had a chance to meet with representatives from Britain, from Canada, not a European country but also very concerned about Ukraine, with people from the Balkan countries, with President Zelenskyy, obviously. And there is a great deal of concern about the U.S. position on Ukraine.",
      "At the panel that we had with President Zelenskyy, we talked about the importance of Europe and the United States acting in concert so that we can hold Putin accountable with sanctions so that we can - so that there is no daylight between the United States and our NATO allies and our European allies. Clearly that's what Vladimir Putin has been trying to do throughout this conflict, and we need to make it clear that that is not going to happen, that we are going to work together, and we are going to support Ukraine.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Does Congress need to be any part of approving this deal President Trump says he wants to take possession of some of the critical minerals that Ukraine has inside their territory? He says he wants to use that as sort of repayment for what the U.S. has spent on weapons.",
      "SENATOR JEANNE SHAHEEN: Well, I think there are some benefits to having the United States have some investments in Ukraine. That's part of what a critical minerals deal would do. It's not at all clear who - who has possession of those critical minerals. Some of them are in the eastern part of Ukraine where Russia controls the territory. Some of them are owned by private - actually oligarchs. There are several oligarchs who own a number of those critical mineral sites. So, I think those are details that have not yet been worked out and I have not seen the agreement that's been put in front of President Zelenskyy.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Well, we know Zelenskyy will be discussing that with other members of the administration. We'll stay tuned on that. But I do want to bring up something that we -",

      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Sorry. Go ahead.",
      "SENATOR JEANNE SHAHEEN: One of the things that, in our conversations with President Zelenskyy, President Zelenskyy reiterated nothing about Ukraine without Ukraine.

In her resignation letter, Danielle Sassoon, the acting U.S. attorney overseeing the case, said a dismissal amounted to a quid pro quo and that the DOJ, quote, \"proposes dismissing the charges against Adams in return for his assistance in enforcing the federal immigration laws.\"",
      "In response, then Acting Deputy Attorney General Emil Bove threatened her with an investigation into her conduct.",
      "Joining us now is Maryland Democrat Jamie Raskin. He's the top Democrat on the House Judiciary Committee.",

      "REPRESENTATIVE JAMIE RASKIN (D-MD): Well, the Justice Department is at war with its own attorneys, its own prosecutors. And the whole episode is just saturated with corruption. It was a corruption prosecution and investigation, which led to a grand jury indictment against Eric Adams for bribery, conspiracy, other corruption charges. And then the new Department of Justice decided to squash the whole thing, basically saying to Adams, well, we will drop this case against you if you engage in certain kinds of political or policy accommodations with us.",
      "And then, in order to complete that deeply corrupt bargain, they had to try to coerce their own lawyers to do it. But, of course, the prosecutors were saying, nothing has changed in the facts of the case and nothing has changed in the law. In fact, additional evidence was found, meaning that they were going to revise and expand the original indictment, but instead they were told to kill it for political reasons.",
      "And so, you know, this is an outrageous violation of the rules of prosecutors and an offense against due process in a very dangerous first move for the Department of Justice to be making under the Trump people.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Mayor Adams, of course, claims there was no quid pro quo and that none of this was wrong, but there was the lead prosecutor, as well, on this case who resigned in objection to what's happening. But it's moving forward here. This is all now in the hands of a judge. Does he have leeway to prosecute?",
      "REPRESENTATIVE JAMIE RASKIN: So, first of all, just about Danielle Sassoon. I mean that's a very conservative U.S. attorney, and she couldn't take it. I mean you have the most conservative prosecutors in the country resigning in opposition to this steam roller on behalf of corruption. But it's not over yet because Judge Dale Ho does not have to accept the withdrawal of the charges, the dismissal of the charges, which seven Department of Justice attorneys resigned rather than be involved in. The head of the public integrity section, the head of the criminal division, five other lawyers said, no way, and they wrote very stinging rebukes of the attorney general and the Department of Justice in this case.",
      "So, Judge Ho has to accept this dismissal, but he may not. He may go ahead and try to appoint another prosecutor to go ahead and, you know, go through with the indictment that was handed down by a grand jury.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Well, Attorney General Bondi says there's nothing wrong here, saying it was President Biden's weaponized DOJ that went after Adams for political reasons, and only after he criticized President Biden's immigration policies.",
      "This is a fellow Democrat. Do you think he should be prosecuted? And how do you respond to that allegation?",
      "REPRESENTATIVE JAMIE RASKIN: Well, first of all, the attorney general did not cite any changes in the facts of the case. She did not cite any changes in the law, because neither occurred, nor did she cite any irregularities in the investigation or the prosecution.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: She's saying it's all made up.",
      "REPRESENTATIVE JAMIE RASKIN: Well, then she's - she's mimicking her boss then, who just lies as a matter of course. One would expect more from the attorney general of the United States.",
      "And, you know, this whole corruption attack that is an attack on the Department of Justice for engaging in corruption prosecutions could be impeachable in a different political environment. But the fact that Mayor Adams is a Democrat is neither here nor there for me. I'm against corruption across the board. It seems like Donald Trump wants to attract all of the corrupt politicians in America to his side.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: So in the Oval Office President Trump - you may have seen this image - he has hung a picture, a framed picture of the front page of \"The New York Post,\" that has his mugshot in it from that criminal case in New York. Yesterday he also tweeted, \"he who saves his country does not violate any law.\"",
      "He seems to believe that all those prosecutions against him were politically motivated and voters apparently didn't think it mattered. He was elected with a mandate. How do you convince the public that it does matter?",
      "REPRESENTATIVE JAMIE RASKIN: The dominant objective of this administration is corruption and lawlessness. The first thing that they did was they sacked 17 inspectors general. Those are the people who are actual corruption fighters within the departments and agencies. These are the people who ferreted out $91 billion worth of waste, fraud and abuse in the government.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: They argue it's within their political power to do so.",
      "REPRESENTATIVE JAMIE RASKIN: Oh, it - there's no doubt it is, but they sacked them. Actually, it's not within their political power to do so in a lawless way. They have to notify Congress first, 30 days in advance, and they have to set forth the specific reasons for why an inspector general is being fired. They never did that.",
      "And the reason, of course, is because they want to pursue agendas of corruption across the board. They're saying they're not going to enforce the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act. They are shutting down the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau, which has saved American consumers $31 million in bank overdraft charges, credit card late fees from corporations completely inflated and having nothing to do with the actual charges and so on. They're getting rid of anything in the government that supports consumers, that supports citizens against the rip-off artists who are their friends.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: And there's little Democrats can do to push back because you don't have any political power.",
      "REPRESENTATIVE JAMIE RASKIN: Well, we're winning in court. More than a dozen federal injunctions and temporary restraining orders have been issued against everything from their illegal seizure of computer data and every Americans' private data at the Treasury Department.",

      "Last week, Acting Deputy Attorney General Emil Bove sent a memo that instructed prosecutors in Manhattan to abandon the indictment that charged Adams with\u00a0bribery, conspiracy and campaign finance violations, which he denied. Bove justified the decision by saying the case \"has unduly restricted Mayor Adams' ability to devote full attention and resources to the illegal immigration and violent crime.\" He also alleged that the prosecution was politically motivated due to Adams' criticism of the Biden administration.",
      "The directive prompted a revolt at the Justice Department that burst into public view when Danielle Sassoon, the acting head of the U.S. Attorney's Office in the Southern District of New York, resigned in protest rather than file a motion seeking to drop the case. She was soon joined by other top Justice Department officials. Different prosecutors ultimately filed a motion late Friday to abandon the charges.",
      "Sassoon alleged in her resignation letter that the Justice Department proposed dismissing the charges against Adams in return for his assistance in enforcing the federal immigration laws. Adams' attorney denied that he offered to help enact the president's deportation agenda in exchange for having his case dropped, saying the mayor's team \"offered nothing and the department asked nothing of us.\" In response to Sassoon's resignation, Bove also denied there was any quid pro quo, writing in a letter that Sassoon's allegation was \"false.\"",
      "On Sunday, Raskin said the Justice Department had to \"try to coerce their own workers\" to file the motion to drop the case, adding that \"they were told to kill it for political reasons\" although they said nothing had changed in the facts of the case.",

      "Crenshaw, speaking from the Munich Security Conference, was among a bipartisan group of lawmakers who met with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy at the annual security summit in recent days.

      "The Texas Republican said Kellogg was \"very clear that what the kind of peace we're talking about is a lasting peace,\" which he said will involve security assurances. Crenshaw said exactly what that looks like is still being determined, while arguing that Europe must be a major player.",
      "Crenshaw said European countries need to not only bolster their defense spending, but also talk about \"where you're going to be putting actual troops on the ground.\"",
      "\"Stop following our lead and actually take the lead,\" Crenshaw said. \"Let us be actually holding you back. That would be an ideal situation, and vastly change the power dynamic when dealing with Putin.\"",
      "Crenshaw argued that if European leaders want a seat at the table, they should \"earn it.\"",
      "\"We listen to Zelenskyy,\" Crenshaw said. \"And I want to listen to other European leaders as well, but I want them to be uncomfortably aggressive, because that gives us more leverage in order to help Ukraine come out with a better outcome.\"",
      "The comments come as Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth has drawn criticism even among some Republicans in recent days for suggesting it was unrealistic for Ukraine to expect NATO membership. He also cast doubt that the country will be able to return to its pre-2014 borders, before Russia first invaded Ukraine and annexed Crimea. Hegseth later walked back those comments, saying that \"everything is on the table.\"",
      "Sen. Jeanne Shaheen of New Hampshire, the ranking Democrat on the Senate Foreign Relations Committee who also appeared on \"Face the Nation\" on Sunday, said the administration is sending a \"mixed message\" on Ukraine.

      "But Crenshaw defended the White House's posture toward the possible peace talks, saying \"you have to listen to the White House as a whole,\" noting that the administration made clear that \"nothing is off the table.\"",
      "\"You walk into a negotiation with everything on the table. And I think that's exactly what this White House is doing,\" Crenshaw said, adding that \"there's a path forward here,\" although the details aren't yet clear.",
      "Crenshaw acknowledged that the U.S. hasn't yet received a commitment to negotiate from Putin, reiterating his request of European leaders to get \"uncomfortably aggressive\" with the Russian leader, who he said \"only responds to power.\"",

      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Last week, seven federal prosecutors resigned in objection after the Justice Department directed them to drop the investigation into New York City Mayor Eric Adams, who is facing charges including bribery and conspiracy. In her resignation letter, Danielle Sassoon, the acting U.S. Attorney overseeing the case, said a dismissal amounted to a quid pro quo, and that the DOJ, quote, \"proposes dismissing the charges against Adams in return for his assistance in enforcing the federal immigration laws.\" In response, then-acting Deputy Attorney General Emil Bove threatened her with an investigation into her conduct. Joining us now is Maryland Democrat Jamie Raskin. He is the top Democrat on the House Judiciary Committee. This episode is highly unusual. Is there anything that you in your role can do about this episode and what's happening inside Attorney General Bondi's Justice Department?",
      "REP. JAMIE RASKIN: Well, the Justice Department is at war with its own attorneys, its own prosecutors, and the whole episode is just saturated with corruption. It was a corrupt- corruption prosecution and investigation which led to a grand jury indictment against Eric Adams for bribery, conspiracy, other corruption charges, and then the new Department of Justice decided to squash the whole thing, basically saying to Adams, well, we will drop this case against you if you engage in certain kinds of political or policy accommodations with us.

      "MARGARET BRENNAN: We want to turn now to the economy and inflation, which, compared to last January, ticked up about 3% last week. Kevin Hassett is the director of the National Economic Council, and he joins us now. Good morning to you, Director.",
      "KEVIN HASSETT, DIRECTOR, NATIONAL ECONOMIC COUNCIL: Good morning, Margaret, good morning.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: So, I don't have to tell you, but the rest of the country saw their egg prices at the grocery store go up. We're now at a record high due to that bird flu outbreak, but also labor costs, and that's contributing to food costs overall. When will the administration get that outbreak under control?",
      "HASSETT: Right, well, what's going on, right, as you know, is that there is an inflation problem that's very large. We saw the consumer price index come out, and we found out that the stagflation that was created by the policies of President Biden was way worse than we thought. Over the last three months, across all goods, including eggs, the average inflation rate was 4.6%, way above target, and an acceleration at the end of the Biden term. And, you know, this is really not just us. You could go look at Jason Furman, Larry Summers, economic advisers of President Biden kept saying, don't do this. You're going to cause massive inflation. In fact, Jason Furman has a very thought provoking peace in \"Foreign Affairs\" right now, calling the Biden economic record a tragedy. And this is them, not us, right? It's- so, now we've got a lot of things that we're doing to get ahold of it--",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: You're talking about fiscal spending there.",
      "HASSETT: Excuse me? Yeah, that's right.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: You were talking about fiscal spending there. But--",
      "HASSETT: Well, where does inflation come from, right? And so what we're doing now is, we've- we've got, really, a multi- multi-faceted plan to end inflation, and I'll go quickly, because I want to end with what we're doing with egg prices, but we're going to have a macroeconomic change that has supply side tax cuts so we have more supply, and we're going to reduce government spending, both through what DOGE is doing, and through congressional action. And so therefore, the macroeconomic forces that Jason Furman said were a tragedy are going to be reversed. That's a good thing. Then we're also going to have a lot of energy production, a lot of deregulation. And then finally, when needed, we're going to focus on the individual thing-by-thing pieces. And so, for example, you mentioned avian flu. President Biden didn't really have a plan for avian flu. Well, Brooke Rollins and I have been working with all the best people in government, including academics around the country and around the world, to have a plan ready for the president next week on what we're going to do with avian flu. In fact, I was editing the thing with them tomorrow, but- but the final thing- and then I'll give it back to you, I promise not to filibuster- that, the question is like, why did we do this? Why did we do this? That's what everybody's talking about. But the thing that I always start with when I'm looking at what we're doing, what the President wants us to do, is, why did they do that? Why did they do that? And- and there are too many times where it feels like nobody thought about that in the press, or maybe--",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Oh, gosh--",
      "HASSET: --the left wing \"Economist,\" why did they do that? Why did Biden print so much money and cause so much inflation? Why did he do it?",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Oh, Kevin--",
      "HASSETT: That's- that's what I'm thinking about.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Kevin, you know, we talked about that on \"Face the Nation\" quite a lot. Quite a lot.",
      "HASSETT: I don't mean to criticize you. Okay, good for you.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN:\u00a0 No, no, no. So next week, we'll see the plan on how to get avian flu- how to get bird flu, under--",
      "HASSETT: I could talk about it right now if you'd like to, yes.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: --well, sure, what- what is the plan you're going to- what are you going to do?",
      "HASSETT: Yeah, so- so again, the- the Biden plan was to just, you know, kill chickens, and they spent billions of dollars just randomly killing chickens within a perimeter where they found a sick chicken. And so you go- I just went to the grocery store. I shop for our family, in part because I love to look at prices. And there were no eggs at the store yesterday, just a few. And- and so that happened because they killed all the chickens. And so what we need to do is have better ways, with biosecurity and medication and so on, to make sure that the perimeter doesn't have to kill the chickens. Have a better, smarter perimeter. And so having a smart perimeter is what we're working on, and we're finalizing the ideas about how to do that with the best scientists in government. And that's the kind of thing that should have happened a year ago, and if it had, then egg prices would be, you know, a lot better than they are now. But the avian flu is a real thing--",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Yes.",
      "HASSETT: --and by the way, it's spread mostly by ducks and geese. And so- think about it, they're killing chickens to stop the spread, but chickens don't really fly. The- the spread is happening from the geese and the ducks. And so, why does it make any sense to have a big perimeter of dead chickens, when it's the- the ducks and the geese that are spreading it?",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Well, the Department of Agriculture policy has been to kill those chickens, as you know, but we'll watch the details of that. But let's get back to something the president said. Higher interest rates, as you know, are part of that battle against inflation that the Federal Reserve has been waging, but this past week, the President called for interest rates to be lowered. Why does he think that's going to lower your grocery prices?",
      "KEVIN HASSETT: Well, first of all, I- I want to say that- I, just this weekend, have arranged to begin, once again, regular lunches with Jay Powell at the Federal Reserve. And Jay and I have a long and collegial relationship, and I'm going to go over there with him and the other governors. So we're going to talk about our views about what's going on, and listen to his and that collegiality has been going on for four years when I was here before, and the President very much values that. I think that the- the thing about--",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: But that's not to influence--",
      "HASSETT: --lower interest rates, no, I'm going to talk about- well, Jay is going to- Jay is an independent person. The Fed- independence is respected. And- and the point is, the President's opinion is also- can be heard. He's the president of the United States. But here's the thing that I think is interesting, that if we get inflation under control, then that takes the pressure off the Fed. And one way to tell whether markets think, are we getting inflation under control, is to look at longer term interest rates that the Fed doesn't affect directly. And if you look at it, the 10 year treasury rate has dropped about 40 basis points over the last couple of weeks while we announced our plan to control inflation. That saved the American people about $40 billion, about $40 billion, just from talking about the stuff that we're about to do.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Okay.",
      "HASSETT: It's pretty good.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Right. But the President's statement contradicts economic policy, as you know--",
      "KEVIN HASSETT: No, inflation- no, inflation rates are already- I'm saying the interest rates are already lower by 40 basis points. So, in- interest rates are lower. The one that matters--",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: You're briefing the president on it. Okay--",
      "HASSETT: --the most for the economy is maybe the 5 or 10, year rate. Those the ones that matter the most. So those are down already. So the President's right about that.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Before we run out of time, I really want to make sure I get to you on tariffs--",
      "HASSETT: Okay, sure.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: --because there's concern that that will add to prices, because they'll be added on to consumers and what they pay. How are these reciprocal tariffs going to work? The President was tweeting he wants to put them on, like 175 different countries that have a VAT tax, a value added tax.",
      "KEVIN HASSETT: You know, we're talking to leaders of other countries all the time. Last night into the wee hours of their morning and kind of a late night for me, I was talking to Minister Reynolds from the UK about this very matter. But here's the way I'd like to think about it, that right now, U.S. companies are spending, are paying, foreign governments about $370 billion a year in tax, and foreign comp- companies are paying the U.S. government about $57 billion in tax, and a lot of it is because of the VAT. But if we didn't have to pay the foreign government's tax, over 10 years, it'd be about $5 trillion of tax that U.S. citizens don't have to pay. That would more than pay for the tax cuts that we're debating right now. And so if we get some of that money back, either through tariffs, or for, obviously, if they reduce the tariffs of that, that that's good for Americans, it's going to put more money in their pockets, and- and that's what President Trump is trying to do.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Kevin Hassett, I'd like to have you come back, sit at the table and talk through this in- in more detail at another time. We have to leave it there for today.",
      "HASSETT: Thanks. Happy, happy to be here.",

      "The following is the transcript of an interview with Secretary of State Marco Rubio that aired on \"Face the Nation with Margaret Brennan\" on Feb. 16, 2025.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Good morning and welcome to \"Face the Nation.\" We want to begin today with Secretary of State Marco Rubio, who is in Jerusalem on the second leg of his trip through Europe and the Middle East. Mr. Secretary, I know it's the evening hours there, and you've had a long day. We appreciate your time. You've got quite a busy schedule. You met earlier with Prime Minister Netanyahu. He said he's lock step with the Trump administration, but he can't share details on, quote, \"when the gates of hell will be open\u2026if all our hostages are not released.\" Did he tell you he wants to keep talks going to get to phase two of this hostage deal?",
      "SECRETARY OF STATE MARCO RUBIO: Well, I think we share a common goal. We want to see every hostage released. Frankly, I think, and the President has said this, we want to see them out as soon as we possibly can. And- and certainly, you know, the world has watched these images of people, and it's just heartbreaking to remember that some of them have been now almost two years there. It's a horrifying situation. So we coordinate and work very close with them. We share the goal that every hostage needs to come home, every single one, without delay. Obviously, the- there are details of how we're pursuing that and coordinating that we're not going to share publicly because we don't want to endanger the hostages and we don't want to endanger this process. But suffice it to say that if it was up to us, every one of these hostages would be home right now, and we want it to happen as soon as possible.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: OK, so the deal stands?",
      "SECRETARY RUBIO: Again, we want every hostage out as soon as possible, and- and we want to see them home. There are some that are supposed to- under the deal, there are some that are supposed to be released coming up next weekend. We expect that to happen, but we'd like to see them all come out. We're not going to- we're not in favor of waiting weeks and weeks. Now, that may be the process that's in place because of the deal, but we would like to see them all out as soon as possible, and we continue to coordinate. That- that's what we'd like to see as the outcome. Who wouldn't want all these hostages to be home and with their families?",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Understood. I want to ask you about Iran as well. President Trump has said he wants a diplomatic deal with Iran. Are you reaching out to them? And alongside that, does the U.S. support a preemptive strike by Israel on Iran to take out its nuclear program?",
      "SECRETARY RUBIO: Well, first of all, Israel will always have to act in what they believe is their national interest and their national defense. And so I'm not going to speak about whatever strategies they may have on this or any other topic. I will say that we don't have any outreach from Iran. We haven't seen any, and ultimately, we've seen in the past that efforts that Iran has undertaken diplomatically have been only about how to extend the time frame that- but continue to enrich and rep- and- and in addition to sponsored terrorism, in addition to build these long range weapons, in addition to sow instability throughout the region. But let's be clear, there's been zero outreach or interest to date from Iran about any negotiated deal. Ideally, yeah, I would love to wake up one day and hear the news that Iran has decided not to pursue a nuclear weapon, not to sponsor terrorism, and re-engage in the world as a- as a- as a normal government. We've had no indication of any of that, not just now, but for 30 years.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: So you head from Israel to Saudi Arabia next, I know you'll be talking about Gaza, but we've also learned that Saudi Arabia is trying to facilitate this diplomacy with Russia about Ukraine. Which Russian officials do you expect to be meeting with, and what will the focus of your talks there be? Do you actually believe Vladimir Putin is ready to negotiate and make concessions?",
      "SECRETARY RUBIO: Well, here's what I know. I know President Trump spoke to Vladimir Putin last week, and in it, Vladimir Putin expressed his interest in peace, and the President expressed his desire to see an end to this conflict in a way that was enduring and that protected Ukrainian sovereignty, and that was an enduring peace, not that we're going to have another invasion in three or four years. That's a good call. Now, obviously it has to be followed up by action, so the next few weeks and days will determine whether it's serious or not. Ultimately, one phone call does not make peace. One phone call does not solve a war as complex as this one. But I can tell you that Donald Trump is the only leader in the world that could potentially begin that process. Other leaders have tried, they have not been able to do so. When he ran in his campaign and he was elected as president, one of his promises was, he would work to bring an end to this conflict in a way that's sustainable and fair. And obviously, you know, this is the first step in that process, but we have a long ways to go. Again, one call doesn't make it, one meeting wouldn't make it. This- there's a lot of work to be done. But I- I thought it has- you know, even the longest journey begins with the first step. So we'll see what happens from here, hopefully good things.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Who will you be meeting with?",
      "SECRETARY RUBIO: Well, nothing's been finalized yet. I was scheduled to be in Saudi Arabia anyways, we invited- we announced that trip a week ago, and- a week and a half ago. So ultimately, look, if at any point in time there's an opportunity to continue the work that President Trump started last week, to begin to create an opening for a broader conversation, that it would involve Ukraine and would involve the end of the war, and would involve our allies all over the world, particularly in Europe, we're going to explore it, if that opportunity presents itself. I don't have any details for you this morning, other than to say that we stand ready to follow the president's lead on this and begin to explore ways, if those opportunities present itself, to begin a process towards peace. Now, a process towards peace is not a one-meeting thing. This war has been going on for a while. It's difficult, it's complicated. It's been bloody, it's been costly, so it will not be easy to end a conflict- and there are other parties at stake that have opinions on this as well. The European Union has sanctions as well. The Ukrainians are obviously fighting this war. It's their country, and they're on the front lines. So, one meeting isn't going to solve it, but I want to reiterate, the President made clear he wants to end this war, and if opportunities present themselves to further that, we're going to take them if they present themselves. We'll see what happens over the next few days.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: But to be clear, Keith Kellogg, who is the envoy appointed to help with these talks, says these are going to be parallel negotiations, meaning the Ukrainians and Russians aren't talking to each other yet. When you meet with your Russian counterpart, whoever that is, are you going to be sitting there arguing Ukraine's position?",
      "SECRETARY RUBIO: Well, first of all, I think the- we have to understand is, right now there is no process. What- what we have right now is a call between Putin and President Trump in which both sides expressed an interest in ending this conflict. I imagine there will be follow up conversations to figure out what a process to talk about that would look like, and then at that point, perhaps we can begin to share more details. So it's a bit premature. I know there's been a lot of reaction to it, because there's been no conversation about it, any serious conversation, but I want to go back to the point I made. President Trump ran, he was very clear, he thinks this war needs to end, and if he sees an opportunity to end it, which is what he's looking for, whether there is an opportunity or not, we're going to pursue it. Ultimately, it will reach a point when you are- if it's real negotiations, and we're not there yet, but if that were to happen, Ukraine will have to be involved, because they're the one that were invaded, and the Europeans will have to be involved because the oth- they have sanctions on Putin and Russia as well, and- and they've contributed to this effort. We're just not there yet. We really aren't, but hopefully we will be, because we'd all like to see this war end.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: No doubt, the last administration did have contact through the intelligence agencies with Russia, but they didn't believe there was any proof that Vladimir Putin was interested in talks. You know the history with Vladimir Putin. He likes to use diplomacy as a cover to distract while he continues to wage war. Do you trust that this time is different?",
      "SECRETARY RUBIO: Yeah, I don't think in geopolitics, anyone should trust anyone. I think these things have to be verified through actions. I said yesterday that peace is not a noun, it's a verb. It's an action. You have to take concrete steps towards it. What I can tell you is, I know of no better negotiator in American politics than President Trump. I don't- I think President Trump will know very quickly whether they say- is this a real thing, or whether this is an effort to buy time. But I don't want to prejudge that. I don't want to foreclose the opportunity to end a conflict that's already cost the lives of hundreds of thousands and continues every single day to be, increasingly, a war of attrition on both sides. I think everyone should be celebrating the fact that we have an American president that is seeking to promote peace in the world, not start wars, but end them, in a way that's enduring. That's something we should be happy about. Whether it's possible or not, we're certainly willing, but it's not entirely up to us, obviously, but we'll find out.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Well, you did speak in a phone call with Russia's top diplomat, Sergei Lavrov. The Russian side claimed that you discussed restoring trade, which seemed to be a nod to sanctions, easing restrictions on diplomats, and other gestures like a high level leaders meeting. Are you actually considering- is the Trump administration considering lifting sanctions on Russia?",
      "SECRETARY RUBIO: Well, the phone call was to establish communications that are consistent with the call the President made last week with Vladimir Putin. Because if- we are- if there is going to be the possibility of- of progress here towards peace, we are going to need to talk to the Russians. I mean, that is going to have to happen, and we're going to have to be able to be able to do it across our channels--",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: About lifting sanctions, though?",
      "SECRETARY RUBIO: --I also raised in that conversation concerns that- well, we didn't go into any details. I mean, what we just discussed is basically the ability to begin communicating. I'd never spoken to Mr. Lavrov in my life, so it was an opportunity for us to begin to open that channel of communication, which, again, if there's the potential for peace here, that's a channel that has to exist. But let me add one more thing. I also raised the issue of our embassy in Moscow, which operates under very difficult conditions. I raised that because it's important, it's going to be very difficult to engage in communication with Russia about anything if our embassy is not functioning. And he raised concerns about his diplomatic mission in the United States. So at a very basic level, if, in fact, there is going to be an opportunity here to pursue peace by engaging with the Russians, we're going to need to have functional embassies in Moscow and in Washington, D.C., and that's certainly something foreign ministers would talk about as a matter of normal course.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: I want to ask you about what happened in Munich, Germany, at the Security Conference. Vice President Vance gave a speech, and he told U.S. allies that the threat he worries about the most is not Russia, it is not China. He called it the \"threat from within,\" and he lectured about what he described as censorship, mainly focusing, though, on including more views from the right. He also met with the leader of a far-right party known as the AfD, which, as you know, is under investigation and monitoring by German intelligence because of extremism. What did all of this accomplish, other than irritating our allies?",
      "SECRETARY RUBIO: Why would our allies or anybody be irritated by free speech and by someone giving their opinion? We are, after all, democracies. The Munich- Munich Security Conference is largely a conference of democracies in which one of the things that we cherish and value is the ability to speak freely and provide your opinions. And so, I think if anyone's angry about his words, they don't have to agree with him, but to be angry about it, I think actually makes his point. I thought it was actually a pretty historic speech, whether you agree with him or not. I think the valid points he's making to Europe is, we are concerned that the true values that we share, the values that bind us together with Europe, are things like free speech and democracy and our shared history in winning two world wars and defeating Soviet communism and the like. These are the values that we shared in common, and in that cold war we fought against things like censorship and oppression and so forth, and when you see backsliding, and you raise that, that's a very valid concern. We can't tell them how to run their countries. We are- he simply expressed in a speech his view of it, which a lot of people, frankly, share. And I thought he said a lot of things in that speech that needed to be said. And honestly, I don't know why anybody would be upset about it. People are- you know, you don't have to agree on someone's speech. I happen to agree with a lot of what he said, but you don't have to agree with someone's speech to- to at least appreciate the fact they have a right to say it and that you should listen to it and see whether those criticisms are valid. I assure you, the United States has come under withering criticism on many occasions from many leaders in Europe, and we don't go around throwing temper tantrums about it.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Well, he was standing in a country where free speech was weaponized to conduct a genocide, and he met with the head of a political party that has far-right views and some historic ties to extreme groups. The context of that was changing the tone of it. And you know that. That the censorship was specifically about the right--",
      "SECRETARY RUBIO: -- Well I have to disagree with you. No- I have- I have to disagree with you. Free speech was not used to conduct a genocide. The genocide was conducted by an authoritarian Nazi regime that happened to also be genocidal because they hated Jews and they hated minorities and they hated those that they- they had a list of people they hated, but primarily the Jews. There was no free speech in Nazi Germany. There was none. There was also no opposition in Nazi Germany, they were a sole and only party that governed that country. So that's not an accurate reflection of history. I also think it's wrong- again, I go back to the point of his speech. The point of his speech was basically that there is an erosion in free speech and intolerance or opposing points of view within Europe, and that's of concern because that is eroding. That's not an erosion of your military capabilities, that's not an erosion of your economic standing, that's an erosion of the actual values that bind us together in this transatlantic union that everybody talks about, and I think allies and friends and partners that have worked together now for 80 years, should be able to speak frankly to one another in open forums without being offended, insulted, or upset. And I spoke to Foreign Ministers from multiple countries throughout Europe. Many of them probably didn't like the speech or didn't agree with it, but they were continuing to engage with us on all sorts of issues that unite us. So again, at the end of the day, I think that, you know, people give all- that is a forum in which you're supposed to be inviting people to give speeches, not basically a chorus where everyone is saying the exact same thing. That's not always going to be the case when it's a collection of democracies where leaders have the right and the privilege to speak their minds in forums such as these.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Mr. Secretary, I'm told that we are out of time. A lot to get through with you. We appreciate you making time today. We'll be back in a minute.",

      "The following is the transcript of an interview with GOP Sen. Jeanne Shaheen of New Hampshire that aired on \"Face the Nation with Margaret Brennan\" on Feb. 16, 2025.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: And joining me now is Senator Jeanne Shaheen, the ranking Democrat on the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, joining us from Munich Security Conference. Senator, you were on stage with Ukraine's President Zelenskyy Friday, discussing the future of U.S. and Ukraine security cooperation. He said he hopes President Trump will help Ukraine. Can Congress? Can senators like yourself give him any assurances that U.S. support in his fight with Russia will continue?",
      "SEN. JEANNE SHAHEEN: Well, we had a bipartisan panel participating with President Zelenskyy, two Democrats, two Republicans, and I think it's fair to say that we were unanimous in our support for Ukraine, for continuing the fight against Russia, for thinking about how we hold Vladimir Putin accountable, and for providing as much leverage as we can to Ukraine before any kind of negotiations start to end the war.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Well, in terms of negotiations, there were some comments made by President Trump this week. There were also comments made by his Defense Secretary that I know got a lot of attention among our European counterparts. The Defense Secretary said returning to Ukraine's pre 2014 borders is unrealistic. He's suggesting that maybe the east and another part of Ukraine and Crimea will be taken by Russia. Why do you think there was this plan to give concessions before talks begin?",
      "SEN. SHAHEEN: Well, I think it was a mixed message coming from the administration. On the one hand, you heard Secretary Hegseth saying they were going to take NATO off the table, that Ukraine needed to give up territory, and on the other hand, you had Vice President Vance yesterday, or at the conference, saying that everything should be on the table, including the possibility of putting boots on the ground in Ukraine. So it's a mixed message. I hope that the upshot of that is that we are going to do everything we can to support Ukraine.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: In terms of what Congress can do, are your hands tied here? Or are some of your Republican colleagues willing to put something perhaps in an upcoming defense bill, for example, that might help Ukraine?",
      "SEN. SHAHEEN: Well, I think that's one option. One of the things that we're talking about doing right away is making some statements on the the repossession of assets by Russia that are held in the United States and in Europe, and the importance of having those assets go to Ukraine to help both with the execution of the military conflict, but also to think about rebuilding.\u00a0 Again, there's bipartisan support, there was bipartisan support for the bill, and there's bipartisan support to continue to try and ensure that those assets from Russia get repaid to Ukraine, because Russia is really the aggressor here, and we need to hold Vladimir Putin accountable.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: You know, your Republican counterpart, Roger Wicker, He is the chair of the Armed Services Committee was really sharp in his comments at Munich. He was saying he was puzzled. He was disturbed by what the Defense Secretary, a member of his own party, had said about Ukraine. He was very clear that what Vladimir Putin is doing, he said, is absolutely out of Adolf Hitler's playbook. Those are sharp words, considering the President of the United States says he wants to meet face to face to Vladimir Putin and possibly bring him to the White House.",
      "SEN. SHAHEEN: Well, they are sharp words, and they are very much justified, regardless of what President Trump may be doing to try and lay the groundwork for any future negotiations. The fact is, there is strong bipartisan support in Congress to help Ukraine in this unfair war that Russia has initiated. And I think Senator Wicker's comments are very important. We need to make sure that the world knows that we want to hold Vladimir Putin and Russia accountable for what, for what they've done.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: At the conference you're at, you are able to speak with European leaders. What are they saying to you about their view of America now?",
      "SEN. SHAHEEN: Well, we're here in Munich, which is one of the biggest security conferences worldwide, and we have leaders from all over the world, a lot of European leaders. And we had a chance to meet with representatives from Britain, from Canada, not a European country, but also very concerned about Ukraine. With- people from the Balkan countries, with President Zelenskyy, obviously, and there is a great deal of concern about the U.S. position on Ukraine. At the panel that we had with President Zelenskyy, we talked about the importance of Europe and the United States acting in concert so that we can hold Putin accountable with sanctions, so that we can- so that there is no daylight between the United States and our NATO allies and our European allies. Clearly, that's what Vladimir Putin has been trying to do throughout this conflict, and we need to make it clear that that is not going to happen, that we are going to work together and we are going to support Ukraine.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Does Congress need to be any part of approving this deal President Trump says he wants, to take possession of some of the critical minerals that Ukraine has inside their territory? He says he wants to use that as sort of repayment for what the U.S. has spent on weapons.",
      "SEN. SHAHEEN: Well, I think there are some benefits to having the United States have some investments in Ukraine. That's part of what a critical minerals deal would do. It's not at all clear who- who has possession of those critical minerals. Some of them are in the eastern part of Ukraine, where Russia controls the territory, some of them are owned by private- actually, oligarchs. There are some oligarchs who own a number of those critical mineral sites. So I think those are details that have not yet been worked out, and I have not seen the agreement that's been put in front of President Zelenskyy.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Well, we know Zelenskyy will be discussing that with other members of the administration. We'll stay tuned on that, but I do want to bring up something that we--",
      "SEN. SHAHEEN: He--",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Sorry, go ahead.",
      "SEN. SHAHEEN: Well, I just- I wanted to- one of the things that in our conversations with President Zelenskyy, that we talked about, that I know that he's got to be concerned about, is making sure that Ukraine is at the table, whether literally, or however those negotiations work out, for any conversations about what happens in Ukraine, and President Zelenskyy reiterated, nothing about Ukraine without Ukraine. And I- he got reassurances from the bipartisan senators that he met with, that we agree, Ukraine absolutely must be part of any negotiations between Russia and the United States.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: But you know, for this administration, they have made the argument time and again that Europe needs to do more to defend itself, that the U.S. can't be responsible for it. Senator Lindsey Graham, who was alongside you with Zelenskyy, defended President Trump's phone call earlier this week with Vladimir Putin, saying, \"All the people worried about the phone call, where were you when we needed to stop Putin?\" He was talking about going all the way back to 2014, in the Obama administration. What do you think- you know, how do you respond to this idea that this was just a conversation, and that if people were truly worried about security, they should have done more earlier?",
      "SEN. SHAHEEN: Well, I think we should have done more earlier. In 2014 I was in the group that said we needed to give lethal weapons to Ukraine so that they could fight back. Unfortunately, that didn't happen, but- but now the issue is, what are we going to do to ensure that they can continue to protect their territorial integrity, that we don't allow Vladimir Putin, or any other dictator, to unilaterally invade a country just because they want to get the territory? And we know that China and President Xi are watching very closely what happens in Ukraine. We've seen North Korea send troops, and they're losing thousands of North Koreans in this battle. We know Iran is watching. So this is not just about Russia and Ukraine. It's also about our other adversaries, and whether both our allies and our adversaries understand that we are going to stand up and support our allies and do everything we can to ensure that they are successful, that the United States is not going to walk away.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: I want to ask you about China. You wrote a letter along with your Republican colleague, Susan Collins, stating concern that this so-called buyout program the Trump administration is offering would leave at risk a Navy shipyard in the Northeast that helps to service submarines. You pointed right at the nuclear threat posed by China to the United States. Have you responded- have you received a response from the Navy, and how significant of an impact will this have?",
      "SEN. SHAHEEN: Well, we haven't received a response. That was in- with concern about a shipyard, the Portsmouth Naval Shipyard that New Hampshire and Maine shares. So the delegations from both New Hampshire and Maine are very concerned about what happens at the shipyard. They do maintenance and repair on our nuclear submarine fleet. It's one of the areas where we have an advantage over China. We need to ensure that our submarine fleet is maintained, that it's out and sea worthy, and we need to ensure that we have the workers that it takes to do all of that work, that we are able to make the investments in our public shipyards so they can do the repairs and make sure that those nuclear submarines are patrolling our seas and keeping America safe.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Before I let you go, I need to ask you about this freeze on foreign assistance. I know one of your colleagues has put a hold on all the picks to go to the State Department to work under Secretary Rubio because of these objections, do you support putting a freeze on getting Secretary Rubio's team in place? Is that in the best interest of the country right now?",
      "SEN. SHAHEEN: Listen, I think we need to get all of our diplomatic officials on the ground as quickly as possible. But what Elon Musk and this administration have done is to unilaterally stop our programs that are providing critical foreign assistance that help keep America safe, that help blunt China, that help address- I mean, in Ukraine, we know that there are programs that have been stopped because of what's happening. We have commodities that are from U.S. farmers that are sitting in ports around the world and in the U.S. that can't get to the people. These are commodities that have been paid for and they can't get unloaded because of the stop work orders and this freeze. That doesn't make sense. That's not efficient. And what we're doing is leaving a vacuum for China and Russia and our adversaries to move into and really eliminate the trust that has been built over years because of all of the good work that has been done by these foreign assistance efforts.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Senator Shaheen, thank you for your time today.",

I understand that he has asked, not just for continued military support now, but security assurances in the event of a peace deal. What can you tell him about what to expect from America?",
      "REP. DAN CRENSHAW: I just- I just came from a lunch where General Kellogg spoke as a Special Envoy leading this effort to establish peace. And he's very clear that what the kind of peace we're talking about is a lasting peace, which, of course, involves security assurances. And part of that process is figuring out exactly what that means. Even the Ukrainians are talking about what that means. There's a variety of options, per se. I think the Europeans have to play a huge role in that. One of the things that gets talked about a lot is, what are European forces actually acting as a peacekeeping force? I'm here to constantly remind the Europeans, and I made this clear in various meetings here today, that, you know, if you want a seat at the table, because this is- this was a contentious issue that came up. You know, the Ukrainians clearly have a seat at the table, and the United States will be the intermediate- intermediary as we try to establish a peace deal. But the Europeans need to demand a seat at the table by- by being uncomfortably aggressive, which is something they haven't done. They often talk--",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: -- What do you mean? --",
      "REP. DAN CRENSHAW: -- about how they have matched U.S.- I'm telling you what I mean. They often talk about how they've matched U.S. aid, for instance. And I say, well, you should be doubling it. You should be tripling it. It's your continent. You should be threatening things to Putin that actually make you uncomfortable, because that's how- that's the only language Putin speaks is power. And when General Kellogg is at that table with Putin, he's only got a finite amount of leverage, and there's only so much more leverage that the U.S. can- can impose. And if anybody can do it, I think it's Donald Trump, and he's already- he's already said that, that nothing is off the table. Vice President Vance said that nothing is off the table. Economic, military, they will use the amount of leverage they can. My message to European leaders, I'm really not talking to you right now, I'm talking to European leaders right now, is if we want to win, if we want a better outcome for Ukraine, at the end of these peace talks, you need to be uncomfortably aggressive. You need to not just bolster your own defense spending, I mean because that's a long-term issue. That's a long term investment. You need to be talking about where you're going to be putting actual troops on the ground. Stop following our lead and actually take the lead. Let us be actually holding you back. That would be an ideal situation and- and- and vastly change the power dynamic when dealing with Putin",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: So I just want to understand what you're describing here. There already is a military security alliance known as NATO. You are saying you think there should be something else, or some other entity providing security assurances for Ukraine?",
      "REP. CRENSHAW: European soldiers. I mean- look, Europeans send aid, right? They send weapons. They do the same things we do, they match it barely. My argument to them is you shouldn't be matching it. You should be doubling it. You should be tripling it. It's your continent. Zelenskyy had a- gave a speech today. He talked about a European army, right? So there's- there's- there's a lot of talk about this. Of course, there's NATO. That's- that's a security that's- that's a defensive alliance. That's- that's- that's not an army. That's- we're talking about different things here. The Europeans need to come together, in my opinion, and have just a much stronger message towards Putin, instead of finger wagging at us about what we're willing to give and not give in a peace deal. Again, I tell them, look, if you- if you want a seat at the table, earn it. The Ukrainians have earned it. The Ukrainians have impressed everybody for the last three years. They've fought valiantly and courageously. They've earned my respect. They earned that seat at the table. We need to listen to their- to what they want. We listen to Zelenskyy. And I want to listen to other European leaders as well, but I want them to be uncomfortably aggressive, because that gives us more leverage in order to help Ukraine come out with a better outcome.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Okay. You said that both President Trump and Vice President Vance were clear, nothing is off the table. However, the Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth did seem, in Brussels, to take things quite explicitly off the table. He said the U.S. does not want Ukraine in NATO and that Ukraine would not return to its pre-2014 borders, which acknowledges giving up some of Crimea and potentially the east. Do you think offering concessions before negotiations begin is a good strategy here?",
      "REP. CRENSHAW: Yeah, I think you have to listen to the White House as a whole. They walked- they walked those back and made it clear that nothing is off- nothing is off the table. So- no, you walk into a negotiation with everything on the table. And I think that's exactly what this White House is doing and what General Kellogg is, I think, the right guy to do it. And again, I just heard from him speak to a whole group of European leaders. We were there with Ukrainian soldiers, Ukrainian leaders. And look, there's a path forward here. We don't know the details yet, because we barely started. It's less than a month since this administration has been in power, and they want to move fast, and everybody's a little nervous, but I think they should be much more optimistic than they should be nervous. You needed a seismic shift here. This is not a sustainable operation in Ukraine. If Kamala Harris had been president, you'd be going along the same lines, which is basically funding this war until every Ukrainian is dead. That's not an end that we can accept. There has to be some talk of negotiation. You know, I remind American people to from- from our perspective, from- from American strategic deterrence perspective, even getting Putin to that table to talk about an end to the war is a massive strategic win for us, because it establishes back our deterrence over time.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Do you know that he is actually committing to come to the table? Secretary of State Rubio said the other day, the Russians haven't even figured out if they have, you know, picked out negotiators. We don't have a commitment to actually negotiate from Vladimir Putin.",
      "REP. CRENSHAW: No, we don't. And you know what would be really helpful? What I said before, if the EU was uncomfortably aggressive about it.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: -- Got it--",
      "REP. CRENSHAW: Again, Putin only responds to power. And this is- this is what I remind Western leaders here to. Western- Westerners don't speak that language. Westerners talk about negotiations and- and, you know- and good moral values that we share and we believe each other. That's not how the East works. They only respond to power.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: So, okay, on that point, Vladimir Putin, it sounds like you would agree, is an accused war criminal. He is a dictator. There is a warrant out for his arrest, as you know, he invaded Ukraine. He is clearly a U.S. adversary, but this past week, President Trump said he'd love to have Putin back in the G8 which would make him again a peer global leader. President Trump floated inviting him to the U.S. or even visiting Russia himself. Do you think any of that is appropriate?",
      "REP. CRENSHAW: It's more appropriate than not talking to him for the last two years, which is what President Biden did. Who did that help? It hasn't gotten us anywhere--",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Talking is different than inviting him to the United States.",
      "REP. CRENSHAW: Sure. I mean, you can parse it out however you like, but the reality is is you're going to have to get him to the table somehow, right? And there's a carrot and a stick approach. Trump can use a lot- you can use a lot of leverage, and then the Europeans need to use a lot more leverage. But you also have that carrot approach, and Trump is good at that. He's good at flattering people in order to get them to the table. That is what we need, whether we like it or not, that's what we need. That's what Ukraine needs. Ukraine cannot sustain this, no matter how much money we give them, cannot sustain this forever, and so it is in our interest to get him to that table and there's a variety of ways to do it, and I trust the president's at least doing a heck of a lot better job than anybody else. I don't see- I don't hear any other ideas, by the way, so this is what we're going with.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: But flattering, a very brutal dictator who's pretty cunning, frankly, you really think that's a winning strategy?",
      "REP. CRENSHAW: He's not that cunning. He's fought a war that has destroyed his society, killed hundreds of thousands of Russians. He's made a massive mistake and miscalculation. He's not as clever as maybe we've given him credit for. I think, let Trump do his campaign promise and play this out. Look, nobody's going to take advantage of Donald Trump. And General Kellogg made that very clear, because that was a question Europeans asked him, you know, we- are you going to sell out just- just- just to get a deal? Just to get a deal that's because of the campaign promise? Kellogg just laughed at that. He's like, there is no way, there is absolutely no way that Donald Trump will be seen, and he will not let himself go down in history as having sold out to Putin. He will not let that happen. He believes- just for the sake of his own legacy, but he does care about lasting peace here, and lasting European peace. Again, my messaging, I'm not even talking to you right now, I'm talking to European leaders, you have to be uncomfortably aggressive against Putin in order to actually help us make this happen.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: But I think you know, some of the things Europeans point to is the fact that the United States cut out our allied government in Afghanistan from the negotiation Donald Trump cut with the Taliban. So there is a reason they point back to that and say, don't do this again. Don't cut Ukraine out of a negotiation with an enemy.",
      "REP. CRENSHAW: Sure, I mean, and I criticized that decision too, but that's just not what's happening now. This is a vastly different situation. I just met with Zelenskyy last night. They're having very good conversations with our administration. The Ukrainians, I think, are very- the Europeans have all sorts of opinions. The Ukrainians, I think, are very optimistic as they should be. We've had some very good conversations, some very realistic conversations, and I'm very excited and optimistic about what can happen here.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Okay, just because I raised Afghanistan to you, I want to ask you, you were one of the co-sponsors of the Afghan Adjustment Act, which was an effort to help bring some of those Afghans who helped the United States in its war in Afghanistan here to the United States for safety reasons. They are now stuck because of this Trump refugee ban. This is not just special immigrant visa holders. These are refugees writ large. Do you think the U.S. should continue to bring those Afghans to the U.S.?",
      "REP. CRENSHAW: Yeah, let's actually be really clear. The reason they're stuck is because Joe Biden pulled out of Afghanistan and had a zero troop policy despite every adviser telling him it was a terrible idea. That's why they're stuck. I still support bringing our allies back. I mean, to answer your question, it is obviously still a policy that I support, and we'll work with the administration to make it happen. I mean, look, I was blown up because one of my interpreters stepped on a- on an IED right in front of me. He died. He lost all four limbs. Died later that night. These are- these are patriots. They were fighting for- with us, alongside of us, for their own country, for our interests. Of course, actual allies need to be brought home. I think the unfortunate thing about that withdrawal is a lot of people who are not even our allies made it back on those flights, and then the people who are our allies, including U.S. citizens, were left behind. Again, we cannot blame Donald Trump for this. Donald Trump never left Afghanistan and we can say, well, he wanted to, well, he never did. That's the reality --",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Right. I'm just asking about the policy now.",
      "REP. CRENSHAW",
      "--So, we're going to work with the administration on this, and also, Congress still has to pass that. I mean\u00a0 --",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Right.",
      "REP. CRENSHAW",
      "--You know it's- there's- it goes beyond the the executive at this moment,",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Okay, when it comes to the military and military spending, the U.S. spends about 3.4 percent of its GDP on defense. Are you on board with boosting it to five percent which is what President Trump is saying western countries need to do? Are Republicans going to do that?",
      "REP. CRENSHAW: It's- it's quite the target. Look, we've got a lot of work to do right now on- we've got a budget to pass, last year's budget. Government funding expires on March 14, so we got to deal with that. We got to deal with the debt ceiling. We've got to finance disaster aid for California wildfires. We've got a reconciliation bill coming up. Look, you look at- you look at the world at the moment, and where America stands and the investments we need to make, it's pretty obvious we need to increase defense spending, and the exact amount, of course, will get worked out in Congress.",

    "story": [
      "Signaling a major shift in civil rights enforcement, the federal agency that enforces workplace anti-discrimination laws has moved to dismiss six of its own cases on behalf of workers alleging gender identity discrimination, arguing that the cases now conflict with President Donald Trump's recent executive order, court documents say.",
      "The requests by the U.S. Equal Employment Opportunity Commission mark a major departure from its prior interpretation of civil rights law, and a stark contrast to a decade ago when the agency\u00a0issued a landmark finding\u00a0that a transgender civilian employee of the U.S. Army had been discriminated against because her employer refused to use her preferred pronouns or allow her to use bathrooms based on her gender identity.",
      "Just last year, the EEOC\u00a0updated its guidance\u00a0to specify that deliberately using the wrong pronouns for an employee, or refusing them access to bathrooms corresponding with their gender identity, constituted a form of harassment. That followed a 2020 Supreme Court ruling that gay, lesbian and transgender people are protected from employment discrimination.",
      "Nearly all workplace discrimination charges\u00a0must pass through the EEOC \u2014 at least initially \u2014 and the agency's decision to drop at least six of the cases raises serious questions about whether its protections will continue to extend to\u00a0transgender and gender nonconforming\u00a0people going forward.",
      "The EEOC is seeking to dismiss three cases in Illinois as well as one in Alabama, New York and California. In each instance, the original complaints allege discrimination against transgender or gender nonconforming workers. The agency cites Trump's Jan. 20 executive order declaring that the government would recognize only two \"immutable\" sexes \u2014 male and female \u2014 as the reason for why it no longer intends to pursue the cases.",
      "The Alabama case charged that Harmony Hospitality LLC discriminated against an employee who identifies as a gay nonbinary male by firing him hours after co-owners learned of his gender identity. The New York lawsuit alleged that Boxwood Hotels LLC fired a transgender housekeeper who complained that a supervisor repeatedly misgendered them and made anti-transgender statements, referring to the housekeeper as a \"transformer\" and \"it.\"",
      "Another suit alleged that Wendy's franchisee Starboard Group, Inc. subjected three transgender employees to pervasive sexual harassment at a Wendy's restaurant in Carbondale, Illinois, claiming a supervisor demanded to know if one employee had a penis. In another Illinois case, a transgender Reggio's Pizza cashier at Chicago O'Hare International Airport was \"outed\" by her manager, called a racist, homophobic slur by coworkers, and fired when she complained. In southern Illinois, at a hog farm called Sis-Bro, Inc., a coworker allegedly exposed his genitals to a transgender employee and touched her breasts.",
      "And in Santa Clara, California, the EEOC charged that a Lush Handmade Cosmetics store manager sexually harassed three gender nonconforming employees with \"offensive physical and verbal sexual conduct.\"",
      "Former EEOC General Counsel and Professor and Co-Dean Emeritus at Rutgers Law School David Lopez, who served in the agency for more than 20 years, on Friday said in his experience, the EEOC has never dismissed cases based on substance rather than merit \u2014 until now.",
      "For the country's anti-discrimination agency \"to discriminate against a group, and say, 'We're not going to enforce the law on their behalf' itself is discrimination, in my view,\" Lopez said. \"It's like a complete abdication of responsibility.\"",
      "The EEOC's requests to dismiss the cases come just weeks after Trump\u00a0dismissed two Democratic commissioners of the five-member EEOC before their terms expired, an unprecedented decision that removed what would have been a major obstacle to his administration efforts to upend interpretation of the nation's civil rights laws. Had the commissioners been allowed to carry out their terms, the EEOC would have had a Democratic majority well into Trump's term. The administration also fired Karla Gilbride as the EEOC's general counsel, replacing her with Andrew Rogers as acting counsel.",
      "Shortly after their dismissals, acting EEOC chair Andrea Lucas, a Republican, signaled her intent to put the agency's resources behind enforcing Trump's executive order on gender. She announced in a statement that one of her priorities would be \"defending the biological and binary reality of sex and related rights.\" Later, she ordered that the EEOC would continue accepting any and all discrimination charges filed by workers, although complaints that \"implicate\" Trump's order should be elevated to headquarters for \"review.\"",
      "\"Biology is not bigotry. Biological sex is real, and it matters,\" Lucas said in her statement. \"Sex is binary (male and female) and immutable. It is not harassment to acknowledge these truths \u2014 or to use language like pronouns that flow from these realities, even repeatedly.\" She removed the agency's \"pronoun app,\" which allowed employees to display their pronouns in their Microsoft 365 profiles, among other changes.",
      "The EEOC in fiscal year 2023 received more than\u00a03,000 charges\u00a0alleging discrimination based on sexual orientation or gender identity, \"the most since the agency started tracking these charges in FY 2013, and up more than 36% from the previous year,\" according to the agency's website, which also provides a link for more information on discrimination based on sexual orientation or gender identity. But the information appears to have been removed and the link now leads to a blank page with the message: \"The requested page could not be found.\"",
      "Jocelyn Samuels, one of the Democratic EEOC commissioners who was fired last month, said via email that Trump's executive order and the EEOC's response to it \"is truly regrettable.\"",

    "story": [
      "Human brains contain higher concentrations of microplastics than other organs, according to a new study, and the amount appears to be increasing over time.",
      "In the study, published in early February in the journal\u00a0Nature Medicine, University of New Mexico Health Sciences researchers found microplastics in human brains have increased 50% over the past 8 years. They also found that people with dementia had up to 10 times as much plastic in their brains as everyone else.",
      "Microplastics are tiny fragments of degraded polymers that are found in the environment, including our air, water and soil, a news release explained. Previous studies have already shown these substances have made their way into the human body.",
      "The lead researcher, toxicologist Matthew Campen, said the rate of accumulation they found mirrors the increasing amounts of plastics waste on the planet. And he said in the news release that their findings should trigger alarm about the potential impact on human health.",
      "\"I have yet to encounter a single human being who says, 'There's a bunch of plastic in my brain and I'm totally cool with that,'\" he said.",
      "The study compared liver, kidney and brain tissue samples from autopsies conducted in 2016 and 2024, and found \"substantially higher concentrations\" in the 2024 brain tissue. The researchers also conducted similar analysis on older and more recent autopsies for people who died with confirmed dementia diagnoses, and found \"far greater\" concentrations.",
      "While it's unclear how particles are actually being transported into the brain, Campen said the size of the micro- and nanoplastics, measuring 200 nanometers or less, are not much larger than viruses and therefore small enough to cross the blood-brain barrier.",
      "In the study, researchers detected 12 different polymers, the most common of which was polyethylene, widely used for packaging and containers, including bottles and cups, the release noted.",
      "Campen suspects most microplastics in the body are ingested through food, particularly meat.",
      "\"The way we irrigate fields with plastic-contaminated water, we postulate that the plastics build up there,\" he said. \"We feed those crops to our livestock. We take the manure and put it back on the field, so there may be a sort of feed-forward biomagnification.\"",
      "The team also found high concentrations of plastic in meat bought at grocery stores.",
      "As for the higher levels found in the brains of dementia patients, the researchers noted the study was not designed to prove whether that was the cause of symptoms \u2014 it may be the reverse, that the disease process allows more accumulation to happen.",
      "\"Atrophy of brain tissue, impaired blood\u2013brain barrier integrity and poor clearance mechanisms are hallmarks of dementia and would be anticipated to increase [micro- and nanoplastic] concentrations,\" they wrote.",
      "Dr. C\u00e9line Gounder, CBS News medical contributor and editor-at-large for public health at KFF Health News, said the research on the health impact of microplastics is still in its infancy, but there are important questions being asked.",
      "\"There are concerns that this could be causing any number of conditions. Could it be increasing the risk of stroke or heart attack? Could it be increasing the risk of cancer, inflammatory bowel disease, infertility?\" she said\u00a0on \"CBS Mornings.\"",
      "For those looking to reduce exposure to microplastics, Gounder suggests switching from plastic bottles to stainless steel or glass and making some other changes in the kitchen.",
      "\"Do not reheat your food in contact with plastic \u2014 that is really important. So move it to a glass dish or your plate, not in plastic,\" she said \"And then finally switch out your cutting boards. Don't use plastic cutting boards, use either wood or stone.\"",

      "International space organizations like NASA are taking the possible threat seriously, however small it might be. Richard Moissl, the head of the European Space Agency's planetary defense office, said their attentiveness shouldn't unduly raise public concern. He shared key facts about the asteroid with CBS News during the below conversation,\u00a0 which has been edited for clarity.",
      "When would the asteroid hit Earth?",
      "This asteroid passes us by every four years. Every time we go four times around the sun, it has almost precisely completed one turn. It has just recently had a flyby in December 2024, which means the next flyby is in December 2028, and we know already that this one is no problem.",
      "The critical one is in 2032, on the 22nd of December, somewhere around the middle of the day in Universal Time. That is when the asteroid is passing, really, through a part of the orbit of the Earth. So, it's really going through the path of Earth, so to speak.",
      "And the question is, whether Earth will be there at this point in time, or whether it will have already passed or is still approaching that point. It's the question, where will it pass by? There's an uncertainty region that spans, right now, the entire Earth-Moon system \u2014 which is not to say that we don't know a lot about it. In fact, we know a lot about it.",
      "Now, we're looking at a closing moment in time on the 22nd of December, 2032, and the question is about fractions of a meter per second, which will make all the difference.",
      "There's about a 20-something-minute window in which the Earth can be in the way of this before it's no longer in the path of the asteroid, or the asteroid cannot come in contact with the Earth anymore.",
      "How is the asteroid risk being managed?",
      "Until recently, we did daily measurements with different telescopes. Then, we had to pause a little bit for one or two days because of the full moon, and the object being too close to the full moon, and the moon illuminating the sky too much to see it.",
      "From now on, we will not monitor it daily, but it will be constantly monitored in the best way possible, with ever larger telescopes. And the idea is to measure its path around the sun in ever higher positions, so you will see this uncertainty region shrink, and shrink, and shrink. And we are trying to constrain the uncertainty so much that we can say whether it passes by Earth safely, or whether there is still some chance left in the middle of April.",
      "What happens in April?",
      "We will be so far away from the object that we cannot observe it from Earth anymore. And then, the James Webb Telescope will take measurements. It will actually take one in March, primarily infrared observations that give us more insight about the size of the object, and then one more in May to do additional measurements. The most likely scenario is that, by that time, you will be able to say, look, we can prove it's not going to hit Earth, but there is a chance that we cannot eliminate it completely. And that will be the more interesting bit, because then we have to wait until mid-2028, when we can observe it again. We will not let that time pass by without action.",
      "When was the last time an asteroid had similar odds of hitting Earth?",
      "This is only the second time that impact prediction systems have rated any asteroid with an impact probability of more than 1%. The last time was about 20 years ago, with the asteroid Apophis in 2004, which reached a couple of percent for a brief period in time before the uncertainty region could be constrained.",
      "That shows how unusual 1% is, and that means that we, as experts, have to take this seriously. However, with the current probability estimated at around 2%, it's still around 98% likely that nothing bad will happen at all. So, that needs to be kept in mind all the time. This is something that merits attention, but it's not perceived as an imminent threat. It's just, we need to find out more about it.",
      "Have asteroids this size actually crashed into Earth?",
      "We are aware of a recent example in history where this has happened. It was 1908 in Siberia. There was an event where 2,000 square kilometers of forest had been flattened by a big explosion, high up in the atmosphere. And this is very consistent with a body about 50 meters in diameter, plus or minus 10 meters, entering Earth's atmosphere.",
      "The body itself was, then, likely not a solid piece of rock. It was more like, what we call a pile of smaller pieces of rock. And this burst several kilometers above the surface and had this effect, that 2,000 square kilometers of forest was flattened, that seismic waves went out from this and could be detected far away, that people witnessed this event, also from very far away.",
      "We don't know if anyone was hurt in that accident. Nothing is reported. But the size, the footprint of the destruction is comparable to a major urban area, or a big city on Earth. So, this is basically the scenario that we would expect from this.",
      "Another example not recorded in human history was an object believed to have been about 50 meters in diameter, a massive chunk of iron that formed the Barringer meteor crater in Arizona. It's a 1.2-kilometer crater. If you look at this and think about it, if that were to hit in a city, the city would look very, very different afterward.",
      "The estimated size of this asteroid ranges from about 40 to 90 meters. Wouldn't there also be a big difference between the damage caused by something 40 meters wide versus 90 meters?",
      "Absolutely. I mean, the 40 to 90 meters is a standard estimate, because we cannot know at this point in time what the surface brightness is. Current data indicate it's more toward the 40- or 50-meter size. So, luckily, on the smaller size range, which is why I cited these popular examples for this.",
      "But, indeed, size matters for asteroids. Size matters a lot. If we're talking about the doubling of the radius of an asteroid, that means eight times the mass, eight times the energy, and that is a significant difference, of course. While on the lower end of the scale, with about 40 meters, it would be threatening to, let's say, a middle-sized city, on the 90-meter edge, it might be comparable to the biggest urban areas.",
      "Why has the probability of 2024 YR4 hitting Earth increased since it was first discovered?",
      "The good news is, this increase does not mean that the asteroid has become more dangerous. The path of the asteroid is defined by physical laws. It's already clear. It's just our knowledge of where that path would be, in reality, is not perfect yet.",
      "The percentage can be compared to the size of the uncertainty area, compared with the size of the Earth. If you look at the fraction, the size of the Earth \u2014   which is inside the uncertainty area \u2014   is compared to the entire area of the uncertainty of where the asteroid could be in that critical moment in time. This equated to about 1% when we reached this threshold for international awareness.",
      "Since then, the size of the uncertainty region has basically shrunk by half. And the size of Earth, luckily, remains the same. So, that means Earth is now occupying twice the amount of space in the uncertainty region. And it means our estimate for the impact risk has risen from 1% to 2%. It doesn't mean that anything has changed.",
      "Again, 2% is a 98% chance of missing. So what will happen is, with our gaining knowledge, uncertainty will shrink further and further and further, and the expected case is that we will manage to shrink it so much that Earth is no longer inside this uncertainty region, and then the impact probability will drop to zero.",
      "In the case of this being a close flyby to Earth, if it's reasonably close, it's entirely possible that the impact probability will continue to rise a little bit on a modest path. This is still no cause for alarm.",
      "The asteroid has been assigned a Level 3 ranking, out of 10, on the Torino Impact Hazard Scale. How uncommon is that?",
      "It's the first time ever that an object is officially classified as a Level 3 on the Torino scale. The only other object that was ever classified with a level higher than 1 was Apophis. Because of its larger size, Apophis has been classified as a 4 on the Torino scale, which is really just indicating that it's a larger object. [Apophis has an estimated diameter of 350 meters, which is much larger than the asteroid 2024 YR4.]",
      "What else should people know?",
      "Well, the most important thing is, don't panic. Always good advice, but it's definitely applicable advice in this situation. I think this gives us a chance to prove that we, as a planet, can still rise above things on Earth that are between people, between countries, between parts of Earth. That if we are facing a completely outside threat, that we can all come together, join forces and face these kinds of threats together.",
      "This one is a manageable challenge. Even if it were to be headed towards Earth, which is by no means certain, 98% it's clear that it will miss us. So, not much to be afraid of, but a good chance to show that we can stand united on this planet.",

      "New images captured by NASA's Curiosity rover show colorful clouds in the sky over Mars.",
      "The images were captured by the rover's Mastcam, which NASA's Jet Propulsion Laboratory compared to the rover's eyes. The clouds were spotted on Jan. 17, and the photos were taken over the course of 16 minutes, the space agency said in a news release.",
      "The clouds, known as noctilucent or twilight clouds, contain frozen carbon dioxide, or dry ice. They are tinted with colors when the setting Sun scatters light. That color has led to them being nicknamed \"mother-of-pearl\" clouds.",
      "While Mars' atmosphere is 95% carbon dioxide, few of its clouds are at a high enough atmosphere and low enough temperature to contain frozen carbon dioxide. Most clouds on the planet are made of water ice. The clouds photographed by Curiosity are at an altitude of 37 to 50 miles above the planet's surface. Other images show the clouds as white plumes falling through the atmosphere, before evaporating about 31 miles above Mars.",
      "Did you know that Mars has *iridescent* clouds?Spotted by the @MarsCuriosity rover, these unique clouds are made of carbon dioxide ice and are only observed at twilight. What this helps us learn about the Red Planet: https://t.co/Snqyo49n1W pic.twitter.com/anXG7hf61K",
      "The twilight clouds have only been spotted in some areas of Mars' southern hemisphere. NASA's Perseverance Rover, which landed on Mars' northern hemisphere in 2021, has not seen the clouds since it landed, but Curiosity has seen them in the southern hemisphere in four different Mars years.",
      "Mark Lemmon, an atmospheric scientist with the Space Science Institute in Boulder, Colorado, told NASA that he believes certain regions of the planet are more likely to form the clouds. Gravity waves, which cool a planet's atmosphere, could be a factor, he said.",
      "\"Carbon dioxide was not expected to be condensing into ice here, so something is cooling it to the point that it could happen,\" Lemmon said in NASA's news release. \"But Martian gravity waves are not fully understood and we're not entirely sure what is causing twilight clouds to form in one place but not another.\"",
      "Even though researchers don't totally understand how the clouds are formed, they can predict when and where they will appear. Lemmon, who was a lead researcher on a 2024 paper detailing Curiosity's first two years of cloud observations, said the phenomenon has \"become so predictable that we can plan our shots in advance.\"",
      "The new cloud photos aren't the only data Curiosity has sent back to NASA in recent weeks. The rover recently investigated a place called the Gediz Vallis channel, the space agency said.",
      "It also visited an impact crater nicknamed \"Rustic Canyon\" to take photos and study the rocks around the crater. The 67-foot wide crater likely formed millions of years ago, based on the erosion of the site, NASA said.",
      "The rover will continue on to a new location that includes what NASA called \"boxwork,\" or fractures in the planet's surface formed by groundwater. When seen from space, the fractures look like giant spiderwebs, NASA said.",

    "summary": "By switching the next space station crew to a different ferry ship, the Starliner astronauts will get home a bit earlier than planned.",
    "story": [
      "NASA plans to bring the two Starliner astronauts back to Earth, along with their two space station crewmates, around March 19-20, shortening their long-extended stay in orbit by about two weeks, the agency announced Tuesday.",
      "The slightly earlier-than-planned trip home was made possible by a tentative decision last week to switch the next set of station fliers \u2014 Crew 10 \u2014 to a different Crew Dragon spacecraft, one that can be ready for launch as early as March 12, with weather and other factors considered.",
      "After a five-to-seven-day handover to bring their Crew 10 replacements up to speed on the ins and outs of space station operation, Crew 9 commander Nick Hague, cosmonaut Alexander Gorbunov, Starliner commander Barry \"Butch\" Wilmore and co-pilot Sunita Williams, will undock and head back to Earth.",
      "They'll come home aboard the Crew Dragon that carried Hague and Gorbunov to the station last September, along with two empty seats reserved for Wilmore and Williams.",
      "Assuming the dates hold up, Wilmore and Williams will have logged nearly 290 days in orbit since launch June 5 on a mission originally expected to last a little more than one week. That's how long Boeing and NASA managers thought it would take to complete the Starliner's first piloted test flight.",
      "As it turned out, the Starliner, built as part of a NASA program to develop independent commercial crew ships to ferry astronauts to and from the space station, ran into propulsion problems and propellant leaks that prompted weeks and then months of tests and analysis.",
      "In the end, NASA managers decided the risks were too high to bring Wilmore and Williams down aboard the Starliner. Instead, they opted to bring the ship down by remote control, without its crew, and to keep Wilmore and Williams aboard the station until they could ride home with Hague and Gorbunov at the end of the Crew 9 expedition.",
      "NASA originally planned to bring all four back to Earth in February, but late last year, another month was added to the mission because of work needed to ready the Crew 10 Dragon for launch.",
      "President Trump last month blamed the Starliner crew's overall mission extension on the Biden administration, which he said had \"abandoned\" the two astronauts in space. He said he had asked SpaceX founder Elon Musk to \"go get\" Wilmore and Williams. Musk also blamed Biden in a post on X.",

      "The risk assessment kept climbing, and on January 29, the International Asteroid Warning Network (IAWN), a global planetary defense collaboration, issued a memo.",
      "According to the latest calculations from NASA's Jet Propulsion Laboratory, there is a 1.6% chance the asteroid will strike Earth on December 22, 2032.",
      "The asteroid 2024 YR4 is now rated at Level 3 out of 10 on the\u00a0Torino Impact Hazard Scale, which is \"a close encounter\" that warrants attention from astronomers and the public.",
      "If it does hit, possible impact sites include over the eastern Pacific Ocean, northern South America, the Atlantic Ocean, Africa, the Arabian Sea, and South Asia, the IAWN memo states.",
      "2024 YR4 follows a highly elliptical, four-year orbit, swinging through the inner planets before shooting past Mars and out toward Jupiter.",
      "For now, it's zooming away from Earth, and its next close pass will not come until 2028. Scientists will be able to get another look at the asteroid then, Harwood said, and determine its orbit and trajectory.",
      "Betts said, \"The odds are very good that not only will this not hit Earth, but at some point in the next months to few years, that probability will go to zero.\"",

      "\"City killer\" category",
      "The most infamous asteroid impact occurred 66 million years ago, when a six-mile-wide space rock triggered a global winter, wiping out the dinosaurs and 75 percent of all species.",

      "\"If you put it over Paris or London or New York, you basically wipe out the whole city and some of the environs,\" said Betts.",
      "The best modern comparison is the 1908 Tunguska Event, when an asteroid or comet fragment measuring 30-50 meters exploded over Siberia, flattening 80 million trees across 770 square miles.",
      "Like that impactor, 2024 YR4 would be expected to blow up in the sky, rather than leaving a crater on the ground.",
      "\"We can calculate the energy... using the mass and the speed,\" said Andrew Rivkin, a planetary astronomer at Johns Hopkins Applied Physics Laboratory.",
      "For 2024 YR4, the explosion from an airburst would equal around eight megatons of TNT \u2014 more than 500 times the power of the Hiroshima bomb.",
      "If it explodes over the ocean, the impact would be less concerning, unless it happens near a coastline triggering a tsunami.",
      "Time to prepare",
      "The good news, experts stress, is that we have plenty of time to prepare.",
      "Rivkin led the investigation for NASA's 2022 DART mission, which successfully nudged an asteroid off its course using a spacecraft \u2014 a strategy known as a \"kinetic impactor.\"",
      "The target asteroid posed no threat to Earth, making it an ideal test subject.",

      "Other, more experimental ideas exist.",
      "Lasers could vaporize part of the asteroid to create a thrust effect, pushing it off course. A \"gravity tractor,\" a large spacecraft that slowly tugs the asteroid away using its own gravitational pull, has also been theorized.",

      "New images captured by NASA's Curiosity rover show colorful clouds in the sky over Mars.",
      "The images were captured by the rover's Mastcam, which NASA's Jet Propulsion Laboratory compared to the rover's eyes. The clouds were spotted on Jan. 17, and the photos were taken over the course of 16 minutes, the space agency said in a news release.",
      "The clouds, known as noctilucent or twilight clouds, contain frozen carbon dioxide, or dry ice. They are tinted with colors when the setting Sun scatters light. That color has led to them being nicknamed \"mother-of-pearl\" clouds.",
      "While Mars' atmosphere is 95% carbon dioxide, few of its clouds are at a high enough atmosphere and low enough temperature to contain frozen carbon dioxide. Most clouds on the planet are made of water ice. The clouds photographed by Curiosity are at an altitude of 37 to 50 miles above the planet's surface. Other images show the clouds as white plumes falling through the atmosphere, before evaporating about 31 miles above Mars.",
      "Did you know that Mars has *iridescent* clouds?Spotted by the @MarsCuriosity rover, these unique clouds are made of carbon dioxide ice and are only observed at twilight. What this helps us learn about the Red Planet: https://t.co/Snqyo49n1W pic.twitter.com/anXG7hf61K",
      "The twilight clouds have only been spotted in some areas of Mars' southern hemisphere. NASA's Perseverance Rover, which landed on Mars' northern hemisphere in 2021, has not seen the clouds since it landed, but Curiosity has seen them in the southern hemisphere in four different Mars years.",
      "Mark Lemmon, an atmospheric scientist with the Space Science Institute in Boulder, Colorado, told NASA that he believes certain regions of the planet are more likely to form the clouds. Gravity waves, which cool a planet's atmosphere, could be a factor, he said.",
      "\"Carbon dioxide was not expected to be condensing into ice here, so something is cooling it to the point that it could happen,\" Lemmon said in NASA's news release. \"But Martian gravity waves are not fully understood and we're not entirely sure what is causing twilight clouds to form in one place but not another.\"",
      "Even though researchers don't totally understand how the clouds are formed, they can predict when and where they will appear. Lemmon, who was a lead researcher on a 2024 paper detailing Curiosity's first two years of cloud observations, said the phenomenon has \"become so predictable that we can plan our shots in advance.\"",
      "The new cloud photos aren't the only data Curiosity has sent back to NASA in recent weeks. The rover recently investigated a place called the Gediz Vallis channel, the space agency said.",
      "It also visited an impact crater nicknamed \"Rustic Canyon\" to take photos and study the rocks around the crater. The 67-foot wide crater likely formed millions of years ago, based on the erosion of the site, NASA said.",

    "summary": "Astronomers will use the Webb telescope to closely monitor the size and trajectory of an asteroid that has a slim chance of hitting Earth in 2032.",
    "story": [
      "An asteroid has a small chance of hitting Earth less than eight years from now, and astronomers are enlisting the help of NASA's James Webb Space Telescope to study it. Characterized as a potential \"city-killer,\" the asteroid was first detected in December and its odds of impacting our planet have increased slightly since then, according to the European Space Agency.",
      "The space rock is formally named 2024 YR4. Scientists say it currently carries a 2% risk of making contact with Earth when it eventually reaches this part of the solar system on Dec. 22, 2032. Although the asteroid will most likely pass by without issue, those tasked with monitoring its physical attributes and potential have shifted upward the probability of a crash since 2024 YR4 was initially discovered.",
      "The European Space Agency in January placed the asteroid's odds of hitting Earth at roughly 1%, before NASA's Jet Propulsion Laboratory estimated the risk was more like 1.6% at the tail end of the month. Officials at both agencies acknowledge the unlikelihood of 2024 YR4 causing problems, with the ESA saying that current risk estimates are probably unnecessarily high because the people studying it are still uncertain about some of the asteroid's key features.",
      "Right now, astronomers estimate the asteroid is between 40 meters and 90 meters wide, which is roughly 130 to 295 feet wide. For reference, an American football field measures 100 yards \u2014 or 300 feet \u2014 long.",
      "\"It is very important that we improve our size estimate for 2024 YR4,\" the ESA said in a statement Monday, which noted \"the hazard represented by a 40 m asteroid is very different from that of a 90 m asteroid.\"",
      "On the slim chance the asteroid does strike Earth in 2032, its impacts would be localized. But 2024 YR4 has nonetheless received a Level 3 rating, out of 10, on the Torino Impact Hazard Scale, which is a fairly rare distinction meant to represent \"a close encounter\" that warrants public and scientific attention.",
      "\"An asteroid this size impacts Earth on average every few thousand years and could cause severe damage to a local region,\" the ESA said\u00a0a previous statement\u00a0about 2024 YR4.",
      "If the asteroid does hit the planet, NASA said its potential impact sites could include areas over the eastern Pacific Ocean, northern South America, the Atlantic Ocean, Africa, the Arabian Sea and South Asia.",
      "CBS News space consultant Bill Harwood said if it landed in a populated area, it would \"be truly catastrophic,\" but the effects would be localized.",
      "\"It wouldn't be something like the rock that killed the dinosaurs,\" Harwood said. \"It wouldn't affect the global climate, but it would certainly be a disaster of every proportion. So we're all hoping that doesn't happen.\"",
      "In order to gain a greater understanding of the asteroid and better prepare for whatever is to come, astronomers will use the Webb Telescope to collect data on its size that could not be observed as accurately without the telescope's technology, the ESA said.",
      "Where scientists are generally limited to observing the asteroid based on the amount of visible light it reflects from the sun, with brighter light typically signaling a larger asteroid, the Webb telescope can calculate its infrared emissions, allowing for more accurate estimates.",
      "Webb will begin studying the asteroid in March, when it appears brightest, and again in May, according to the ESA. 2024 YR4 will disappear from view for a while after that, and astronomers will take time to interpret the telescope's data and determine what it could mean for the asteroid's route before it shows itself again in 2028.",

      "NASA plans to bring the two Starliner astronauts back to Earth, along with their two space station crewmates, around March 19-20, shortening their long-extended stay in orbit by about two weeks, the agency announced Tuesday.",
      "The slightly earlier-than-planned trip home was made possible by a tentative decision last week to switch the next set of station fliers \u2014 Crew 10 \u2014 to a different Crew Dragon spacecraft, one that can be ready for launch as early as March 12, with weather and other factors considered.",
      "After a five-to-seven-day handover to bring their Crew 10 replacements up to speed on the ins and outs of space station operation, Crew 9 commander Nick Hague, cosmonaut Alexander Gorbunov, Starliner commander Barry \"Butch\" Wilmore and co-pilot Sunita Williams, will undock and head back to Earth.",
      "They'll come home aboard the Crew Dragon that carried Hague and Gorbunov to the station last September, along with two empty seats reserved for Wilmore and Williams.",
      "Assuming the dates hold up, Wilmore and Williams will have logged nearly 290 days in orbit since launch June 5 on a mission originally expected to last a little more than one week. That's how long Boeing and NASA managers thought it would take to complete the Starliner's first piloted test flight.",
      "As it turned out, the Starliner, built as part of a NASA program to develop independent commercial crew ships to ferry astronauts to and from the space station, ran into propulsion problems and propellant leaks that prompted weeks and then months of tests and analysis.",
      "In the end, NASA managers decided the risks were too high to bring Wilmore and Williams down aboard the Starliner. Instead, they opted to bring the ship down by remote control, without its crew, and to keep Wilmore and Williams aboard the station until they could ride home with Hague and Gorbunov at the end of the Crew 9 expedition.",
      "NASA originally planned to bring all four back to Earth in February, but late last year, another month was added to the mission because of work needed to ready the Crew 10 Dragon for launch.",
      "President Trump last month blamed the Starliner crew's overall mission extension on the Biden administration, which he said had \"abandoned\" the two astronauts in space. He said he had asked SpaceX founder Elon Musk to \"go get\" Wilmore and Williams. Musk also blamed Biden in a post on X.",
      "But the Biden administration had no known influence on NASA's decision to extend the Starliner crew's mission, a plan that has been in place since last September when the Crew 9 spacecraft was launched with a two-man crew and two empty seats for Wilmore and Williams.",
      "And in any case, there was no need to \"go get\" the astronauts given the Crew 9 spacecraft, the Starliner crew's ride home, has been docked at the space station for the past five months.",

      "But social media users and product experts posting to online community boards have pointed to several holidays and cultural observances that they're not seeing anymore. In addition to the first days of Pride Month and Black History Month, that includes the start of Indigenous Peoples Month and Hispanic Heritage Month, as well as Holocaust Remembrance Day. The Verge first reported on some of these omissions last week.",

McKinley.",

Last week, Google outlined plans to scrap some of its diversity hiring targets \u2014 joining a growing list of U.S. companies that have abandoned or scaled back their diversity, equity and inclusion programs.

      "Roman Berezhnoy, 33, and Egor Nikolaevich Glebov, 39, allegedly used ransomware software called Phobos to hack victim computer networks, copy and steal files and programs, then encrypt the original data, according to a news release from the DOJ. Once the original data was encrypted, the men and others involved in the scheme would allegedly extort the victims for ransom payments in exchange for keys that would allow the victims to access the data again.",
      "The men also allegedly threatened to expose stolen files, and allegedly operated a site on the dark web where stolen data was published. Victims of the scheme included a children's hospital, health care providers, and educational institutions, the Justice Department said. Victims lost data and money.",
      "Berezhnoy and Glebov were arrested Monday. Charges were announced Tuesday.",
      "Each has been charged with one count of wire fraud conspiracy, one count of wire fraud, one count of conspiracy to commit computer fraud and abuse, three counts of causing intentional damage to protected computers, three counts of extortion in relation to damage to a protected computer, one count of transmitting a threat to impair the confidentiality of stolen data, and one count of unauthorized access and obtaining information from a protected computer.",
      "If convicted, each wire fraud-related charge carries a maximum penalty of 20 years in prison. Each computer damage count has a maximum penalty of 10 years. The remaining counts each have a maximum penalty of five years.",
      "The arrests come as international authorities announced a number of actions against cybercriminals. Recently, Russian national Evgenii Ptitsyn was arrested and extradited on charges related to his alleged administration of Phobos ransomware. European and German authorities also announced an operation involving the FBI and other law enforcement partners that had disrupted over 100 servers associated with the criminal network Berezhnoy and Glebov were a part of, the Department of Justice said.",

    "story": [
      "Paris, France\u00a0\u2014 Vice President JD Vance, in his first international address, warned European Union countries against overregulation and said the Trump administration wants artificial intelligence to remain free from ideological bias.",
      "\"The Trump administration is troubled by reports that some foreign governments are considering tightening the screws on U.S. tech companies with international footprints,\" Vance said while speaking to world leaders and tech executives at the Artificial Intelligence Action summit in Paris, France. \"Now, America cannot and will not accept that, and we think it's a terrible mistake \u2014 not just for the United States of America \u2014 but for your own countries.\"",
      "Vance said the U.S. wants to ensure that the internet is a safe place, but suggested the European Union's Digital Services Act had gone too far, enacting \"massive regulations\" and \"policing so-called misinformation.\"",
      "\"It is one thing to prevent a predator from preying on a child on the internet, and it is something quite different to prevent a grown man or woman from accessing an opinion that the government thinks is misinformation,\" Vance said.",
      "The Digital Services Act seeks to hold platforms more accountable for protecting European users from harmful or illegal content on their sites and imposes fines on violators. Last July, the EU found that the social media platform X, owned by Department of Government Effficiency head and Trump ally Elon Musk, did not comply with the act's transparency or accountability requirements.",
      "Vance told leaders, including European Commission president Ursula von der Leyen, that excessive regulation of the AI sector could \"kill a transformative industry just as it's taking off\" and the Trump administration will make it a priority to promote pro-growth AI policies.",
      "\"I'd like to see that deregulatory flavor making its way into a lot of the conversations at this conference,\" Vance said.",
      "Vance promoted America-first AI policies during his address, echoing a push by French President Emmanuel Macron for the EU to embrace a deregulatory environment to encourage more AI development on the continent.",
      "Macron said Monday that France generates enough clean electric power to build artificial intelligence centers, which require massive amounts of energy.",
      "\"I have a good friend on the other part of the ocean saying 'drill, baby, drill,'\" Macron said, in reference to President Trump and his push for fossil fuel energy. \"Here, there is no need to 'drill, baby, drill.' It is just 'plug, baby, plug.'\"",
      "Though the intent of the summit, which Macron is co-hosting with Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi, was to establish standards for more sustainable AI in the public interest, it has been overshadowed by the race between global powers to become the dominant country in the sector.",
      "Major American tech CEOs Google's Sundar Pichai and OpenAI's Sam Altman are attending the summit, as well as world leaders, including Chinese Vice Premier Zhang Guoqing.",
      "Vance said the Trump administration would ensure that the U.S. continues to be the partner of choice for foreign countries and businesses in developing AI.",
      "While the vice president did not mention China \u2014 or its new AI company DeepSeek \u2014 he put \"hostile foreign adversaries\" who have \"weaponized A.I. software to rewrite history, surveil users, and censor speech\" on notice.",
      "\"I want to be clear: this administration will block such efforts, full stop,\" Vance said. \"We will safeguard American A.I. and chip technologies from theft and misuse, work with our allies and partners to strengthen and extend these protections and close pathways to advert areas attaining A.I. capabilities that threaten all of our people.\"",
      "He extended the warning to allies as well.",
      "\"I would also remind our international friends here today that partnering with such regimes, it never pays off in the long term. From CCTV to 5G equipment, we're all familiar with cheap tech in the marketplace that's been heavily subsidized and exported by authoritarian regimes,\" Mr. Vance said.",

      "Measles is known as being \"the most contagious infectious disease out there,\" Gounder said.",
      "\"You need very high levels of vaccination to prevent an outbreak. So even a dip from 95% coverage to 93% coverage can leave you vulnerable to having outbreaks,\" she said.",
      "The measles vaccine, however, is highly effective and safe. It is normally given as part of the combination measles-mumps-rubella (MMR) vaccine.",
      "\"Two doses gets you to 97% protection and effectiveness against developing measles infection,\" Gounder said. \"We've seen hundreds of millions of doses given over the years worldwide. When you do not get the vaccine, that is when you have the risk of hospitalization and death.\"",
      "Before a vaccine became available in the 1960s, between 400 and 500 Americans \u2014 mostly children \u2014 died every year from measles.",

      "\"This is up from about 10% just two years ago. So we're really seeing a lot of exemptions [and] concerns about vaccination that are not warranted,\" Gounder said.",
      "Measles symptoms",

So this is really not a minor infection.\"",

    "summary": "Some Democratic lawmakers are raising concerns about the security of taxpayer data as Musk's cost-cutting task force moves to the IRS.",
    "story": [
      "The presence of Elon Musk's cost-cutting task force, the Department of Government Efficiency, at the IRS is sparking fresh concerns from Democratic lawmakers about the safety of taxpayer information, and whether the group's work could cause delays in taxpayers receiving their refunds.",
      "In a Feb. 17 letter to the IRS, Senators Ron Wyden and Elizabeth Warren, both Democrats, cited reports that DOGE is \"pressuring the IRS to agree to a memorandum of understanding (\"the MOU\") which would give software engineers working for Elon Musk at DOGE broad access to IRS systems, property and datasets which include the private tax return information of hundreds of millions of American citizens and businesses.\"",
      "DOGE is reportedly requesting access to the IRS' Integrated Data Retrieval System, or IDRS, which would provide the group with access to tax data for individuals and businesses, according to the Washington Post. DOGE is currently at the IRS, a White House official confirmed to CBS News. The IRS didn't immediately return a request for comment.",
      "Supporters of DOGE view its efforts as a way to cut what they see as bloated federal spending at a time when the nation's outlays are outstripping its tax revenue, pushing the federal debt to an all-time high of\u00a0$36 trillion. But the group's efforts have also sparked several lawsuits, with consumer advocates and Democratic lawmakers raising alarms earlier this month after DOGE gained access to the Treasury Department's\u00a0payment system, which stores personal data for most Americans.",
      "IRS data is particularly sensitive, given that it reflects financial details for millions of Americans and businesses, ranging from their income, employers, losses, investments, dependents and other items. Under the IRS taxpayers' bill of rights, \"information [taxpayers] provide to the IRS will not be disclosed unless authorized by the taxpayer or by law.\"",
      "\"Software engineers working for Musk seeking to gain access to tax return information have no right to hoover up taxpayer data and send that data back to any other part of the federal government and may be breaking the law if they are doing so,\" Wyden and Warren wrote in the Feb. 17 letter.",
      "The senators pointed to privacy regulations in the tax code that they said provide \"strong legal protections\" for taxpayer data, noting that violation of those laws can result in incarceration or other criminal penalties. They added that even if the DOGE employees are employed at the Treasury Department, which oversees the IRS, they may still be violating the law by accessing taxpayer data.",
      "\"There are serious statutory and regulatory restrictions on when employees outside the Treasury Department may gain access to tax return information,\" the letter said.",
      "It added, \"To date, no information on DOGE employees or any others executing orders on Musk's behalf have revealed any clear, stated purpose as to why they need access to return information, whether they have followed all required laws to gain access to IRS systems, and what steps the IRS has taken to ensure that inspection of tax return is contained to authorized personnel and not disclosed to any unauthorized parties.\"",
      "Delays to IRS tax refunds?",
      "Wyden and Warren also raised concerns about DOGE's impact on tax refunds this year.",
      "DOGE's work at the IRS comes as the tax agency is in the middle of the current tax season, when about 140 million individual tax returns are expected to be filed before the April 15 deadline. For many households, their tax refund check \u2014 which last year averaged more than $3,100 \u2014 is often their biggest cash influx of the year.",
      "\"We are also extremely concerned that DOGE personnel meddling with IRS systems in the middle of tax filing season could, inadvertently or otherwise, cause breakdowns that may delay the issuance of tax refunds indefinitely,\" the Feb. 17 letter said. \"Any delay in refunds could be financially devastating to millions of Americans who plan their budgets around timely refunds every spring.\"",
      "In the meantime, the IRS is preparing to fire thousands of probationary workers in the middle of tax season, the Associated Press reported, citing two sources familiar with the agency's plans. It's unclear how many IRS workers could be impacted, however, the AP noted. Federal workers in a probationary period typically have less than one year on the job and have not yet gained civil service protection.",
      "The cuts would come even as IRS employees were told they would not be able to participate in the Trump administration's earlier \"deferred resignation\" offer until after the tax filing deadline had passed.",
      "A letter sent earlier this month to IRS workers said that \"critical filing season positions in Taxpayer Services, Information Technology and the Taxpayer Advocate Service are exempt\" from the administration's buyout plan until May 15.",

      "A post shared by CBS News Climate Watch (@cbsnewsplanet)",
      "At one point late Saturday night, officials said the river level at the monitoring point in the lower Bowles Addition had reached 38 feet, prompting them to put up a flood gate. As of Monday morning, Pikeville Public Safety said the river levels had subsided enough that pond gates could be opened, but that water levels would continue to be monitored.",
      "\"The city of Pikeville has experienced significant and devastating flooding since yesterday afternoon, resulting in widespread impacts to our community,\" Pikeville Mayor Jimmy Carter wrote in a statement on Sunday. \"Since 3:00 PM on February 15th, the Pikeville Fire Department has responded heroically, participating in over 50 swift water rescue operations and answering more than 130 emergency calls. ...Their dedication and professionalism in the face of this crisis have undoubtedly saved lives, and we owe them our deepest gratitude.\"",

      "\"In many ways, this is one of the biggest flooding events we've had, in some areas just since 2022, because we've been hit hard. In other areas, one of the biggest floods ever,\" Beshear said. \"And it's basically happening in the middle of multiple snowstorms. So we always think we've seen it all and then we get hit by something else.\"",
      "Beshear said Sunday that at least 1,000 people stranded by floods had to be rescued. \"The speed of those rescues is thankfully decreasing as the water has either crested or is going down in many areas of the state, but there are still some significant active missions that are going on right now that are very important,\" the governor said Monday.",

      "Power outages were reported along much of the eastern seaboard, from New York south to Georgia.",

    "summary": "The Trump administration has halted DOGE's firings of hundreds of federal employees working on the nation's nuclear weapons programs.",
    "story": [
      "The Trump administration has paused the firings of hundreds of federal employees working on the nation's nuclear weapons programs, in a reversal that has left workers confused and experts cautioning that DOGE's blind cost cutting will put communities at risk.",
      "Late Thursday afternoon, a number\u00a0probationary employees of the National Nuclear Security Administration were fired, a source in the Energy Department confirmed. This is the entity within the department that manages the nation's nuclear weapons stockpile, among other responsibilities. Three U.S. officials told The Associated Press up to 350 employees at the NNSA were abruptly laid off, with some losing access to email even before they'd learned they were fired, only to try to enter their offices on Friday morning to find they had been locked out. The officials spoke on the condition of anonymity for fear of retaliation.",
      "One of the hardest hit offices was the Pantex Plant near Amarillo, Texas, which saw about 30% of the cuts. Those employees work on reassembling warheads, one of the most sensitive jobs across the nuclear weapons enterprise, with the highest levels of clearance.",
      "The hundreds let go at NNSA were part of a DOGE purge across the Department of Energy that targeted about 2,000 employees.",
      "\"The DOGE people are coming in with absolutely no knowledge of what these departments are responsible for,\" said Daryl Kimball, executive director of the Arms Control Association, referencing Elon Musk's Department of Government Efficiency team. \"They don't seem to realize that it's actually the department of nuclear weapons more than it is the Department of Energy.\"",
      "By late Friday night, the agency's acting director, Teresa Robbins, issued a memo rescinding the firings for all but 28 of those hundreds of fired staff members.",
      "\"This letter serves as formal notification that the termination decision issued to you on Feb. 13, 2025 has been rescinded, effective immediately,\" said the memo, which was obtained by the AP.",
      "The accounts from the three officials contradict an official statement from the Department of Energy, which said fewer than 50 National Nuclear Security Administration staffers had been let go, referring to them as \"probationary employees\" who \"held primarily administrative and clerical roles.\"",
      "But that wasn't the case. The firings prompted one NNSA senior staffer to post a warning and call to action.",
      "\"This is a pivotal moment. We must decide whether we are truly committed to leading on the world stage or if we are content with undermining the very systems that secure our nation's future,\" deputy division director Rob Plonski posted to LinkedIn. \"Cutting the federal workforce responsible for these functions may be seen as reckless at best and adversarily opportunistic at worst.\"",
      "While some of the Energy Department employees who were fired dealt with energy efficiency and the effects of climate change, issues not seen as priorities by the Trump administration, many others dealt with nuclear issues, even if they didn't directly work on weapons programs. This included managing massive radioactive waste sites and ensuring the material there doesn't further contaminate nearby communities.",
      "That incudes the Savannah River National Laboratory in Jackson, South Carolina; the Hanford Nuclear Site in Washington state, where workers secure 177 high-level waste tanks from the site's previous work producing plutonium for the atomic bomb; and the Oak Ridge Reservation in Tennessee, a Superfund contamination site where much of the early work on the Manhattan Project was done, among others.",
      "Rep. Marcy Kaptur of Ohio and Sen. Patty Murray of Washington, both Democrats, called the firings last week \"utterly callous and dangerous.\"",
      "Not all of the NNSA staff who had been reinstated could be reached after they were fired, and some were reconsidering whether to return to work, given the uncertainty created by DOGE.",
      "Many federal employees who had worked on the nation's nuclear programs had spent their entire careers there, and there was a wave of retirements in recent years that cost the agency years of institutional knowledge.",
      "But it's now in the midst of a major $750 billion nuclear weapons modernization effort \u2014 including new land-based intercontinental ballistic missiles, new stealth bombers and new submarine-launched warheads. In response, the labs have aggressively hired over the past few years: In 2023, 60% of the workforce had been there five years or less.",

    "title": "Trump's firings put 90-year-old Supreme Court precedent in crosshairs",
    "published": "Mon, 17 Feb 2025 09:11:47 -0500",
    "summary": "President Trump has terminated the heads of the National Labor Relations Board and the Merit Systems Protection Board, sparking legal challenges over their removal.",
    "story": [
      "Washington \u2014 President Trump's firings of the members of independent agencies and boards have prompted a string of legal fights that could set the Supreme Court up to reconsider and potentially overturn a 90-year-old decision that shields certain executive branch officials from being removed after political shifts in the White House.",
      "Since returning to the presidency, Mr. Trump has terminated the heads of the National Labor Relations Board and the Merit Systems Protection Board, as well as the director of the Office of Government Ethics and the special counsel, Hampton Dellinger, who oversees the office that investigates whistleblower complaints.",
      "The officials learned of their firings through emails stating that they had been removed from their respective positions at their agencies, according to court filings.",
      "But in subsequent lawsuits challenging their removal, some of the officials have alleged that Mr. Trump violated federal laws passed by Congress that created the agencies and limited the president to removing their members only for cause \u2014 in cases of neglect of duty or malfeasance.",
      "The president has said the heads of executive branch agencies should share his administration's objectives, but the firings may have also been aimed at provoking these very legal challenges, with the ultimate goal of addressing the question to the Supreme Court.",
      "\"It really was kind of a matter of time before a test case made its way to the court, where the court would have a chance to overrule Humphrey's,\" Joel Alicea, a law professor at the Catholic University of America, told CBS News.",
      "Alicea was referring to the Supreme Court's 1935 decision in the case Humphrey's Executor v. United States, in which the court carved out an exception to the president's power to remove executive officers. William Humphrey, appointed to a second term on the Federal Trade Commission by President Herbert Hoover, was asked to resign by President Franklin Roosevelt. The new president then fired him, citing their policy differences, rather than dismissing him for cause. The case is referred to a Humphrey's Executor because he died not long after his firing, but the executors of his estate brought the case to pursue his back pay.",
      "In Humphrey's Executor, the Supreme Court found that Congress could impose for-cause removal protections to multi-member commissions of experts that are balanced along partisan lines and do not exercise any executive power. The high court recognized another exception in 1988, which applies to certain inferior officers who have limited duties and lack policymaking or significant administrative authority.",
      "In recent years, though, the Supreme Court has chipped away at its 1935 ruling and reasserted the president's power to remove executive branch officers at will. Most notably in 2020, the Supreme Court ruled that the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau's structure of a single leader removable only for inefficiency, neglect or malfeasance is unconstitutional.",
      "\"In our constitutional system, the executive power belongs to the president, and that power generally includes the ability to supervise and remove the agents who wield executive power in his stead,\" Chief Justice John Roberts wrote for the court's conservative majority. \"While we have previously upheld limits on the president's removal authority in certain contexts, we decline to do so when it comes to principal officers who, acting alone, wield significant executive power.\"",
      "Now, nearly five years later, the high court is on track to revisit the issue of the president's removal power and could overturn the nearly century-old ruling allowing Congress to protect the members of independent agencies from being fired at will.",
      "In what is likely to be the Trump administration's first\u00a0Supreme Court\u00a0emergency appeal of his second term, the solicitor general is expected to ask the high court to\u00a0permit Dellinger's firing, according to documents obtained Sunday.",
      "Two justices, Clarence Thomas and Neil Gorsuch, who was appointed by Mr. Trump, have already indicated that it's time for the Supreme Court to scrap its 1935 precedent.",
      "\"The decision in Humphrey's Executor poses a direct threat to our constitutional structure and, as a result, the liberty of the American people,\" Thomas wrote in a concurring opinion to its 2020 decision on the CFPB, which was joined by Gorsuch.",
      "Thomas, the longest-serving member of the court, said that in a future case, he \"would repudiate what is left of this erroneous precedent.\"",
      "Three more members of the court, Roberts and Justices Brett Kavanaugh and Samuel Alito, all have experience working in the executive branch that could have shaped their views on executive power.",
      "\"This has nothing to do with the justices' ideological leanings or which president appointed them,\" Alicea said. \"This has to do with deeply held views about the nature of presidential removal under Article II of the Constitution, and these are views that some of these justices have had for decades.\"",
      "At least one of the officials fired by Mr. Trump recognized that she may be part of a broader plan to target the Supreme Court's 1935 ruling. Gwynne Wilcox, the chair of the National Labor Relations Board, received an email on behalf of the president on Jan. 27 informing her and the agency's general counsel that they had been \"removed from the office of members of the National Labor Relations Board.\"",
      "But the National Labor Relations Act, passed by Congress in 1935, restricts the reasons for removal of board members to \"neglect of duty or malfeasance in office,\" and requires that they receive \"notice and hearing.\"",
      "Mr. Trump's firing of Wilcox was a \"blatant violation\" of that law, she wrote in a lawsuit challenging her removal. But Wilcox also said that the president's action was \"apparently designed to test Congress's power to create independent agencies like the board.\"",
      "\"Although Ms. Wilcox has no desire to aid the president in establishing a test case, she is also cognizant of the fact that, if no challenge is made, the president will have effectively succeeded in rendering the NLRA's protections \u2014 and, by extension, that of other independent agencies \u2014 nugatory,\" her lawyers wrote.",
      "Citing Humphrey's Executor, Wilcox's legal team wrote that Congress has relied on that decision for decades when structuring independent agencies and warned that \"abandoning it now could cast a cloud over a wide variety of agency decision-making.\"",
      "But Alicea said that if Humphrey's Executor is reversed, it would bring these agencies under the direction of the president.",
      "\"The American people will have more control over their own government by having a president who they elect that superintends the entire federal bureaucracy, and I think that's a much better and much healthier constitutional structure than what we've had since the New Deal, where you have agencies that are largely insulated from direct presidential control and oversight, and therefore less politically accountable to the American people,\" he said.",
      "The Trump administration, too, has laid out its roadmap: It plans to urge the Supreme Court to overrule Humphrey's Executor.",
      "In a letter to Sen. Dick Durbin, the top Democrat on the Judiciary Committee, dated Wednesday, acting Solicitor General Sarah Harris said the Justice Department believes certain for-cause removal provisions that apply to members of multi-member commissions are unconstitutional.",
      "The department, she wrote, will no longer defend the constitutionality of those provisions. Harris specifically pointed to the protections for members of three agencies that the Trump administration believes violate the Constitution: the Federal Trade Commission, the National Labor Relations Board and the Consumer Product Safety Commission.",
      "\"To the extent that Humphrey's Executor requires otherwise, the department intends to urge the Supreme Court to overrule that decision, which prevents the president from adequately supervising principal officers in the executive branch who execute the laws on the president's behalf, and which has already been severely eroded by recent Supreme Court decisions,\" Harris wrote.",
      "As acting solicitor general, Harris represents the federal government before the Supreme Court. Mr. Trump has nominated D. John Sauer, his former defense attorney, for the role but he has not yet been confirmed.",
      "Durbin, an Illinois Democrat, said in response to Harris' letter that it's been the law of the land for decades that members of bipartisan, independent agencies are protected from removal by the president and can only be terminated for cause.",
      "\"But under President Trump, the Justice Department will no longer defend these duly-enacted laws and will instead push the Supreme Court to overturn a nearly-century-old Supreme Court precedent upholding the constitutionality of these statutes,\" he said in a statement. \"This is a striking reversal of the Justice Department's longstanding position under Republican and Democratic presidents alike, but not surprising from an administration that is only looking out for wealthy special interests \u2014 not the American people.\"",

      "This final one, which began after a 54-46 loss to North Carolina State on Dec. 3, 2020, had filled up the 18,000-seat arena game after game where people eagerly came to watch the Gamecocks pile up victories.",

      "You met earlier with Prime Minister Netanyahu. He said he's lockstep with the Trump administration, but he can't share details on \u2013 quote \u2013 \"when the gates of hell will be open if all our hostages are not released.\"",
      "Did he tell you he wants to keep talks going to get to phase two of this hostage deal?",
      "MARCO RUBIO (U.S. Secretary of State): Well, I think we share a common goal. We want to see every hostage released.",
      "Frankly, I think \u2013 and the president has said this \u2013 we want to see them out as soon as we possibly can. And \u2013 and, certainly, you know, the world has watched these images of people \u2013 and it's just heartbreaking to remember that some of them have been now almost two years there. It's a horrifying situation.",
      "So we coordinate and work very close with them. We share the goal that every hostage needs to come home, every single one, without delay. Obviously, the \u2013 there are details of how we're pursuing that and coordinating that we're not going to share publicly because we don't want to endanger the hostages and we don't want to endanger this process.",
      "But suffice it to say that, if it was up to us, every one of these hostages would be home right now, and we want it to happen as soon as possible.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: OK. So, the deal stands?",
      "SECRETARY MARCO RUBIO: Again, we want every hostage out as soon as possible.",

      "There are some that are supposed to \u2013 under the deal, there are some that are supposed to be released coming up next weekend. We expect that to happen, but we'd like to see them all come out. We're not going to \u2013 we're not in favor of waiting weeks and weeks.",
      "Now, that may be the process that's in place because of the deal, but we would like to see them all out as soon as possible, and we continue to coordinate. And that \u2013 that's what we'd like to see as the outcome.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Yes.",
      "SECRETARY MARCO RUBIO: Who wouldn't want all these hostages to be home and with their families?",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Understood.",
      "Want to ask you about Iran as well. President Trump has said he wants a diplomatic deal with Iran. Are you reaching out to them? And alongside that, does the U.S. support a preemptive strike by Israel on Iran to take out its nuclear program?",
      "SECRETARY MARCO RUBIO: Well, first of all, Israel will always have to act in what they believe is their national interest and their national defense.",
      "And so I'm not going to speak about whatever strategies they may have on this or any other topic. I will say that we don't have any outreach from Iran. We haven't seen any. And, ultimately, we've seen in the past that efforts that Iran has undertaken diplomatically have been only about how to extend the time frame that \u2013 but continue to enrich and re \u2013 and \u2013 and in addition to sponsor terrorism, in addition to build these long-range weapons, in addition to sow instability throughout the region.",
      "But let's be clear. There's been zero outreach or interest to date from Iran about any negotiated deal. Ideally, yes, I would love to wake up one day and hear the news that Iran has decided not to pursue a nuclear weapon, not to sponsor terrorism, and reengage in the world as a \u2013 as a \u2013 as a normal government.",
      "We've had no indication of any of that, not just now, but for 30 years.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: So you head from Israel to Saudi Arabia next. I know you'll be talking about Gaza, but we've also learned that Saudi Arabia is trying to facilitate this diplomacy with Russia about Ukraine.",
      "Which Russian officials do you expect to be meeting with? And what will the focus of your talks there be? Do you actually believe Vladimir Putin is ready to negotiate and make concessions?",
      "SECRETARY MARCO RUBIO: Well, here's what I know.",
      "I know President Trump spoke to Vladimir Putin last week. And, in it, Vladimir Putin expressed his interest in peace, and the president expressed his desire to see an end to this conflict in a way that was enduring and that protected Ukrainian sovereignty, and that was an enduring peace, not that we're going to have another invasion in three or four years.",
      "That's a good call. Now, obviously, it has to be followed up by action. So, the next few weeks and days will determine whether it's serious or not. Ultimately, one phone call does not make peace. One phone call does not solve a war as complex as this one.",
      "But I can tell you that Donald Trump is the only leader in the world that could potentially begin that process. Other leaders have tried. They have not been able to do so. When he ran in his campaign and he was elected as president, one of his promises was, he would work to bring an end to this conflict in a way that's sustainable and fair.",
      "And, obviously, you know, this is the first step in that process, but we have a long ways to go. Again, one call doesn't make it. One meeting wouldn't make it. This \u2013 there's a lot of work to be done. But I \u2013 I thought it has \u2013 you know, even the longest journey begins with the first step.",
      "So we'll see what happens from here, hopefully good things.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Who will you be meeting with?",
      "SECRETARY MARCO RUBIO: Well, nothing's been finalized yet. I was scheduled to be in Saudi Arabia anyways.",
      "We invited \u2013 we announced that trip a week ago, and \u2013 a week-and-a-half ago. So, ultimately, look, if at any point in time there's an opportunity to continue the work that President Trump started last week to begin to create an opening for a broader conversation, that it would involve Ukraine and would involve the end of the war, and would involve our allies all over the world, particularly in Europe, we're going to explore it, if that opportunity presents itself.",
      "I don't have any details for you this morning, other than to say that we stand ready to follow the president's lead on this and begin to explore ways, if those opportunities present itself, to begin a process towards peace.",
      "Now, a process towards peace is not a one-meeting thing. This war has been going on for a while.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Right.",
      "SECRETARY MARCO RUBIO: It's difficult. It's complicated. It's been bloody. It's been costly. So it will not be easy to end the conflict in this.",
      "And there are other parties at stake that have opinions on this as well. The European Union has sanctions as well. The Ukrainians are obviously fighting this war. It's their country, and they're on the front lines. So, one meeting isn't going to solve it.",
      "But I want to reiterate the president made clear he wants to end this war, and if opportunities present themselves to further that, we're going to take them if they present themselves. We'll see what happens over the next few days.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: But, to be clear, Keith Kellogg, who is the envoy appointed to help with these talks, says these are going to be parallel negotiations, meaning the Ukrainians and Russians aren't talking to each other yet.",
      "When you meet with your Russian counterpart, whoever that is, are you going to be sitting there arguing Ukraine's position?",
      "SECRETARY MARCO RUBIO: Well, first of all, I think that we have to understand is, right now, there is no process.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Right.",
      "SECRETARY MARCO RUBIO: What \u2013 what we have right now is a call between Putin and President Trump in which both sides expressed an interest in ending this conflict.",
      "I imagine there will be follow-up conversations to figure out what a process to talk about that would look like. And then, at that point, perhaps we can begin to share more details. So it's a bit premature. I know there's been a lot of reaction to it, because there's been no conversation about it, any serious conversation.",
      "But I want to go back to the point I made. President Trump ran. He was very clear. He thinks this war needs to end. And if he sees an opportunity to end it, which is what he's looking for, whether there is an opportunity or not, we're going to pursue it.",
      "Ultimately, it will reach a point when you are \u2013 if it's real negotiations, and we're not there yet, but if that were to happen, Ukraine will have to be involved, because they're the one that were invaded, and the Europeans will have to be involved because they're the \u2013 they have sanctions on Putin and Russia as well, and \u2013 and they've contributed to this effort.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Yes.",
      "SECRETARY MARCO RUBIO: We're just not there yet. We really aren't, but hopefully we will be, because we'd all like to see this war end.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: No doubt.",
      "The last administration did have contact through the intelligence agencies with Russia, but they didn't believe there was any proof that Vladimir Putin was interested in talks. You know the history with Vladimir Putin. He likes to use diplomacy as a cover to distract while he continues to wage war.",
      "Do you trust that this time is different?",
      "SECRETARY MARCO RUBIO: Yes, I don't think, in geopolitics, anyone should trust anyone. I think these things have to be verified through actions.",
      "I said yesterday that peace is not a noun. It's a verb. It's an action. You have to take concrete steps towards it. What I can tell you is, I know of no better negotiator in American politics than President Trump.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Yes.",
      "SECRETARY MARCO RUBIO: I don't \u2013 I think President Trump will know very quickly whether to say, is this a real thing or whether this is an effort to buy time.",
      "But I don't want to prejudge that. I don't want to foreclose the opportunity to end a conflict that's already cost the lives of hundreds of thousands and continues every single day to be increasingly a war of attrition on both sides.",
      "I think everyone should be celebrating the fact that we have an American president that is seeking to promote peace in the world, not start wars, but end them, in a way that's enduring.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Right.",
      "SECRETARY MARCO RUBIO: That's something we should be happy about. Whether it's possible or not, we're certainly willing, but it's not entirely up to us, obviously, but we'll find out.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Well, you did speak in a phone call with Russia's top diplomat, Sergey Lavrov. The Russian side claimed that you discussed restoring trade, which seemed to be a nod to sanctions, easing restrictions on diplomats, and other gestures like a high-level leaders meeting.",
      "Are you actually considering, is the Trump administration considering lifting sanctions on Russia?",
      "SECRETARY MARCO RUBIO: Well, the phone call was to establish communications that are consistent with the call the president made last week with Vladimir Putin, because if we are \u2013 if there is going to be the possibility of \u2013 of progress here towards peace, we are going to need to talk to the Russians.",
      "I mean, that is going to have to happen, and we're going to have to be able to be able to do it across our channels.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: About lifting sanctions, though?",
      "SECRETARY MARCO RUBIO: I also raised in that conversation concerns that \u2013 well, we didn't go into any details.",
      "I mean, what we just discussed is basically the ability to begin communicating. I had never spoken to Mr. Lavrov in my life, so it was an opportunity for us to begin to open that channel of communication, which, again, if there's the potential for peace here, that's a channel that has to exist.",
      "But let me add one more thing. I also raised the issue of our embassy in Moscow, which operates under very difficult conditions. I raised that because it's important. It's going to be very difficult to engage in communication with Russia about anything if our embassy is not functioning. And he raised concerns about his diplomatic mission in the United States.",
      "So, at a very basic level, if, in fact, there is going to be an opportunity here to pursue peace by engaging with the Russians, we're going to need to have functional embassies in Moscow and in Washington, D.C., and that's certainly something foreign ministers would talk about as a matter of normal course.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: I want to ask you about what happened in Munich, Germany, at the Security Conference.",
      "Vice President Vance gave a speech, and he told U.S. allies that the threat he worries about the most is not Russia. It is not China. He called it the threat from within, and he lectured about what he described as censorship, mainly focusing, though, on including more views from the right.",
      "He also met with the leader of a far-right party known as the AfD, which, as you know, is under investigation and monitoring by German intelligence because of extremism. What did all of this accomplish, other than irritating our allies?",
      "SECRETARY MARCO RUBIO: Why would our allies or anybody be irritated by free speech and by someone giving their opinion?",
      "We are, after all, democracies. The Munich \u2013 Munich Security Conference is largely a conference of democracies, in which one of the things that we cherish and value is the ability to speak freely and provide your opinions.",
      "And so I think if anyone's angry about his words, they don't have to agree with him, but to be angry about it, I think, actually makes his point. I thought it was actually a pretty historic speech. Whether you agree with him or not, I think the valid points he's making to Europe is, we are concerned that the true values that we share, the values that bind us together with Europe are things like free speech and democracy and our shared history in winning two World Wars and defeating Soviet communism and the like.",
      "These are the values that we shared in common. And, in that Cold War, we fought against things like censorship and oppression and so forth.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Right.",
      "SECRETARY MARCO RUBIO: And when you see backsliding, and you raise that, that's a very valid concern.",
      "We can't tell them how to run their countries. We are \u2013 he simply expressed in a speech his view of it, which a lot of people, frankly, share. And I thought he said a lot of things in that speech that needed to be said. And, honestly, I don't know why anybody would be upset about it.",
      "People are allowed \u2013 you know, you don't have to agree on someone's speech. I happen to agree with a lot of what he said, but you don't have to agree with someone's speech to \u2013 to at least appreciate the fact they have a right to say it and that you should listen to it and see whether those criticisms are valid.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Yes.",
      "SECRETARY MARCO RUBIO: I assure you, the United States has come under withering criticism on many occasions from many leaders in Europe, and we don't go around throwing temper tantrums about it.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Well, he was standing in a country where free speech was weaponized to conduct a genocide.",
      "And he met with the head of a political party that has far right views and some historic ties to extreme groups. The context of that was changing the tone of it. And you know that, that the censorship was specifically about the right.",
      "SECRETARY MARCO RUBIO: Well, I have to disagree with you. No, I have \u2013 I have to disagree with you.",
      "Free speech was not used to conduct a genocide. The genocide was conducted by an authoritarian Nazi regime that happened to also be genocidal because they hated Jews and they hated minorities and they hated those that they \u2013 they had a list of people they hated, but primarily the Jews. There was no free speech in Nazi Germany. There was none.",
      "There was also no opposition in Nazi Germany. They were a sole and only party that governed that country. So that's not an accurate reflection of history.",
      "I also think it's wrong \u2013 again, I go back to the point of his speech. The point of his speech was basically that there is an erosion in free speech and intolerance for opposing points of view within Europe, and that's of concern, because that is eroding. That's not an erosion of your military capabilities. That's not an erosion of your economic standing.",
      "That's an erosion of the actual values that bind us together in this transatlantic union that everybody talks about. And I think allies and friends and partners that have worked together now for 80 years should be able to speak frankly to one another in open forums without being offended, insulted, or upset.",
      "And I spoke to Foreign Ministers from multiple countries throughout Europe. Many of them probably didn't like the speech or didn't agree with it, but they were continuing to engage with us on all sorts of issues that unite us.",
      "So, again, at the end of the day, I think that, you know, people give all - - that is a forum in which you're supposed to be inviting people to give speeches, not basically a chorus where everyone is saying the exact same thing. That's not always going to be the case when it's a collection of democracies where leaders have the right and the privilege to speak their minds in forums such as these.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Mr. Secretary, I'm told that we are out of time. A lot to get through with you. We appreciate you making time today.",
      "SECRETARY MARCO RUBIO: Yes.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: We'll be back in a minute.",
      "(ANNOUNCEMENTS)",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: We want to turn now to the economy and inflation, which, compared to last January, ticked up about 3 percent last week.",
      "Kevin Hassett is the director of the National Economic Council, and he joins us now. Good morning to you, Director.",
      "KEVIN HASSETT (Director, National Economic Council): Good morning, Margaret. Good morning.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: So, I don't have to tell you, but the rest of the country saw their egg prices at the grocery store go up. We're now at a record high due to that bird flu outbreak, but also labor costs, and that's contributing to food costs overall.",
      "When will the administration get that outbreak under control?",
      "KEVIN HASSETT: Right.",
      "Well, what's going on, right, as you know, is that there is an inflation problem that's very large. We saw the Consumer Price Index come out, and we found out that the stagflation that was created by the policies of President Biden was way worse than we thought.",
      "Over the last three months, across all goods, including eggs, the average inflation rate was 4.6 percent, way above target, and an acceleration at the end of the Biden term.",
      "And, you know, this is really not just us. You could go look at Jason Furman, Larry Summers, economic advisers of President Biden kept saying, don't do this. You're going to cause massive inflation. In fact, Jason Furman has a very thought-provoking peace in \"Foreign Affairs\" right now calling the Biden economic record a tragedy.",
      "And this is them, not us, right? It's \u2013 so, now we've got a lot of things that we're doing to get ahold of it.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: You're talking about fiscal spending there.",
      "KEVIN HASSETT: Excuse me. Yes, that's right.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: You were talking about fiscal spending there. But\u2026",
      "KEVIN HASSETT: Well, where does inflation come from, right? And so what we're doing now is, we've \u2013 we've got, really, a multi-multi-faceted plan to end inflation.",
      "And I will go quickly, because I want to end with what we're doing with egg prices. But we're going to have a macroeconomic change that has supply-side tax cuts, so we have more supply, and we're going to reduce government spending, both through what DOGE is doing, and through congressional action.",
      "And so, therefore, the macroeconomic forces that Jason Furman said were a tragedy are going to be reversed. That's a good thing. Then we're also going to have a lot of energy production, a lot of deregulation. And then, finally, when needed, we're going to focus on the individual thing-by-thing pieces.",
      "And so, for example, you mentioned avian flu. President Biden didn't really have a plan for avian flu. Well, Brooke Rollins and I have been working with all the best people in government, including academics around the country and around the world, to have a plan ready for the president next week on what we're going to do with avian flu.",
      "In fact, I was editing the thing with them tomorrow. But \u2013 but the final thing \u2013 and then I will give it back to you. I promise not to filibuster.",
      "(LAUGHTER)",
      "KEVIN HASSETT: The question is, like, why did we do this? Why did we do this? That's what everybody's talking about.",
      "But the thing that I always start with when I'm looking at what we're doing, what the president wants us to do, is, why did they do that? Why did they do that?",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Right. Right.",
      "KEVIN HASSETT: And \u2013 and there are too many times where it feels like nobody thought about that in the press, or maybe\u2026",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Oh, gosh.",
      "KEVIN HASSETT: \u2026 the left wing economists. Why did they do that? Why did Biden print so much money and cause so much inflation? Why did he do it?",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Oh, Kevin.",
      "KEVIN HASSETT: That's \u2013 that's what I'm thinking about.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Kevin, you know, we talked about that on Face the Nation quite a lot. Quite a lot.",
      "KEVIN HASSETT: I don't want \u2013 mean to criticize you. OK, good for you.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: No, no, no.",
      "KEVIN HASSETT: Yes.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: So, next week, we'll see the plan on how to get avian flu \u2013 how to get bird flu, under\u2026",
      "KEVIN HASSETT: I could talk about it right now if you'd like to, yes.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Well, sure. What \u2013 what is the plan? Are you going to - - what are you going to do?",
      "KEVIN HASSETT: Yes, so \u2013 so, again, the \u2013 the Biden plan was to just, you know, kill chickens. And they spent billions of dollars just randomly killing chickens within a perimeter where they found a sick chicken.",
      "And so you go \u2013 I just went to the grocery store. I shop for our family, in part because I love to look at prices. And there were no eggs at the store yesterday, just a few. And \u2013 and so that happened because they killed all the chickens.",
      "And so what we need to do is have better ways, with biosecurity and medication and so on, to make sure that the perimeter doesn't have to kill the chickens, have a better, smarter perimeter. And so having a smart perimeter is what we're working on. And we're finalizing the ideas about how to do that with the best scientists in government.",
      "And that's the kind of thing that should have happened a year ago. And if it had, then egg prices would be, you know, a lot better than they are now.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: OK.",
      "KEVIN HASSETT: But the avian flu is a real thing.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Yes.",
      "KEVIN HASSETT: And, by the way, it's spread mostly by ducks and geese. And so think about it. They're killing chickens to stop the spread, but chickens don't really fly. The \u2013 the spread is happening from the geese and the ducks.",
      "And so why does it make any sense to have a big perimeter of dead chickens, when it's the \u2013 the ducks and the geese that are spreading it?",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Well, the Department of Agriculture policy has been to kill those chickens, as you know.",
      "KEVIN HASSETT: Right.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: But we'll watch the details of that.",
      "KEVIN HASSETT: Sure.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: But let's get back to something the president said.",
      "Higher interest rates, as you know, are part of that battle against inflation that the Federal Reserve has been waging. But, this past week, the president called for interest rates to be lowered. Why does he think that's going to lower your grocery prices?",
      "KEVIN HASSETT: Well, first of all, I \u2013 I want to say that I, just this weekend, have arranged to begin once again regular lunches with Jay Powell at the Federal Reserve.",
      "And Jay and I have a long and collegial relationship. And I'm going to go over there with him and the other governors. So we're going to talk about our views about what's going on, and listen to his. And that collegiality has been going on for four years when I was here before, and the president very much values that.",
      "I think that the \u2013 the thing about\u2026",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: But that's not to influence?",
      "KEVIN HASSETT: \u2026 lower interest rates \u2013 no, I'm going to talk about \u2013 well, Jay is going to \u2013 Jay is an independent person.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Right.",
      "KEVIN HASSETT: The Fed independence is respected. And \u2013 and the point is, the president's opinion is also \u2013 can be heard. He's the president of the United States.",
      "But here's the thing that I think is interesting, that if we get inflation under control, then that takes the pressure off the Fed. And one way to tell whether markets think, are we getting inflation under control, is to look at longer-term interest rates that the Fed doesn't affect directly.",
      "And if you look at it, the 10-year Treasury rate has dropped about 40 basis points\u2026",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Yes.",
      "KEVIN HASSETT: \u2026 over the last couple of weeks while we announced our plan to control inflation.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Well\u2026",
      "KEVIN HASSETT: That saved the American people about $40 billion, about $40 billion, just from talking about the stuff that we're about to do.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: OK.",
      "KEVIN HASSETT: That's pretty good.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Right, but the president's statement contradicts economic policy. As you know\u2026",
      "KEVIN HASSETT: No. Inflation \u2013 no. Inflation rates are already \u2013 I'm saying the interest rates are already lower by 40 basis points. So, Interest rates are lower. The one that matters\u2026",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: You're briefing the president on it. OK.",
      "KEVIN HASSETT: \u2026 the most for the economy is maybe the 5- or 10- year rate.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: But on\u2026",
      "KEVIN HASSETT: Those the ones that matter the most. And those are down already. So the president's right about that.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Before we run out of time, I really want to make sure I get to you on tariffs.",
      "KEVIN HASSETT: OK, sure.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Because there's concern that that will add to prices.",
      "KEVIN HASSETT: Sure.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Because they'll be added on to consumers and what they pay.",
      "How are these reciprocal tariffs going to work? The president was tweeting he wants to put them on, like, 175 different countries that have a VAT tax, a value-added tax.",
      "KEVIN HASSETT: You know, we're talking to leaders of other countries all the time.",
      "Last night, into the wee hours of their morning and kind of a late night for me, I was talking to Minister Reynolds from the U.K. about this very matter. But here's the way I would like to think about it, that, right now, U.S. companies are spending \u2013 are paying foreign governments about $370 billion a year in tax, and foreign companies are paying the U.S. government about $57 billion in tax.",
      "And a lot of it is because of the VAT. But if we didn't have to pay the foreign governments tax, over 10 years, it'd be about $5 trillion of tax that U.S. citizens don't have to pay. That would more than pay for the tax cuts that we're debating right now.",
      "And so if we get some of that money back, either through tariffs, or for \u2013 obviously, if they reduce the tariffs of that, then that's good for Americans. It's going to put more money in their pockets.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Yes.",
      "KEVIN HASSETT: And \u2013 and that's what President Trump is \u2013 is trying to do.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Kevin Hassett, I would like to have you come back, sit at the table\u2026",
      "KEVIN HASSETT: Always.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: \u2026 and talk through this in \u2013 in more detail at another time. We have to leave it there for today.",
      "KEVIN HASSETT: Thanks. Happy \u2013 happy to be here.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Take care.",
      "A lot more \"Face the Nation\" in a moment.",

      "The Munich Security Conference is an annual gathering of heads of state and international security policymakers. It's one of the biggest conferences. And one of the biggest topics this year was the war in Ukraine.",
      "We spoke to two lawmakers earlier from Munich, including House Intelligence Committee Republican Dan Crenshaw. We asked him about President Zelenskyy's views regarding what's needed in a potential peace deal.",
      "(BEGIN VT)",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: I understand that he has asked not just for continued military support now, but security assurances in the event of a peace deal. What can you tell him about what to expect from America?",
      "REPRESENTATIVE DAN CRENSHAW (R-TX): Well, I just - I just came from a lunch where General Kellogg spoke. He's the special envoy leading this effort to establish peace. And he's very clear that the kind of peace we're talking about is a lasting peace, which, of course, involves security assurances.",
      "And part of that process is figuring out exactly what that means. Even the Ukrainians are talking about what that means. There's a variety of options, per se.",
      "I think the Europeans have to play a huge role in that. One of the things that gets talked about a lot is where do - European forces actually acting as a peacekeeping force.",
      "The Ukrainians clearly have a seat at the table and then the United States will be the intermediary as we try to establish a peace deal.",
      "But the Europeans need to demand a seat at the table by being uncomfortably aggressive, which is something they haven't done. You should be threatening things to Putin that actually make you uncomfortable because that's how - that's the only language Putin speaks is power. And when General Kellogg is at that table with Putin, he's only got a finite amount of leverage. And there's only so much more leverage that the U.S. can - can impose. And if anybody can do it, I think it's Donald Trump. And he's already - he's already said that, that nothing is off the table. Vice President Vance said that, nothing is off the table, economic, military. They will use the amount of leverage they can.",
      "My message to European leaders is, if we want to win, if we want a better outcome for Ukraine at the end of these peace talks, you need to be uncomfortably aggressive. You need to, not just bolster your own defense spending, I mean because that's a long-term issue, that's a long-term investment -",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Yes.",
      "REPRESENTATIVE DAN CRENSHAW: You need to be talking about where you're going to be putting actual troops on the ground. Stop following our lead and actually take the lead. Let us be actually holding you back. That would be an ideal situation and vastly change the power dynamic when dealing with Putin.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: There already is a military security alliance known as NATO. You are saying you think there should be something else or some other entity providing security assurances for Ukraine?",
      "REPRESENTATIVE DAN CRENSHAW: European soldiers. I mean, look, Europeans send aid, right? They send weapons. They do the same things we do. They - they - they match it, barely. My argument to them is you shouldn't be matching it, you should be doubling it. You should be tripling it. It's your continent.",
      "Zelenskyy had a - gave a speech today. He talked about a European army, right? So, there's - there's a lot of talk about this. Of course, there's NATO. That's - that's a security - that's a - that's a defensive alliance.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Right.",
      "REPRESENTATIVE DAN CRENSHAW: That's - that's - that's some - that's not an army. That's - they did this - we're talking about different things here.",
      "The Europeans need to come together, in my opinion, and have just a much stronger message towards Putin instead of finger wagging at us about what we're willing to give or not give in a peace deal.",
      "Again, I tell them, look, if you want a seat at the table, earn it. The Ukrainians have earned it. The Ukrainians have impressed everybody for the last three years. They've fought valiantly and courageously. They've earned my respect. They earned that seat at the table. We need to listen to their - to what they want. We listened to Zelenskyy.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: OK. You said that both President Trump and Vice President Vance were clear, nothing is off the table. However, the defense secretary, Pete Hegseth, did seem, in Brussels, to take things quite explicitly off the table. He said the U.S. does not want Ukraine in NATO and that Ukraine would not return to its pre-2014 borders, which acknowledges giving up some of Crimea and potentially the east.",
      "Do you think offering concessions before negotiations begin is a good strategy here?",
      "REPRESENTATIVE DAN CRENSHAW: Yes, the - I think you have to listen to the White House as a whole. They walked - they walked those back and -",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Yes.",
      "REPRESENTATIVE DAN CRENSHAW: And - and made it clear that nothing is off the - nothing is off the table. So, no, you walk into a negotiation with everything on the table and I think that's exactly what this White House is doing.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Yes.",
      "REPRESENTATIVE DAN CRENSHAW: It's less than a month since this administration has been in power and they want to move fast. And everybody's a little nervous. But I think they should be much more optimistic than they should be nervous.",
      "You needed a seismic shift here. This was not a sustainable operation in Ukraine. If Kamala Harris had been president, you'd be going along the same lines, which is basically funding this war until every Ukrainian is dead. That's not an end that we can accept.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: So -",
      "REPRESENTATIVE DAN CRENSHAW: There has to be some talk of negotiation. And I'll remind the American people, too, from our perspective, from American strategic deterrent's perspective, even getting Putin to that table to talk about an end to the war is -",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Yes.",
      "REPRESENTATIVE DAN CRENSHAW: Is a massive strategic win for us because it establishes back our deterrents over time.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Well, do you know that he is actually committing to come to the table? We don't have a commitment to actually negotiate from Vladimir Putin.",
      "REPRESENTATIVE DAN CRENSHAW: No, we don't.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: OK.",
      "REPRESENTATIVE DAN CRENSHAW: You know what would be really helpful? What I said before, if the EU was uncomfortably aggressive about it.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: OK. Got it.",
      "REPRESENTATIVE DAN CRENSHAW: Again, Putin only responds to power. And this is - this is what I remind western leaders here, too. Western - westerners don't speak that language. Westerns talk about negotiations and, you know, and good moral values that we share and we believe each other.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Yes.",
      "REPRESENTATIVE DAN CRENSHAW: That's not how the east works. They only respond to power.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: So, OK, on that point, Vladimir Putin, it sounds like you would agree, is an accused war criminal. He is a dictator. There is a warrant out for his arrest, as you know. He invaded Ukraine. He is clearly a U.S. adversary.",
      "But this past week President Trump said he'd love to have Putin back in the G-8, which would make him, again, a peer global leader. President Trump floated inviting him to the U.S. or even visiting Russia himself. Do you think any of that is appropriate?",
      "REPRESENTATIVE DAN CRENSHAW: It's more appropriate than not talking to him for the last two years, which is what President Biden did. Who did that help? It hasn't - it hasn't gotten us anywhere.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Talking is different than inviting him to the United States.",
      "REPRESENTATIVE DAN CRENSHAW: Right. Sure. I mean, you can parse it out however you like. But the reality is, is you're going to have to get him to the table somehow, right? And there's a carrot and a stick approach. Trump can use a lot - can use a lot of leverage. And then the Europeans can use a lot more leverage. But you also have that carrot approach. And Trump is good at that. He's good at flattering people in order to get them to the table. That is what we need. Whether we like it or not, that's what we need.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: But flattering a very brutal dictator who is pretty cunning, frankly, you really think that's a winning strategy?",

Kellogg just laughed at that. He's like, there is no way. There is absolutely no way that Donald Trump will be seen - he will not let himself go down in history as having sold out to Putin. He will not let that happen. He believes - just for the sake of his own legacy.",

      "(BEGIN VT)",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: In terms of negotiations, there were some comments made by President Trump this week. The defense secretary said returning to Ukraine's pre-2014 borders is unrealistic. He's suggesting that maybe the east and another part of Ukraine and Crimea will be taken by Russia. Why do you think there was this plan to give concessions before talks begin?",
      "SENATOR JEANNE SHAHEEN (D-NH): Well, I think it was a mixed message coming from the administration. On the one hand you heard Secretary Hegseth saying they were going to take NATO off the table, that Ukraine needed to give up territory, and on the other hand you had Vice President Vance saying that everything should be on the table, including the possibility of putting boots on the ground in Ukraine.",
      "So, it's a mixed message. I hope that the upshot of that is that we are going to do everything we can to support Ukraine.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: In terms of what Congress can do, are your hands tied here or are some of your Republican colleagues willing to put something, perhaps, in an upcoming defense bill, for example, that might help Ukraine?",
      "SENATOR JEANNE SHAHEEN: Well, I think that's one option. One of the things that we're talking about doing right away is making some statements on the - the repossession of assets by Russia that are held in the United States and in Europe and the importance of having those assets go to Ukraine to help both with the execution of the military conflict, but also to think about rebuilding.",
      "Again, there's bipartisan support. There was bipartisan support for the bill and there's bipartisan support to continue to try and ensure that those assets from Russia get repaid to Ukraine because Russia is really the aggressor here and we need to hold Vladimir Putin accountable.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: You know, your Republican counterpart, Roger Wicker, he is the chair of the Armed Services Committee, was really sharp in his comments at Munich. He was saying, he was puzzled, he was disturbed by what the defense secretary, a member of his own party, had said about Ukraine. He was very clear that what Vladimir Putin is doing, he said, is absolutely out of Adolf Hitler's playbook. Those are sharp words considering the president of the United States says he wants to meet face-to-face to Vladimir Putin and possibly bring him to the White House.",
      "SENATOR JEANNE SHAHEEN: Well, they are sharp words and they are very much justified. Regardless of what President Trump may be doing to try and lay the groundwork for any future negotiations, the fact is there is strong bipartisan support in Congress to help Ukraine in this unfair war that Russia has initiated. And I think Senator Wicker's comments are very important.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: At the conference you're at, you were able to speak with European leaders. What are they saying to you about their view of America now?",
      "SENATOR JEANNE SHAHEEN: Well, we had a chance to meet with representatives from Britain, from Canada, not a European country but also very concerned about Ukraine, with people from the Balkan countries, with President Zelenskyy, obviously. And there is a great deal of concern about the U.S. position on Ukraine.",
      "At the panel that we had with President Zelenskyy, we talked about the importance of Europe and the United States acting in concert so that we can hold Putin accountable with sanctions so that we can - so that there is no daylight between the United States and our NATO allies and our European allies. Clearly that's what Vladimir Putin has been trying to do throughout this conflict, and we need to make it clear that that is not going to happen, that we are going to work together, and we are going to support Ukraine.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Does Congress need to be any part of approving this deal President Trump says he wants to take possession of some of the critical minerals that Ukraine has inside their territory? He says he wants to use that as sort of repayment for what the U.S. has spent on weapons.",
      "SENATOR JEANNE SHAHEEN: Well, I think there are some benefits to having the United States have some investments in Ukraine. That's part of what a critical minerals deal would do. It's not at all clear who - who has possession of those critical minerals. Some of them are in the eastern part of Ukraine where Russia controls the territory. Some of them are owned by private - actually oligarchs. There are several oligarchs who own a number of those critical mineral sites. So, I think those are details that have not yet been worked out and I have not seen the agreement that's been put in front of President Zelenskyy.",

      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Last week seven federal prosecutors resigned in objection after the Justice Department directed them to drop the investigation into New York City Mayor Eric Adams, who is facing charges, including bribery and conspiracy. In her resignation letter, Danielle Sassoon, the acting U.S. attorney overseeing the case, said a dismissal amounted to a quid pro quo and that the DOJ, quote, \"proposes dismissing the charges against Adams in return for his assistance in enforcing the federal immigration laws.\"",
      "In response, then Acting Deputy Attorney General Emil Bove threatened her with an investigation into her conduct.",
      "Joining us now is Maryland Democrat Jamie Raskin. He's the top Democrat on the House Judiciary Committee.",
      "This episode is highly unusual. Is there anything that you, in your role, can do about this episode and what's happening inside Attorney General Bondi's Justice Department?",
      "REPRESENTATIVE JAMIE RASKIN (D-MD): Well, the Justice Department is at war with its own attorneys, its own prosecutors. And the whole episode is just saturated with corruption. It was a corruption prosecution and investigation, which led to a grand jury indictment against Eric Adams for bribery, conspiracy, other corruption charges. And then the new Department of Justice decided to squash the whole thing, basically saying to Adams, well, we will drop this case against you if you engage in certain kinds of political or policy accommodations with us.",
      "And then, in order to complete that deeply corrupt bargain, they had to try to coerce their own lawyers to do it. But, of course, the prosecutors were saying, nothing has changed in the facts of the case and nothing has changed in the law. In fact, additional evidence was found, meaning that they were going to revise and expand the original indictment, but instead they were told to kill it for political reasons.",
      "And so, you know, this is an outrageous violation of the rules of prosecutors and an offense against due process in a very dangerous first move for the Department of Justice to be making under the Trump people.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Mayor Adams, of course, claims there was no quid pro quo and that none of this was wrong, but there was the lead prosecutor, as well, on this case who resigned in objection to what's happening. But it's moving forward here. This is all now in the hands of a judge. Does he have leeway to prosecute?",
      "REPRESENTATIVE JAMIE RASKIN: So, first of all, just about Danielle Sassoon. I mean that's a very conservative U.S. attorney, and she couldn't take it. I mean you have the most conservative prosecutors in the country resigning in opposition to this steam roller on behalf of corruption. But it's not over yet because Judge Dale Ho does not have to accept the withdrawal of the charges, the dismissal of the charges, which seven Department of Justice attorneys resigned rather than be involved in. The head of the public integrity section, the head of the criminal division, five other lawyers said, no way, and they wrote very stinging rebukes of the attorney general and the Department of Justice in this case.",
      "So, Judge Ho has to accept this dismissal, but he may not. He may go ahead and try to appoint another prosecutor to go ahead and, you know, go through with the indictment that was handed down by a grand jury.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Well, Attorney General Bondi says there's nothing wrong here, saying it was President Biden's weaponized DOJ that went after Adams for political reasons, and only after he criticized President Biden's immigration policies.",
      "This is a fellow Democrat. Do you think he should be prosecuted? And how do you respond to that allegation?",
      "REPRESENTATIVE JAMIE RASKIN: Well, first of all, the attorney general did not cite any changes in the facts of the case. She did not cite any changes in the law, because neither occurred, nor did she cite any irregularities in the investigation or the prosecution.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: She's saying it's all made up.",
      "REPRESENTATIVE JAMIE RASKIN: Well, then she's - she's mimicking her boss then, who just lies as a matter of course. One would expect more from the attorney general of the United States.",
      "And, you know, this whole corruption attack that is an attack on the Department of Justice for engaging in corruption prosecutions could be impeachable in a different political environment. But the fact that Mayor Adams is a Democrat is neither here nor there for me. I'm against corruption across the board. It seems like Donald Trump wants to attract all of the corrupt politicians in America to his side.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: So in the Oval Office President Trump - you may have seen this image - he has hung a picture, a framed picture of the front page of \"The New York Post,\" that has his mugshot in it from that criminal case in New York. Yesterday he also tweeted, \"he who saves his country does not violate any law.\"",
      "He seems to believe that all those prosecutions against him were politically motivated and voters apparently didn't think it mattered. He was elected with a mandate. How do you convince the public that it does matter?",
      "REPRESENTATIVE JAMIE RASKIN: The dominant objective of this administration is corruption and lawlessness. The first thing that they did was they sacked 17 inspectors general. Those are the people who are actual corruption fighters within the departments and agencies. These are the people who ferreted out $91 billion worth of waste, fraud and abuse in the government.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: They argue it's within their political power to do so.",
      "REPRESENTATIVE JAMIE RASKIN: Oh, it - there's no doubt it is, but they sacked them. Actually, it's not within their political power to do so in a lawless way. They have to notify Congress first, 30 days in advance, and they have to set forth the specific reasons for why an inspector general is being fired. They never did that.",
      "And the reason, of course, is because they want to pursue agendas of corruption across the board. They're saying they're not going to enforce the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act. They are shutting down the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau, which has saved American consumers $31 million in bank overdraft charges, credit card late fees from corporations completely inflated and having nothing to do with the actual charges and so on. They're getting rid of anything in the government that supports consumers, that supports citizens against the rip-off artists who are their friends.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: And there's little Democrats can do to push back because you don't have any political power.",
      "REPRESENTATIVE JAMIE RASKIN: Well, we're winning in court. More than a dozen federal injunctions and temporary restraining orders have been issued against everything from their illegal seizure of computer data and every Americans' private data at the Treasury Department.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: OK.",

      "\"We've removed these images for violating our policies and will continue monitoring for other violating posts. This is an industry-wide challenge, and we're continually working to improve our detection and enforcement technology,\" Meta spokesperson Erin Logan told CBS News in a statement emailed on Friday.",

      "How to spot deepfake images online",
      "An analysis of over a dozen of these images by Reality Defender, a platform that works to detect AI-generated media, showed that many of the photos were deepfake images \u2014 with AI-generated, underwear-clad bodies replacing the bodies of celebrities in otherwise real photographs. A few of the images were likely created using image stitching tools that do not involve AI, according to Reality Defender's analysis.",
      "\"Almost all deepfake pornography does not have the consent of the subject being deepfaked,\" Ben Colman, co-founder and CEO of Reality Defender told CBS News on Sunday. \"Such content is growing at a dizzying rate, especially as existing measures to stop such content are seldom implemented.\"",
      "CBS News has sought comments from Miranda Cosgrove, Jeanette McCurdy, Ariana Grande, and Maria Sharapova on this story. Johansson declined to issue any comment, according to a representative for the actor.",
      "Under Meta's Bullying and Harassment policy, the company prohibits \"derogatory sexualized photoshop or drawings\" on its platforms. The company also bans adult nudity, sexual activity and adult sexual exploitation, and its regulations are intended to block users from sharing or threatening to share non-consensual intimate imagery. Meta has also rolled out the use of \"AI info\" labels to clearly mark content that is AI manipulated.",
      "But questions remain over the effectiveness of the tech company's policing of such content. CBS News found dozens of AI-generated, sexualized images of Cosgrave and McCurdy still publicly available on Facebook even after the widespread sharing of such content, in violation of the company's terms, was flagged to Meta.",
      "One such deepfake image of Cosgrave that was still up over the weekend had been shared by an account with 2.8 million followers.",
      "The two actors \u2014 both former child stars on the Nickelodeon show iCarly, which is owned by CBS News' parent company Paramount Global \u2014 are the most prolifically targeted for deepfake content, based on the images of public figures that CBS News has analyzed.",
      "Meta's Oversight Board, a quasi-independent body that consists of experts in the field of human rights and freedom of speech, and makes recommendations for content moderation on Meta's platforms, told CBS News in an emailed statement that the company's current regulations around sexualized deepfake content are insufficient.",
      "The Oversight Board cited recommendations it has made to Meta over the past year,\u00a0 including urging the company to make its rules clearer by updating its prohibition against \"derogatory sexualized photoshop\" to specifically include the word \"non-consensual\" and to encompass other photo manipulation techniques such as AI.",
      "The board has also recommended that Meta fold its ban on \"derogatory sexualized photoshop\" into the company's Adult Sexual Exploitation regulations, so moderation of such content would be more rigorously enforced.",
      "Asked Monday by CBS News about the board's recommendations, Meta pointed to the guidelines on its transparency website, which show the company is assessing the feasibility of three of four recommendations from the oversight board and is implementing one of its suggestions, though Meta noted in its statement on its site that it is currently ruling out changing the language of its \"derogatory sexualized photoshop\" policy to include the phrase \"non consensual.\" Meta also says it is currently unlikely   to move its \"derogatory sexualized photoshop\" policy to within its Adult Sexual Exploitation regulations.",
      "Meta noted in its statement that it was still considering ways to signal a lack of consent in AI-generated images. Meta also said it was considering reforms to its Adult Sexual Exploitation policies, to \"capture the spirit\" of the board's recommendations.",
      "\"The Oversight Board has made clear that non-consensual deepfake intimate images are a serious violation of privacy and personal dignity, disproportionately harming women and girls. These images are not just a misuse of technology \u2014 they are a form of abuse that can have lasting consequences,\" Michael McConnell, an Oversight Board co-chair, told CBS News on Friday.",

    "story": [
      "Russia has freed a U.S. citizen arrested earlier this month on drug smuggling charges, according to Russian media reports and a U.S. official who spoke with The Associated Press. The move appeared to be an effort to ease tension between Moscow and Washington ahead of talks in Saudi Arabia on Tuesday, which are expected to focus on the war in Ukraine and the fragile ceasefire between Hamas and Israel in Gaza.",
      "Kalob Byers, 28, was detained on Feb. 7 at Moscow's Vnukovo airport after customs officials allegedly found cannabis-laced gummies or marmalade in his baggage. It was unclear from Russian media reports exactly what the purportedly-laced food products were.",
      "According to the reports, Byers had traveled from Istanbul with his Russian fiancee, who was also detained. The authorities said he had attempted to smuggle a \"significant amount\" of drugs into the country and put him in custody on the charges of drug smuggling, punishable by a prison term of up to 10 years.",
      "Byers has been released from custody and is in the U.S. embassy in Moscow where he is awaiting a flight home, Russian independent news outlet Meduza reported Monday, citing a Facebook post by his parents. A U.S. official confirmed to the AP that Byers was released to the embassy late on Sunday evening. The official spoke on condition of anonymity because they were not authorized to discuss sensitive matters.",
      "Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov told reporters Monday in response to a question about Byers that Moscow expected \"to discuss restoring the entire complex of Russian-American relations\" at the talks in Saudi Arabia on Tuesday, \"so certain events can be viewed in this context.\"",
      "Speaking to reporters Monday, however, State Department spokesperson Tammy Bruce said that, from the U.S. government's perspective, the conversations in Riyadh would be focused largely on the Ukraine war.",
      "\"There are a multitude of issues, obviously, that we're all interested in, but there is this larger issue of Ukraine that matters to everyone, and certainly it matters to President Trump,\" she said. \"He has made very clear that it's [the war] got to stop.\"",
      "It wasn't immediately clear Monday whether Byers' fiancee had also been released. Russian media reports identified her as Naida Mambetova and said she was placed in pre-trial detention on the same charges.",
      "Arrests of American nationals in Russia have become increasingly common in recent years, with relations between Moscow and Washington sinking to Cold War lows over the war in Ukraine. Some have been released in prisoner exchanges. The most recent one included Marc Fogel, a teacher from Pennsylvania imprisoned in Russia on charges similar to those Byers had faced.",
      "Fogel was detained in 2021 when traveling to Russia to work at a school and handed a 14-year sentence for having what his family and supporters said was medically prescribed marijuana. He was released and brought back to the U.S. earlier this month in a swap that saw Alexander Vinnik, a Russian cryptocurrency expert who faced Bitcoin fraud charges in the U.S., returned to Russia.",

      "Beijing\u00a0\u2014 China's Foreign Ministry took issue Monday with a revised U.S. government fact sheet that removed a line on American opposition to independence for Taiwan. The United States \"gravely backpedaled\" on its position on Taiwan and sent the wrong message to \"separatist forces\" on the island, ministry spokesperson Guo Jiakun said.",
      "Taiwan and China split in 1949 during the civil war that brought the communists to power in China. The defeated Nationalists fled to Taiwan and set up a rival government there. Taiwan has its own government and military but has never declared formal independence from China.",
      "\"We urge the U.S. to ... stop emboldening and supporting Taiwan independence and avoid further damaging China-U.S. relations and the peace and stability of the Taiwan Strait,\" Guo said when asked about the revision at a daily media briefing.",
      "The Taiwan Strait is a narrow waterway that separates the island of Taiwan from China's east coast.",
      "The U.S. State Department removed the phrase \"we do not support Taiwan independence\" from the fact sheet last week. The document on America's relations with the self-governing island is posted on its website.",
      "Taiwan's government welcomed the move, though a statement sent to The Associated Press on Monday did not mention the language specifically.",
      "\"The Ministry of Foreign Affairs has noted that the U.S. State Department updated the 'Current State of U.S.-Taiwan Relations' page ... with text that is positive and friendly toward us, reflecting the close and amicable partnership between Taiwan and the United States,\" it said.",
      "It's not the first time the State Department has removed the phrase. It did so in May 2022 but restored it a few weeks later after a strong protest from China.",
      "It's unclear why the State Department changed the language again and whether it signals any shift in policy under President Trump, who returned to the White House last month.",
      "The government in Taiwan is worried that Mr. Trump might not be as steadfast a supporter of the island as his predecessor, former President Joe Biden.",
      "The U.S. does not recognize Taiwan as a country but is its strongest backer and biggest arms supplier, and is bound by U.S. law to provide the island with the means and support required to defend itself from any attack or coercion.",

      "China, which has vowed to bring Taiwan back under its control, by force if necessary, has stepped up military exercises around the island of 23 million people in recent years. The U.S. government fact sheet says it expects \"differences to be resolved by peaceful means, free from coercion, in a manner acceptable to the people on both sides.\"",
      "The language in the document continues to state that the U.S. \"approach to Taiwan has remained consistent across decades and administrations,\" noting the \"longstanding one China policy,\" under which the U.S. has recognized the independent governance of the island without recognizing it as an independent national entity.",

      "\"We can't always share the details of this strategy with the public, including when the gates of hell will be opened, as they surely will if all our hostages are not released until the last one,\" the statement said. \"We will eliminate Hamas' military capability and its political rule in Gaza. We will bring all our hostages home, and we will ensure that Gaza never again poses a threat to Israel.\"",
      "Rubio was in Jerusalem on Sunday as part of a regional tour where he is likely to face pushback from Arab leaders over Mr. Trump's proposal to transfer the Palestinian population out of the Gaza Strip and redevelop it under U.S. ownership.",
      "Rubio told \"Face the Nation\" moderator Margaret Brennan after he met with Netanyahu, that the U.S. and Israel are working diligently to get the hostages home.",
      "\"Obviously, there are details of how we're pursuing that and coordinating that we're not going to share publicly because we don't want to endanger the hostages and we don't want to endanger this process,\" he said. \"But suffice it to say that if it was up to us, every one of these hostages would be home right now, and we want it to happen as soon as possible.\"",

      "Their remarks came just two weeks before the first phase of the shaky ceasefire between Israel and Gaza is set to end.\u00a0The second phase, in which Hamas is to release dozens of remaining hostages in exchange for more Palestinian prisoners, a lasting truce and the withdrawal of Israeli forces, has yet to be negotiated.",
      "Rubio said Hamas \"cannot continue as a military or government force.\"",

      "The Israeli military meanwhile said it carried out an airstrike Sunday on people who approached its forces in southern Gaza. The Hamas-run Interior Ministry said the strike killed three of its policemen while they were securing the entry of aid trucks near Rafah, on the Egyptian border.",
      "Hamas called the attack a \"serious violation\" of the ceasefire and accused Netanyahu of trying to sabotage the deal.",
      "Israel launched a 15-month war against Hamas in Gaza in response to the October 7 terrorist attack, which saw militants kill some 1,200 people in southern Israel and take 251 others hostage. The war killed more than 48,000 people in Gaza, according to the Palestinian territory's Hamas-run Health Ministry.",
      "On Saturday, Israel accepted the delivery of a consignment of MK-84 heavy bombs after Mr. Trump lifted a block placed on them by the Biden administration, Reuters reported. The MK-84 is an unguided 2,000-pound bomb, which can rip through thick concrete and metal, creating a wide blast radius.",
      "\"Peace through strength. You understand that, right? It's called peace through strength,\" Mr. Trump told reporters Sunday when asked about the weapons delivery. \"You know, they contracted for those weapons a long time under the Biden administration, and then Biden wouldn't deliver the weapons. But I look at a different thing. I say peace through strength. They were sitting there. Nobody knew what to do with them. They bought them.\"",

      "\"If we want to win, if we want a better outcome for Ukraine, at the end of these peace talks, you need to be uncomfortably aggressive,\" Crenshaw said of his message to European leaders on \"Face the Nation with Margaret Brennan.\"",
      "Crenshaw, speaking from the Munich Security Conference, was among a bipartisan group of lawmakers who met with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy at the annual security summit in recent days. They also heard from retired Lt. Gen. Keith Kellogg, the U.S. special envoy for Ukraine and Russia who is involved with handling the peace talks.",

      "Transcript: Rep. Dan Crenshaw on \"Face the Nation with Margaret Brennan\"",
      "The Texas Republican said Kellogg was \"very clear that what the kind of peace we're talking about is a lasting peace,\" which he said will involve security assurances. Crenshaw said exactly what that looks like is still being determined, while arguing that Europe must be a major player.",
      "Crenshaw said European countries need to not only bolster their defense spending, but also talk about \"where you're going to be putting actual troops on the ground.\"",
      "\"Stop following our lead and actually take the lead,\" Crenshaw said. \"Let us be actually holding you back. That would be an ideal situation, and vastly change the power dynamic when dealing with Putin.\"",
      "Crenshaw argued that if European leaders want a seat at the table, they should \"earn it.\"",
      "\"We listen to Zelenskyy,\" Crenshaw said. \"And I want to listen to other European leaders as well, but I want them to be uncomfortably aggressive, because that gives us more leverage in order to help Ukraine come out with a better outcome.\"",
      "The comments come as Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth has drawn criticism even among some Republicans in recent days for suggesting it was unrealistic for Ukraine to expect NATO membership. He also cast doubt that the country will be able to return to its pre-2014 borders, before Russia first invaded Ukraine and annexed Crimea. Hegseth later walked back those comments, saying that \"everything is on the table.\"",
      "Sen. Jeanne Shaheen of New Hampshire, the ranking Democrat on the Senate Foreign Relations Committee who also appeared on \"Face the Nation\" on Sunday, said the administration is sending a \"mixed message\" on Ukraine. She said she's hopeful that \"the upshot of that is that we are going to do everything we can to support Ukraine.\"",
      "But Crenshaw defended the White House's posture toward the possible peace talks, saying \"you have to listen to the White House as a whole,\" noting that the administration made clear that \"nothing is off the table.\"",
      "\"You walk into a negotiation with everything on the table. And I think that's exactly what this White House is doing,\" Crenshaw said, adding that \"there's a path forward here,\" although the details aren't yet clear.",
      "Crenshaw acknowledged that the U.S. hasn't yet received a commitment to negotiate from Putin, reiterating his request of European leaders to get \"uncomfortably aggressive\" with the Russian leader, who he said \"only responds to power.\"",

      "Barriers to good health",
      "The biggest obstacle that is keeping Americans from living healthier lives, Prato said, is lack of motivation to make changes.",

As highlighted by\u00a0Malwarebytes, a new wave of information stealers is taking over, and they are far more dangerous, going after passwords, authentication cookies, credit card details and even cryptocurrency.",
      "This shift started in mid-2023 with the arrival of\u00a0Atomic Stealer, also known as AMOS, a piece of malware that looked much more like something you would see on Windows than the typical Mac threats. AMOS was not just effective. It was easy to use and sold as a service \u00a0for $1,000 a month with a slick web-based control panel. That success led to the rise of even more dangerous variants.",

Once stolen, these credentials can be sold or used for fraud,\u00a0identity theft or further\u00a0cyberattacks. Because phishing apps require minimal code and fewer permissions than traditional malware, they are much easier to sneak onto app stores, including Google Play.",
      "Many phishing apps look like regular, fully functional software. Some impersonate games or utilities, while others appear as cracked versions of popular apps like TikTok, WhatsApp or Spotify.

Be wary of unsolicited emails or messages prompting you to download or install updates, especially if they contain links.\u00a0Phishing attempts often disguise themselves as legitimate update notifications or urgent messages.",
      "3. Keep your software updated: Ensure that both macOS, Android and all installed applications are up to date. Apple and Android frequently release security patches and updates that address vulnerabilities. Enable automatic updates for macOS, Android and your apps to stay protected without having to manually check for updates. If you need more help, see my\u00a0guide on keeping all your devices updated.",
      "4. Use strong and unique passwords:\u00a0To protect your Mac from malware, it\u2019s also crucial to use strong, unique passwords for all your accounts and devices. Avoid reusing passwords across different sites or services. A\u00a0password manager can be incredibly helpful here. It generates and stores complex passwords for you, making them difficult for hackers to crack.",
      "It also keeps track of all your passwords in one place and automatically fills them in when you log into accounts, so you don\u2019t have to remember them yourself. By reducing the number of passwords you need to recall, you\u2019re less likely to reuse them, which lowers the risk of security breaches. Get more details about my\u00a0best expert-reviewed Password Managers of 2025 here.",
      "5. Use two-factor authentication (2FA): Enable\u00a02FA for your important accounts, including your Apple ID, Google account, email and any financial services. This adds an extra step to the login process, making it harder for attackers to gain access even if they have your password.",

Android phishing apps are also becoming harder to detect and more widespread than ever. From stealing passwords and authentication cookies to intercepting OTPs and draining cryptocurrency wallets, these threats are growing in both sophistication and scale.

      "Cyberscams have reached alarming levels in the U.S., with nearly 30% of Americans falling victim to fraudulent schemes in the past year alone.",
      "The financial toll is staggering \u2014 scams cost Americans over $159 billion annually, with average individual losses now exceeding $3,500 per victim. This epidemic is not just a financial crisis but also a human rights issue, as many scams originate from forced labor operations in Southeast Asia.",
      "With nearly 90% of Americans targeted by scam attempts and 40% receiving suspicious messages daily, the question remains: how can we protect ourselves and hold perpetrators accountable in an increasingly digital world?",

      "The word scam with data in the background\u00a0\u00a0 (Kurt \"CyberGuy\" Knutsson)",
      "The mechanics of \"pig butchering\"",
      "One of the most pervasive scams today is the so-called \"pig butchering\" scheme. Originating in China and spreading across Southeast Asia, this scam involves criminals building trust with victims through social media or messaging apps. Once trust is established, victims are lured into fraudulent cryptocurrency investment schemes. These scams are meticulously crafted to appear legitimate, often involving fake trading platforms and simulated profits. Victims are encouraged to invest more until they are \"slaughtered,\" losing their\u00a0entire savings when the scammers vanish with their funds.",
      "9 WAYS SCAMMERS CAN USE YOUR PHONE NUMBER TO TRY TO TRICK YOU",
      "Forced labor behind these scam centers",
      "What makes these scams even more horrifying is their reliance on human trafficking. Criminal syndicates in countries like Myanmar, Cambodia and Laos force trafficked individuals to run these operations under threat of violence. These \"scam centers\" operate in lawless regions controlled by rebel groups or corrupt officials, making international intervention challenging. Survivors describe conditions akin to modern slavery, with physical abuse and even torture being common.",

      "BEST PRESIDENT\u2019S DAY DEALS",
      "Why America is a prime target",
      "Cyberscams have taken hold in the U.S. for several reasons that make it particularly vulnerable. As an American, you\u2019re likely connected to the digital world through social media platforms, messaging apps and other online tools. This high level of connectivity makes it easier for scammers to reach you directly, whether through a text message, email or social media chat. The sheer number of people online in the U.S. creates a vast pool of potential targets for cybercriminals.",
      "Additionally, the growing popularity of cryptocurrency in the U.S. has made it a\u00a0prime medium for fraud. Cryptocurrency transactions are fast, anonymous and difficult to trace, which makes them ideal for scammers looking to steal funds without leaving a trail. Many scams are designed to exploit this lack of transparency, leaving victims with little chance of recovering their money once it\u2019s gone.",
      "Another major issue is the lack of a centralized reporting system for cyberscams in the U.S. If you\u2019ve ever been scammed or know someone who has, you might have noticed how confusing it can be to figure out where to report the crime \u2014 whether to the FBI, the Federal Trade Commission (FTC) or another agency. This fragmented system not only makes it harder for victims to seek help but also prevents authorities from gathering comprehensive data to tackle the problem effectively. These factors combined have made Americans some of the most targeted individuals in the world when it comes to cyberscams.",

      "Several countries have implemented innovative measures to combat cyberscams, offering valuable lessons for the U.S. Singapore, for instance, has introduced a mandatory SMS Sender ID Registry (SSIR) that requires organizations to register their alphanumeric Sender IDs. This system effectively blocks unregistered SMS senders, significantly reducing impersonation scams. In fact, cases involving scam SMSes in Singapore fell by 70% over three months after mandating the SSIR.",
      "Britain has taken a different approach by establishing a dedicated \"159\" hotline, allowing residents to instantly verify suspicious calls. This simple yet effective system provides a quick way for individuals to check the legitimacy of unexpected communications, potentially preventing many scams before they occur.",
      "WHAT IS ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE (AI)?",
      "Many nations have also implemented stricter authentication measures, such as biometric checks and in-app verifications, which have proven highly effective in reducing fraud. For example, Singapore has required facial verification for higher-risk transactions through Singpass since 2022, resulting in no further reports of malware-enabled scams involving unauthorized CPF withdrawals since its implementation in June 2023.",
      "Some countries are exploring ways to slow down cryptocurrency transactions or cap transfer amounts, which could significantly hinder scammers who rely on quick, anonymous transfers. These measures, combined with a coordinated global response involving major victim nations like the U.S. and China, could prove instrumental in dismantling criminal networks more effectively. By learning from these international examples and adapting them to the American context, the U.S. could significantly strengthen its defenses against the rising tide of cyberscams.",

      "1. Verify before you act: Always verify the identity of the person or organization contacting you. Use official contact information to reach out directly and confirm the legitimacy of the request.",
      "2. Limit personal information sharing: Avoid sharing personal or financial information over the phone, email or online unless you are certain of the recipient's identity and legitimacy.",
      "3. Use strong, unique passwords for all your accounts:\u00a0A robust password should include a mix of uppercase and lowercase letters, numbers and symbols. Avoid reusing passwords across multiple platforms, and consider using a reputable\u00a0password manager to store and generate complex passwords securely.",
      "4. Enable two-factor authentication (2FA) wherever possible:\u00a02FA adds an extra layer of security by requiring a secondary verification method, such as a code sent to your phone or biometric authentication. This ensures that even if your password is compromised, unauthorized access remains highly unlikely.",
      "5. Keep your devices and software up to date:\u00a0By regularly installing the\u00a0latest updates and security patches, you can ensure your devices are equipped with the latest security features and bug fixes, reducing the risk of becoming a target for cyberattacks. Many cyberattacks exploit unpatched vulnerabilities, so enabling automatic updates for your operating system, apps and antivirus software can significantly reduce your risk.",
      "GET FOX BUSINESS ON THE GO BY CLICKING HERE",
      "6. Invest in personal data removal services: Consider using a service that specializes in removing your personal information from the internet to reduce your exposure to potential scammers. While no service promises to remove all your data from the internet, having a removal service is great if you want to constantly monitor and automate the process of removing your information from hundreds of sites continuously over a longer period of time.\u00a0Check out my top picks for data removal services here.",
      "7. Monitor financial accounts: Regularly check your bank and credit card statements for any unusual or unauthorized transactions. Promptly report any suspicious activity.",
      "8. Be skeptical of unsolicited requests: Treat unexpected requests for money or personal information with caution. Scammers often create a sense of urgency to pressure you into acting quickly.",
      "9. Be vigilant against phishing attempts and use strong antivirus software:\u00a0Avoid clicking on links or downloading attachments from unsolicited emails or messages. Ensure your devices are protected with strong antivirus software that can detect and block malicious activities. The best way to safeguard yourself from malicious links that install malware, potentially accessing your private information, is to have antivirus software installed on all your devices. This protection can also alert you to phishing emails and ransomware scams, keeping your personal information and digital assets safe.\u00a0Get my picks for the best 2025 antivirus protection winners for your Windows, Mac, Android and iOS devices.",

    "summary": "Security experts have discovered that hackers are targeting apps on the App Store to spread malware that steals information from saved screenshots.",
    "story": [
      "Kurt 'CyberGuy' Knutsson walks you through the process.",
      "Every tech expert will tell you the App Store is safer than Google Play Store. Some might even claim it is impossible to download a malicious app from the App Store, but they are wrong.",
      "While I admit the App Store is a secure and tightly controlled ecosystem, it cannot completely shield you. Security researchers have found that hackers are targeting several apps on the App Store to spread malware that steals information from screenshots saved on a device.",
      "The issue also affects those downloading apps from the Google Play Store.",
      "STAY PROTECTED & INFORMED! GET SECURITY ALERTS & EXPERT TECH TIPS \u2014 SIGN UP FOR KURT\u2019S THE CYBERGUY REPORT NOW",
      "A person holding an iPhone. (Kurt \"CyberGuy\" Knutsson\u00a0)",
      "How the malware works and what makes it different",
      "According to\u00a0researchers at Kaspersky, this malware campaign is more advanced than typical info stealers, both in how it works and how it spreads. Instead of relying on social engineering tricks to get users to grant permissions like most banking trojans or spyware, this malware hides inside seemingly legitimate apps and slips past Apple and Google\u2019s security checks.",
      "One of its standout features is Optical Character Recognition. Instead of stealing stored files, it scans screenshots saved on the device, extracts text and sends the information to remote servers.",
      "Once installed, the malware operates stealthily, often activating only after a period of dormancy to avoid raising suspicion. It employs encrypted communication channels to send stolen data back to its operators, making it difficult to trace. Plus, it spreads through deceptive updates or hidden code within app dependencies, an approach that helps it evade initial security screenings by app store review teams.",
      "The infection vectors vary between Apple and Google\u2019s ecosystems. On iOS, the malware is often embedded within apps that initially pass Apple\u2019s rigorous review process but later introduce harmful functionality through updates. On Android, the malware can exploit sideloading options, but even official Google Play apps have been found to carry these malicious payloads, sometimes hidden within SDKs (software development kits) supplied by third-party developers.",
      "Messaging app in the App Store designed to lure victims.",
      "THE HIDDEN COSTS OF FREE APPS: YOUR PERSONAL INFORMATION",
      "What's being stolen, and who's responsible?",
      "The scope of stolen information is alarming. This malware primarily targets crypto wallet recovery phrases but is also capable of exfiltrating login credentials, payment details, personal messages, location data and even biometric identifiers. Some versions are designed to harvest authentication tokens, allowing attackers to access accounts even if users change their passwords.",
      "The apps serving as malware carriers include ComeCome, ChatAi, WeTink, AnyGPT and more. These range from productivity tools to entertainment and utility apps. In some cases, malicious developers create these apps with full knowledge of the malware\u2019s purpose. In others, the issue appears to be a supply chain vulnerability, where legitimate developers unknowingly integrate compromised SDKs or third-party services that introduce malicious code into their applications.",
      "We reached out to Apple for a comment but did not hear back before our deadline.",
      "Messaging app in the App Store designed to lure victims. (Kaspersky)",
      "Apple's response to screenshot-scanning malware discovered in App Store",
      "Apple has removed the 11 iOS apps mentioned in Kaspersky's report from the App Store. Furthermore, they discovered that these 11 apps shared code signatures with 89 other iOS apps, all of which had been previously rejected or removed for violating Apple's policies, resulting in the termination of their developer accounts.",
      "Apps requesting access to user data such as Photos, Camera or Location must provide relevant functionality or face rejection. They must also clearly explain their data usage when prompting users for permission. iOS privacy features ensure users always control whether their location information is shared with an app. Also, starting in iOS 14, the PhotoKit API \u2014 which allows apps to request access to a user\u2019s Photos library \u2014 added additional controls to let users select only specific photos or videos to share with an app instead of providing access to their entire library.",
      "The App Store Review Guidelines mandate that developers are responsible for ensuring their entire app, including ad networks, analytics services and third-party SDKs, complies with the guidelines. Developers must carefully review and choose these components. Apps must also accurately represent their privacy practices, including those of the SDKs they use, in their privacy labels.",
      "In 2023, the App Store rejected over 1.7 million app submissions for failing to meet its stringent privacy, security and content standards. It also rejected 248,000 app submissions found to be spam, copycats or misleading and prevented 84,000 potentially fraudulent apps from reaching users.",

      "1. Use strong antivirus software:\u00a0Installing strong antivirus software can add an extra layer of protection by scanning apps for malware, blocking suspicious activity and alerting you to potential threats. The best way to safeguard yourself from malicious links that install malware, potentially accessing your private information, is to have antivirus software installed on all your devices. This protection can also alert you to phishing emails and ransomware scams, keeping your personal information and digital assets safe.\u00a0Get my picks for the best 2025 antivirus protection winners for your Windows, Mac, Android and iOS devices.",
      "2. Stick to trusted developers and well-known apps:\u00a0Even though malware has been found in official app stores, users can still minimize their risk by downloading apps from reputable developers with a long track record. Before installing an app, check its developer history, read multiple reviews and look at the permissions it requests. If an app from an unknown developer suddenly gains popularity but lacks a strong review history, approach it with caution.",
      "GET FOX BUSINESS ON THE GO BY CLICKING HERE",
      "3. Review app permissions carefully:\u00a0Many malicious apps disguise themselves as legitimate tools but request excessive permissions that go beyond their stated purpose. For example, a simple calculator app should not need access to your contacts, messages or location. If an app asks for permissions that seem unnecessary, consider it a red flag and either deny those permissions or avoid installing the app altogether. Go to your phone settings and check app permissions on your\u00a0iPhone and\u00a0Android.",
      "4. Keep your device and apps updated:\u00a0Cybercriminals exploit vulnerabilities in outdated software to distribute malware. Always\u00a0keep your operating system and apps updated to the latest versions, as these updates often contain critical security patches. Enabling automatic updates ensures that you stay protected without having to manually check for new versions.",
      "5. Be wary of apps that promise too much:\u00a0Many malware-infected apps lure users by offering features that seem too good to be true \u2014 such as free premium services, extreme battery optimizations or AI-powered functionality that appears unrealistic. If an app\u2019s claims sound exaggerated or its download numbers skyrocket overnight with questionable reviews, it\u2019s best to avoid it. Stick to apps with a transparent development team and verifiable functionalities.",
      "HOW TO REMOVE YOUR PRIVATE DATA FROM THE INTERNET",
      "Kurt\u2019s key takeaway",
      "The new malware campaign highlights the need for stricter vetting processes, continuous monitoring of app behavior post-approval and greater transparency from app stores regarding security risks. While Apple and Google have removed the malicious apps upon detection, the fact that they made it onto the platform in the first place exposes a gap in the existing security framework. As cybercriminals refine their methods, app stores must evolve just as quickly or risk losing the trust of the very users they claim to protect.",

This includes your phone number, email and other contact details that allow them to reach you, as well as information like the celebrities you follow, your family members and even the type of content you engage with online to tailor the perfect attack. As scams become more sophisticated and reliant on loads of data, it\u2019s more important than ever to take proactive measures to safeguard your personal information.",
      "1. Vigilance in online dating: In the digital world, not everyone is who they claim to be.

Keep your personal and financial information private and never share it with someone you haven't met in person.",

      "3. Research and verify: Conduct an online search using the person's name, email address or phone number to see if any suspicious or fraudulent activities are associated with them.\u00a0Reverse image search their profile pictures to check if they are stolen from elsewhere on the internet.

      "\"This is a very real threat,\" he said. \"EMP is generated when a small nuclear weapon, 40 to 60 kilotons or about three times the size of a Hiroshima bomb, is detonated 200 miles out in space above the United States. It sets up an electrostatic discharge which cascades to the Earth's surface, feeds into the millions of miles of wires which become antennas, feeds this into the power grid, overloads the grid and blows it out.\"",
      "Forstchen, citing Congressional reports from 2002 and 2008, said that 80%-90% of Americans would be dead a year later if an EMP strike happened.",

      "While an EMP strike, at first glance, appears to be more science fiction than fact, Forstchen said that the potential for such an attack was recognized decades ago.",
      "\"The threat of an EMP was first realized during the 1962 Starfish Prime high-altitude nuclear test. What happened was that it blew about 500 miles away from Hawaii and 200 miles up,\" he said. \"They were able to bring the system back within a matter of days, but what would it be like if it took a month, six months, a year, or five years to fix?\"",
      "The late Peter Pry, a nuclear weapons expert, and former staff director at the Congressional EMP Commission,\u00a0agreed. Before his death in 2022, Pry warned that Kim Jung Un's launch of a high-altitude ballistic missile was a test of North Korea's EMP capabilities against the United States.",
      "\"Cars would be paralyzed,\" Pry told Fox Business in May 2017. \"Airplanes could fall out of the sky. You'd have natural gas pipeline explosions, nuclear reactor overloads. And worst of all, if you had a protracted blackout, it would be a serious threat to the survival of the American people.\"",

      "In the past month, San Clemente has seen an uptick in small boats carrying migrants. In some cases, the migrants are still aboard when discovered, but, in many cases, the vessels are abandoned.

Balogh was backing out of a parking space at a liquor store across the street when Nance pulled open the car door and fatally shot him.",

      "The U.S. Supreme Court has said that for an inmate to challenge an execution method under the Eighth Amendment, they must prove that it creates \"a substantial risk of serious harm\" and that there are \"known and available alternatives\" that are \"feasible, readily implemented\" and that will significantly reduce the risk of severe pain, which is why Nance's lawyers suggested the firing squad.",
      "Boulee ruled in March 2020 that Nance's arguments were procedurally barred because he had waited too long to bring them and that he had failed to prove how his constitutional protections against cruel and unusual punishment would be violated.",
      "Nance appealed and a panel of the 11th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals concluded that since lethal injection is the only method of execution authorized by Georgia law, he was effectively challenging the validity of his death sentence, which the panel said he was procedurally barred from doing.",

So President Trump is rethinking the entire dynamic here. That has some people uncomfortable, but I think Zelenskyy would be very wise to enter into this agreement with the United States.

The stops on the trip will include a meeting with the United Steelworkers in Pittsburgh, meetings with the state Democratic Party chairs in Illinois and Missouri, and door-knocking for Democratic state House candidate Dan Goughnour ahead of his March special election outside of Pittsburgh.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s time for the DNC to get out of D.C. \u2014 that means getting out of our comfort zone, having tough but honest conversations with voters, and showing that we\u2019re willing to fight for people. Democrats will win by organizing everywhere, competing across the ballot in every community, and uniting working families from all backgrounds,\u201d Martin told NBC News in a statement.",
      "He went on to criticize President Donald Trump and billionaire Elon Musk, arguing they have a plan to \u201cgive trillions of dollars to billionaires by cutting things like health care for kids, seniors and rural communities \u2014 and we can\u2019t let that happen.\u201d",

      "Throughout his campaign to lead the party, Martin pitched his vision for the DNC chair as multifaceted \u2014 helping build out the party\u2019s infrastructure across the country and U.S. territories, embarking on a \u201cpost-election review,\u201d bringing the party\u2019s message to new outlets through new messengers, and also going on offense against Trump and his policies.",
      "The decision to kick off his time leading the party with the cross-country tour speaks to the party\u2019s need to shore up its standing across the nation and with multiple voting blocs, after a presidential election in which former Vice President Kamala Harris lost all seven of the major swing states and lost ground with key pieces of the Democratic base, including Latinos and young voters.",
      "Asked by reporters shortly after his victory what his first priorities as chair would be, Martin said he wanted to look at the party\u2019s finances, begin that \u201cpost-election review\u201d and then start bringing the fight to Trump.",
      "\u201cWe need to start getting out there right now, when the stakes are so high. If we\u2019re not willing to start the fight right now against Donald Trump, and he\u2019s already failing the American people, no one\u2019s going to believe that we\u2019re going to fight for them when they put us in power,\u201d he said.",
      "\u201cSo we\u2019re going to be aggressive about litigating the case against Donald Trump. We\u2019re going to be aggressive about standing up a war room to get back against the misinformation and disinformation campaigns that we\u2019ve already seen in the last two weeks,\u201d Martin said. \u201cAnd we\u2019re going to make sure that we start the planning process of getting ready for \u201925, \u201926 and then, of course, \u201928.\u201d",
      "During an interview on MSNBC's \"Morning Joe\" on Monday announcing the trip, Martin acknowledged that the party's brand has taken a significant hit recently, and pegged the trip as a way to reconnect the party with voters.",
      "\"So many parts of our coalition left us this last election cycle, right?\" he said. \"We know that. From Latino voters to working class households, to young voters, to women. You can go down the list, the only two groups we overperformed with last election cycle were wealthy households and college educated voters. That's a damning indictment of the Democratic Party.\"",
      "Later, he said that Democrats have started to \"message to smaller and smaller parts of our coalition, and as a result we've lost the narrative, who we are as a Democratic Party.\"",
      "Asked about how to toe the line between resisting Trump and not disrespecting those who voted for him, Martin the party has to fight back against Republicans but not stay in a posture of \"perpetual resistance.\"",

Others just aren\u2019t sure: At\u00a0Martin Marietta Materials, CFO James Nickolas said the supplier\u2019s profits could either benefit or take a hit from tariffs depending on what form ultimately takes effect.",
      "While\u00a0Generac\u00a0didn\u2019t calculate how these import taxes could affect future performance, CEO Aaron Jagdfeld said the generator maker is ready to mitigate the financial hit by reducing costs elsewhere and raising its prices.\u00a0Camden Property Trust\u00a0CEO Richard Campo said a company analysis shows proposed tariffs would push up costs for materials from Canada and Mexico like lumber and electrical boxes. These comments offer support to the idea that Trump\u2019s tariffs may drive up consumer prices and fan inflation.",
      "Zebra Technologies\u00a0CFO Nathan Winters said price increases could help mitigate profit pressure. Auto parts maker\u00a0BorgWarner, meanwhile, anticipates another year of declining demand in certain markets, which CFO Craig Aaron attributed in part to potential headwinds from these levies.",
      "Cisco\u2019s R. Scott Herren agreed with other executives on the lack of clarity, describing the tariff situation as \u201cdynamic\u201d on the networking equipment maker\u2019s earnings call last week. Still, the CFO said the company has planned for some variation of Trump\u2019s tariff proposals to take effect and is expecting costs to increase as a result.",
      "\u201cWe\u2019ve game planned out several scenarios and steps we could take depending on what actually goes into effect,\u201d he said.",
      "Immigration",
      "The topic of immigration, meanwhile, has already come up on the highest share of calls since 2017.",
      "Trump has promised\u00a0mass deportations\u00a0of undocumented immigrants during his second term in office. Cracking down on immigration has been a core component of Trump\u2019s political messaging since he ran in part to\u00a0\u201cbuild the wall\u201d\u00a0between the U.S. and Mexico for his first term. Critics assert that his plans would\u00a0shock the labor market\u00a0and could result in\u00a0higher inflation.",
      "Immigration mentions tend to tick up during the first year of a new administration, CNBC data shows. But 2025 has surpassed the first years of Joe Biden\u2019s presidency and Barack Obama\u2019s second term, underscoring Trump\u2019s role in elevating the issue within U.S. businesses.",
      "Some companies grouped immigration with tariffs as drivers of broader unpredictability within the economy. Nicholas Pinchuk, CEO of toolmaker\u00a0Snap-On, described anecdotes of strong demand for repair services from its clients, but said they were still stressed by red flags in the economic backdrop.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s clear the techs are in a good position. But that doesn\u2019t make them immune to the macro uncertainty around them: ongoing wars, immigration disputes, lingering inflation,\u201d Pinchuk said. \u201cAlthough the election is in the rear mirror and the new team may be more focused on business expansion, there\u2019s a rapid fire of new initiatives. ... It\u2019s hard not to be uncertain about what\u2019s up.\u201d",
      "Firms in a variety of sectors took questions about what changes in the composition of America\u2019s population would mean.\u00a0AT&T,\u00a0Verizon\u00a0and\u00a0T-Mobile\u00a0all fielded questions about whether a slowdown in immigration would hurt demand for certain phone plans. Michael Manelis, operations chief at apartment manager\u00a0Equity Residential, said in response to an immigration-related inquiry that it hasn\u2019t seen any upticks in lease breaks from tenants being deported.",
      "In the Southern California market, real estate developer\u00a0Prologis\u00a0CEO Hamid Moghadam said deportations can decrease the pool of workers and, in turn, drive up employment costs in the region. That can exacerbate pricing pressures already expected as the Los Angeles community rebuilds in the wake of last month\u2019s\u00a0wildfires.",
      "Other businesses insisted deportations wouldn\u2019t create labor shortages for their operations because all of their workers are legally authorized. One such company, chicken producer\u00a0Tyson Foods, said it hasn\u2019t had factories visited by U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement or seen any declines in worker attendance.",
      "\u201cWe\u2019re confident that we\u2019ll be able to continue to successfully run our business,\u201d CEO Donnie King said on Feb. 3.",
      "DOGE and the Gulf",
      "Topics that gained newfound relevance with Trump\u2019s return to office have also already started emerging.",
      "DOGE \u2014 the acronym for the new Department of Government Efficiency led by\u00a0Tesla\u00a0CEO\u00a0Elon Musk\u00a0\u2014 has been mentioned on more than 15 calls, as of Friday morning. This department has put Wall Street on alert as investors wonder if contracts between public companies and federal agencies could be on the chopping block with Musk\u2019s team slashing spending.",
      "Iron Mountain\u2019s mine that stores government retirement records was ripped as an example of inefficiency by Musk during a visit to the Oval Office. But surprisingly, CEO Bill Meaney said the push for streamlining can\u00a0actually benefit\u00a0other parts of its business.",
      "\u201cAs the government continues to drive to be more efficient, we see this as a continued opportunity for the company,\u201d he said last week.",
      "Executives at\u00a0Palantir, the defensive technology company that was a\u00a0top performer\u00a0within the S&P 500 last year, are similarly hopeful. Technology Chief Shyam Sankar described Palantir\u2019s work with the government as \u201coperational\u201d and \u201cvaluable,\u201d and is hopeful that DOGE engineers will be \u201cable to see that for a change.\u201d",
      "\u201cI think DOGE is going to bring meritocracy and transparency to government, and that\u2019s exactly what our commercial business is,\u201d Sankar said during the company\u2019s Feb. 3 call. \u201cThe commercial market is meritocratic and transparent, and you see the results that we have in that sort of environment. And that\u2019s the basis of our optimism around this.\u201d",
      "He noted some concerns among other government software providers, and called those agreements \u201csacred cows of the deep state\u201d during the call.",
      "Elsewhere, the so-called Gulf of America has been a point of divergence after Trump\u2019s executive order renaming what has long been known as the Gulf of Mexico.\u00a0Chevron\u00a0used the moniker Gulf of America\u00a0repeatedly\u00a0in its earnings release and on its call with analysts late last month. But\u00a0Exxon Mobil, which held its earnings call the same day, opted instead to refer to the body of water as the Gulf of Mexico."

      "The State Department fact sheet on U.S.-Taiwan relations continues to state Washington\u2019s opposition to any unilateral changes to the status quo from either China or Taiwan, a self-ruling democracy that rejects Beijing\u2019s sovereignty claims. But the phrase \u201cwe do not support Taiwan independence\u201d appears to have been removed Thursday in what the State Department says was a routine update.",
      "The change was cheered by Taiwan, while China said it \u201csends a wrong signal to the Taiwan independence forces\u201d and urged the U.S. to \u201cimmediately correct this mistake.\u201d",
      "The U.S. should \u201cstop using Taiwan to control China\u201d and \u201cstop condoning and supporting Taiwan independence,\u201d Chinese Foreign Ministry spokesperson Guo Jiakun said at a regular briefing in Beijing on Monday. \u201cThis will help avoid further serious damage to China-U.S. relations and peace and stability in the Taiwan Strait.\u201d",
      "The same phrase about not supporting Taiwan independence was removed from the State Department fact sheet in 2022 during the Biden administration before being restored a few weeks later.",
      "The United States, like most countries, does not have official relations with Taiwan but is its most important international backer, and is required by law to provide the island of 23 million people with defensive weapons.",
      "Beijing, which has not ruled out the use of force to assert its sovereignty claims, is extremely sensitive to any sign of international recognition of Taiwan, which it describes as its \u201ccore of core interests.\u201d",
      "Taiwan, formally known as the Republic of China, says it is already an independent country. Its government fled to Taiwan in 1949 after losing a civil war with the communist forces of Mao Zedong, founder of the People\u2019s Republic of China.",
      "The U.S. has recognized the PRC as the sole legal government of China since establishing diplomatic relations with Beijing in 1979, acknowledging Beijing\u2019s assertion that Taiwan is part of China but taking no official stance of its own on the sovereignty of Taiwan.",
      "The State Department said the U.S. position on Taiwan independence had not changed and that the U.S. remained committed to its \u201cOne China\u201d policy.",
      "\u201cThe United States is committed to preserving peace and stability in the Taiwan Strait,\u201d a State Department spokesperson said in an email Sunday.",
      "\u201cWe oppose any unilateral changes to the status quo from either side.\u00a0We support cross-Strait dialogue, and we expect cross-Strait differences to be resolved by peaceful means, free from coercion, in a manner acceptable to people on both sides of the Strait.\u201d",
      "The State Department website has also been changed to add a reference to Taiwan\u2019s cooperation with a Pentagon technology and semiconductor development project and to say the U.S. will continue to support Taiwan\u2019s participation in international organizations, \u201cincluding membership where applicable.\u201d",
      "China has consistently opposed Taiwan\u2019s membership in international bodies such as the World Health Organization.",
      "The website changes were praised by Taiwan, whose foreign minister, Lin Chia-lung, said in a statement Sunday that his ministry welcomed \u201cthe support and positive stance on U.S.-Taiwan relations\u201d that they demonstrated.",
      "Though President Donald Trump has unnerved Taiwan with recent comments demanding the island pay more for its defense and accusing it of stealing U.S. semiconductor business, his administration has also made strong statements of support for Taipei.",
      "Last week, two U.S. Navy ships sailed through the sensitive Taiwan Strait for the first time since Trump\u2019s inauguration last month. A Canadian warship also sailed through the strait on Sunday, drawing condemnation from Beijing.",
      "In recent years Taiwan has come under increasing military and other pressure from China, which sends warplanes and vessels toward the island almost daily.",
      "On Monday, the Taiwan Ministry of National Defense said it had detected 41 Chinese military aircraft, nine Chinese naval vessels and one \u201cofficial ship\u201d operating around Taiwan in the 24 hours to 6 a.m. local time (5 p.m. Sunday ET), with 28 of the planes crossing the median line that had previously served as an unofficial buffer in the Taiwan Strait."

      "Hampton Dellinger, leader of the whistleblower protection agency the Office of Special Counsel, sued the Trump administration after he was fired this month.",
      "A district judge had ordered Dellinger, a Biden appointee, to be temporarily reinstated during ongoing legal proceedings. A panel of the U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals in Washington, D.C., denied the Trump administration's request to overturn the district judge's order on procedural grounds Saturday.",
      "The Justice Department plans to elevate the case to the Supreme Court, asking it to intervene by allowing the administration to keep Dellinger off the job while litigation proceeds, according to a copy of the application provided by a Justice Department official. The application has not yet been docketed at the Supreme Court.",
      "The application argues that lower courts' actions limited President Donald Trump's ability to manage the executive branch and that \"preventing him from exercising these powers thus inflicts the gravest of injuries on the Executive Branch and the separation of powers.\"",

    "story": [
      "LOS ANGELES\u00a0\u2014 As work crews race to clear debris from thousands of homes and businesses destroyed in last month\u2019s wildfires, residents are grappling\u00a0with whether they can afford to stay in a region where real estate prices were already out of reach for many people.",
      "Displaced homeowners and renters are facing an economic landscape rife with long-standing affordability and equity concerns, illuminating the gulf between those who can afford to start over from scratch and those who cannot.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s intimidating,\u201d said Kaitlyn Little, who grew up in Pacific Palisades, one of hundreds of distinct neighborhoods that make up the city of Los Angeles. \u201cIt just reinforces the feelings of uncertainty and uneasiness about what the future of that town really does look like.\u201d",
      "Little lost the Palisades condominium she shared with her husband and their 2-year-old child in the Jan. 7 fires that razed entire communities. At least 29 people were killed in the multiday siege, and more than 16,000 structures, the majority residences, were destroyed.",
      "Now, Little finds herself in a market where the average home price in Los Angeles County is just shy of $1 million and the average rent is nearly $3,000, according to Zillow. State and local leaders have warned against price gouging, but displaced families said they are already feeling the pinch.",
      "At this point, Little said, she cannot afford to rebuild, much less buy a home.",
      "\u201cOur renters insurance doesn\u2019t begin to cover the cost of what was lost,\u201d she said.",
      "Like many survivors, Little did not have time to pack before evacuating. She ran out of the condominium she rented with the clothes on her back and three diapers. She thought she would return home in a few hours.",
      "After completing seemingly endless paperwork, Little received a $16,000 payout. She is attempting to stretch that out to cover moving into a new apartment and buying new clothes and essentials for her family of three.",
      "She yearns to return to the Palisades after it is rebuilt, but worries that rising rents could force her and her family to relocate permanently.",
      "\u201cGoing back is the dream, but there are so many factors at play,\u201d she said. \u201cWhat does it look like a year from now and how are the schools going to be?\u201d",
      "Economic losses reach $250 billion",
      "Early estimates of the total economic loss from the fires have soared to $250 billion. According to a recent economic impact study by the University of California, Los Angeles, areas near the burn zones could suffer wage losses of nearly $300 million because so many businesses were destroyed and few customers are around to patronize those that survived.",
      "The study also confirmed what most people already knew: The housing market will become more unaffordable in coming years, and rentals, already in short supply before the fires, will become even pricier.",
      "\u201cThe reduction in the supply of housing is going to raise prices,\u201d said Adam Rose, senior research fellow and director emeritus of the Center for Risk and Economic Analysis of Threats and Emergencies at the University of Southern California. \u201cThe only thing that\u2019s going to offset that is if people move elsewhere.\u201d",
      "State and local leaders have expedited recovery efforts by waiving permits and lifting some environmental regulations. But the rush to rebuild is already leaving some survivors in the dust.",
      "\u201cThis is gonna be a long, tough, difficult road,\u201d said Altadena resident Freddy Sayegh, whose extended family lost a total of seven properties in the Eaton Fire.",
      "\u201cWhat we don\u2019t want is unscrupulous developers coming in here trying to build and make a profit and increase the home prices, decreasing the ability to have affordable housing.\u201d",
      "In the weeks since the fire, Sayegh, his wife and two children have bounced from one short-term rental to the next. He now drives more than an hour to drop his kids off at school and continues to look for a house or apartment to rent that he can afford. His law office was badly smoke damaged and several businesses owned by his family, including an auto parts store and a gas station, were destroyed, he said.",
      "His homeowners insurance payout will cover smoke remediation, a timely and painstaking process to remove toxic particles and soot from his ranch-style home. But his commercial properties near north Lake Avenue, a busy thoroughfare consumed by the fire, were underinsured and Sayegh anticipates his payout will not be enough to rebuild.",
      "While he waits to meet with adjusters to determine how much he will receive, Sayegh is helping to organize a coalition of Altadena residents and businesses that will work to make the rebuilding effort affordable and attainable for longtime community members. The group will operate like a labor union, negotiating with builders and architects for the best prices on large-scale construction projects, he said.",
      "Altadena resident Maria Shufeldt said the homeowner-focused effort may not do much to help her. The building where she rented an apartment for 13 years withstood the flames but was badly damaged by smoke. She shuffled through three different hotels as she hunted for a rental.",
      "She spent much of Thursday afternoon speaking with the Red Cross and the Federal Emergency Management Agency in hopes of extending her hotel stay until her new apartment is ready. The whole recovery experience has left her numb and exhausted.",
      "\u201cIt completely makes you almost not able to function in real life, because you\u2019re constantly dealing with what\u2019s next,\u201d she said.",
      "'Death of the American dream'",
      "Even homeowners in tony Pacific Palisades face displacement. Blake Mallen, an entrepreneur, lived in a home valued at more than $3 million near the trailhead where the Palisades Fire was first reported. The five-bedroom, five-bathroom home was paid off in full, but Mallen was one of some 1,600 Palisades residents dropped by their homeowners insurance companies last year amid soaring costs and an increasing risk of wildfires.",
      "He attempted to supplement his homeowners insurance through California\u2019s FAIR Plan, the state\u2019s insurer of last resort, but was told he did not qualify because his home value was too high.",
      "Without insurance, Mallen has been unable to recoup losses.",
      "\u201cThis is the death of the American dream,\u201d he said. \u201cWe\u2019re seeing the core of our community fragment.\u201d",
      "Mallen has spent much of the past five weeks on the phone with lawyers, hoping to find a loophole that will make him eligible for some kind of payout. For now, he is facing a total financial loss, he said. His home of seven years was not just where he and his wife raised their two children, it was their entire nest egg.",
      "\u201cRight now, we couldn\u2019t even rebuild if we wanted to,\u201d he said, speaking from his rental house in L.A.\u2019s Venice neighborhood. \u201cDo I even want to rebuild a house that can\u2019t get insurance?\u201d",
      "Residents who can afford to rebuild also face uncertainty as tariffs and inflation threaten to increase the price of materials.",
      "In Sunset Mesa, near Pacific Palisades, longtime resident Tom Reed said he plans to start construction to replace his destroyed home as soon as possible and is already negotiating the cost of an architect. Reed has carefully mapped out rental costs for the next three years to help stay within the budget dictated by his insurance payout. He and his wife are even renting furniture for their temporary apartment, instead of buying.",
      "While forging ahead, he said he knows some items lost in the fire can never be replaced. The amateur photographer estimates he lost some 100,000 negatives and photos when the Palisades Fire tore through his oceanside community.",
      "\u201cAs I tell people, you can\u2019t look back. Let\u2019s just look forward and keep going forward,\u201d he said. \u201cThat\u2019s all you can do.\u201d"

      "Did any of that make sense to you?",
      "As the NBA concluded its All-Star weekend in San Francisco on Sunday, featuring a brand-new game format consisting of four teams (three made up of the 24 All-Stars, one made up of rising stars) playing a mini-tournament of games to 40 points, the consensus conclusion among participants and observers is that the league is still searching for an answer to revive its midseason showcase.",

      "\u201cThis ain\u2019t basketball,\u201d Golden State Warriors forward Draymond Green said on the broadcast of the game, rating the new competition zero on a scale of 1 to 10.",
      "Sunday\u2019s tournament was the league\u2019s latest attempt to inject life into its middling All-Star Game, which has undergone several tweaks over the last few years. The NBA, which seems to be at its wit\u2019s end, has tried several gimmicks to make the game more competitive, from having player captains pick their own teams to eschewing a timed fourth quarter in favor of a target score.",
      "The mini-tournament Sunday did have some moments of inspired basketball, but the basketball itself seemed to take a back seat to a variety show of sorts.",
      "There were several long breaks in action between the games and sometimes even during the games. The breaks included, but were not limited to, a concert by Bay Area legends, a shooting contest featuring a popular YouTuber and a tribute to TNT in honor of its final All-Star broadcast.",
      "The TNT tribute, which happened during the final game of the night, lasted longer than the final game itself.",
      "\u201cI would say it\u2019s not ideal to stop like that if you want guys to play, be physical and play harder,\u201d Boston Celtics All-Star Jaylen Brown said afterward.",
      "The NBA\u2019s constant tweaking of the game is more than understandable, as everyone from players to fans to media has acknowledged in recent years the game has lost most, if not all, of its competitive edge. The extended breaks Sunday were self-inflicted wounds, however, as multiple players said afterward that it was difficult to stay loose for the actual basketball with all the stoppages \u2014 at one point, Dallas Mavericks guard Kyrie Irving began running line drills by himself to warm up during the TNT tribute.",
      "The league was also dealt a blow by who decided not to play.",
      "In addition to Edwards, Los Angeles Lakers forward LeBron James was a late scratch. James did not arrive to the All-Star festivities until Sunday, and he said at a pregame news conference he would not play because of ankle soreness.",
      "Meanwhile, even before the games started, Milwaukee Bucks forward Giannis Antetokounmpo, also out because of injury, threw cold water on the new format, saying a game featuring American All-Stars against the world would be \u201cmore exciting.\u201d",
      "If the NBA heeds the advice of those on hand Sunday, it seems there is a formula most could agree on \u2014 an East vs. West or USA vs. the World game, with fewer breaks and more of an emphasis on basketball.",
      "A positive for the league? At least one marquee player felt there was a little more energy whenever the players actually got to play.",
      "\u201cI think we\u2019re starting to see All-Star weekend competitive nature in the game starting to creep back in,\u201d Phoenix Suns forward and 15-time All-Star Kevin Durant said. \u201cI think it was solid tonight. It was way better than it was before.\u201d"

      "\"A paradigm shift in how regulatory frameworks and health organizations collaborate to address the complexities of gambling harms is needed,\" the researchers wrote.",
      "The study comes as legalized sports betting has exploded into a multibillion-dollar industry following a 2018 Supreme Court ruling that broke up Nevada's monopoly on the practice and cleared the way for state-sponsored sports gambling.",
      "Americans were set to wager an estimated $1.4 billion\u00a0in this year's Super Bowl, up from $1.25 billion in 2024, according to the American Gaming Association.",

      "While online searches for gambling addiction help had declined or stabilized in 2020 as the Covid pandemic halted sporting events, the searches increased year over year since 2021, when 32 states had sports betting, according to the study.",
      "Researchers analyzed monthly Google searches surrounding gambling addiction, such as for \"gambling addiction hotline\" or \"am I a gambling addict,\" and found that there were cumulatively 23% more searches nationally than expected since the Supreme Court ruling.",
      "In the 73 months following it, \"there were approximately 6.5 to 7.3 million searches for gambling addiction help-seeking nationally, with 180,000 monthly searches at a peak during June 2023,\" the study said.",
      "Researchers also conducted independent evaluations in eight states \u2014 Illinois, Massachusetts, Michigan, New Jersey, New York, Ohio, Pennsylvania and Virginia \u2014 where there were \"significantly more searches than expected.\"",
      "They concluded the higher search volumes in those states were \"highly unlikely to be due to chance.\"",
      "\"Each state's cumulative increase in searches was higher than the aggregate national model and their peak month typically occurred during 2024, suggesting that searches are continuing to rise following the opening of sportsbooks,\" according to the study.",

      "The motion also suggests that someone else may have orchestrated the shooting and that witnesses who could testify on the matter are being interviewed.",

      "\u201cThis case involves decades-old allegations, and with every new piece of evidence, it becomes increasingly clear that critical facts have yet to be fully examined,\u201d said attorney Carl Arnold, who is leading Davis\u2019 defense.",

      "Davis has acknowledged in interviews and in the memoir that he provided the gun used in the drive-by shooting and that he was in the car. But his court filings say his descriptions in recent years of orchestrating the shooting were \u201cdone for entertainment purposes and to make money.\u201d",
      "Defense attorneys also say they have witness information indicating that Shakur was in stable condition after the shooting and that he died suddenly after being hospitalized for a week. They were consulting medical and forensic experts to evaluate potential alternative causes of death."

      "As well as being able to start and land them with a click of a button on their laptop, operators could also hand control of the drones to other units hidden in dense forest several miles away, while the information they gathered could be shared instantly with colleagues or commanders.",

      "He added that the maritime capabilities were \u201cprobably more significant than the land capabilities,\u201d because Ukraine\u2019s military had been able to use marine drones to destroy Russian ships and infrastructure. This had allowed Ukraine to keep vital shipping lanes open so it could continue exporting critical products like grain.",
      "The U.S. military had also learned a lot from the way Ukraine has defended parts of the Black Sea, he said.",

      "\u201cThe lessons that are coming out of Ukraine are ones that we are very rapidly adapting to and incorporating into our own training,\u201d he said. \u201cSo it\u2019s provided, I would say, a sense of urgency, not only for us, but for our NATO allies as well, to very rapidly modernize.\u201d",

      "A New Zealand government tourism campaign titled \u201cEveryone Must Go\u201d is drawing derision and mockery from residents who have criticized it as tone deaf, especially at a time when New Zealanders themselves are leaving the country in droves.",
      "In an announcement Sunday, officials said they were spending 500,000 New Zealand dollars ($287,000) on the campaign, which is aimed at visitors from neighboring Australia, New Zealand\u2019s biggest tourism market.",
      "Like many countries, New Zealand has struggled to restore its tourism industry since the Covid-19 pandemic, and the number of visitors from Australia is still at 88% of 2019 levels.",
      "\u201cWhat this Tourism New Zealand campaign says to our Aussie mates is that we\u2019re open for business, there are some great deals on, and we\u2019d love to see you soon,\u201d Tourism Minister Louise Upston said in a news release.",
      "Critics disagreed, saying the slogan sounded like New Zealand was advertising a clearance sale. Others said it invited bathroom jokes.",
      "\u201cI think \u2018Everyone Must Go\u2019 might refer to the need for toilets in some of our high-tourist spots. I mean, the queues are ridiculous,\u201d Cushla Tangaere-Manuel, tourism spokesperson for the opposition Labour Party, told New Zealand news outlet RNZ.",
      "Upston did not respond to an emailed request for comment.",
      "The campaign comes as record numbers of New Zealanders are leaving the country of 5 million, driven in part by concerns about high living costs and lack of job opportunities. Last year, the country had a net migration loss of 47,100 New Zealand citizens, Stats NZ said Monday.",
      "More than half of those migrants went to Australia, where they can live and work visa-free under a reciprocal arrangement.",
      "There were 3.3 million visitor arrivals in New Zealand last year, Stats NZ said separately Monday, up 12% from 2023. Australia, the United States and China were the biggest sources of visitors, with the 370,000 U.S. arrivals representing a record for a calendar year.",
      "Tourism was New Zealand\u2019s biggest export earner before the pandemic, and the conservative government has looked to it as one way to boost the economy. Last month, officials said they were easing visa rules to allow digital nomads to work in New Zealand while visiting on holiday, in the hope that they would spend more time there.",
      "Opposition lawmakers say that while they would welcome more tourists, they worry about the impact on the environment and whether the country\u2019s tourism infrastructure can support them.",
      "\u201cWe\u2019ve had the digital nomad announcement, now we\u2019ve got this \u2014 and the attitude of anyone, anytime, anywhere, is concerning,\u201d Tangaere-Manuel said.",
      "In an effort to address those concerns, last year the New Zealand government nearly tripled the entry fee for international tourists to 100 New Zealand dollars ($62.20) from 35 dollars. Australians are exempted from paying the levy, the proceeds from which are funding the same campaign for their tourist dollars that has sparked the controversy.",
      "Social media users skeptical of the \u201cEveryone Must Go\u201d slogan pointed out another possible use for it.",
      "\u201cWorth us tucking away to use at the next election,\u201d read one comment on the social media platform X."

    "story": [
      "Shortly before \"NBC's Saturday Night\" lit up American TV sets on Oct. 11, 1975, producer Lorne Michaels and seven unknown actors and comedians appeared on \"The Tomorrow Show,\" a late-night talk show with Tom Snyder, to promote their new 90-minute variety series.",
      "\"We've got eight and we're hoping for two for it to really work,\" Michaels deadpanned to Snyder about his new cast. \"So, not all of these people will become stars.\"",
      "Sitting next to him? Chevy Chase, Dan Aykroyd, Jane Curtin, Garrett Morris, Gilda Radner, John Belushi and Laraine Newman. Despite Michaels' tongue-in-cheek prediction, they would, in fact, go on to become not only stars, but legends as the original Not Ready For Prime Time Players on the soon-to-be renamed \"Saturday Night Live.\"",
      "Now, 50 years later, the sketch comedy show has gone on to become the most Emmy-decorated television show in history, receiving countless nominations, awards and accolades. And in 2017, those original cast members were inducted into the Television Academy Hall of Fame.",
      "Defined by its satirical and often censor-defying comedy, along with performances by cutting-edge musicians and artists, \"SNL\" has been a touchstone of American pop culture for five decades. In that time, more than 160 cast members have come and gone, many of them going on to become legends in their own right.",
      "In honor of \"SNL's\" golden anniversary, TODAY.com sat down with past and present cast members to learn what really goes on behind the scenes of the late night show \u2014\u00a0from the anxiety to the exhilaration \u2014 what viewers at home might be surprised to find out, along with their take on the best character breaks and sketches that didn't go quite as planned.",
      "Here's what they revealed.",
      "Answers have been edited for length and clarity.",
      "Laraine Newman (1975 to 1980)",
      "You can only be aware of the audience that's in the studio. There's no sense, at least from my experience, that there's millions of people watching.",
      "It's like everything I was trained to do at The Groundlings where we did sketches and were in place, in costume, doing the sketch, lights out, run off, change, get back down to your spot, lights up and do the next sketch. That's exactly what \"SNL\" is.",
      "What's heroic is that the set designers, they have four days to build sets for sketches that might not even make it to air. The craft of the look of the show, the work that goes into that, the thought that goes into it. The fact that the writers get to collaborate with every aspect \u2014 wardrobe, makeup, everything \u2014 to really optimize their material. I don't think there's any show like that.",
      "Lorne (Michaels) did not want us to laugh, and I never got close to laughing, except when Rodney Dangerfield hosted. We were doing a takeoff on the Woody Allen movie \"Manhattan\" called \"Manhasset.\" (Dangerfield) is saying, \"Tracy, don't go to Manhasset. I tell ya, it's rough. I got a waterbed and there was a guy at the bottom of it.\"",
      "Now, I'd heard that joke in read-through and the rehearsal and it still got me. If you watch it, you can't tell. But I am dying. It is everything I could do not to laugh.",
      "Nora Dunn (1985 to 1990)",
      "There's something about the camera coming on \u2014 you come to life. Because right before that, you're not. It's like your dead, and you're revived and it's a \"do-or-die\" situation. And you go, \"Well, I got here.\" I always tell myself, \"You got here. There's a reason that you are here.\"",
      "I don't think you do it. I think the other side does it. The lights do it. They go, \"5, 4, 3, 2, 1 ... boom!\" It just happens. You can't plan it.",
      "When you're watching a sketch, right behind that wall, someone's taking their clothes off and putting on a costume and having a wig grabbed off their head and put something else on it. You have to make those quick changes.",
      "You might be on with a guest star, the host, and you're like, \"Gotta get my clothes off!\" You're not naked, but next to naked. Every time there's a sketch on \"Saturday Night Live,\" there's all kinds of stuff going on in the background.",
      "We were not supposed to use cue cards, but we all did. But Lorne was like (imitating Michaels), \"They're there if you need them. That's why they're not there, because you don't know your lines.\"",
      "So, Jon (Lovitz) and I had to do a sketch with Charlton Heston. He needed glasses, but he said he didn't. He didn't wear glasses, so they had to make his cue cards huge. So, we had huge stacks of cue cards and we were doing an Egyptian scene. We're dressed up as a couple that's having pyramids built, and the cue card guy lost control of the cards. They spread all over the floor. Lorne was standing 15 feet away and he was furious. We just beelined away from Lorne because he was going to say (imitating Michaels), \"Well, someone didn't learn their lines.\" He was not happy with us.",
      "Kevin Nealon (1986 to 1995)",
      "It's unlike anything I've ever experienced before. It's like sitting in a rollercoaster car, right at the beginning, just anticipating and waiting for it all to happen. And it was a rollercoaster, there were ups and downs, it was crazy.",
      "I remember before I did my first sketch, it was \"Mr. Subliminal,\" and right before, Lorne Michaels comes up to me, puts his hand on my shoulder, and he said, \"Are you sure this is what you want?\" It was funny and it relaxed me a little bit.",
      "But I remember the excitement of the first show. I think The Pretenders were on, and I remember finishing a sketch, then running back to get made up and I'm hearing the band playing and I'm thinking, \"Oh my God,\" and I got filled with such energy and excitement that, \"This is it, man, this is live, this is 'Saturday Night Live.'\"",
      "I think the audience doesn't realize how small the studio is when they get there. And I don't think they realize that we're scrambling to figure out what sketches to cut from rehearsal, how to improve a sketch and what didn't work and what you're surprised that did work.",
      "But, also, I think a lot of times they don't realize how frightened we are about going out there.",
      "(Breaking character) was very rare for me and for a lot of people on our cast because, at the time, Lorne thought of that as being very \"hacky.\" Also, it was a disservice to the writer. If you put all this labor into writing a sketch and then people are breaking on it, it's like, \"Well, there goes that sketch.\"",
      "I did break with Chevy Chase on \"Weekend Update\" once, but that was one of the only times I ever broke in nine years.",
      "Molly Shannon (1995 to 2001)",
      "It's exhilaration. When I hosted, for example, right before you go on, you're in the back and you're with a stage manager and they're like, \"OK ... 5, 4, 3, 2, 1 ...\" So, you're like, \"Ugh (clutches her stomach).\"",
      "I got advice when I hosted. Steve Higgins, a wonderful producer on the show was like, \"Take your time. You don't have to run out there. It's OK.\" So, I thought that was good advice. Set yourself on stage, take a deep breath. But, definitely, there's nerves. I would say, an excited, kind of nervous feeling.",
      "I remember years ago, when I did the show, we would all have dinner after the rehearsals, before the live show. And I remember, because we had the whole week of writing comedy sketches, rehearsing them at dinner, I felt like, \"Ugh, this is time to just relax before the big comedy show live at 11:30 p.m.\"",
      "But people would still be doing comedy bits at dinner, and I remember thinking I just wanted to talk seriously and not have anybody joke around, like, have a quiet dinner before we have to go do a show. I was like, \"No comedy bits at dinner, like, please, let's just eat.\"",
      "Will Ferrell and I were characters who had recently lost 100 pounds, and we were very excited about it. We did it center stage and Will Ferrell and I always had a deal that, if you bombed, if you were tanking, and people weren't laughing, you would still have to commit as an actor, pour your heart into it even more.",
      "While we're performing it, there were crickets, no laughter at all. I remember during the scene, looking at Will, we were like (grimace), but we just kept performing it like the greatest dramatic actors, and we thought it was so funny. So, it entertained us that you had to bomb with grace and dignity, to just jump into bombing and be OK with it. Scoring and bombing were on equal planes \u2014 you had to respect both.",
      "Cheri Oteri (1995 to 2000)",
      "I would always be in the bathroom. That's how fearful I was. I was always very nervous. It's sheer fear and excitement. But because you only get a chance to do it once, it's more fear for me. But I've always been like that, even when I did theater. I was always in the bathroom until it was like, \"10, 9, 8 ...\"",
      "We have a two-hour draft show at 8 o'clock, then a half hour is cut out of that and you're just ... nothing's ever settled until 11:30 p.m. You're working to get your sketches in during the week and you don't know if they're going to get in. And if they do get in, they could always be cut between dress and air.",
      "Nothing is guaranteed. So that's kind of hard. I always say it's a show that you audition for every week, that you already got.",
      "There was one time I broke and it was doing \"Morning Latte.\" It was with Jerry Seinfeld. In this sketch, Will (Ferrell) goes like this (makes hitting motion) with a book and it hits me in the head. That book hit me so hard in the head \u2014 but it didn't hurt. It just clocked. And because of the book being a hardcover, the sound just reverberated and the audience went, \"Ooohhh.\"",
      "I went back and I saw stars. I started laughing and I couldn't stop. Will had to say my lines. Tears are coming down, I'm laughing so much. I've never not been able to recover from something. But because I saw stars, I couldn't stop laughing.",
      "But it was dress, so on air, I knew it was coming. But that was the one and only time I broke.",
      "Ana Gasteyer (1996 to 2002)",
      "Those last 15 seconds right before you go live, I think it's largely fear. It's not fear, necessarily, about failing or anything like that, but it's all so last-minute that it's just your brain synthesizing what has inevitably changed in your sketch moments before you've started and the breakneck pace of it because it really is live.",
      "What people don't understand \u2014\u00a0it's live, and it's written that week, that minute, that day. We may have written a sketch on Tuesday night, but it got rewritten on Thursday. It got rewritten again on Friday and then rewritten before your dress.",
      "You may have just come off another experience, may have had a failed quick change or stressed moment because commercial breaks are only two minutes. They might feel long when you're at home, but two minutes is really, really, really fast to have to change an entire outfit and wig. So, what's happening in those 15 seconds is kind of rooting yourself in the space of what you're going to do.",
      "You know, when you're coming back from a commercial and you're at home and you're like, \"Gosh, why is this taking so long? Why am I looking at this picture of Ariana Grande for so incredibly long?\"",
      "That's because, wildly, some set has not been assembled. That's what those bumper (photo) cards are for, to buy a little bit of time on the edges of your returns.",
      "There was a sketch we did, a Sally Jessy Raphael with Christina Ricci. She had never done live television before, so she was really spooked and kind of addled, and maybe had a little champagne. There was a bad teen sketch and I was Sally Jessy, there was a fist fight.",
      "It looked bad at dress. Lorne, in the notes, between dress and air, was like, \u201cLet\u2019s work on that punch.\u201d We didn\u2019t have a fight coordinator, it was very unrehearsed and the depth perception was off. We got to air and (Christina) was so focused, and that fist hit my nose in such a dramatic, hilarious, painful ... I mean, in the moment I remember my Sally Jessy red signature frames went flying up off my face and landed in, like, slow motion. It was insane. It was like a full-face TKO. I remember just being like, \u201cI\u2019ve got to maintain the impression,\u201d because I was so nervous about my Sally Jessy impression the whole time.",
      "Rachel Dratch (1999 to 2006)",
      "It's kind of a mix. Definite excitement, nerves ... fear is a factor. Doing theater before \"SNL,\" the fear is kind of what drives you. So, the fear is good actually. But, overall, excitement.",
      "This is kind of common sense, but you don't think of it when you're watching at home: That in between when you're watching a commercial, all the madness is happening because it's live. Someone's changing costume, hair, someone can go from being a baby to an old man in that commercial. There's a team of people working \u2014\u00a0every person has their own hair, makeup and wardrobe person. So, there's this huge transformation taking place or the sets are being moved.",
      "A sketch that went wrong in the best way possible was the \"Debbie Downer at Disney World,\" where we started laughing. That's the one everyone seems to remember so well. People tell me they watch when they're sad to cheer them up and that makes me so happy.",
      "But, yes, of course, we try not to laugh on the show. But that one, knowing the camera was coming in every time after I was saying this total bummer fact, and trying to keep it together, it just shows that this show is live. If there's any doubt, things can go wrong. And sometimes it's very funny when they do.",
      "Amy Poehler (2001 to 2008)",
      "Performing on \"SNL\" feels like working in a comedy emergency room. So you are rushing around sometimes, sometimes things are slow. You are around trained professionals, you have high stakes and it feels often very life or death.",
      "There's so many surprising things about \"SNL\" that people wouldn't realize. It's such a unique unicorn of a show and the way it's put together. I think a lot of people don't realize how tired everyone is all the time, especially during read through, because people have stayed up all night and then go in and have to perform.",
      "I think people also don't realize how most of your time at \"SNL\" is wondering when your food is going to get there. That's about 75% of your brain space, \"When is my food going to come?\" So, I think a lot of people are thinking that when (viewers) are thinking that they're thinking about sketches.",
      "My first year on \"SNL,\" the great John Goodman hosted and was so nice to me, even though I was a lone freshman. I remember I did a sketch with Chris Kattan and I got flipped into a dumpster \u2014 on purpose. I think I kind of passed out for a second and then woke up and I remember thinking, \"I wonder if anyone's ever passed out on 'SNL'?'\" Then I thought, \"How long have I been in this dumpster?\" So, that was fun. That was a good entry into what was a wild ride.",
      "Mikey Day (2013 to Present)",
      "It's so week-to-week. That's how the show works. You could have a week when you're in everything, you could have a week where you have three lines and one thing. It all depends. So, I feel like the emotions vary depending on that week.",
      "However, one constant is that after, \"Live from New York, it's Saturday Night,\" and the band starts playing \u2014 that's when the adrenaline (starts) and I'm always reminded, \"Oh wow, it's 'SNL,'\" and I always get kind of a little high off that.",
      "There's so many heroes on that show. The crew, itself, is, like, Tetris because Studio 8H isn't that big. So, they're constantly moving and all the equipment feels like it's from the '70s. This stuff has that old-school feel in terms of its size and bulk, and moving it to and fro on Saturday is pretty crazy. But they make it work somehow.",
      "Also, the filmed pieces, they build those sets in a day \u2014 a literal day \u2014 and sometimes there's three films being shot in one week, which is wild.",
      "Most recently, it was \"Beavis and Butt-Head\" with Ryan Gosling. It was a lot of fun. Heidi (Gardner) broke, Ryan and I were laughing, giggling like two schoolboys.",
      "But I remember the first time I laughed and it was in an unpredictable sketch called \"Dog Head Man.\" It's like geneticists who have created Dog Head Man. It was so dumb. At dress they were feeding the dog some treat or something and the dog didn't really like it. We're like, \"Can we just give it bread?\" And then it just went to town on this bread and I started laughing because Sam Rockwell and I were talking about such heavy stuff, and you just see the dog is so happy, going to town on human food.",
      "Dog Head Man stands out as one that I remember as the first time I kind of lost it. It wasn't too bad, but when you start to go, you're like, \"Oh no, I haven't done this before, am I going to get in trouble?\"",
      "Heidi Gardner (2017 to present)",
      "It's all of those things, actually. But I always just remind myself to have fun, take a few deep breaths. I'm going to do my job, the words are going to come out. That's always the biggest fear: Am I just going to stop knowing how to read cue cards? But it happens.",
      "I had never seen the show as a fan \u2014 I was a fan, but I had never gone to it. I really didn't understand that it was all in the same studio. I thought \"Weekend Update\" was in a separate room, that you walked down the hall to \"Weekend Update,\" then you walk to a sketch, but it's all in the studio. So, those two-minute commercial breaks really are like just complete chaos. The most organized chaos in the world. And it's really its own art form to watch the crew navigate that.",
      "Well, obviously, \"Beavis and Butt-Head,\" but there was one last season I did with Kristen Wiig, where we were \"Mad Men\" type secretaries, and she was supposed to fall through a desk, like sit on a desk and it breaks away. And I was supposed to fall through a wall and both of us just didn't quite have the strength to break either one.",
      "So, she sat on the desk and it didn't break and then she had to hop down. I went into the wall and it didn't break. So it was very funny to try and navigate that live.",
      "Chloe Fineman (2019 to Present)",
      "Performing on \"SNL\" is truly a fever dream. After so many shows, I'm like, \"Wait, what? I was with who? And I kissed so and so?\" Or, \"I was on stage with Ariana Grande?\" It really runs the gamut. It's very surreal, I'd say.",
      "I think viewers at home would be surprised to learn about the machine that happens during the live show. Anytime I've had friends and family come, it's amazing to watch. The sets are running over here and we're running here and there's heels and this thing's getting taken apart and put together. It happens like clockwork and, really, so much can go wrong. For some reason, it doesn't and it's magic. To me, that's almost as entertaining as the show.",
      "We did a \"Cast Away\" sketch with Jason Momoa, and he was supposed to lift me up and we were supposed to pretend to, like, have our bodies move, but he's so much bigger than me and I'm so short and little, that I really was like, \"Woo!\" He really thrusted me in a way that took my breath away. Honestly, that's a favorite."

I think he should, I don\u2019t know, end up in a meat-grinding machine.\u201d",
      "Though Coolidge's character Tanya is dead, she has ideas for how her spirit can live on.",

    "published": "Sun, 16 Feb 2025 19:55:52 GMT",
    "summary": "Anthony Mackie and Mark Waid, the comic book writer who introduced the idea of the first Black Captain America, discuss the controversy surround the superhero.",
    "story": [
      "Anthony Mackie taking on the role of Captain America, a fictional comic book character initially portrayed as a white man with blond hair and blue eyes, isn\u2019t groundbreaking to comic books fans.",
      "The idea of a Black man as the patriotic superhero was introduced in 1998 by writer Mark Waid in the comic book \u201cCaptain America: Sentinel of Liberty,\u201d where, according to Waid, Sam Wilson first \u201cpicked up the costume and took on the identity of Captain America.\u201d",
      "Over two decades after Sam Wilson became Cap in the comics, a Black Captain America in the movie adaptations has turned into a contentious topic.",
      "The issue of a Black Captain America in the Marvel Cinematic Universe first arose after Chris Evans, who portrayed Cap on-screen for eight years, passed the mantle on to Mackie\u2019s Falcon in 2019\u2019s \u201cAvengers: Endgame.\u201d Fans were upset with Evans\u2019 departure and some felt Mackie wasn\u2019t capable of taking on the superpowered role.",
      "Though some eventually warmed up to the idea after seeing him in the 2021 critically acclaimed Disney+ series, \u201cFalcon and the Winter Soldier,\u201d where Mackie\u2019s Falcon grapples with the complicated notion of what it means for a Black man to be Captain America, the vitriol against actor ramped back up during his press run for \u201cCaptain America: Brave New World.\u201d",
      "During a Q&A in January, fans threatened to boycott the film and Mackie because of his comments on what he thinks Captain America represents that some deemed unpatriotic.",
      "\u201cCaptain America represents a lot of different things, and I don\u2019t think the term \u2018America\u2019 should be one of those representations. It\u2019s about a man who keeps his word and who has honor, dignity, and integrity. Someone who is trustworthy and dependable. This is like an aspect of a dream coming true,\u201d the actor said at the time.",
      "Following the backlash, Mackie has since clarified his comments online and in interviews, saying he\u2019s a \u201cproud American,\u201d and that Captain America is \u201cimportant for kids of all races\u201d so they can have someone to look up to regardless of their race.",
      "Speaking to TODAY.com about some fans\u2019 mixed reaction following the first teaser of him as Cap, Mackie, 46, says he wasn\u2019t \u201caware\u201d that a Black Captain America had become so controversial.",
      "\u201cI think that\u2019s funny, because we all call ourselves comic book fans, right? We all call ourselves comic book nerds, right? So if the comic book says, Sam Wilson becomes Captain America, then Sam Wilson becomes Captain America,\u201d Mackie says pragmatically.",
      "Though Mackie says he \u201cdidn\u2019t have any hesitations\u201d taking on the role in the MCU, Waid \u2014 who introduced the idea of Falcon becoming the first Black Captain America in the comics \u2014 admits there was \u201ca little bit of resistance\u201d from Marvel when he pitched it in the '90s.",
      "\u201cNot because anybody disbelieved the message,\u201d Waid, 62, tells TODAY.com. \u201cNot because anybody at Marvel was on the wrong side of history here, but just because when you\u2019re dealing with a corporate character like that it\u2019s going to go through many creators hands over his 80 years of existence.\u201d",
      "We all call ourselves comic book fans, right? We all call ourselves comic book nerds, right? So if the comic book says, Sam Wilson becomes Captain America, then Sam Wilson becomes Captain America.\u201d",
      "Anthony mackie",
      "Captain America was first created in 1941 during World War II. Since then, an array of people have held the role in the comics, including women and people of color, like Sam Wilson.",
      "Waid explains that Marvel wanted him to be careful and not\u00a0\u201ctoo extreme\u201d since that could potentially \u201calienate\u201d a huge part of their audience. \u201cBecause that\u2019s where the money comes from,\u201d he explains.",
      "But Waid\u2019s goal wasn\u2019t just to make sure the comic\u2019s core readers were satisfied, it was also to authentically portray the Black experience. To do this, the comic book writer says he spoke to his real-life Black friends who made him see a different perspective of America, which included sentiments of \u201cracial hatred\u201d and \u201cbigotry.\u201d",
      "\u201c\u2018There is more of this going on than you realize \u2026 so just be mindful of that as you go into the story,\u2019\u201d he recalls them saying.",
      "Within Marvel, Waid says his story of Falcon taking on the mantle of Captain America \u201cwas very well received.\u201d But externally, he says there was \u201ca little bit of pushback\u201d from fandom and readers, with some saying, \u2018\u2018Well, this is not Captain America. I don\u2019t know what you\u2019re trying to say.\u201d",
      "Looking back, Waid says the pushback by fans wasn\u2019t so severe that he recalls \u201creceiving any hate mail\u201d about it. But he suspects that if he had done this story today, \u201cpeople would be screaming DEI at us at the top of their lungs without knowing what they\u2019re talking about.\u201d",
      "Waid notes that over the last 10 to 15 years, \u201cThere\u2019s been a lot more trolling, a lot more blow back. A lot of organized fandom full of angry white guys who are not happy that they are being quote, unquote, eclipsed by people of color, which is bulls--t.\u201d",
      "If we had done this story today, people would be screaming DEI at us at the top of their lungs without knowing what they\u2019re talking about.\u201d",
      "Mark Waid, writer of \u00a0\u201cCaptain America: Sentinel of Liberty\u201d",
      "The tenured comic book writer says it comes as no surprise that some fans are upset and even threatening to boycott Marvel\u2019s TV shows and the movies, because \u201cthese are the same people who were up in arms about the comics.\u201d",
      "\u201cLuckily, they have been a small enough part of the audience where we didn\u2019t have to take them into account,\u201d he explains. \u201cIt\u2019s not like we lost tons of sales because these trolls were out there being actively, performatively angry about the replacement of Captain America by a Black man in a comic book. They weren\u2019t buying the comics anyway. They were just looking for something to be mad about.\u201d",
      "Waid\u2019s introduction of Sam Wilson (Falcon) as Captain America in the comic \u201cCaptain America: Sentinel of Liberty #9\u201d unfolds in a time of \u201cgreat racial divide\u201d in America.",
      "Steve Rogers (Captain America) is trying to disassociate himself from white supremacists (Sons of Serpents) who are co-opting his name and image because they believe that Cap represents their cause, Waid explains.",
      "\u201c\u2018He\u2019s a blonde white guy with a strong jaw. He\u2019s showing you that this is what America should be,\u2019\u201d he says of their sentiments toward Rogers \u2014 who, during his fight to stop them, appears to get killed. It\u2019s at this juncture that \u201cSam Wilson realizes that someone has to pick up the mantle, someone has to pick up the shield, and someone has to fight to clear the name of Captain America.\u201d",
      "While the film is not exactly like the comics, there are similarities. Directed by Julius Onah, the film follows Falcon\u2019s fight to uncover a villainous plot against President Thaddeus Ross (Harrison Ford) while also helping to exonerate Isaiah Bradley (Carl Lumbly) \u2014 a war vet who is turned into a Super Soldier after undergoing human testings by the government \u2014 who was accused of being involved. Some fans have argued that Bradley is the first Black Captain America since he took the Super Solider serum like Cap. Mackie says Sam's sense of integrity and dedication to justice is what he leans into and tries to embody with his titular role.",
      "\u201cOne thing that I\u2019ve always wanted to portray with Sam, and make the focal point of that conversation, is the fact that he\u2019s the best part of all of us,\u201d Mackie tells TODAY.com. \u201cSam didn\u2019t take the (Super Soldier) serum. Sam isn\u2019t a Super Soldier. He\u2019s just a good human being, and I think that\u2019s why we all kind of are endeared to him and kind of appreciate him, because we can see the best of us in him.\u201d",
      "One thing that I\u2019ve always wanted to portray with Sam, and make the focal point of that conversation, is the fact that he\u2019s the best part of all of us.\"",
      "Anthony Mackie",
      "Since its first publication in March 1941, Waid says Captain America has had a simple, altruistic purpose: he represented the American dream and showed that it was attainable. But he says Cap\u2019s mission has \u201cchanged\u201d over the years.",
      "\u201cAmerica was the land of opportunity,\u201d Waid tells TODAY.com. \u201cAnd clearly it has not always been that way for some people \u2026 And I think that Captain America today stands for equality. He stands for making sure that anyone in this country has an opportunity at bettering themselves and has an opportunity to have the best life possible \u2014 if they\u2019re willing to put the work into it.\u201d",
      "And Anthony Mackie has put that work in with his over two decades in Hollywood and 10 years playing Sam Wilson. Still, even with his tenure, there will still be those who take issue with there being a Black Captain America.",
      "Mackie even gave a nod to the pressure of taking on Cap\u2019s mantle in the film. In an exchange with President Ross following the attack on his life, Mackie\u2019s Sam tells the president that he overwhelmingly understands what he\u2019s going through.",
      "\u201cI know what it\u2019s like to feel you have something to prove,\u201d he says.",
      "Later in the film, Mackie is seen grappling with his past decision to reject the Super Soldier serum and also the pressure that he\u2019s under if he fails his mission.",
      "\u201cIf I\u2019m not on point, I let everyone who wants a seat at that table down,\u201d he says to his First Lieutenant Joaquin Torres (Danny Ramirez), who takes on Sam's former mantle of Falcon. \u201cThat\u2019s pressure. It makes you feel that you\u2019re not enough.\u201d",
      "The \"Captain America\" comic book writer says there\u2019s always been room\u00a0for the character to change, evolve and represent something more inclusive.",
      "\u201cCaptain America can be an Asian man. Captain America can be a woman. Captain America could be anyone who stands for the ideals that Captain America stands for,\u201d Waid explains, noting that he hopes Cap\u2019s fight eventually \u201cgets easier.\u201d",
      "\u201cAs long as they\u2019re an American at heart and fight for the American way \u2026 the way we wish truly was the dream as opposed to what racism and bigotry has sort of poisoned that well.\u201d",
      "Mackie agrees, noting that his Captain America leads with two important things: \u201cCompassion and empathy.\u201d",
      "\u201cI feel like today, we could all use a little compassion and empathy,\u201d he adds.",

    "summary": "Who is Belinda on The White Lotus? Remembering where Natasha Rothwell left off her character.",
    "story": [
      "\"The White Lotus\" is back, and so is Belinda, the resort masseuse played by Natasha Rothwell.",
      "Season 3 of the Emmy-winning HBO series will look sparkling new in a lot of ways \u2014 from its new set of characters to its Thailand location. But not everyone will be unfamiliar, particularly if you\u2019ve watched Season 1.",
      "One of the first season\u2019s most sympathetic characters, Belinda's storyline wrapped in a bittersweet way. Not only is she returning \u2014 she\u2019s also a guest at the resort, rather than an employee, this season.",
      "Below, we'll go over who Belinda is and what we should know about her before Season 3 premieres.",
      "What happens to Belinda in Season 1 of \u2018The White Lotus\u2019?",
      "Belinda Lindsey manages the resort spa at the White Lotus resort in Maui, Hawaii, and so has a hospitality spirit that keeps her privileged, often spoiled guests from getting upset.",
      "She bonds with guest Tanya McQuoid (Jennifer Coolidge) primarily, revealing that she\u2019s low-key, empathetic and even a bit spiritual.",
      "Afterward, she and Tanya have a few conversations about opening a wellness business together (funded largely by Tanya). Alas, Tanya\u2019s attention soon turns to her new boyfriend, local sport fisherman Greg. She blows off a dinner with Belinda \u2014 and chooses to invest herself, and her money, in his plans.",
      "Shattered when Tanya abandons their shared dream, Belinda is buoyed slightly when the guest hands her an envelope stuffed with cash. It\u2019s not what she hoped for, but it\u2019s still better than nothing.",
      "What\u2019s Belinda\u2019s storyline in Season 3?",
      "To be determined. According to what Rothwell told Entertainment Weekly, Tanya is still an employee of The White Lotus but is \u201cin Thailand doing sort of an exchange program to learn more about the wellness programs that the Thailand White Lotus offers.\u201d",
      "In that capacity, Tanya is both employee and guest, but she\u2019ll get to take classes while she\u2019s there and enjoy the hotel\u2019s amenities.",
      "As a \u201cdownstairs\u201d employee hanging out with the \u201cupstairs\u201d folks, she\u2019ll likely empathize with the hotel workers, while also using her skills and charm to make friends with some of the guests.",
      "Expect class struggle between the haves and have-nots as she wanders the resort alongside a clutch of longtime friends vacationing together, a curious couple and two parents traveling with their three grown kids. It\u2019s a combination that echoes Season 1 of the series.",
      "The trailer does reveal that a robbery takes place and Belinda is shown urging someone to call the police. When someone quips, \u201cGo big or go home\u201d in the trailer, she responds knowingly, \u201c\u2026 in a g\u2014damn body bag.\u201d",
      "But as for her dreams \u2014 we think Belinda still has that wellness center dream. All she really needs from this vacation may be an angel investor!",
      "But we won\u2019t really know where she\u2019s going until after the show premieres.",
      "What has Natasha Rothwell said about returning?",
      "Belinda is still recovering from Tanya\u2019s (well-paid) ghosting, Rothwell told Entertainment Weekly \u201cShe was so devastated by Tanya taking what little hope she had and shattering it,\u201d says Rothwell.",
      "\u201cOver the course of the Italy (second) season of \u2018White Lotus\u2019 in the world that we\u2019ve created, she\u2019s been trying to dig herself out of that sadness and really be inspired again. Her purpose for coming to Thailand is to have a dream again.\u201d"

      "Season 8 of \u201cLove Is Blind\u201d has arrived, and after six episodes multiple couples have already found love and heartbreak in the pods.",
      "In the latest season of the hit Netflix dating series, which arrived on Feb. 14, 32 singles from Minneapolis met and mingled with each other, hoping to find their soulmate on the other side of an opaque wall.",
      "As \u201cLove Is Blind\u201d fans have come to expect, quite a few love triangles popped up that caused some contestants to declare their feelings and others to doubt their connections.",
      "Speaking to TODAY.com, Vanessa and Nick Lachey, who host the U.S. version of the show, explained why so much of this season unfolds in the pods.",
      "\u201cThey didn\u2019t just come in guns blazing going, \u2018We need to get engaged,\u2019\u201d Vanessa Lachey said of the cast. \u201cThey really pulled back the curtain, if you will, and peeled back the layers of themselves and the couples to really get down to it.\u201d",
      "Nick Lachey said this season's geographical location impacted the vibe of the cast and couples, too.",
      "\u201cMinnesota is totally Midwest,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s just a different pool of people here. So, every season\u2019s different. And I think what people will find in this particular season is that it\u2019s very, very ... I don\u2019t want to say\u00a0sweet, but it\u2019s more, it\u2019s more heartfelt.\u201d",
      "By the end of Episode 6, five couples agreed to get married, sight unseen, while two pairs realized that they weren\u2019t ready to move onto the next part of the experiment.",
      "So, who got engaged and traveled to Honduras for their couples trip?",
      "Read on to learn more about the Season 8 couples who are still together, as well as the relationships that didn\u2019t make it out of the pods, below.",
      "Season 8 couples who are still together",
      "Devin and Virginia",
      "Devin Buckley and Virginia Miller hit it off in the pods after learning that they both attended the same Minnesota high school. But, Devin, a 29-year-old youth director and coach, was a student at the school a few years after Virginia, a 34-year-old healthcare recruiter, graduated and the two had never crossed paths.",
      "While in the pods, Devin also formed a connection with Brittany Dodson, but the relationship fizzled out when she realized he was too \u201crigid\u201d and didn\u2019t seem like the ideal partner. He agreed and continued to pursue Virginia, who had been reserved and skeptical during many of their conversations.",
      "In Episode 6, Devin wrote a sweet letter to Virginia expressing his feelings. \u201cVirginia, you are the most kind, loving and genuine person I\u2019ve ever met,\u201d he praised. \u201cI know that in your past relationships, they made you feel insecure and undervalued. But I promise to always make you feel valued, loved, and to make you feel like the queen that you are.\u201d",
      "At the end of his letter, he told Virginia he loved her and asked her to marry him. \u201cYes, I will,\u201d she softly replied. She later told the cameras through tears, \u201cI haven\u2019t felt like this ever. I just feel amazing. Today\u2019s a good day.\u201d",
      "Daniel and Taylor",
      "Daniel Hastings and Taylor Haag matched each other\u2019s energy from their first conversation. He joked about proposing a few minutes into their chat and she playfully went along. When she returned to gush with the girls, Taylor, a 32-year-old colonoscopy nurse, said she appreciated that Daniel, a 30-year-old sales account executive, repeatedly spoke about searching for the mother of his kids.",
      "They also bonded over their love of Christmas. In Episode 5, they gifted each other Christmas ornaments and stockings and marveled over their similarities. \u201cThe Christmas thing means a lot to me,\u201d Daniel said. \u201cBut even if it wasn\u2019t Christmas stuff, I feel like we were meant to find each other.\u201d",
      "Taylor replied that Daniel made her feel \u201cvery special, very loved and very important.\u201d She then told Daniel that his words to her were the nicest things anyone has ever said to her.",
      "In Episode 6, he read her a letter explaining why he loved her. \u201cAll I want to do is make you feel safe and make you happy for the rest of your life,\u201d Daniel said. He then knelt on one knee and proposed.",
      "\u201cI would love to marry you!\u201d she cheered.",
      "David and Lauren",
      "David \u201cDave\u201d Bettenburg and Lauren O\u2019Brien were one of many Season 8 contestants who were involved in a love triangle. Dave, a 33-year-old medical device salesman, couldn\u2019t determine if he had stronger feelings for Lauren or Molly Mulaney. When Lauren, a 31-year-old education saleswoman, realized Dave was undecided, she revealed to him that she didn\u2019t have any other connections.",
      "Meanwhile, Molly anxiously waited for Dave to call it quits with Lauren and solely pursue her. But in Episode 5, Dave cried as he told Molly that he wanted to \u201csee things through\u201d with Lauren instead. Molly was hurt but said she knew if he didn\u2019t want her then it wasn\u2019t meant to be.",
      "Dave then met with Lauren. She said although they had some tough conversations she appreciated that they were open with each other and were able to move past everything.",
      "He agreed and said, \u201cYou easily could have bailed. I just can\u2019t thank you enough for your patience because it helped me come to terms with a lot of other things. And not being afraid to go after the girl that I really want to be with. I\u2019m so in love with you.\u201d",
      "He proposed and she quickly accepted. \u201cI love you so much, too. I\u2019m excited to just start a future with you,\u201d she said.",
      "Joey and Monica",
      "Joey Leveille and Monica Danus\u2019 time in the pods was drama-free. Joey, a 35-year-old physician associate, and Monica, a 28-year-old digital marketer, seemed to only form a bond with each other. They quickly connected thanks to their bubbly and quirky personalities and their love for \u201cThe Sound of Music.\u201d Joey also supported Monica when she revealed that she was between jobs because she needed to take time off to help her family.",
      "By Episode 2, they already knew that they wanted to get engaged and leave the pods together, making them the first official couple of Season 8.\u00a0 \u201cI\u2019ve had an incredible time falling in love with who you are as a person, your laugh, your voice, and I would love to take the next step with you,\u201d Joey said.",
      "\u201cWould you get engaged with me?\u201d he asked.",
      "She laughed and said \u201cYes!\u201d She said she couldn\u2019t wait to see him in person before running to share the news with her friends.",
      "Ben and Sara",
      "Ben Mezzenga and Sara Carton briefly struggled in the pods when they started discussing their values. In Episode 2, Sara, a 29-year-old oncology nurse, asked Ben, a 28-year-old developer, about growing up in a Christian household. He explained his beliefs before she revealed that she wasn\u2019t religious.",
      "\u201cThe main thing for me that\u2019s really tough about religion is my sister, Lisa. She\u2019s my best friend. She\u2019s gay,\u201d she explained. She asked if Ben would be comfortable around her sister and would go to Pride activities with them.",
      "\u201cYeah, no discomfort around that community at all,\u201d he replied. She felt confident in their connection, but when they met again in Episode 4, she had some more concerns. She mentioned Donald Trump\u2019s first presidency and the Black Lives Matter protests in 2020.",
      "\u201cI\u2019m kind of ignorant towards that stuff. Like, I didn\u2019t vote in the last election. As long as I don\u2019t know, it\u2019s not going to do much, so\u2026\u201d Ben said. When she asked directly about BLM, he said, \u201cI\u2019m not one way or the other. I just kind of keep out of it.\u201d",
      "Sara replied, \u201cI think it\u2019s very valuable and important to think about those things.\u201d\u00a0 She later said she didn\u2019t like his responses to her questions. \u201cBasic human rights, equality, I need someone to be on the same page with me about that,\u201d she said.",
      "Ben assured her in Episode 5 that their values aligned. \u201cI don\u2019t want you to have any burden or any weight on your shoulder thinking that you have to teach me because I do have that motivation to grow into that and that internal feeling that we do have the same beliefs in these things,\u201d he said before proposing.",
      "\u201cI feel so at peace and accepted by you,\u201d she said after accepting his proposal. \u201cI honestly can\u2019t imagine being with anyone else.\u201d",
      "Season 8 couples who are no longer together",
      "Alex and Madison",
      "Alex Brown and Madison Errichiello opened up in the pods about their difficult childhoods. Alex, a 29-year-old commercial real estate broker, and Madison, a 28-year-old artist, were both bullied in school and felt like outcasts.",
      "The two seemed headed for an engagement until Madison revealed she had an avoidant attachment style. Alex suddenly became less talkative and their conversation ended abruptly.",
      "When they met again, Alex voiced his concerns that Madison would run if they faced an obstacle. She told him that her still being in the experiment was proof that she was ready to go through challenging times with him. Meanwhile, Madison was also building a connection with Mason Horacen.",
      "Mason told Madison he was \u201ccommitted\u201d to her. But when Madison decided to pursue her relationship with Alex instead, Mason regretted what he said. In Episode 6, Madison explained the situation to Alex.",
      "Alex said he sympathized with Mason and wished him well. Madison didn\u2019t appreciate that Alex wasn\u2019t more comforting toward her.\u00a0 After their tense conversation, Alex said he could see a future with her but he was worried they would struggle with communication and disagreements. \u201cI think at this point, it\u2019s a pretty big jump. We\u2019re not at a point to get engaged,\u201d he said.",
      "Madison tearfully departed the pods and left the experiment.",
      "In an interview with TODAY.com, Alex said he had no regrets over ending the relationship.",
      "\"I was confident in the decision. If we could go back and do things again, I think it would have unfolded the same way. I\u2019m glad that we got all of the issues out on the table the way we did so we could make that decision early on instead of moving forward and proposing and then going on the trip and then living together. I think it would have been a lot messier if that were to happen,\" he said.",
      "His decision came down to attachment style and conflict resolution, as it appeared in the pods. \"I think she has different ways of dealing with conflict than I do, and again, that\u2019s totally fine. There\u2019s nothing right or wrong with either way, but I think we just realized that we are both on very different pages and that communication wasn\u2019t going to be easy,\" he said.",
      "Read the rest of our interview with Alex here.",
      "Mason and Meg",
      "Mason, a 33-year-old cinematographer, gravitated toward Meg Fink, a 31-year-old oncology nurse, in the pods. She shared her conspiracy theories with him and expressed her strong feelings. But she knew that Mason also had a connection with Madison.",
      "After Madison ended things with Mason, she told Meg what happened. Meg confronted Mason in the pods at the end of Episode 5. She questioned if she was only there by \u201cdefault\u201d because Madison rejected him.",
      "He said he validated the \u201cwrong person\u201d because he was \u201cconfused\u201d at the time.",
      "When he said she was always his first choice, Meg replied, \u201cI wasn\u2019t yesterday, just to be fair.\u201d She said he never affirmed his feelings for her until it was too late.",
      "\u201cI\u2019ll never know if what you\u2019re saying is true because we don\u2019t get the opportunity for you to pick,\u201d she told him in Episode 6. \u201cI\u2019m not going to be able to get past that.\u201d",
      "He said he understood her perspective and they said goodbye.",

      "\"To be quite honest with you, I finished filming about 4 a.m. last night, outside in the rain, so to then wake up and get on an 8 a.m. flight was a little challenging,\" he says. \"But '9-1-1' were actually super accommodating in making sure I was free to do this, but they did send me on my way with a night shoot.\"",

      "Season 7, Episode 4, which aired April 4, 2024, saw Buck deal with a newfound jealousy over his best friend Eddie's (Ryan Guzman) new friendship with Tommy (Louis Ferrigno Jr.) Later in the episode, Buck learns via Eddie's wall calendar that he and Tommy have plans to play pick-up basketball, which he decides to crash.",

After Eddie steals the ball, Buck chases him down before shoving him, fracturing Eddie's ankle. In the end, Tommy apologizes for excluding Buck, while Buck cops to feeling jealous and admitting he had been trying to get Tommy's attention.",

(\"It was on 'Jeopardy!'?\" he says when asked about it.)",
      "Stark says he's \"cautiously optimistic\" going into the game.",
      "\"I think I'm trying to focus on, 'I'm just here to have fun,' but I do know that my competitive side will probably take over,\" he says. \"But listen, I might spend the whole game on the bench.\"",

      "This interview has been lightly edited and condensed for clarity.",
      "So listen, it's been a little while since I've played basketball competitively. I played a lot in high school, but that was some years ago. So as soon as I got the email about this, to be quite honest with you, I said, 'Yes.' I put my phone down. I went to the park, and I've pretty much been there ever since playing day in and day out, just to kind of get it back in my body a little bit.",
      "(Laughs) Well, I'll tell you, one of the things that I miscalculated was, you know, I'm 6' 2\", and so I thought that maybe, you know, for the kind of game that it is, that I might be on the taller side. But I'm actually one of the shorter players. So I'm going to put that as a weakness. And I'm going to put, and I say this tentatively, but sports IQ in my in my strengths column, and hope that works in my favor.",
      "Most of their reactions were to do with my somewhat injured knee that I've been struggling with for the past year. And basically everyone said, \"Is your knee going to be able to handle that?\" To which I said, \"I don't know. I guess we'll find out.\"",
      "But over the weeks of prepping for it, I feel good about it and having told that to them, they're all really excited. And they've all said to make sure I let them know exactly what network it's on, what time, and they're going to be cheering me on from back down in Los Angeles.",
      "\"9-1-1\" returns March 6 with Season 8, Episode 9, titled, \"Sob Stories.\" The midseason finale of the show left Buck reeling when Eddie told him he plans to move to El Paso to be closer to his son, Christopher. Buck has also been mourning the end of his relationship with Tommy, who broke up with Buck in Episode 6. Meanwhile, a trailer for the Season 8 return hints that Buck's sister, Maddie, is about to be kidnapped by a serial killer.",
      "Yeah, there's a ton of different stuff going on. There's a lot of tension  in the upcoming episodes between characters that we don't often see tension between. I think the stories across these (episodes), it's going to be quite a fraught and intense atmosphere for a good healthy portion of it. And that's not something that '9-1-1' tends to do, right? In general, our main cast, our main characters, are a pretty tight knit group, whereas we're going to be looking at what happens when you kind of start to tug at a thread, and you know, it keeps on pulling and pulling, and you kind of watch a lot of things unravel as that goes.",
      "Definitely, and I think they're going to be kind of explored and looked at in a way that is more obvious than kind of has ever been done before on the show. To an extent where I was actually surprised by the extent to which it's going to be explored. So, yeah, no, absolutely, that is to come very soon.",
      "Not that specifically. But just kind of an exploration of what the feelings are.",
      "Yeah... I'll say no more on that."

      "His Danish counterpart, Mette Frederiksen, also warned that a quick ceasefire deal would allow Russia to remobilize and attack Ukraine again or target another country in Europe. \u201cRussia is threatening all of\u00a0Europe\u00a0now, unfortunately,\u201d she told reporters.",
      "Jean-No\u00ebl Barrot, France's minister of foreign affairs, also indicated on Sunday that discussions were underway on the deployment of French, British and Polish troops \u2014 the countries possess three of Europe's biggest armies \u2014 to guarantee a future ceasefire in Ukraine.",

      "Israeli forces will remain in five strategic locations in southern Lebanon near the border after Tuesday\u2019s deadline for their full withdrawal, an Israeli official said Monday.",
      "The official spoke on condition of anonymity in line with regulations.",
      "Lebanon\u2019s government has opposed any further delay in the Israeli pullout under the ceasefire agreement that ended fighting with the Hezbollah militant group. There was no immediate comment from Lebanese or Hezbollah officials. Earlier on Monday, an Israeli strike in Lebanon killed a senior Hamas leader.",
      "The news came as Israelis were marking the 500th day since Hamas\u2019 Oct. 7, 2023, attack, which ignited the war in the Gaza Strip and rippled across the region, eventually setting off a full-blown war between Israel and Hezbollah.",
      "The war in Gaza was paused last month\u00a0when a fragile ceasefire took hold. The first phase of the truce is set to end in early March, and it\u2019s unclear whether it will be extended to allow the release of dozens more hostages, or if Israel will renew its military offensive against Hamas with U.S. support.",
      "Separately, an anti-settlement watchdog said Monday that Israel has issued a tender for the construction of nearly 1,000\u00a0additional settler homes\u00a0in the occupied West Bank.",
      "Peace Now says the development of 974 new housing units would allow the population of the Efrat settlement to expand by 40% and further block the development of the nearby Palestinian city of Bethlehem. Hagit Ofran, who leads the group\u2019s settlement monitoring, said construction can begin after the contracting process and issuing of permits, which could take another year at least.",
      "There was no immediate comment from the Israeli government.",
      "Israel captured the West Bank, along with the Gaza Strip and east Jerusalem, in the 1967 Mideast war. The Palestinians want all three territories for their future state and view the settlements as a major obstacle to peace, a position with wide international support.",
      "Settlement expansion",
      "President Donald Trump lent\u00a0unprecedented support to the settlements\u00a0during his previous term. Israel has also steadily expanded settlements during Democratic administrations, which were more critical but rarely took any action to curb them.",
      "Israel has built well over 100 settlements across the West Bank, ranging from hilltop outposts to fully developed suburban communities, with apartment blocks, malls and parks.",
      "Over 500,000 settlers live in the occupied West Bank, which is home to some 3 million Palestinians. The settlers have Israeli citizenship, while Palestinians live under military rule with the Western-backed Palestinian Authority administering population centers.",
      "The Israeli government views the West Bank as the historical and biblical heartland of the Jewish people and is opposed to Palestinian statehood, while human rights groups have accused Israel of\u00a0discrimination against and oppression of\u00a0Palestinians in the West Bank.",
      "Peace Now, which favors a negotiated two-state solution to the conflict, accused Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu\u2019s government of pressing ahead with settlement construction while dozens of hostages captured in Hamas\u2019 Oct. 7, 2023, attack languish in captivity in the Gaza Strip.",

      "\u201cAll I care about, all I want, is for my friends to return. There were six of us living in unbearable conditions, in a six-square-meter (65-square-foot) space. I got out, but they are still there,\u201d Ohad Ben Ami, a\u00a0hostage who was released a week and a half ago, told Israeli President Isaac Herzog on Monday. He added that hostages don\u2019t count days while in captivity, they count minutes and seconds.",
      "Hamas is set to continue the gradual release of 33 hostages during the current phase of the truce in exchange for hundreds of Palestinian prisoners. Israeli forces have pulled back from most parts of Gaza and allowed a surge of humanitarian aid.",
      "But the two sides have yet to negotiate the second phase, in which Hamas would release more than 70 remaining hostages \u2014 around half of whom are believed to be dead \u2014 in exchange for more Palestinian prisoners, a full Israeli withdrawal and a lasting ceasefire.",
      "Netanyahu and the Trump administration have given conflicting signals over whether they want to continue the ceasefire or renew the war. Both they say are committed to the eradication of Hamas and the return of all the hostages, but those goals are widely seen as incompatible.",
      "Hamas-led militants killed some 1,200 people, mostly civilians, in the Oct. 7, 2023, attack and abducted around 250. More than half of the hostages have been returned in agreements with Hamas or other deals, while just eight have been rescued in military operations.",
      "The militant group, though weakened,\u00a0remains in full control of the territory. Hamas has said it is willing to relinquish power to other Palestinians but will not accept any occupying force.",
      "Israel\u2019s air and ground war has killed over 48,000 Palestinians, more than half of them women and children, according to Gaza\u2019s Health Ministry, which does not say how many were combatants. The war destroyed vast areas of Gaza and at its height had displaced around 90% of the population of 2.3 million.",
      "Trump has called for Gaza\u2019s population to be permanently relocated to other countries and for the United States to take ownership of the territory and rebuild it for others. Israel has welcomed the plan, while Palestinians and Arab nations\u00a0have universally rejected the idea.",
      "Rights groups and experts say the proposal, if implemented,\u00a0would likely violate international law.",
      "The proposal has meanwhile cast further doubt over the future of the ceasefire. Hamas may be unwilling to release the remaining captives \u2014 its only bargaining chips \u2014 it if believes Israel is going to resume the war with the goal of expelling the Palestinian population.",
      "Hamas official killed",
      "An Israeli drone strike targeted a car in Lebanon\u2019s southern port city of Sidon, the deepest strike since the ceasefire between Hezbollah and Israel took effect in November.",
      "Israel said it targeted Muhammad Shaheen, the head of Hamas\u2019 operations in Lebanon. Footage circulating online showed a car engulfed in flames. The strike occurred near a Lebanese army checkpoint and Sidon\u2019s municipal sports stadium.",
      "The original withdrawal deadline was in late January, but under pressure from Israel, Lebanon agreed to extend it to Feb. 18. It remains unclear whether Israeli troops will complete their withdrawal by Tuesday.",
      "Since the ceasefire, Israel has continued airstrikes in southern and eastern Lebanon, saying it is targeting military sites containing missiles and combat equipment. Each side has accused the other of violating the truce."

      "Netanyahu's office said the negotiating team would receive \"instructions for the continuation of negotiations on Phase B issues\" after the Israeli security Cabinet's discussion on the matter as it pushed back on reports suggesting Israel had dispatched the negotiating team under U.S. pressure.",
      "Branding those reports \"fake news,\" Netanyahu's office said in a statement there had been \"no American pressure to send a delegation to negotiate Phase 2.\"",
      "Still, plans for further negotiations come after Netanyahu said Sunday following a visit from Secretary of State Marco Rubio that Israel and the Trump administration had formed a \"joint strategy\" to ensure that the \"gates of hell will open\" if Hamas does not eventually release all of the hostages who remain held captive in Gaza \u2014 a key requirement of the current ceasefire deal.",
      "He also said Israel was \"committed\" to Trump's widely condemned plan to take over Gaza, where tens of thousands of people have been killed and much of the infrastructure destroyed during Israel's offensive in the enclave.",
      "That campaign began after around 1,200 people were killed in the Hamas-led Oct. 7, 2023, terror attacks, with 251 people taken hostage into Gaza in an assault that marked a major escalation in a decadeslong conflict.",
      "Since then, more than 48,000 people have been killed in Gaza, according to local health officials, though researchers estimate the death toll could be significantly higher. At least 60% of the territory\u2019s infrastructure, including schools and hospitals, has been destroyed, according to estimates from the United Nations.",
      "Hailing Trump's proposal to take over Gaza as a \"revolutionary vision,\" Netanyahu said the U.S. and Israel had also come up with a \"joint strategy\" to see it through and bring about a \"completely different Gaza.\"",
      "In a meeting Sunday with a U.S. Senate delegation led by Sen. Lindsey Graham, R-S.C., Israeli Defense Minister Israel Katz further said he believed Trump's plan for Gaza was \"the only one that can guarantee security for the residents of the south and the state of Israel, in light of the lessons learned from the events of Oct. 7.\"",
      "Hamas on Sunday accused Netanyahu of looking to \u201creturn to aggression\u201d in Gaza as it accused Israel of \u201chesitation in starting the second phase of negotiations.\u201d",
      "The militant group also accused Israeli forces of carrying out a bombing east of Rafah city in southern Gaza, which it said killed three police officers. Video captured by NBC News\u2019 crew on the ground in Gaza on Sunday appeared to show people mourning over their bodies after they were taken to the European Hospital in Khan Younis.",

      "It added that forces on Sunday had fired to distance \u201csuspicious vehicles\u201d that were advancing north from central Gaza along a route unauthorized for passage under the ceasefire agreement and that the trucks had not been inspected, which it said violated the terms of the truce.",
      "That came as concerns grew over the expansion of Israeli settlements in the occupied West Bank.",
      "Anti-settlement watchdog group Peace Now said in a news release Sunday that Israel had issued a tender for the construction of nearly 1,000 additional settler housing units that could significantly expand the population of the Efrat settlement in the territory.",
      "The organization warned that such a development would also risk further blocking the development of the nearby Palestinian city of Bethlehem.",
      "Israel has occupied the West Bank since the 1967 Middle East war, building and expanding Jewish settlements there that are widely considered illegal by the international community, a charge Israel rejects.",
      "The West Bank, Gaza and east Jerusalem would form the internationally recognized future state Palestinians seek \u2014 and the expansion of settlements, as well as Trump's plan to take over Gaza, presents major obstacles to that effort."

      "Crowded in the drab, concrete prison are thousands of men, many of them captured on the battlefield during ISIS\u2019 last stand in 2019, who sit or lie around in tattered brown jailhouse uniforms, dozens in each cell.",

    "story": [
      "For a country ravaged by two years of brutal civil war and with over 30 million people \u2014 or more than half of the population \u2014 in need of humanitarian assistance, President Donald Trump\u2019s 90-day freeze on all foreign aid could not have come at a worse time for Sudan.",
      "As battles rage in the North African country, a network of communal kitchens has had to immediately stop most of its operations due to a lack of funding, about 75% of which came from the U.S. Agency for International Development (USAID), according to their organizers.",
      "Part of Sudan\u2019s Emergency Response Rooms (ERRs) \u2014\u00a0a civilian-led, grassroots effort to provide humanitarian support \u2014 the kitchens have been able to provide food, medicine and other basic supplies to people in parts of the country unreachable by aid agencies.",
      "Without the American funding \u201ca lot of people will die because of hunger,\u201d Abuzar Osman Suliman, the coordinator of the ERRs in Sudan\u2019s western Darfur region, told NBC News on Friday.",
      "Suliman, who said it cost $10,000 for a single kitchen in Darfur to feed 250 families for two weeks, gave a 10 to 20 day window for people to start dying.",
      "Trump signed an executive order on Jan. 20 freezing foreign assistance, forcing American-funded aid and development programs worldwide to shut down and lay off staff.\u00a0Secretary of State Marco Rubio said he had sought to mitigate the damage by issuing a waiver to exempt emergency food aid and \u201clife-saving\u201d programs, but USAID officials and aid groups say neither funding nor staffing have been reinstated in order to allow even the most essential programs to start working again.",
      "In Sudan, Suliman said all 40 of ERRs\u2019 community kitchens had to close in Darfur\u2019s Zamzam camp, where more than 1 million displaced people have sought refuge from the conflict between the country\u2019s two main warring powers \u2014 the Sudanese Armed Forces controlled by the country\u2019s top commander and de facto ruler, Gen. Abdel Fattah Burhan, and the Rapid Support Forces (RSF) militia, led by his former deputy, Gen. Mohammed Hamdan Dagalo.",
      "Once allies, both men were part of the military establishment that seized power following the collapse of the Western-backed government of Prime Minister Abdalla Hamdok in 2021. But although they agreed to rule together, their alliance spectacularly broke down over how to manage the transition to a civilian government. With neither willing to cede power, war broke out in April 2023.",
      "Because of intense fighting and an ongoing RSF siege in the surrounding area, U.N. agencies have been unable to get substantial amounts of food relief to the Zamzam camp and a famine was declared in the camps in August, according to an analysis by the Integrated Food Security Phase Classification (IPC), an international system that sets a scale used by the United Nations and governments.\u00a0So people are now facing the choice between staying in the camp to die from hunger, or risk their lives by moving through Darfur areas besieged by the RSF, Suliman said.",
      "Famine has since spread to four other areas of Sudan, according to the IPC, and is expected to deepen and spread in coming months due to the war and impeded access to humanitarian assistance.",
      "In Sudan\u2019s capital, Khartoum, intense block-by-block fighting has made aid delivery almost impossible.\u00a0The World Food Program said it was only able to deliver its first shipment in December, 20 months after the conflict erupted, and even then, it said it had to rely on the ERRs for distribution.",
      "Across Khartoum, the ERRs were operating 742 kitchens and serving around 816,000 people before Trump's executive order, but now 80% of those kitchens have closed, according to Hajooj Kuka, an external communications officer for the Emergency Response Rooms.",
      "In a country riven by ethnic and political divisions, the ERRs have espoused neutrality and solidarity, allowing them to operate in areas controlled by SAF as well as the RSF, leveraging local know-how to navigate hostile terrain.",
      "The kitchens are organized locally and entirely volunteer-led, Kuka said, adding the whole ERR system was run by housewives, doctors, engineers, electricians \u2014 \u201cjust everybody.\u201d",
      "\u201cThis minute, I\u2019m trying to save the lives of the people in the district and the volunteers,\u201d he said in an interview Friday. \u201cI\u2019m just, like, going crazy trying to get any money.\u201d",
      "Without immediate funding, famine could take hold in the city, he added.",
      "Because USAID was often distributing money through other nongovernmental organizations working in Sudan, Kuka said the ERR organizers weren\u2019t always aware of how crucial USAID was to their funding, until the money was taken away.",
      "On Friday, Kuka said he found out that a $50,000 grant he expected from the Baltimore-based Catholic Relief Services (CRS) had been suddenly canceled because of the U.S. freeze.",
      "The humanitarian agency told NBC News they could not comment on the grant cancellation.",
      "CRS, which has about 5,000 employees, told staffers last week to expect layoffs because of the administration\u2019s cuts to their foreign aid grants, according to Reuters. The organization has a $1.5 billion budget, about half of it funded by USAID.",
      "Across Sudan, the cost of operating the kitchens was around $20 million a year, the ERR communications officer said. But the localized ad-hoc nature of the work is also what made them so vulnerable to U.S. funding cuts, Kuka added.",
      "While U.N. agencies may have several months of supplies in the pipeline, the ERRs often relied on purchasing goods directly from local markets. So when the cash flow was cut off, the kitchens could no longer buy and cook food.Andrea Tracy, a former USAID official and country representative in Sudan, said the exemption issued by Rubio was \u201cvery complicated, nobody really knows how it works.\u201d",
      "Tracy, who is currently vice president of Proximity 2 Humanity, a nonprofit working to shore up funding for Sudan\u2019s ERRs, added that some agencies might be big enough to continue operations, relying on a future reimbursement if an exemption is granted, but a lot of smaller organizations can\u2019t do that.",
      "On Friday, a federal judge paused an order putting USAID staff on administrative leave, but Tracy said it is still not clear to what capacity the agency will be able to operate.",
      "\u201cIn theory they have a week where they\u2019re able to work again \u2014access to emails, etc. \u2014 but what they could do before this was heavily curtailed, so unclear as to how much they can do, like make payments.\u201d",
      "Kuka said he is also appealing to any other institutional donors to fill in the funding gaps, using what little they have left to support emergency assistance programs.",
      "\u201cAfter a month, it will be completely done,\u201d he said."

    "title": "New Zealand's 'Everyone Must Go' tourism campaign mocked by locals heading for the exit",
    "published": "Mon, 17 Feb 2025 12:45:10 GMT",
    "summary": "A New Zealand tourism campaign called \u201cEveryone Must Go\u201d is drawing derision at a time when New Zealanders themselves are leaving the country in droves.",
    "story": [
      "A New Zealand government tourism campaign titled \u201cEveryone Must Go\u201d is drawing derision and mockery from residents who have criticized it as tone deaf, especially at a time when New Zealanders themselves are leaving the country in droves.",
      "In an announcement Sunday, officials said they were spending 500,000 New Zealand dollars ($287,000) on the campaign, which is aimed at visitors from neighboring Australia, New Zealand\u2019s biggest tourism market.",
      "Like many countries, New Zealand has struggled to restore its tourism industry since the Covid-19 pandemic, and the number of visitors from Australia is still at 88% of 2019 levels.",
      "\u201cWhat this Tourism New Zealand campaign says to our Aussie mates is that we\u2019re open for business, there are some great deals on, and we\u2019d love to see you soon,\u201d Tourism Minister Louise Upston said in a news release.",
      "Critics disagreed, saying the slogan sounded like New Zealand was advertising a clearance sale. Others said it invited bathroom jokes.",
      "\u201cI think \u2018Everyone Must Go\u2019 might refer to the need for toilets in some of our high-tourist spots. I mean, the queues are ridiculous,\u201d Cushla Tangaere-Manuel, tourism spokesperson for the opposition Labour Party, told New Zealand news outlet RNZ.",
      "Upston did not respond to an emailed request for comment.",
      "The campaign comes as record numbers of New Zealanders are leaving the country of 5 million, driven in part by concerns about high living costs and lack of job opportunities. Last year, the country had a net migration loss of 47,100 New Zealand citizens, Stats NZ said Monday.",
      "More than half of those migrants went to Australia, where they can live and work visa-free under a reciprocal arrangement.",
      "There were 3.3 million visitor arrivals in New Zealand last year, Stats NZ said separately Monday, up 12% from 2023. Australia, the United States and China were the biggest sources of visitors, with the 370,000 U.S. arrivals representing a record for a calendar year.",
      "Tourism was New Zealand\u2019s biggest export earner before the pandemic, and the conservative government has looked to it as one way to boost the economy. Last month, officials said they were easing visa rules to allow digital nomads to work in New Zealand while visiting on holiday, in the hope that they would spend more time there.",
      "Opposition lawmakers say that while they would welcome more tourists, they worry about the impact on the environment and whether the country\u2019s tourism infrastructure can support them.",
      "\u201cWe\u2019ve had the digital nomad announcement, now we\u2019ve got this \u2014 and the attitude of anyone, anytime, anywhere, is concerning,\u201d Tangaere-Manuel said.",
      "In an effort to address those concerns, last year the New Zealand government nearly tripled the entry fee for international tourists to 100 New Zealand dollars ($62.20) from 35 dollars. Australians are exempted from paying the levy, the proceeds from which are funding the same campaign for their tourist dollars that has sparked the controversy.",
      "Social media users skeptical of the \u201cEveryone Must Go\u201d slogan pointed out another possible use for it.",
      "\u201cWorth us tucking away to use at the next election,\u201d read one comment on the social media platform X."

    "published": "Mon, 17 Feb 2025 11:09:50 GMT",
    "summary": "China accused the United States of a \u201cserious regression\u201d in its position on Taiwan, after the State Department updated the Taiwan section of its website.",
    "story": [
      "HONG KONG \u2014 China accused the United States on Monday of a \u201cserious regression\u201d in its position on Taiwan, after the State Department updated the Taiwan section of its website to remove a reference to the independence of the Beijing-claimed island.",
      "The State Department fact sheet on U.S.-Taiwan relations continues to state Washington\u2019s opposition to any unilateral changes to the status quo from either China or Taiwan, a self-ruling democracy that rejects Beijing\u2019s sovereignty claims. But the phrase \u201cwe do not support Taiwan independence\u201d appears to have been removed Thursday in what the State Department says was a routine update.",
      "The change was cheered by Taiwan, while China said it \u201csends a wrong signal to the Taiwan independence forces\u201d and urged the U.S. to \u201cimmediately correct this mistake.\u201d",
      "The U.S. should \u201cstop using Taiwan to control China\u201d and \u201cstop condoning and supporting Taiwan independence,\u201d Chinese Foreign Ministry spokesperson Guo Jiakun said at a regular briefing in Beijing on Monday. \u201cThis will help avoid further serious damage to China-U.S. relations and peace and stability in the Taiwan Strait.\u201d",
      "The same phrase about not supporting Taiwan independence was removed from the State Department fact sheet in 2022 during the Biden administration before being restored a few weeks later.",
      "The United States, like most countries, does not have official relations with Taiwan but is its most important international backer, and is required by law to provide the island of 23 million people with defensive weapons.",
      "Beijing, which has not ruled out the use of force to assert its sovereignty claims, is extremely sensitive to any sign of international recognition of Taiwan, which it describes as its \u201ccore of core interests.\u201d",
      "Taiwan, formally known as the Republic of China, says it is already an independent country. Its government fled to Taiwan in 1949 after losing a civil war with the communist forces of Mao Zedong, founder of the People\u2019s Republic of China.",
      "The U.S. has recognized the PRC as the sole legal government of China since establishing diplomatic relations with Beijing in 1979, acknowledging Beijing\u2019s assertion that Taiwan is part of China but taking no official stance of its own on the sovereignty of Taiwan.",
      "The State Department said the U.S. position on Taiwan independence had not changed and that the U.S. remained committed to its \u201cOne China\u201d policy.",
      "\u201cThe United States is committed to preserving peace and stability in the Taiwan Strait,\u201d a State Department spokesperson said in an email Sunday.",
      "\u201cWe oppose any unilateral changes to the status quo from either side.\u00a0We support cross-Strait dialogue, and we expect cross-Strait differences to be resolved by peaceful means, free from coercion, in a manner acceptable to people on both sides of the Strait.\u201d",
      "The State Department website has also been changed to add a reference to Taiwan\u2019s cooperation with a Pentagon technology and semiconductor development project and to say the U.S. will continue to support Taiwan\u2019s participation in international organizations, \u201cincluding membership where applicable.\u201d",
      "China has consistently opposed Taiwan\u2019s membership in international bodies such as the World Health Organization.",
      "The website changes were praised by Taiwan, whose foreign minister, Lin Chia-lung, said in a statement Sunday that his ministry welcomed \u201cthe support and positive stance on U.S.-Taiwan relations\u201d that they demonstrated.",
      "Though President Donald Trump has unnerved Taiwan with recent comments demanding the island pay more for its defense and accusing it of stealing U.S. semiconductor business, his administration has also made strong statements of support for Taipei.",
      "Last week, two U.S. Navy ships sailed through the sensitive Taiwan Strait for the first time since Trump\u2019s inauguration last month. A Canadian warship also sailed through the strait on Sunday, drawing condemnation from Beijing.",
      "In recent years Taiwan has come under increasing military and other pressure from China, which sends warplanes and vessels toward the island almost daily.",
      "On Monday, the Taiwan Ministry of National Defense said it had detected 41 Chinese military aircraft, nine Chinese naval vessels and one \u201cofficial ship\u201d operating around Taiwan in the 24 hours to 6 a.m. local time (5 p.m. Sunday ET), with 28 of the planes crossing the median line that had previously served as an unofficial buffer in the Taiwan Strait."

      "Photos and a video released by KCNA showed Kim at a ceremony receiving thunderous applause from thousands of people, many of them wearing protective helmets, against a backdrop showing images of modern apartments and high-rises.",
      "Koo Byoung-sam, a spokesperson for South\u00a0Korea\u2019s unification ministry handling inter-Korean affairs, said\u00a0North\u00a0Korea\u00a0appears to be focusing on producing tangible outcomes by mobilizing manpower and material where they can relatively easily make progress, such as housing construction.",
      "During the ceremony, Kim lauded construction workers and officials for achieving nearly 400% progress last year compared with 2020, and pledged another plan to continue expanding the city.",
      "The project would \u201cusher in a new era of prosperity of Pyongyang in which the ideal streets of the people to be proud of in the world are built every year,\u201d KCNA said."

      "VIENNA \u2014 Austrian authorities said the stabbing of six people that left a 14-year-old boy dead was carried out by a man with possible connections to the Islamic State group who appeared to have acted alone.",
      "The suspect, a 23-year-old Syrian, was arrested after the attack, which took place on Saturday afternoon in the center of the southern city of Villach, close to the main square. Police said he used a folding knife. Those wounded were two 15-year-old boys and men aged 28, 32 and 36. Two were seriously wounded and two others are also still receiving hospital treatment, while one was treated for minor injuries.",
      "\u201cThis is an Islamist attack with an IS connection by an attacker who radicalized himself within a very short time via the internet,\u201d Interior Minister Gerhard Karner told reporters in Villach Sunday.",
      "State Gov. Peter Kaiser thanked a 42-year-old man, also a Syrian, working for a food delivery company who drove toward the suspect and helped prevent the situation from getting worse. \u201cThis shows how closely terrorist evil but also human good can be united in one and the same nationality,\u201d he said.",
      "As the focus shifted to migration and asylum-seekers, Karner said that it will ultimately be necessary to \u201ccarry out a mass screening without cause, because this assassin was not conspicuous.\u201d",
      "He did not elaborate on his plans. It was unclear how long the suspect had been in Austria, although authorities said he had a residence permit.

In November 2020, a man who had previously attempted to join the Islamic State group carried out a rampage in Vienna, armed with an automatic rifle and a fake explosive vest, killing four people before being fatally shot by police.",

We are grateful to have found asylum and protection in Austria,\u201d the association said.",

      "\u201cAt the same time, I am angry \u2014 angry at those politicians who have allowed stabbings, rapes, gang wars and other capital crimes to become the order of the day in Austria. This is a first-class failure of the system, for which a young man in Villach has now had to pay with his life,\u201d Kickl said.",

    "story": [
      "U.S. Secretary of State Marco Rubio said Sunday that Iran remains the \u201csingle greatest source of instability\u201d in the Middle East and threw his full support behind Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu.",
      "A meeting between the two in Jerusalem came as a fragile ceasefire between Israel and Hamas \u2014 a militant group backed by Iran \u2014 lasted into a second month despite being tested to its limit this week.",
      "Despite the fragile truce, Rubio said Hamas must be \u201ceradicated\u201d and praised President Donald Trump\u2019s \u201cbold\u201d plans to take control of Gaza and displace Palestinians to other countries.",
      "While hostage and prisoner exchanges, the future of the ceasefire, and the possibility of lasting peace have dominated recent discussions between the nations, Netanyahu told members of the press after the meeting that no issue was \u201cmore important than Iran.\u201d",
      "Rubio said in Jerusalem that Iran was \u201cbehind every terrorist group, behind every act of violence\u201d and \u201cbehind everything that threatens peace and stability.\u201d",
      "Iran has long funded militant groups such as Hamas, Hezbollah in Lebanon, and Yemeni-based Houthi militants, though it is not behind other groups in the region such as Islamic State.",
      "Its proxies have fueled conflicts across the region, while the nation is simultaneously advancing its missile program. Its leadership opposes Israel and the U.S.",
      "While\u00a0Iran has not yet pursued\u00a0building a nuclear bomb, a 2023 report\u00a0released by\u00a0watchdog\u00a0International Atomic Energy Agency also found the country had begun enriching uranium close to weapons-grade levels.",
      "\u201cWe agreed that the ayatollahs must not have nuclear weapons, and we also agreed that Iran\u2019s aggression in the region has to be rolled back,\u201d said Netanyahu, adding that Israel had \u201cdealt a mighty blow\u201d to Iran in the past year and a half.",
      "In a string of setbacks for the country, Iran\u2019s proxy forces in Lebanon and Gaza have been weakened by fighting Israel, while the swift collapse of Bashar al-Assad\u2019s Syrian regime\u00a0\u2014 which Tehran also supported \u2014 also represented a devastating defeat.",
      "Netanyahu said that with U.S. support, \u201cwe can and will finish the job,\u201d without elaborating on what that would mean in practice.",
      "The pair also released a joint statement after the meeting insisting that Israel and the United States had a \u201cshared strategy\u201d regarding the future of Gaza, \u201cincluding when the gates of hell will open.\u201d",
      "Hamas and the Iranian government did not immediately respond to NBC News\u2019 request for comment, although Hamas spokesman Hazem Qassem told NBC News in an interview Tuesday that the militant group was committed to the ceasefire deal, to which \u201cit adheres fully and not selectively as the Israeli side does.\u201d",
      "Responding to Trump\u2019s earlier threat, Qassem added that Gaza was already \u201cliving in a state of hell.\u201d",
      "The comments appeared to reference Trump\u2019s warning last week that\u00a0\u201call hell is going to break out\u201d if Hamas did not release \u201call\u201d the remaining hostages on Saturday.",
      "As Hamas released three hostages on Saturday, he wrote on Truth Social that \u201cIsrael will now have to decide what they will do about the 12:00 O\u2019CLOCK, TODAY, DEADLINE imposed on the release of ALL HOSTAGES,\u201d adding that \u201cthe United States will back the decision they make!\u201d",
      "While Israel has maintained the ceasefire despite Trump\u2019s deadline, the meeting in Jerusalem offered no clear messaging around the future of the deal or further conflict in Gaza.",
      "Rubio said that Hamas \u201ccannot continue as a military or government force,\u201d adding that the hostages \u201cneed to come home\u201d without mentioning the second phase of the ongoing ceasefire, negotiations for which were meant to begin earlier this month."

    "published": "Sun, 16 Feb 2025 13:51:44 GMT",
    "summary": "The Trump administration may have given America's European allies mixed messages, but Vance\u2019s speech gave them clarity as tensions between burst into the open.",
    "story": [
      "The past week has left America\u2019s European allies reeling and searching for alternatives after the Trump administration seemingly set itself in opposition to a rules-based system that the U.S. and its trans-Atlantic friends have spent decades building together.",
      "Not only did Vice President JD Vance wade into European politics, lambasting its leadership and interfering in Germany\u2019s upcoming election on behalf of its far right, but Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth all but nullified American military support for Ukraine, and President Donald Trump flirted with unilateral peace talks with his Russian counterpart, Vladimir Putin.",
      "While the U.S., as the West\u2019s superpower, and most of Europe \u2014 the European Union is an economic market of 500 million people \u2014 have spent the period since the end of World War II in political, military and commercial sync, the continent stands at the precipice of a generational change.",
      "Europe\u2019s leaders \u201ccannot accept the fact that what was the U.S.\u00a0is not the U.S. anymore,\u201d and that the continent could no longer call it an ally, former French Prime Minister Dominique de Villepin said in a briefing with reporters.",
      "\u201cIn the weeks and months, you will see the people of Europe waving their hand and asking from their government a very strong government,\u201d said de Villepin, who served under French President Jacques Chirac in the 2000s.",
      "With a blistering attack on Europe\u2019s culture, commitment to democracy, migration policies and the \u201cdanger from within,\u201d Vance\u2019s speech at the Munich Security Conference \u2014 which was supposed to focus on the war in Ukraine \u2014 tore up Washington\u2019s decadeslong alliances.",
      "Vance\u2019s silence on the almost three-year war also sent a clear message to Kyiv, according to Ukraine\u2019s President Volodymyr Zelenskyy. \u201cDecades of the old relationship between Europe and America are ending,\u201d he told the conference in Munich. \u201cFrom now on, things will be different, and Europe needs to adjust to that.\u201d",
      "Vance\u2019s dismissal of Ukraine spoke to the broader view that the U.S. no longer considers European involvement in negotiations with Russia as vital to peace talks.",
      "The Kremlin framed a recent phone call between Putin and Trump as a shift toward peace talks between Russia and the United States. Meanwhile, Secretary of State Marco Rubio is set to travel to Saudi Arabia to initiate peace negotiations, two sources familiar with the matter told NBC News.",
      "Zelenskyy, still excluded from discussions in Saudi Arabia as of late Saturday, has been left sidelined, and European leaders shared the Ukrainian president\u2019s unease.",
      "After years of disunity and dithering, the leaders of the E.U. and the U.K. are worried they no longer have a seat at the table in negotiations that may reshape their ally\u2019s borders, and are set to gather in Paris this week for a summit on the war, in response to concerns the U.S. is moving ahead without them.",
      "\u201cEurope urgently needs its own plan of action concerning Ukraine, Polish Prime Minister Donald Tusk said Saturday. \u201cOr else other global players will decide about our future. Not necessarily in line with our own interests.\u201d",
      "Still, Ukraine is the tip of the iceberg when it comes to the faltering rapport between Europe and the U.S. over policy and ideology. At the heart of Vance\u2019s speech was a direct attack on European democracy and culture.",
      "The vice president told the conference that he was worried less about the threats of Russia or China and more about \u201cthe retreat of Europe from some of its most fundamental values, values shared with the United States of America.\u201d",
      "Director of National Intelligence\u00a0Tulsi Gabbard took a different approach, somewhat muddying the waters in Munich by saying challenges from \u201cRussia, China, Iran and North Korea demand a united front.\u201d",
      "But analysts say Trumpist foreign policy \u2014 involving stopping almost all funding for the U.S. Agency for International Development and seeking to shake off Kyiv \u2014 may create an opportunity for America\u2019s rivals.",
      "China\u2019s foreign ministry responded on Saturday to events in Munich, saying it wants to \u201cstrengthen solidarity\u201d and \u201cpractice multilateralism\u201d with Germany and the European Union in what can only be read as thinly veiled comment on the Trump administration\u2019s capriciousness.",
      "Europe\u2019s leaders can expect more of the same, said Keir Giles, a senior fellow at the London-based Chatham House think tank.",
      "\u201cIt would be astonishing if not just China, but other adversaries of Europe were not to take advantage of the split and the gaps this presents,\u201d Giles told NBC News.",
      "Meanwhile, Vance\u2019s criticism of European leaders for shunning far-right parties was taken as an endorsement of those parties, which are on the rise in Europe, especially in the context of his later meeting with Alice Weidel, co-leader of Germany\u2019s far-right Alternative for Germany (AfD) party.",
      "The AfD is poised to play kingmaker in any coalition emerging from elections in Germany next week. There has long been a taboo against allying with the party, which has won the support of key Trump adviser Elon Musk.",
      "The normally mild-mannered German Chancellor Olaf Scholz accused Vance of interfering in Germany\u2019s elections. \u201cThat is not appropriate, especially not among friends and allies. We firmly reject that,\u201d he told the conference.",
      "Perhaps even more striking, Germany\u2019s conservative opposition leader Friedrich Merz felt the need to publicly state that he expected the U.S. to respect the results of the upcoming elections.",
      "Even so, Europe\u2019s leaders had few reasons to be surprised despite Vance\u2019s ferocious attack, according to Chatham House\u2019s Giles.",
      "Giles told NBC News that Europe has ignored decades of signals that U.S. patience has been \u201cwearing thin\u201d with Europe\u2019s reliance on American defense and that Vance\u2019s rhetoric on immigration and his outreach to the far right would resonate with European voters.",
      "Both Vance and Hegseth this week echoed Trump\u2019s long-standing view that Europe should contribute more toward its own defense.",
      "In the latest consequence of that policy, U.K. Prime Minister Keir Starmer was preparing to raise his country\u2019s defense spending ahead of a visit to meet Trump, Britain\u2019s Sunday Times\u00a0newspaper reported.",
      "Starmer will hope to win favor in Washington with the funding boost when he visits at a crucial time for both the Ukraine talks and the political balance of its E.U. neighbors.",
      "Next week, Germany goes to the polls in an election in which the AfD is expected to perform well. It may be the first test for the shifts that Vance described in Munich.",
      "The schism \u201cis not invented out of thin air,\u201d Giles said. \u201cThere\u2019s a reason populist parties across the continent tap into a deep vein of frustration with Europe\u2019s elites.\u201d"

    "summary": "Rwanda-backed rebels reached the center of east Congo\u2019s second largest city, Bukavu, Sunday after little resistance from government forces, many of whom fled.",
    "story": [
      "Rwanda-backed rebels reached the center of east Congo\u2019s second largest city, Bukavu, on Sunday morning and took control of the South Kivu province administrative office after\u00a0little resistance from government forces, many of whom fled the rebels\u2019 advance.",
      "Associated Press journalists witnessed scores of residents cheering on the M23 rebels in central Bukavu on Sunday morning as they walked and drove around the city center after a dayslong march from the region\u2019s major city of Goma 63 miles away, which they captured late last month. Several parts of the city, however, remained deserted with residents indoors.",
      "The M23 rebels are the most prominent of more than 100 armed groups vying for control of Congo\u2019s mineral-rich east, and are supported by some 4,000 troops from neighboring Rwanda, according to the U.N.",
      "It was not clear if the rebels had taken decisive control of the city of about 1.3 million people. Their presence in central Bukavu is an unprecedented expansion of the rebels\u2019 reach in\u00a0their yearslong fighting with Congolese forces. Unlike in 2012 when they only seized Goma in the fighting connected to ethnic tension, analysts have said the rebels this time are eyeing political power.",
      "Many Congolese soldiers were seen on Saturday fleeing the rebels\u2019 advance into Bukavu alongside thousands of civilians amid widespread looting and panic.",
      "Congo\u2019s President Felix Tshisekedi held a security meeting in the faraway capital of Kinshasa, where officials noted that Bukavu was \u201cbriefly\u201d invaded by M23 but remains under the control of the Congolese army and allies from local militia, the presidency said on X. There were no signs of fighting or of Congolese forces in most parts of Bukavu on Sunday.",
      "Tshisekedi has warned of the risk of a regional expansion of the conflict. Congo\u2019s forces are being supported in Bukavu by troops from Burundi and in Goma by troops from South Africa.",
      "Burundi\u2019s president, Evariste Ndayishimiye, appeared to suggest his country will not retaliate in the fighting. In a post on X he said that \u201cthose people who were ready to get profit of the armed attack of Rwanda to Burundi will not see this.\u201d",
      "The Congo River Alliance, a coalition of rebel groups that includes M23, said it was committed to \u201cdefending the people of Bukavu\u201d in a Saturday statement that did not acknowledge their presence in the city. \u201cWe call on the population to remain in control of their city and not give in to panic,\u201d Lawrence Kanyuka, the alliance\u2019s spokesperson, said in a statement.",
      "The fighting in Congo\u00a0has connections with a decadeslong ethnic conflict. M23 says it is defending ethnic Tutsis in Congo. Rwanda has claimed the Tutsis are being persecuted by Hutus and former militias responsible for the 1994 genocide of 800,000 Tutsis and others in Rwanda. Many Hutus fled to Congo after the genocide and founded the Democratic Forces for the Liberation of Rwanda militia group. Rwanda says the group is \u201cfully integrated\u201d into the Congolese military, which denies the charges."
