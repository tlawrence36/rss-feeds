      "Hip-hop star Megan Thee Stallion has asked a court to issue a restraining order against rapper Tory Lanez",
      "LOS ANGELES -- LOS ANGELES (AP) \u2014 Megan Thee Stallion asked a court on Tuesday to issue a restraining order against Tory Lanez, who she says is harassing her from prison through surrogates as he serves a 10-year sentence for shooting her in the feet.",
      "The petition filed by the hip-hop star in Los Angeles Superior Court asks the judge to prevent the Canadian rapper Lanez, whose legal name is Daystar Peterson, from using third parties to continue the same online harassment of Megan, whose legal name is Megan Pete, that he engaged in and encouraged before his imprisonment.",
      "\u201cEven now, while behind bars, Mr. Peterson shows no signs of stopping,\u201d the petition says. \"Despite being sentenced to 10 years in prison for shooting Ms. Pete, Mr. Peterson continues to to subject her to repeated trauma and revictimization.\"",
      "The petition says prison call logs from Lanez at the California Correctional Institution in Tehachapi show that he is coordinating attacks on Megan's credibility.",
      "An email seeking comment from Lanez's lawyers was not immediately returned. A court hearing on the order is scheduled for Jan. 9.",
      "The filing says bloggers acting on Lanez behalf continue to cast doubt on her allegations, making false claims including that the gun and bullet fragments in the case are missing.",
      "The petition says the protective order issued to prevent the previous harassment is no longer in effect, which it calls a loophole and flaw in the criminal justice system.",
      "In December 2022, Lanez was convicted of three felonies: assault with a semiautomatic firearm; having a loaded, unregistered firearm in a vehicle and discharging a firearm with gross negligence.",
      "A judge rejected a motion for a new trial from Lanez's lawyers, who are appealing his conviction.",
      "In August of last year, he received the 10-year sentence, bringing what seemed to be a conclusion to a three-year legal and cultural saga that saw two careers, and lives, thrown into turmoil.",
      "The petition says that one blogger in particular, Elizabeth Milagro Cooper, whom Megan is suing in a separate lawsuit, is acting as Lanez \u201cpuppet and mouthpiece.\u201d She alleges Cooper is spreading falsehoods on social media and YouTube, saying in one video posted to X, \u201cCan you even prove she was shot?\" and calling her a \u201cprofessional victim\u201d in another post.",
      "Cooper's attorney Michael Pancier declined comment on the California petition, and said in an email that their forthcoming response to the separate federal lawsuit against her will speak for itself.",
      "A previous motion to dismiss Megan's lawsuit said it makes \u201cdubious legal claims\u201d and \u201cirrelevant and impertinent allegations.\u201d",
      "Megan testified during the trial that in July 2020, after they left a party at Kylie Jenner's Hollywood Hills home, Lanez fired the gun at the back of her feet and shouted for her to dance as she walked away from an SUV in which they had been riding. She revealed who had fired the gun only months later.",
      "The case created a firestorm in the hip-hop community, churning up issues including the reluctance of Black victims to speak to police, gender politics in hip-hop, online toxicity, protecting Black women and the ramifications of misogynoir, a particular brand of misogyny Black women experience.",
      "Megan Thee Stallion, now 29, was already a major rising star at the time of the shooting, and her music\u2019s popularity has soared since. She won a Grammy for best new artist in 2021, and she had No. 1 singles with \u201cSavage,\u201d featuring Beyonc\u00e9, and as a guest on Cardi B\u2019s \u201cWAP.\u201d",
      "Lanez, 32, began releasing mixtapes in 2009 and saw a steady rise in popularity, moving on to major label albums. His last two reached the top 10 on Billboard\u2019s charts."

      "\u201cI am committed to making meaningful changes in my life,\u201d he said Tuesday via Instagram, in his first public statement since the arrest. \u201cI am taking time to focus on my sobriety, personal growth, and being present for my loved ones.

      "Late on the night of Dec. 10, officers in Burbank, near Los Angeles, were sent to a residence after a report of a man and woman arguing, according to police records. A woman told officers that her boyfriend lifted and threw her to the ground.",

The Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences unveiled shortlists in 10 categories Tuesday, including for documentary, international feature, best song and score.",
      "Two musicals, \u201cEmilia P\u00e9rez\u201d and \u201cWicked,\u201d were well represented in the categories. Netflix\u2019s audacious transgender drug-lord drama \u201cEmilia P\u00e9rez\u201d was most named, advancing in international feature, original score, two original songs including \u201cMi Camino\u201d and \u201cEl Mal\u201d (performed by Zoe Salda\u00f1a), sound and hair and makeup.",
      "\u201cWicked\u201d also moved forward in several categories, like hair and makeup, original score, sound and visual effects. The adaptation of the Broadway musical did not include original songs and therefore wasn\u2019t eligible in that category.",
      "The song semifinalists include several notable artists, like Pharrell Williams for \u201cPiece by Piece,\u201d Lainey Wilson for her \u201cTwisters\u201d song \u201cOut of Oklahoma,\u201d Elton John and Brandi Carlile for \u201cNever Too Late\u201d and Robbie Williams for \u201cForbidden Road\u201d from \u201cBetter Man.\u201d Diane Warren may also be heading for a 16th nomination for her song from \u201cThe Six Triple Eight.\u201d Nicholas Britell\u2019s \u201cWinter Coat,\u201d performed by Saoirse Ronan in \u201cBlitz,\u201d was also included, as was Lin-Manuel Miranda\u2019s \u201cTell Me It\u2019s You\u201d from \u201cMufasa: The Lion King,\u201d performed by Aaron Pierre and Tiffany Boone.",

      "As most of the shortlists are in below-the-line categories celebrating crafts, there are also films that aren\u2019t necessarily the most obvious of Oscar contenders. \u201cDeadpool & Wolverine\u201d was singled out for both sound and visual effects, as was \u201cAlien: Romulus\u201d which also got a nod for score.",
      "\u201cDune: Part Two,\u201d included in visual effects, sound and makeup and hair, was notably not among the 20 score finalists. Hans Zimmer\u2019s work was not eligible because it contained too much preexisting music from the first \u201cDune.\u201d He did make the cut for \u201cBlitz,\u201d however, as did Danny Elfman for \u201cBeetlejuice Beetlejuice,\u201d Kris Bowers for \u201cThe Wild Robot,\u201d Bryce Dessner for \u201cSing Sing\u201d and Daniel Blumberg for \u201cThe Brutalist.\u201d",
      "For the most part, shortlists are determined by members in their respective categories, though the specifics vary from branch to branch: Some have committees, some have minimum viewing requirements.",
      "These lists will narrow to five when final nominations are announced on Jan. 17. The 97th Oscars, hosted by Conan O\u2019Brien, will be held on Sunday, March 2, broadcasting on ABC and streaming live on Hulu."

      "Pop star and fashion designer Pharrell Williams has been named UNESCO\u2019s goodwill ambassador for artistic education and entrepreneurship on Tuesday in Paris",
      "PARIS -- Pop star and fashion designer Pharrell Williams was named UNESCO\u2019s goodwill ambassador for artistic education and entrepreneurship on Tuesday in Paris, continuing his cultural dominance of the French capital as Louis Vuitton menswear artistic director and performer at Notre Dame Cathedral\u2019s reopening earlier this month.",
      "Williams said he hoped to \u201cdeepen that sense of unity and togetherness\u201d in work that \u201cevens the odds for marginalized communities.\u201d",
      "He also spoke about his impoverished youth, adding: \u201cGrowing up in Virginia, never in my wildest dreams did I think I would be given an opportunity like this one.\"",
      "The role of goodwill ambassador for the Paris-based U.N. cultural agency involves promoting its initiatives that include protecting Indigenous cultures, advancing education and health care for women, raising awareness about genocide prevention and safeguarding cultural heritage.",
      "The U.N. agency said Williams will be \u201ca mentor and role model for young creators, particularly in Africa, where UNESCO supports the development of cultural industries.\u201d",
      "Williams joins a list of goodwill ambassadors that includes U.S. jazz musician Herbie Hancock, Brazilian artist Vik Muniz and Japanese filmmaker Naomi Kawase.",
      "Williams has been particularly visible in Paris this year. Shortly before the Paris Olympics, his role as Louis Vuitton menswear designer took center stage during a star-studded event at UNESCO\u2019s headquarters. The show, celebrating the beauty of human skin, featured models wearing garments in shades representing the diverse hues of humanity.",
      "UNESCO leaders hope that Williams' global influence and deep connections to fashion and music will draw fresh attention to the agency\u2019s work.",
      "Williams is American, and his selection as goodwill ambassador also may be highlighting the readmission of the United States to UNESCO last year.",
      "The U.S. exit under President Donald Trump cited alleged anti-Israel bias within the agency. The decision followed a 2011 decision by UNESCO to include Palestine as a member state, which led the U.S. and Israel to cease financing for the agency.",

      "\u201cMufasa: The Lion King,\u201d in theaters Thursday, takes audiences back to Mufasa's days as a cub and explains how he and Scar came to be brothers",
      "\u201cMufasa: The Lion King\u201d has one very important thing going for it: an original story.",
      "That may seem like faint praise or at least a very, very low bar in the grand scheme of things. But in a landscape where Disney continues to remake its animated catalogue in slightly different, and usually less interesting, forms whether \u201clive action\u201d or \u201cphotorealistic\u201d that usually only serves to remind how good the 2D animation was, originality is not to be undervalued.",
      "And this story isn\u2019t simply checking off fan service boxes and overexplaining origins that never needed them: It\u2019s actually good. A prequel to \u201cThe Lion King,\u201d opening in theaters Thursday, it\u2019s a tale of found family, betrayal and destiny, one that begins to explain the estrangement between brothers Scar and Mufasa that we all know will end in murder, how Mufasa ( Aaron Pierre ) ends up as king of the pride lands and, perhaps most importantly, why only one has an English accent.",
      "In this telling, Scar was once Taka (Kelvin Harrison Jr.), destined to be king of his pride, and Mufasa was a lost cub, separated from his parents in a dramatic flood. Taka saves Mufasa and brings him into his family. His mother (Thandiwe Newton) embraces the newcomer; his father (Lennie James) rejects him as nothing but a stray. Not that it matters much to the cubs; both are thrilled to have a brother. They play and protect one another and grow up together. But fissures start to appear in this foundation as Mufasa emerges as the exceptional one and Taka as the coward. And then a lioness enters the picture in Sarabi (Tiffany Boone). We\u2019ve all seen enough movies to know what happens with that.",
      "The screenplay comes from veteran screenwriter Jeff Nathanson, whose credits include the 2019 \u201cLion King,\u201d this year\u2019s lovely \u201cYoung Woman and the Sea\u201d and \u201cCatch Me If You Can.\u201d He clearly took a corporate mandate (give us more \u201cLion King\u201d) and made the absolute least cynical version of that. There are still questionable corporate-feeling choices, like straining to tie it to a current and future \u201cLion King\u201d by having Rafiki (John Kani) tell the story to Simba (Donald Glover) and Nala\u2019s ( Beyonc\u00e9 ) daughter Kiara ( Blue Ivy Carter ), Pumbaa (Seth Rogen) and Timon (Billy Eichner). These comedic breaks, and Lin-Manuel Miranda\u2019s songs peppered throughout, aren\u2019t additive. They really only serve to break up the momentum of the compelling main story.",
      "But the biggest issue remains the form itself. The photo-realistic computer-generated animals may have technically improved since the 2019 \u201cLion King,\u201d but they still aren\u2019t movie stars like their 2D animation counterparts. Impressive though it may be intellectually, the reality of watching these animals for two hours is a somewhat numbing and dull experience despite the best efforts of director Barry Jenkins. The Oscar-winning filmmaker of \u201cMoonlight\u201d did an admirable job adding visual interest and color into the landscapes, bringing it closer to the vibrancy of animation than ever before, and making it as cinematic as possible. The original story also helps here in that he was never going to have to recreate iconic sequences in a less stimulating form. There are just inherent limitations that filmmakers have not yet figured out, including how odd it looks for these animals\u2019 mouths to be moving and speaking English words. It\u2019s strangest when they\u2019re singing, mouths agape to hold the long notes in a way that no lion\u2019s mouth should ever appear.",
      "If this is one future for filmmaking there\u2019s still a lot of room for improvement and experimentation. That doesn\u2019t mean it shouldn\u2019t be embraced while the kinks are worked out. But it also doesn\u2019t mean the moviegoing public has to get excited about every rehash. \u201cMufasa: The Lion King\u201d is better than the ones that came before it, but that doesn\u2019t mean it\u2019s great.",
      "\u201cMufasa: The Lion King,\u201d a Walt Disney Studios release in theaters Thursday, is rated PG by the Motion Picture Association for \u201cperil, action/violence and some thematic elements.\u201d Running time: 118 minutes. Two and a half stars out of four."

      "\u201cPeople deserve to know up front what they\u2019re being asked to pay without worrying that they\u2019ll later be saddled with mysterious fees that they haven\u2019t budgeted for and can\u2019t avoid,\u201d FTC Chair Lina Khan said in a statement.",
      "The rule is scheduled to go into effect in 120 days.",
      "Ticketmaster said Tuesday it supports the new rule.",
      "\u201cTicketmaster has long advocated for all-in pricing as a nationwide industry standard, and we\u2019re pleased to see the FTC mandate the necessary changes to make ticket-buying more transparent for fans,\u201d the company said.",
      "The Associated Press left a message seeking comment Tuesday with the American Hotel and Lodging Association.",
      "Four of the FTC\u2019s five commissioners voted to approve the rule. Commissioner Andrew Ferguson, \u2013 who is President-elect Donald Trump\u2019s choice to replace Khan, was the one dissenting vote.",
      "The rule requires lodging and ticketing businesses to clearly and conspicuously disclose the true cost \u2013 including all mandatory fees \u2013 when they display any pricing. Businesses that exclude taxes or shipping fees from advertised prices must also disclose them before customers enter any payment information.",
      "The FTC estimates the rule will save U.S. consumers 53 million hours per year of time spent searching for the true price of lodging or events.",
      "The FTC launched the rule-making process in 2022, asking for public input on whether a fee-disclosure rule might help eliminate unfair and deceptive pricing. The agency said more than 12,000 people commented.",
      "Junk fees and deceptive pricing are also one of the reasons the Department of Justice sued Ticketmaster and its parent company, Live Nation Entertainment, earlier this year. The government asked a court to separate the companies, saying they have a monopoly on concert promotion and ticketing that drives up price for consumers.",
      "The Biden administration also has targeted the fee practices of U.S. airlines, banks and online payment platforms."

      "Panto is as much a part of Christmas in Britain as turkey, tinsel and mince pies",
      "LONDON -- Here\u2019s a recipe as essential to Christmas in Britain as turkey, tinsel and mince pies.",
      "Mix a fairy-tale plot with topical references, slapstick, song, dance and double entendres. Drench in sequins and spangles, mix vigorously, add some noisy audience participation, and you have a panto.",
      "Pantos \u2014 short for pantomimes \u2014 are stage musicals that play at theaters big and small across the U.K. each winter. Formulaic but anarchic, family friendly but a little risque, they are a holiday tradition that give many children their first exposure to live theater \u2014 and adults a chance to cut loose.",
      "Anyone who thinks Britons are buttoned up hasn't been to a panto. Audiences happily shed their inhibitions \u2013 cheering, singing, hissing the villain, shouting \u201cHe\u2019s behind you!\u201d to warn the hero.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s singing, dancing, laughing \u2014 taking the family out and being able to be out with their kids and letting the kids run riot,\u201d said Clive Rowe, who directed and stars in \u201cDick Whittington and his Cat\u201d at the Hackney Empire \u2014 his 17th annual panto for the storied east London theater.",
      "Pantomime has deep roots, stretching back to the stock characters and bawdy humor of the 16th-century Italian commedia dell\u2019arte and the French harlequinade, as well as the English music hall. By the late 19th century, the elements had gelled into a form still recognizable today.",
      "The plots are drawn from well-known fairy tales and children\u2019s stories such as \u201cAladdin,\u201d \u201cSnow White\u201d and \u201cCinderella.\u201d Characters include a plucky hero, or \u201cprincipal boy,\u201d often played by a woman, an outrageous villain, and a \u201cdame,\u201d a sharp-tongued matron who is always played by a man in fabulously flamboyant drag.",
      "\u201cThe pantomime dame is the beating heart of the show,\u201d said Simon Sladen, curator of theater and performance at London\u2019s Victoria and Albert Museum. \u201cShe is that engine that drives it. Firstly with pace and anarchy, but also a little bit of sauce on the side.\u201d",
      "An estimated 3 million people in Britain attend a pantomime each year, in venues ranging from small regional theaters to London West End playhouses. Many theaters rely on them for a big chunk of their annual income.",
      "When London\u2019s theaters were closed for months by pandemic lockdowns in 2020, panto dames led a protest march through the city to stress their importance to the creative economy.",
      "They provide seasonal work to faded pop stars, television entertainers, the occasional Hollywood celebrity \u2014 Pamela Anderson took Liverpool by storm when she starred in \u201cAladdin\u201d in 2010, singing \u201cSanta Baby\u201d while suspended on a swing above the stage, dressed in costumes by Vivienne Westwood.",
      "They are also vital experience for many young actors, including the A-listers of tomorrow.",
      "Jude Law told The Associated Press recently that he\u2019d played Humpty Dumpty, recalling his performance as \u201cloud and round.\u201d At 17, Michael Fassbender played one of Cinderella\u2019s Ugly Sisters, and a tree.",
      "\u201cWicked\u201d star Jonathan Bailey starred alongside a young Nicholas Hoult in a production of \u201cPeter Pan.\u201d Hoult also appeared in \u201cMother Goose\u201d as a child, and says he would happily do another, as they\u2019re \u201creally fun.\u201d",
      "Asked to sum up the art form, Bailey called it a \u201cquintessentially British bloody good time for all the family.\u201d",
      "Today\u2019s pantos often strive to reflect diversity, both onstage and in the audience. Rowe, whose Hackney Empire pantos draw many of their cast and crew from Britain\u2019s Black communities, said that at its core the genre is \u201cabout acceptance.\u201d",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s about understanding, it\u2019s about the idea that being different isn\u2019t necessarily a bad thing,\u201d he said. \u201cIt should be brought in and kind of celebrated and that no matter where you are in society, from the youngest to the oldest, we all have a place and we should embrace that.\u201d",
      "Drag performer Ginger Johnson, starring in an adult \u201call-drag panto\u201d version of \u201cPeter Pan\u201d at London\u2019s Phoenix Theatre, said that panto\u2019s ability to change is \u201cwhy it\u2019s managed to survive for so long as a cultural form.\u201d",
      "\u201cI think for a lot of kids, panto is the first time that they come in contact with drag as well,\u201d Johnson said.",
      "Stage historian Sladen said that some are leaning into the drag element of panto, with \u201ca bigger, wider explosion of roles than just the dame and the principal boy being cross-dressed.\u201d",
      "\u201cWe might see the fairy godmother played by a dame or played by a drag artist. We might see a wicked stepmother, also played by a very well-known drag performer. So (it\u2019s) constantly evolving, constantly changing with the times.\u201d",

She instead belongs to a revolving sisterhood of performers who, at a glance, have little in common \u2014 but all have donned a bowler hat and slinked across the stage.",
      "There are the musical theater professionals far from household names. Others, much like Roxie herself, have notoriety but little stage experience. Some are ingenues on the cusp of fame. Some are world-weary, looking to reclaim the spotlight.",
      "Since 1996, the list of Roxies has included Brooke Shields, Sandy Duncan, Marilu Henner, Christie Brinkley, Mel B, Gretchen Mol, Brandy, Robin Givens, Lisa Rinna, Ashlee Simpson, Jennifer Nettles, \u201cTrading Spaces\u201d host Paige Davis, \u201cPose\u201d star Angelica Ross and Ariana Madix of \u201cVanderpump Rules.\u201d",
      "\u201c\u2018Chicago\u2019 is different,\u201d says Barry Weissler, a lead producer with his wife, Fran. \u201cIt welcomes people constantly. There\u2019s never a locked door where we\u2019re concerned.\u201d",
      "Roxie isn't a cute role: She kills her lover and tries to get her dimwitted husband to take the blame. She grows insatiably hungry for fame behind bars and, after an acquittal, teams up with rival Velma to cash in with a revue. \u201cThe name on everybody\u2019s lips / Is gonna be Roxie,\u201d she purrs.",
      "The revival has lasted for decades, attributable in part to often casting celebrities to lead a show about the venality of celebrity.",
      "\u201cThe casting of this show falls in line with the show itself,\u201d says choreographer Greg Butler, who helps prepare actors in Los Angeles. \u201cWe talk about celebrity and how celebrity is glorified. And yet, in a way, we glorify it.\u201d",
      "Glorified though they may be, the stars still have to perform. So how does \u201cChicago\u201d turn a reality star into Roxie?",
      "Each Roxie needs to memorize their lines, sing and make it down a ladder in high heels. But there's elasticity built into the role.",
      "The secret about Roxie: She has two really big songs \u2014 \u201cFunny Honey\u201d and \u201cRoxie\u201d \u2014 but the role isn\u2019t as physically taxing as Velma's. And Roxie will always be taken care of.",
      "\u201cI always say when we bring these celebrities in, we must protect them so that everyone around them and every other part is a full-blooded Broadway pro,\u201d director Walter Bobbie reveals.",
      "In \u201cRoxie,\u201d the merry murderess is surrounded by smitten, superb male dancers.",
      "\u201cRoxie could simply stand there and have seven men adore her and the number is delivered,\u201d Bobbie says.",
      "Some Roxies need lots of work, including singing lessons. Some Roxies you leave alone. Take Pamela Anderson, who was a hit in 2022.",
      "\u201cLet her do whatever she wants,\u201d Weissler says. \u201cSo she can\u2019t do a somersault, she can\u2019t do a split. It\u2019s all right because she IS Roxie.\u201d",
      "The team tries to incorporate the star's signatures. Underneath Anderson's dress, for instance, the costume shop added fabric that looked like a bathing suit bottom, a nod to \u201cBaywatch.\u201d",
      "\u201cNo one in the show tries to imitate anybody else\u2019s performance. I always try to say, \u2018I don\u2019t want you to play Roxie. I want you to find the Roxie in yourself,\u2019\u201d Bobbie says.",
      "It all begins, though, with landing a willing celebrity.",
      "\u201cWhen I approach an agent for a star \u2014 no matter how big or small \u2014 I always say, \u2018Ask not what you can do for \u201cChicago\u201d but what \u201cChicago\u201d can do for you,\u2019\u201d says Duncan Stewart, who has landed castmembers for nearly two decades.",
      "Stewart, ARC vice president and casting director, emphasizes the part's glamour and razzle-dazzle in negotiations, as well as its relative ease. All you need is some training and the willingness to wear a black cocktail dress.",
      "\u201cYou don\u2019t have to dress up as a spoon or a fork. You don\u2019t have to dress up in green paint and sing through the stratosphere,\u201d he says. \u201cYou can rehearse for four weeks and you can do a quick six-week run. You can get your Broadway debut and legacy in under eight weeks.\u201d",
      "Sometimes a celebrity will mull a pitch for years. Sometimes they need just days.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s all about the timing. It\u2019s all about persistence and never accepting a no,\u201d Stewart says. (If a target Roxie ages out of the role, he says, the offer shifts to Matron \u201cMama\u201d Morton.)",
      "Celebrities sign up for different reasons: Broadway is on their bucket list. Their latest tour sold poorly. They were recently divorced. They're doing it for their kids.",
      "\u201cThey need some way of saying to the world, \u2018I\u2019m worthy. I can prove my mettle,\u2019\u201d says Stewart.",
      "Once or twice a year he goes to a newsstand and buys $400 worth of magazines \u2014 Ebony, People, Variety, you name it. He hands them to his staff, along with black pens.",
      "His instructions: \u201cThere are no bad ideas. Circle everybody from these magazines and just write in black pen, \u2018Roxie,\u2019 \u2018Velma,\u2019 \u2018Billy,\u2019 \u2018Amos,\u2019 \u2018Mama.\u2019\u201d",
      "The names go into a spreadsheet, which goes to the marketing team and producers, who score the names from one to five. One is terrible. Three, four and five prompt him to pursue interest and availability.",
      "Stewart then puts together a dossier with background details on the potential Roxie \u2014 perhaps she played saxophone in high school or sang with a band. He delivers the report and any YouTube footage to the Weisslers.",
      "With their green light, the offer goes out \u2014 contingent on a successful boot camp.",
      "Like the military, Roxie\u2019s boot camp is meant to build volunteers up \u2014 with a lot less screaming.",
      "\u201cWe try to meet them where they are,\u201d says Butler, an associate choreographer since 2005 who performed in the show for 14 years and was a dance captain.",
      "\u201cThey have something that you can\u2019t really teach them. They understand the idea of celebrity,\u201d he says. \u201cThey are pulling from life.\u201d",
      "Butler usually asks the Roxie-to-be to draw on what they know: red carpets, news conferences, getting their pictures taken by paparazzi. They go from there.",
      "\u201cUltimately, your feet are probably going to have to leave the ground and you\u2019re probably going to have to kick. So I\u2019m going to have to teach you how to punch your foot,\u201d he tells his starry students.",
      "He started one session with Rita Wilson by asking her if she had a favorite pose. \u201cAnd she was like, \u2018Oh my God! I have this pose,\u2019\u201d Butler says. \u201cWe used it and then she starts to build from that.\u201d",
      "The original \u201cChicago\u201d debuted on Broadway in 1975, directed by Bob Fosse. Butler credits Ann Reinking \u2014 the iconic Fosse collaborator who originated Roxie in the 1996 revival and created the choreography in Fosse's style \u2014 with cracking how to accommodate the skillset of each successive Roxie. Vocal coaches also help find the right keys and approach to each song.",
      "One of the harder things Roxie faces comes during the song \u201cHot Honey Rag.\u201d In a sequence nicknamed The Cakewalk, the actor must dance backward while executing a series of intricate hand movements. Trained dancers, like Reinking, rely on their strong cores. But Melanie Griffith, primarily a film actor, struggled with The Cakewalk. The two experimented with different ideas as Griffith prepared to become Roxie in 2003.",
      "\u201cShe just started doing a move and Annie saw her do this thing and she went, \u2018Oh my, God! OK. Do that again,\u2019\u201d he recalls.",
      "What Griffith had done was fan her hands over her head and make her hips and hands move at the same time.",
      "\u201cAnnie, said \u2018That\u2019s it. That\u2019s your move,\u2019\u201d he recounts. \u201cSo now there\u2019s a step in the show that we call The Melanie, just in case I have an actress where The Cakewalk does not look awesome on them.\u201d",
      "Some elements may be tweaked but make no mistake: It's hard work.",
      "\u201cThere\u2019s new parts of my body that are sore that I didn\u2019t know would actually get sore,\u201d says Alyssa Milano, one of the newest Roxies, in the middle of her boot camp. \u201cAnd I've been a dancer all my life.\u201d",
      "The Roxies who don't have extensive stage or dance backgrounds may feel vulnerable.",
      "\u201cI tell them that falls right in line with Roxie Hart,\u201d Butler says. \u201cI\u2019m like, \u2018Honey, you are halfway there.\u2019\u201d",
      "Melora Hardin was more than halfway there. \u201cThe Office\u201d star arrived not only able to sing, but also as a lifelong dancer, first in ballet and then in jazz.",
      "Hardin was taught a few numbers in a Valley studio before flying to New York to perform in front of Weissler and his team.",
      "She could tell they liked it.",
      "\u201cBarry walks me to the window and kind of puts his arm around my shoulder and asks, \u2018Where have you been? Why haven't I met you before?\u2019\u201d she remembers.",
      "She got the job on the spot.",
      "Fast-forward and Hardin in late 2008 made her Broadway debut, with her husband and two young daughters in the audience. When fans threw her roses, she'd try to toss them to her girls. She laughs that the crowd seemed more impressed by her somersault than nailing her Fosse steps.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s definitely something that I will hold as one of the most joyful times of my life,\u201d says Hardin. \u201cI couldn\u2019t have asked for a more wonderful experience.\u201d",
      "Roxie has been kicking for more than 11,000 performances on Broadway, despite recession, storms, a pandemic and an Oscar-winning adaptation. \u201cChicago\u201d is the second longest-running show in Broadway history, behind only the now-closed \u201cThe Phantom of the Opera.\u201d In all, the musical has been seen by more than 32 million people across 36 countries and more than 500 cities.",
      "\u201cThe show changes from actor to actor, from country to country, from city to city, from company to company,\u201d says Butler.",
      "But Butler has his favorites. He still gets excited whenever one of his Roxies slays: \u201cIt\u2019s like giving birth. I\u2019m just like, \u2018Oh, my God, my little baby\u2019s about to step up!\u2019\u201d",
      "Trends come and go, but \u201cChicago\u201d endures, fed by a plot replete with celebrity culture, greed and media manipulation. \u201cIt keeps becoming more relevant, not less. More,\u201d says Weissler.",
      "Bobbie bristles at critics who deride the revolving door as a gimmick: \u201cYou can call it stunt casting all you want. There\u2019s an authenticity to it.\u201d",
      "He argues that \u201cChicago\u201d will always be different than most other Broadway shows.",
      "\u201cThe guy doesn't get the girl. The girl gets the girl,\u201d he says with a laugh. \u201cThis is about a romance with show business.\u201d",

      "Crime writer John D",
      "NEW YORK -- Crime writer John D. MacDonald, a master of the genre, was so prolific that sometimes even he couldn't keep up with what he was doing.",
      "He might have dozens of stories in submission at once and would leave some unfinished or unpublished as he moved on to a new idea. One of the surviving manuscripts was recently discovered and appears this week in the literary quarterly The Strand Magazine, which has run rarities by Ernest Hemingway,Tennessee Williams and many others. \"The Accomplice\u201d is an early work from the author known for his Travis McGee series and for the novel \u201cThe Executioners,\u201d retitled \u201cCape Fear\u201d in two film adaptations.",
      "The newly seen story, a narrative of lust, betrayal and dangerous choices, was found in the archives at the University of Florida.",
      "\u201cRaw and gritty, the narrative embraces classic noir tropes, only to flip them in quintessential MacDonald style with an unexpected and thought-provoking finale,\u201d Strand managing editor Andrew F. Gulli writes in the current issue.",
      "\u201cThe Accomplice\u201d is set in a grocery store where a \u201cnearly\u201d 18-year clerk named Joey works alongside the middle-aged owner, John Mallon, and his younger wife, Belle, whom MacDonald introduces as tall and long-faced, very white and so thin and taut that \u201cher hips stuck out against the dresses she wore.\u201d Before long, she is paying close attention to Joey, who would prefer \u2014 at first \u2014 that she keep it all professional.",
      "\u201cIt scared him a little when he realized that when they were alone, in the store he\u2019d head for the space behind the meat counter or the entrance to the cellar where the stock was kept, knowing that she would find some excuse to go by him,\u201d MacDonald writes.",
      "\u201cAfter he realized that, he had a hard time getting to sleep at night and sometimes he would dream about her. In the dreams she was cold to touch, and like snakes. And then she would get mixed up in the dream with other girls.\u201d",
      "In a plot turn known to fans of \u201cDouble Indemnity\u201d and other noir favorites, Belle proposes that they kill her husband and use the insurance money to go into business together.",
      "\"She whispered, \u2018How are we going to do it, Joey?\u2019\u201d",
      "MacDonald was born in Sharon, Pennsylvania, in 1916, and later moved with his family to Utica, New York, where he was still living when he wrote \u201cThe Accomplice.\u201d He settled in Sarasota, Florida in the early 1950s and remained for decades before dying in Milwaukee, in 1986. His books have sold millions of copies and numerous authors, including Stephen King, have cited him as an influence. He is especially loved in Florida, and was honored in song by another famous state resident, Jimmy Buffett, who offered tribute in \u201cIncommunicado.\u201d",
      "According to MacDonald scholar Calvin Branche, the author likely wrote \u201cThe Accomplice\u201d in the late 1940s-early 1950s and set it aside amidst other projects. His wife, Dorothy, had gotten one of his stories published while he was serving overseas in World War II, and he was anxious to follow up, writing some 80 hours a week. MacDonald was still a few years away from his Travis McGee books, but Branche said that \u201cThe Accomplice\u201d did anticipate the moral struggles of McGee and other MacDonald protagonists.",
      "\u201c(Joey) stands up to her temptation despite having initially thought her plan and a future with her might be good,\u201d Branche says. \u201cThe reader is pleased with this conclusion, and it is the kind of insight characters find in many of the stories.\u201d"

      "Over the four years he\u2019s spent working on \u201cMufasa: The Lion King,\u201d Barry Jenkins estimates that he\u2019s been asked why he wanted to make it at least 400 times",
      "NEW YORK -- Over the four years he\u2019s spent working on \u201cMufasa: The Lion King,\u201d Barry Jenkins estimates that he\u2019s been asked why he wanted to make it at least 400 times.",
      "The question of why Jenkins, the filmmaker of \u201cMoonlight\u201d and \u201cIf Beale Street Could Talk\u201d and \u201cThe Underground Railroad,\u201d would want to jump into the big-budget, photorealistic animated Disney world of lions and tigers has bedeviled much of a film world that reveres him.",
      "Countless other directors had made leaps into CGI-heavy blockbuster-making before. But Jenkins\u2019 decision was uniquely analyzed \u2013 perhaps because there\u2019s no more heralded, or trusted, filmmaker today under the age of 50 than Jenkins.",
      "\u201cIt just thought it was something I could not deny,\u201d Jenkins says. \u201cI had to do it.\u201d",
      "\u201cMufasa,\u201d which opens in theaters Friday, brings together movie worlds that ordinarily stay very far apart. On the one hand, you have the Oscar-winning, 45-year-old director of some of the most luminous and lyrical films of the past decade. On the other, you have the intellectual property imperatives of today\u2019s Hollywood. What happens when they collide?",
      "The result in \u201cMufasa,\u201d about the lion cub's orphaned upbringing set both before and after the events of Jon Favreau's 2019 remake of \u201cThe Lion King,\u201d is an uncommonly textured and thoughtfully rendered spectacle that, Jenkins maintained in a recent interview, has more in common with \u201cMoonlight\u201d than you\u2019d think. Made with virtual filmmaking tools, \u201cMufasa\u201d essentially plopped one of the most groundbreaking filmmakers working today into an all-digital playground, with a budget more than a hundred times that of \u201cMoonlight.\u201d",
      "Often in \u201cMufasa,\u201d you can feel Jenkins\u2019 sensibility warming and enhancing what can, in other less sensitively commanded films, feel soulless. With songs by Lin-Manuel Miranda, \u201cMufasa\u201d works as a big-movie entertainment and, even more surprisingly, as a Barry Jenkins film.",
      "\u201cMy head was spinning when this started,\u201d Jenkins says. \u201cIt actually reminded me of when I first got into filmmaking. This felt oddly enough very similar to that first experience. You can sort of run away from that newness and be intimidated by it, or you can embrace it, learn the things you don\u2019t know and then start to bend it.\u201d",
      "It\u2019s also an experience that has quite evidently changed Jenkins, exponentially expanding his filmmaking tool kit while opening his eyes to new ways of making movies. \u201cIt was almost like learning a new language,\u201d Jenkins says of the process. These are edited excerpts from the conversation.",
      "Jenkins: At least 400 times. But it came down to the spirit and the warmth of Jeff Nathanson\u2019s script and also the spirit and the warmth I always found in the story. I came to \u201cThe Lion King\u201d by babysitting my nephews way, way back in the 1990s. My sister was a single mom and I\u2019d be at home watching with the kids. You\u2019d put on different VHSs and \u201cThe Lion King\u201d was always the one that stuck. I just thought: Wouldn\u2019t it be interesting to, coming out of something like \u201cThe Underground Railroad\u201d to step into this thing that\u2019s so full of light?",
      "JENKINS: Maybe warmer, lighter but still just as deep, just as spiritual. This idea of family legacy, of finding your place in the world, those are things that are very present in \u201cMoonlight\u201d and \u201cThe Underground Railroad.\u201d If I was telling you, \u201cI\u2019m going to make this film about this kid who has this almost biblical experience involving water and a parent figure that he then gets displaced from, and has to find his place in the world, I could be talking about \u201cMoonlight\u201d or I could be talking about \u201cMufasa.\u201d",
      "JENKINS: It wasn\u2019t about the notions of who people thought I was. But I was looking to expand just the kind of filmmaking I was doing at that point. This came right in the thick of pretty much a seven-year cycle, from beginning \u201cMoonlight\u201d to being in post on \u201cThe Underground Railroad,\u201d the way this movie is made, with this virtual production, it\u2019s just a very new way of making films. There\u2019s maybe been five or six movies made with this technology.",
      "JENKINS: I did. We evolved this process to the point where we could create so much of all the world and the movement in virtual space, and we could then take our virtual cameras into virtual production. We evolved the animation to the point where we could create the light, we could create the set, we could create the environment. (Cinematographer) James (Laxton) would be there and I would be there, and we\u2019re blasting the voices of the actors into the room and the animators are moving through and I\u2019m directing the blocking, and the camera is responding to the blocking in real time.",
      "JENKINS: Absolutely. Look, I\u2019m a filmmaker who was on set with \u201cMoonlight,\u201d I\u2019ve got 25 days and the sun is going down. Yeah, you\u2019re trying to find a place for the camera, you have ideas, but those ideas aren\u2019t practically achievable. In this sense, the camera could be anywhere. It could be everywhere. It\u2019s sort of the same questions but the possibility of answering is so immediate and direct.",
      "JENKINS: I want to unpack what you just said. We\u2019ve been talking, and I\u2019ve been talking about using these tools to create a very physical, in-person experience. I don\u2019t consider this a project that\u2019s all digital and all computer animated. If I made this movie again right now, it wouldn\u2019t take me four years. It\u2019d probably take me two and a quarter. If I was going to do another one of these films, I would have such a stronger foundation. It wouldn\u2019t feel like something that\u2019s alien or something that\u2019s other or that\u2019s all digital. It would just feel like filmmaking.",
      "JENKINS: One thousand percent. I love through this process I\u2019ve learned so many other ways of making a film that I just could not learn making something like \u201cThe Underground Railroad.\u201d What I love now is the overlap between the two of them. When I began this process, I talked to Matt Reeves because I had heard he had used some of these tools to pre-vis \u201cThe Batman.\u201d He said, \u201cDo you know that shot where the Penguin is in his car and Batman is walking upside down? I discovered that in the volume.\u201d I said, \u201cOf course you did.\u201d I was like, Oh my God, we could have pre-vised \u201cMoonlight\u201d with this technology.",
      "JENKINS: One thousand percent. The light can be anywhere in this film and the camera can be anywhere. That doesn\u2019t mean it should be everywhere. The next time I go out to make a film whether it\u2019s something like \u201cThe Underground Railroad\u201d or \u201cBeale Street,\u201d James and I are probably going to incorporate these tools as well. Because figuring out the light is half the battle, as they say in \u201cG.I. Joe.\u201d",
      "JENKINS: This is all new. It\u2019s all being developed right now. We went down to \u201cAvatar\u201d and spoke to the engineers there. They heard what we were trying to do and sent some people to embed with us and they helped us evolve our process, so we could have these animators with two legs move as if they have four legs. What I\u2019m saying is: This is the wild, wild West."

    "story": [
      "An attorney defending Jay-Z against a rape allegation says the unnamed accuser's account is \u201cprovably, demonstrably false.\u201d",
      "NEW YORK -- An attorney defending Jay-Z against the rape allegation brought against him last week by an unnamed woman outlined a range of evidence Monday that he said showed the accuser\u2019s account to be \u201cprovably, demonstrably false.\u201d",
      "The woman told NBC News last week that Jay-Z and Sean \u201cDiddy\u201d Combs sexually assaulted her in 2000, when she was 13, at an after-party for the MTV Music Awards. She has since acknowledged certain inconsistencies in her story.",
      "Speaking to reporters at Roc Nation\u2019s New York headquarters, Jay-Z\u2019s attorney, Alex Spiro, said the woman\u2019s claim relied on an \u201cimpossible timeline\u201d and a nonexistent location. While the lawsuit said the assault happened at a \u201clarge white residence with a U-shaped driveway,\u201d photos show both Jay-Z, whose legal name is Shawn Carter, and Combs at a nightclub following the award show.",
      "In the suit, the woman said she snuck out of a window of her home in Rochester and hitched a ride to the award ceremony from a friend, who has since died. She said she watched the event on a jumbotron outside, then befriended a limousine driver who drove her to the house party where she was assaulted by the two rap moguls.",
      "Following the alleged rape, she said she fled the house and called her father for a ride home from a nearby gas station.",
      "The allegation, Spiro said, \u201cdefies credibility.\u201d It would\u2019ve taken her five hours to drive from Rochester, the lawyer noted, meaning she would\u2019ve had to leave her home by 3 p.m. Permits and photographs show there was no jumbotron outside the VMAs in 2000, according to Spiro. The woman\u2019s father has said he does not recall driving from Rochester to pick her up in New York City.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s not just that this story is a lie and that it\u2019s not true, it\u2019s provably, demonstrably false,\u201d Spiro said. \"This never happened.\u201d",
      "The suit comes amid a wave of sexual assault lawsuits levied against Combs, who remains in custody in New York awaiting trial on federal sex trafficking charges. He has pleaded not guilty and faces trial in May.",
      "The lawsuits were filed on the eve of the expiration of the Adult Survivors Act, a New York law permitting victims of sexual abuse a one-year window to file civil action regardless of the statute of limitations.",
      "After initially suing Combs, the woman\u2019s complaint was amended to include a new allegation that Jay-Z also participated in the sexual assault as a third unnamed celebrity watched.",
      "The litigation was filed by Tony Buzbee, a personal injury attorney in Houston whose firm has set up a toll-free phone line for accusers. In October, Buzbee said he was representing some 120 people, men and women, with allegations of sexual misconduct against Combs.",
      "Last month, Jay-Z anonymously sued Buzbee, alleging the lawyer had attempted to blackmail him by making the rape allegation public if he did not agree to a legal settlement. Buzbee has said the letter was simply trying to set up a confidential mediation session.",
      "In a statement last week, Jay-Z said his \u201cheart and support goes out to true victims in the world.\u201d",
      "On Monday, Spiro accused Buzbee of \u201ctaking advantage\u201d of the woman, while \"destroying this opportunity and the voices of real victims.\u201d",
      "In an emailed statement Monday, Buzbee said the woman had been referred to him by another law firm and vetted by four attorneys from his firm.",
      "\u201cCourts exist to resolve factual disputes,\u201d Buzbee added. \u201cOur client remains adamant about her claim.\u201d"

      "Former talk show host Carlos Watson has been sentenced to nearly 10 years in prison in the federal financial conspiracy case surrounding his once-buzzy Ozy Media",
      "NEW YORK -- Former talk show host Carlos Watson was sentenced Monday to nearly 10 years in prison in a federal financial conspiracy case that cast his once-buzzy Ozy Media as an extreme of fake-it-'til-you-make-it startup culture.",
      "In one example, another Ozy executive impersonated a YouTube executive to hype Ozy to investment bankers \u2014 while Watson coached him, prosecutors said.",
      "Watson, 55, and the now-defunct company were found guilty last summer of charges including wire fraud conspiracy. He has denied the allegations and plans to appeal.",
      "\u201cI loved what we built with Ozy,\u201d he said in court Monday, initially addressing supporters in the audience before the judge suggested he turn around. Watson told the judge he was a target of \u201cselective prosecution\u201d as a Black entrepreneur in Silicon Valley, where African American executives have been disproportionately few, and he called the case \u201ca modern lynching.\u201d",
      "\u201cI made mistakes. I'm very, very sorry that people are hurt, myself included,\u201d he said, but \u201cI don't think it's fair.\u201d",
      "Watson, who faced a mandatory minimum sentence of two years in prison and potentially as much as 37 years, remains free for now on $3 million bond. He is to surrender to prison March 28. Any restitution will be determined after a hearing in February.",
      "U.S. District Judge Eric Komitee said Monday that the \u201cquantum of dishonesty in this case is exceptional.\u201d",
      "\u201cYour internal apparatus for separating truth from fiction became badly miscalibrated,\u201d he told Watson in sentencing him.",
      "Prosecutors accused the former cable news commentator and host of playing a leading role in a scheme to deceive Ozy investors and lenders by inflating revenue numbers, touting deals and offers that were nonexistent or not finalized, and flashing other false indications of Ozy's success.",
      "Watson even listened in and texted talking points while his co-founder posed as a YouTube executive to praise Ozy on a phone call with potential investors, prosecutors said.",
      "\u201cHis incessant and deliberate lies demonstrated not only a brazen disregard for the rule of law, but also a contempt for the values of honesty and fairness that should underlie American entrepreneurship,\u201d Brooklyn-based U.S. Attorney Breon Peace said in a statement Monday. His office prosecuted the case.",
      "During the trial, Watson's defense blamed any misrepresentations on others, particularly co-founder Samir Rao and former Ozy chief of staff Suzee Han. She and Rao pleaded guilty, are awaiting sentencing and testified against Watson.",
      "Watson portrayed himself Monday as a founder who put everything he had into his company, saying that he took an average salary of around $51,000 from Ozy in its final years, has triple-mortgaged his home and drives a 15-year-old car.",
      "After court, he questioned why Brooklyn-based federal prosecutors had gone after a California-based company and founder. Prosecutors declined to comment; the indictment alleged that scheming happened in the Brooklyn-based jurisdiction and elsewhere.",
      "\u201cI do think this is an attack on Black excellence,\u201d Watson said after noting that his sentence wasn't far from the 11-year term meted out to Elizabeth Holmes. She's the white former Silicon Valley CEO convicted of duping investors in the Theranos blood-testing device hoax; she has appealed.",
      "There's no parallel between unreliable blood test technology and Ozy's roster of real programs and events, Watson said.",
      "Ozy, founded in 2012, was styled as a hub of news and culture for millennials with a global outlook.",
      "Watson boasted an impressive resume: degrees from Harvard University and Stanford Law School, a stint on Wall Street, on-air gigs at CNN and MSNBC, and entrepreneurial chops. Ozy Media was his second startup, coming a decade after he sold a test-prep company that he had founded while in his 20s.",
      "Mountain View, California-based Ozy produced TV shows, newsletters, podcasts, and a music-and-ideas festival. Watson hosted several of the TV programs, including the Emmy-winning \u201cBlack Women OWN the Conversation,\u201d which appeared on the Oprah Winfrey Network.",
      "Ozy snagged big advertisers, clients and grants. But beneath the outward signs of success was an overextended company that struggled \u2014 and dissembled \u2014 to stay afloat after 2017, according to insiders' testimony.",
      "The company strained to make payroll, ran late on rent and took out pricey cash advances to pay bills, former finance vice president Janeen Poutre told jurors. Meanwhile, Ozy gave prospective investors much bigger revenue numbers than those it reported to accountants, according to testimony and documents.",
      "On the witness stand in July, Watson said the company's cash squeezes were just a startup norm and its investors knew they were getting unaudited numbers that could change.",
      "The only investor who spoke at the sentencing was Beverly Watson, who stands by her brother. She told the court Monday that her biggest loss was \u201cthis important platform that elevated people and ideas that weren't being heard before.\u201d",
      "Ozy disintegrated in 2021, after a New York Times column disclosed the phone-call impersonation gambit and raised questions about the true size of the startup's audience."

      "\u201dThe Rivals\u201d is Jane Pek\u2019s latest mystery novel featuring the online dating detective Claudia Lin",
      "Claudia Lin, an online dating detective in the age of AI, is hunting once again through a dark cybersphere of tech systems in \u201cThe Rivals,\u201d the second novel in a new mystery series by Jane Pek.",
      "Pek, who introduced Claudia in her 2022 debut book, \u201cThe Verifiers,\u201d has given the mystery genre fresh trappings \u2014 a vivid New York City landscape of chatbots and apps that can create chaos or sniff out fraud, and a delightfully plucky new sleuth, who is in her mid-20s, Asian American and gay.",
      "In \u201cThe Rivals,\u201d Claudia and Becks Rittel are the co-owners of the fact-checking firm Veracity. It\u2019s a tiny business \u2014 it only has one other employee, the unkempt gamer Squirrel \u2014 but helps clients of giant matchmaking platforms make sure the strangers they meet for dates are not unscrupulous liars or worse.",
      "\u201cThe Rivals\u201d opens with a couple of customers from online meet-up sites seeking different kinds of assistance. One wants Veracity to make sure his new lady friend, the charming Amalia Suarez, is all she claims to be; the other, Pradeep Mehta, anxiously asks for help taking down a false online gay-dating profile that could ruin his life.",
      "Claudia takes on both projects, despite Becks\u2019 protests and disparagement. A curt, tough-minded colleague in her mid-30s, Becks is nicknamed the \u201cBlonde Assassin.\u201d In short order, both cases present Claudia with false turns, odd developments and scary possibilities. These twists make \u201cThe Rivals\u201d a modern mystery unfolding amid synthetic culprits \u2014 cyberworld bots known as \u201csynths\u201d \u2014 that can wreck real lives.",
      "Pek adds a few vital human ingredients to the story\u2019s digital mix. One is Claudia\u2019s striving but dysfunctional family. Her siblings, Charles and Coraline, and their irritable mother are introduced in an early chapter as they gather in the West Village for a meal celebrating the Chinese New Year. Coraline\u2019s beau is there, too. Their father is out of the picture. A celebration the meal is not, but the Lin family fracas adds sparks to the narrative throughout.",
      "Pek also makes neighborhoods and go-to sites of Manhattan, Brooklyn and other city environs an integral and appealing part of the story. Claudia, for example, plays Ultimate frisbee in Prospect Park and takes the reader on her many rendezvous, from the touristy High Line to a bike path through Fort Washington Park.",
      "Claudia\u2019s sexuality is not a central tug-of-war plot issue. But it does give an edgy lift to the story line when Claudia, as the novel\u2019s narrator, notes the inner romantic tingles set off in her by others.",
      "Pek writes with wit and AI savvy. At times \u201cThe Rivals\u201d unfolds with so much tech-heavy dialogue that it can be hard to follow. But Claudia is a winning new entry in the field of modern serial detectives. \u201cThe Rivals\u201d hints that she has more work in store. With the freshness of Pek\u2019s staging of online love and death, a third entry in the series will be welcome.",

      "A couple has dropped a lawsuit that led the Alabama Supreme Court to rule earlier this year that frozen embryos are what it called \"extrauterine children.\"",
      "MONTGOMERY, Ala. -- A judge last week dismissed a wrongful death lawsuit that led the Alabama Supreme Court to rule that frozen embryos are \u201cextrauterine children,\u201d a decision that drew national attention and temporarily halted in vitro fertilization services in the state.",
      "A couple, who filed a wrongful death lawsuit over the accidental destruction of their last frozen embryo, asked to drop the suit. A judge granted the request and dismissed the case Friday, according to state court records. Two other couples had dropped similar lawsuits in August.",
      "The court order did not detail the reason for dropping the lawsuit or if a settlement had been reached. Trip Smalley, a lawyer representing the couple, did not immediately return an email and telephone message seeking comment.",
      "The three couples had their embryos destroyed in 2020 when a hospital patient wandered into the storage area. The patient opened the container, picked up embryos and dropped them to the floor.",
      "The Alabama Supreme Court in February ruled that the three couples could pursue wrongful death claims for the destruction of the embryos. Justices, citing anti-abortion language in the Alabama Constitution, ruled that an 1872 state law allowing parents to sue over the death of a minor child, \u201capplies to all unborn children, regardless of their location.\u201d",
      "The decision became a flashpoint in the national debate over abortion and raised liability concerns for fertility clinics as they create, store and work with frozen embryos. Three large IVF providers in Alabama paused services in the wake of the ruling. Facing a public backlash to the decision, Alabama lawmakers approved immunity legislation to shield doctors from lawsuits and get IVF services restarted in the state.",
      "The couple, who had turned to IVF to have children, said in their 2021 lawsuit that the accident destroyed their final frozen embryo, which was being stored at the facility. Even though they had chosen not to implant it, \u201cthey considered this embryo a human being or life,\u201d their lawyer wrote in the lawsuit."

      "\u201cAll residents here have felt the impact,\u201d said Amiruddin, 53, a fisherman who like many Indonesians uses only one name.",
      "With the world's largest known nickel reserves and rich deposits of cobalt, bauxite and other materials, Indonesia has been experiencing a mining boom on demand for stainless steel, electric vehicle batteries and more that are needed for the global energy transition. The island nation has sought to expand its mining and processing capabilities while facing backlash from international and local watchdogs for various environmental concerns.",
      "Across Indonesia, nickel processing plants sometimes sprawl just a few minutes from the sea, and barges ready to carry away nickel ore often dot the water. Some mines operate near schools.",
      "Local communities and the natural environments around these mines can bear the burden of this intense demand. From 2001 to 2020, the world lost nearly 1.4 million hectares (about 3.5 million acres) of trees due to mining, with Indonesia having the highest loss, according to an analysis by the World Resources Institute.",
      "______",
      "EDITOR\u2019S NOTE: This is part of a series of on how tribes and Indigenous communities are coping with and combating climate change.",
      "______",
      "On Kabaena, over 3,700 hectares (9,140 acres) of forest \u2014 including protected forest \u2014 were cleared by mining companies between 2001 to 2023, according to data analysis by international environmental organization Mighty Earth. That deforestation has devastated the environment and livelihoods on Kabaena, said Amanda Hurowitz, a senior director at Mighty Earth.",
      "Where fishers could once catch fish to sell or feed their families, the water is now filled with runoff sediment from mining activities and no fish are to be found. Fishers with boats must travel farther, using expensive petrol, and wind up with smaller catches that earn them less money. Those without boats often resort to eating the small shellfish they can find in the murky water around their homes.",
      "\u201c(I would) fish near there by setting a net,\u201d Ilyas, 70, said while pointing in front of his home. \u201cNow it\u2019s far away before (fish) are found.\u201d",
      "Communities on land are experiencing the mines' impact as well: Sugar cane, palm and clove trees cultivated for food and income don't grow as well, with water sources used for crops tainted by mining activities, residents said.",
      "\u201cThat\u2019s the effect: The growth of the sugar palm trees will not be as good because of the influence of mining,\u201d said Amal Susanto, 32, a palm sugar farmer in an area of Kabaena where exploration permits have been granted but mining has not yet begun. \u201cI hope no mines around here, because our income will be impacted.\u201d",
      "Since the mines have opened, there's been a spike in residents complaining of itchy skin, sore throats and other health issues. Villagers no longer want to bathe or wash clothes in the water; when they do, they get itchy skin and rashes said Nina, 33, an Indigenous Bajau resident of Kabaena.",
      "Lab results from samples of rivers, sea water, dust and shellfish from Kabaena taken by Satya Bumi, a nonprofit environmental organization based in Indonesia, in July and November showed hazardous levels of nickel, lead and cadmium \u2014 common mining byproducts.",
      "Exposure to these metals at the levels seen in the lab samples could lead to cancer, cardiovascular, kidney and other chronic diseases, said Kathrin Schilling, an assistant professor at Columbia University who researches molecular biology and reviewed the lab results.",
      "\u201cIf people on this island are using the river water as drinking water \u2014 which has higher levels of the metals \u2014 and then if they are also eating the shellfish and breathe the air ... you cannot escape basically any of the exposure to those toxic metals,\u201d Schilling told AP.",
      "The impact isn\u2019t limited to Kabaena. Across the sea to the north, a nickel mine near the village of Torobulu pushes up against a tattered soccer field and nearby athletic courts.",
      "The impacts and mining continue despite a March 2024 ruling by Indonesia's constitutional court that small islands such as Kabaena require special protection from abnormally dangerous activities, including mining, as they threaten ecosystems in vulnerable areas.",
      "But Indonesia's government is still issuing mining permits for small islands, said Sayyidatiihayaa Afra, a researcher at Satya Bumi.",
      "Since the constitutional court ruling, forest loss has continued on Kabaena, with 150 hectares (370 acres) cleared in areas approved for mining on the island since April 1, according to data analysis by Mighty Earth. Over half of the forest loss occurred in a concession owned by mining company Tonia Mitra Sejahtera.",
      "Tonia Mitra Sejahtera did not respond to a request for interviews or comment. Mining company Anugrah Harisma Barakah \u2014 which caused the most deforestation on Kabaena, according to Satya Bumi \u2014 also did not answer the publicly listed phone number when AP made requests for interviews or comment.",
      "Indonesia's Ministry of Energy and Mineral Resources did not respond to a request for comment.",
      "Meanwhile, people on Kabaena say they feel helpless.",
      "\u201cWhat else can we do if the water is like this?\u201d said Nina. \"We\u2019re small people \u2014 we can\u2019t do anything. We have to surrender.\u201d",

    "summary": "Teen drug use hasn&rsquo;t rebounded from its drop during the early years of the COVID-19 pandemic",

      "Teen drug use hasn\u2019t rebounded from its drop during the early years of the COVID-19 pandemic",
      "NEW YORK -- Teen drug use hasn't rebounded from its drop during the early years of the COVID-19 pandemic, according to the results from a large annual national survey released Tuesday.",
      "About two-thirds of 12th graders this year said they hadn\u2019t used alcohol, marijuana, cigarettes or e-cigarettes in the previous 30 days. That\u2019s the largest proportion abstaining since the annual survey started measuring abstinence in 2017.",
      "Among 10th graders, 80% said they hadn\u2019t used any of those substances recently, another record. Among 8th graders, 90% didn\u2019t use any of them, the same as was reported in the previous survey.",
      "The only significant increase occurred in nicotine pouches. About 6% of 12th graders saying they\u2019d used them in the previous year, up from about 3% in 2023.",
      "Whether that has the makings of a new public health problem is unclear. The University of Michigan\u2019s Richard Miech, who leads the survey, said: \u201cIt\u2019s hard to know if we\u2019re seeing the start of something, or not.\"",
      "The federally funded Monitoring the Future survey has been operating since 1975. This year\u2019s findings are based on responses from about 24,000 students in grades 8, 10 and 12 in schools across the country. The survey is \u201cone of the best, if not the best\" source of national data for substance use by teens, said Noah Kreski, a Columbia University researcher who has studied teen drug use.",
      "Early in the pandemic, students across the country were told not to go to schools and to avoid parties or other gatherings. They were at home, under parents' supervision. Alcohol and drug use of all kinds dropped because experimentation tends to occur with friends, spurred by peer pressure, experts say.",
      "As lockdowns ended, \u201cI think everyone expected at least a partial rebound,\u201d Miech said.",
      "Even before the pandemic, there were longstanding declines in teen cigarette smoking, drinking and use of several types of drugs. Experts theorized that kids were staying home and communicating on smartphones rather than hanging out in groups, where they sometimes tried illicit substances.",
      "But marijuana use wasn't falling before the pandemic. And vaping was on the upswing. It was only during the pandemic that those two saw enduring declines, too.",
      "Some experts wonder if the pandemic lockdowns had a deeper influence.",
      "Miech noted that a lot of teens who experiment with e-cigarettes or drugs start in the 9th grade, sometimes because older adolescents are doing it. But the kids who were 9th graders during the lockdowns never picked up the habit, and never had the opportunity to turn into negative influencers of their younger classmates, he said.",
      "\u201cThe pandemic stopped the cycle of new kids coming in and being recruited to drug use,\u201d Miech said.",
      "Mental health may also be a factor. There were increased reports of depression and anxiety in kids after the pandemic began. Depression is often associated with substance use, but some people with depression and anxiety are very wary of messing with drugs, said Dr. Duncan Clark, a University of Pittsburgh psychiatrist who researches substance use in kids.",
      "\u201cSome teens with anxiety are worried about the effects of substances. They may also be socially inhibited and have less opportunity to use drugs,\" Clark said. \"It's a complicated relationship.\u201d",

      "People worried they'll never get a scarce human transplant want to know when they might get a pig kidney instead",
      "LOUISVILLE, Ky. -- The calls and emails started coming into NYU Langone Health and Massachusetts General Hospital soon after doctors began experimenting with pig organs in humans.",
      "People worried they\u2019ll never get a scarce human transplant asked: When could we get a pig kidney?",
      "Alex Berrios of Louisville, Kentucky, needs a second transplant but finding another human match is proving impossible. So he's closely watching for a chance at pig kidney research.",
      "\"It may not work, and I have to be OK with that,\u201d Berrios said. \u201cI think it\u2019s worth the shot.\u201d",
      "Now two U.S. companies aim to begin the world\u2019s first clinical trials of xenotransplantation in 2025 \u2013 using pig kidneys or hearts to try to save human lives. Would-be volunteers are impatient to see if they'll qualify as researchers fine-tune how best to test if the humanized pig organs they\u2019ve designed might really work.",
      "Anticipation is growing with news that an Alabama woman was faring well after a pig kidney transplant at NYU in late November. Towana Looney is the fifth American to receive a gene-edited pig organ, each case so far an emergency experiment for people out of options.",
      "None of the previous recipients \u2014 two given pig hearts and two kidneys \u2014 survived more than two months but that hasn't deterred researchers hunting an alternative to the dire shortage of transplantable organs.",
      "\u201cWe have to have the courage to continue,\u201d said University of Maryland transplant surgeon Dr. Bartley Griffith.",
      "Back in 2022, Griffith had a hard time figuring out how to ask a dying patient if he\u2019d consider undergoing the world\u2019s first transplant of a gene-edited pig heart.",
      "\u201cI was so afraid to mention the word pig heart,\u201d Griffith said. He marveled that patient David Bennett responded with a joke about oinking and made clear if the last-ditch attempt failed that \u201cmaybe you\u2019ll learn something for others like me.\u201d",
      "Fast forward to late 2023, when patients at a National Kidney Foundation meeting with FDA officials and pig developers described a life so miserable on dialysis that they, too, would chance an animal organ.",
      "\u201cWhy not try? That was really what we took back,\u201d said Mike Curtis, CEO of eGenesis, one of the companies developing organs. \u201cIt was like we really almost have an obligation to try.\u201d",
      "\u201cThe patients pushed us to go ahead,\u201d agreed Dr. Tatsuo Kawai, a Mass General surgeon who\u2019d been reluctant to even broach the idea \u2013 but last March, four months after that meeting, gave a longtime patient the first gene-edited pig kidney.",
      "In Palm Springs, California, Carl McNew emailed NYU to ask about volunteering while he\u2019s still fairly healthy.",
      "McNew donated a kidney to his husband in 2015 but later his remaining kidney began declining, something very rare in living donors. Medications and intermittent dialysis are helping but McNew knows he\u2019ll eventually need a transplant.",
      "\u201cThere\u2019s just something about being part of something like that, that is so cutting-edge,\u201d said McNew, who spotted news of NYU\u2019s xenotransplant research in 2023 and emailed his interest.",
      "For Louisville\u2019s Berrios, donor scarcity isn\u2019t the only hurdle. Born with a single kidney that failed in his late 20s, a living donor transplant restored his health for 13 years. But it failed in 2020 and he has since developed antibodies that would destroy another human kidney, what doctors call \u201chighly sensitized.\u201d",
      "Every Monday, Wednesday and Friday, Berrios quietly slips out of his home before dawn to spend nearly four hours tethered to a dialysis machine. Getting the grueling treatments at 5 a.m. is the only way the father of two can both stay alive and hold down a fulltime job.",
      "But dialysis doesn\u2019t fully replace kidney function \u2013 people slowly get sicker. So even as Berrios tried an experimental therapy to tamp down his problem antibodies, he told NYU he's interested in a pig kidney.",
      "FDA rules require that pig organs be extensively tested in monkeys or baboons before humans. And while researchers have extended those primates\u2019 survival to a year, sometimes longer, they were desperate for experience with people. After all, the pig organs are genetically altered to be more humanlike, not more baboon-like.",
      "At NYU and the University of Alabama at Birmingham, surgeons first tested pig organs in bodies of the recently deceased, donated for scientific research.",
      "And patients given pig organs so far have been \u201ccompassionate use\u201d transplants, experiments that FDA allows in select emergency cases for people out of other options.",
      "Although the first four didn\u2019t survive long, in part because of complications from other diseases, those experiments proved pig organs could work at least for a while and offered other lessons. For example, discovery of a hidden pig virus in the first heart transplant prompted better tests for that risk.",
      "Only rigorous studies comparing similarly ill patients will offer a clearer picture of pig organs\u2019 potential \u2013 maybe those like Looney. Despite eight years of dialysis, she wasn\u2019t nearly as sick as prior xenotransplant recipients but couldn\u2019t find a matching donor. Like Berrios, she had a highly sensitized immune response.",
      "Looney may be \u201ckind of a litmus test\u201d for trial candidates, said NYU\u2019s Montgomery, who led her transplant with her original surgeon in Alabama, Dr. Jayme Locke. \u201cShe\u2019s received the transplant at just the right time,\u201d before dialysis did too much damage.",
      "Scientists have tried animal-to-human transplants for years without success but now they can edit pig genes, trying to bridge the species gap enough to keep the human immune system from immediately attacking the foreign tissue. Still, nobody knows the best gene combination.",
      "Revivicor, a United Therapeutics subsidiary, produces kidneys and hearts with 10 gene edits, \u201cknocking out\u201d pig genes that trigger hyper-rejection and excessive organ growth and adding some human genes to improve compatibility. Maryland used hearts with 10 gene edits in its two xenotransplants. Looney also got a kidney with 10 gene edits, based on Locke\u2019s research when she worked in Alabama.",
      "While Montgomery is thrilled with Looney\u2019s progress, he's done most work using Revivicor pigs with just one gene edit, in a xenotransplant last April and in research with the deceased.",
      "\u201cOur feeling is, you know, less is more,\u201d said Montgomery, noting it\u2019s easier to mass produce pigs with fewer gene alterations. Looney\u2019s transplant offers a chance to compare \u201creally how much difference those additional gene edits are making.\u201d",
      "In Boston, eGenesis has still another approach \u2013 a whopping 69 gene edits. In addition to 10 genetic alterations to improve human compatibility, genes linked to certain pig viruses also are inactivated.",
      "Researchers feel pressure to show if pig organs can keep people alive much longer than a few months, said eGenesis' Curtis. If not, the question will be \u201cdo we have the right gene edits?\u201d",
      "The balance is choosing participants sick enough to qualify but not so sick they have no chance.",
      "\u201cThere\u2019s a tremendous number of patients who would be very willing, very willing to do this,\u201d said Dr. Silke Niederhaus of the University of Maryland, who isn\u2019t involved in xenotransplant research but watches it closely.",
      "Niederhaus became a kidney transplant surgeon because around her 12th birthday, one saved her life. That kidney lasted three decades. When it failed, it took five years to find another. So she understands the draw of pig research, and urges people to learn their odds of getting a human kidney before volunteering.",
      "If they\u2019re younger, healthier or have a living donor, \u201cI would probably say go with what\u2019s known and what\u2019s proven,\u201d Niederhaus said. But if they\u2019re older and dialysis is starting to fail, \u201cmaybe it\u2019s worth taking the risk.\u201d",

      "Looney\u2019s surgery marks an important step as scientists get ready for formal studies of xenotransplantation expected to begin next year, said Dr. Robert Montgomery of NYU Langone Health, who led the highly experimental procedure on Nov. 25.",
      "On Tuesday, NYU announced that Looney is recuperating well. She was discharged from the hospital just 11 days after surgery although she was temporarily readmitted this week to adjust her medications. Doctors expect her to return home to Gadsden, Alabama, in three months. If the pig kidney were to fail, she could begin dialysis again.",
      "\u201cTo see hope restored to her and her family is extraordinary,\u201d said Dr. Jayme Locke, Looney's original surgeon who secured Food and Drug Administration permission for the transplant.",
      "More than 100,000 people are on the U.S. transplant list, most who need a kidney. Thousands die waiting and many more who need a transplant never qualify. Now, searching for an alternate supply, scientists are genetically altering pigs so their organs are more humanlike.",
      "Looney donated a kidney to her mother in 1999. Later pregnancy complications caused high blood pressure that damaged her remaining kidney, which eventually failed. It\u2019s incredibly rare for living donors to develop kidney failure although those who do are given extra priority on the transplant list.",
      "But Looney couldn't get a match \u2014 she had developed antibodies abnormally primed to attack another human kidney. Tests showed she\u2019d reject every kidney donors have offered.",
      "Then Looney heard about pig kidney research at t he University of Alabama at Birmingham and told Locke, at the time a UAB transplant surgeon, she'd like to try one. In April 2023, Locke filed an FDA application seeking an emergency experiment, under rules for people like Looney who are out of options.",
      "The FDA didn't agree right away. Instead, the world's first gene-edited pig kidney transplants went to two sicker patients last spring, at Massachusetts General Hospital and NYU. Both also had serious heart disease. The Boston patient recovered enough to spend about a month at home before dying of sudden cardiac arrest deemed unrelated to the pig kidney. NYU\u2019s patient had heart complications that damaged her pig kidney, forcing its removal, and she later died.",
      "Those disappointing outcomes didn\u2019t dissuade Looney, who was starting to feel worse on dialysis but, Locke said, hadn't developed heart disease or other complications. The FDA eventually allowed her transplant at NYU, where Locke collaborated with Montgomery.",
      "Moments after Montgomery sewed the pig kidney into place, it turned a healthy pink and began producing urine.",
      "Even if her new organ fails, doctors can learn from it, Looney told the AP: \u201cYou don't know if it's going to work or not until you try.\u201d",
      "Blacksburg, Virginia-based Revivicor provided Looney\u2019s new kidney from a pig with 10 gene alterations. Its parent company, United Therapeutics said Tuesday it plans to file an application with the FDA \u201cvery soon\u201d to begin clinical trials with that type of kidney.",
      "Looney was initially discharged on Dec. 6, wearing monitors to track her blood pressure, heart rate and other bodily functions and returning to the hospital for daily checkups before her medication readmission. Doctors scrutinize her bloodwork and other tests, comparing them to prior research in animals and a few humans in hopes of spotting an early warning if problems crop up.",

      "Global security leaders are warning nuclear threats are growing as weapons spending has surged to $91.4 billion last year",
      "Global security leaders are warning that nuclear threats are growing as weapons spending has surged around the world. At the same time, private bunker sales are on the rise globally. Critics warn these bunkers create a false perception that a nuclear war is survivable. They argue that people planning to live through an atomic blast aren\u2019t focusing on the real and current dangers posed by nuclear threats, and the critical need to stop the proliferation of weapons of mass destruction.",
      "Meanwhile, government disaster experts say bunkers aren\u2019t necessary. A Federal Emergency Management Agency\u2019s 100-page guide on responding to a nuclear detonation focuses on having the public get inside and stay inside, ideally in a basement and away from outside walls for at least a day. Those existing spaces can provide protection from radioactive fallout, says FEMA.",
      "Here are takeaways from the AP\u2019s reporting on bunkers and the debate over the message building bunkers sends.",
      "The market for U.S. bomb and fallout shelters is forecast to grow from $137 million last year to $175 million by 2030, according to a market research report from BlueWeave Consulting. The report says major growth factors include \u201cthe rising threat of nuclear or terrorist attacks or civil unrest.\u201d",
      "\u201cPeople are uneasy and they want a safe place to put their family. And they have this attitude that it\u2019s better to have it and not need it then to need it and not have it,\u201d said Atlas Survival Shelters CEO Ron Hubbard. He says his bunker factory, in Sulphur Springs, Texas, is the world\u2019s largest. Hubbard said COVID lockdowns, Russia\u2019s invasion of Ukraine and the outbreak of the Israel-Hamas war have driven sales.",
      "\u201cLook, this fallout exposure is entirely preventable because it is something that happens after the detonation,\u201d said Brooke Buddemeier a radiation safety specialist at Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory, where the U.S. government designs nuclear weapons. \u201cThere\u2019s going to be a fairly obvious nuclear explosion event, a large cloud. So just getting inside, away from where those particles fall, can keep you and your family safe.\u201d",
      "After a deadly and deafening blast, a bright flash and a mushroom cloud, it will take about 15 minutes for the radioactive fallout to arrive for those a mile or more away from ground zero, said Michael Dillon, a scientist at Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s going to literally be sand falling on your head, and you\u2019re going to want to get out of that situation. You want to go to your most robust building,\u201d he said. In their models, they estimate people may need to stay inside for a day or two before evacuating.",
      "Nonproliferation advocates bristle at the bunkers, shelters or any suggestion that a nuclear war is survivable.",
      "\u201cBunkers are, in fact, not a tool to survive a nuclear war, but a tool to allow a population to psychologically endure the possibility of a nuclear war,\u201d said Alicia Sanders-Zakre at the International Campaign to Abolish Nuclear Weapons.",

      "Global security leaders are warning nuclear threats are growing as weapons spending surged to $91.4 billion last year",
      "When Bernard Jones Jr. and his wife, Doris, built their dream home, they didn\u2019t hold back. A grotto swimming pool with a waterfall for hot summer days. A home theater for cozy winter nights. A fruit orchard to harvest in fall. And a vast underground bunker in case disaster strikes.",
      "\u201cThe world\u2019s not becoming a safer place,\u201d he said. \u201cWe wanted to be prepared.\u201d",
      "Under a nondescript metal hatch near the private basketball court, there\u2019s a hidden staircase that leads down into rooms with beds for about 25 people, bathrooms and two kitchens, all backed by a self-sufficient energy source.",
      "With water, electricity, clean air and food, they felt ready for any disaster, even a nuclear blast, at their bucolic home in California\u2019s Inland Empire.",
      "\u201cIf there was a nuclear strike, would you rather go into the living room or go into a bunker? If you had one, you\u2019d go there too,\u201d said Jones, who said he reluctantly sold the home two years ago.",
      "Global security leaders are warning nuclear threats are growing as weapons spending surged to $91.4 billion last year. At the same time, private bunker sales are on the rise globally, from small metal boxes to crawl inside of to extravagant underground mansions.",
      "Critics warn these bunkers create a false perception that a nuclear war is survivable. They argue that people planning to live through an atomic blast aren\u2019t focusing on the real and current dangers posed by nuclear threats, and the critical need to stop the proliferation of weapons of mass destruction.",
      "Meanwhile, government disaster experts say bunkers aren\u2019t necessary. A Federal Emergency Management Agency 100-page guide on responding to a nuclear detonation focuses on having the public get inside and stay inside, ideally in a basement and away from outside walls for at least a day. Those existing spaces can provide protection from radioactive fallout, says FEMA.",
      "But increasingly, buyers say bunkers offer a sense of security. The market for U.S. bomb and fallout shelters is forecast to grow from $137 million last year to $175 million by 2030, according to a market research report from BlueWeave Consulting. The report says major growth factors include \u201cthe rising threat of nuclear or terrorist attacks or civil unrest.\u201d",
      "\u201cPeople are uneasy and they want a safe place to put their family. And they have this attitude that it\u2019s better to have it and not need it then to need it and not have it,\u201d said Atlas Survival Shelters CEO Ron Hubbard, amid showers of sparks and the loud buzz of welding at his bunker factory, which he says is the world\u2019s largest, in Sulphur Springs, Texas.",
      "Hubbard said COVID lockdowns, Russia\u2019s invasion of Ukraine and the outbreak of the Israel-Hamas war have driven sales.",
      "On Nov. 21, in the hours after Russia\u2019s first-ever use of an experimental, hypersonic ballistic missile to attack Ukraine, Hubbard said his phone rang nonstop.",
      "Four callers ended up buying bunkers in one day, he said, and more ended up ordering doors and other parts for shelters they were already building.",
      "Hubbard said his bunkers are built for all disasters.",
      "\u201cThey\u2019re good for anything from a tornado to a hurricane to nuclear fallout, to a pandemic to even a volcano erupting,\u201d he said, sweeping his arms toward a massive warehouse where more than 50 different bunkers were under construction.",
      "A loaded shotgun at arm\u2019s length and metal mesh window shields to block Molotov cocktails nearby, Hubbard said he started his company after building his own bunker about 10 years ago. He says callers ask about prices \u2014 $20,000 to multimillions, averaging $500,000 \u2014 and installations \u2014 they can go just about anywhere. He said most days he sells at least one bunker.",
      "Under Hubbard\u2019s doomsday scenario, global tensions could lead to World War III, a situation he is prepared to live through.",
      "\u201cThe good news about nuclear warfare,\u201d he said, \u201cif there ever was any, that it\u2019s very survivable if you\u2019re not killed in the initial blast.\u201d",
      "He\u2019s not wrong, say U.S. government disaster preparedness experts.",
      "\u201cLook, this fallout exposure is entirely preventable because it is something that happens after the detonation,\u201d said Brooke Buddemeier a radiation safety specialist at Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory, where the U.S. government designs nuclear weapons. Buddemeier and his colleagues are tasked with evaluating what could happen after an attack and how best to survive. \u201cThere\u2019s going to be a fairly obvious nuclear explosion event, a large cloud. So just getting inside, away from where those particles fall, can keep you and your family safe.\u201d",
      "Buddemeier and others in the U.S. government are trying to get Americans \u2014 who decades ago hid under desks during nuclear attack drills \u2014 educated about how to respond.",
      "After a deadly and deafening blast, a bright flash and a mushroom cloud, it will take about 15 minutes for the radioactive fallout to arrive for those a mile or more away from ground zero, said Michael Dillon, a scientist at Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s going to literally be sand falling on your head, and you\u2019re going to want to get out of that situation. You want to go to your most robust building,\u201d he said. In their models, they estimate people may need to stay inside for a day or two before evacuating.",
      "The government\u2019s efforts to educate the public were reinvigorated after a false alarm missile alert in Hawaii in 2018 caused widespread panic.",
      "The emergency alert, which was sent to cellphones statewide just before 8:10 a.m., said: \u201cBALLISTIC MISSILE THREAT INBOUND TO HAWAII. SEEK IMMEDIATE SHELTER. THIS IS NOT A DRILL.\u201d",
      "For the next 40 minutes there were traffic jams, workers running into and out of buildings, families huddling in their bathrooms, students gathering in gyms, drivers blocking tunnels, all in an attempt to seek shelter, without any clear idea of what \u201cseek immediate shelter\u201d actually meant.",
      "Today the federal government offers a guide to prepare citizens for a nuclear attack that advises people to find a basement or the center of a large building and stay there, possibly for a few days, until they get word about where to go next.",
      "\u201cGently brush your pet\u2019s coat to remove any fallout particles\u201d it says, adding that the 15-minute delay between bomb and fallout allows \u201cenough time for you to be able to prevent significant radiation exposure.\u201d",
      "Jeffrey Schlegelmilch, who directs the FEMA-backed National Center for Disaster Preparedness at Columbia University, said \u201cthe scenarios of a nuclear detonation are not all or nothing.\u201d",
      "If a small number of weapons detonate rather than all-out war, he said, sheltering inside a large building to avoid the fallout could save lives.",
      "Nonproliferation advocates bristle at the bunkers, shelters or any suggestion that a nuclear war is survivable.",
      "\u201cBunkers are, in fact, not a tool to survive a nuclear war, but a tool to allow a population to psychologically endure the possibility of a nuclear war,\u201d said Alicia Sanders-Zakre at the International Campaign to Abolish Nuclear Weapons.",
      "Sanders-Zakre called radiation the \u201cuniquely horrific aspect of nuclear weapons,\u201d and noted that even surviving the fallout doesn\u2019t prevent long-lasting, intergenerational health crises. \u201cUltimately, the only solution to protect populations from nuclear war is to eliminate nuclear weapons.\u201d",
      "Researcher Sam Lair at the James Martin Center for Nonproliferation Studies says U.S. leaders stopped talking about bunkers decades ago.",
      "\u201cThe political costs incurred by causing people to think about shelters again is not worth it to leaders because it forces people to think about what they would do after nuclear war,\u201d he said. \u201cThat\u2019s something that very, very few people want to think about. This makes people feel vulnerable.\u201d",
      "Lair said building bunkers seems futile, even if they work in the short term.",
      "\u201cEven if a nuclear exchange is perhaps more survivable than many people think, I think the aftermath will be uglier than many people think as well,\u201d he said. \u201cThe fundamental wrenching that it would do to our way of life would be profound.\u201d",
      "That\u2019s been a serious concern of Massachusetts Congressman James McGovern for almost 50 years.",
      "\u201cIf we ever get to a point where there\u2019s all out nuclear war, underground bunkers aren\u2019t going to protect people,\u201d he said. \u201cInstead, we ought to be investing our resources and our energy trying to talk about a nuclear weapons freeze, initially.\u201d",
      "Next, he said, \u201cwe should work for the day when we get rid of all nuclear weapons.\u201d",
      "Year after year he introduces legislation pushing for nonproliferation, but looking out his office window at the Capitol, he said he\u2019s disappointed by the lack of debate over what will be a $1 trillion expenditure to build and modernize the U.S. arsenal.",
      "\u201cThe stakes, if a nuclear weapon is ever used, is that millions and millions and millions of people will die. It really is shocking that we have world leaders who talk casually about utilizing nuclear weapons. I mean, it would be catastrophic, not just for those that are involved in an exchange of nuclear weapons, but for the entire world.\u201d",
      "McGovern pushed back against FEMA\u2019s efforts to prepare the public for a nuclear attack by advising people to take shelter.",
      "\u201cWhat a stupid thing to say that we all just need to know where to hide and where to avoid the most impacts of nuclear radiation. I mean, really, that\u2019s chilling when you hear people try to rationalize nuclear war that way,\u201d he said.",
      "Nuclear war was far from a couple's mind when they went house-hunting in Southern California a few years ago. They wanted a home to settle down and raise their family, and they needed extra garage space. They spotted an online ad for a home with at least eight parking spots. On the basketball court, there was a metal hatch. Beneath it was a bunker.",
      "This was Jones' former home, which Jones said he put up for sale for family reasons.",
      "The husband, who spoke on condition of anonymity because of concerns about his family's privacy, went ahead and bought Jones' home, bunker and all. They aren\u2019t particularly worried about nuclear war, and haven\u2019t spent a night in the bunker, but they have stored food and medical supplies down there.",
      "\u201cWe have told some of our friends, if something goes crazy and gets bad, get over here as fast as possible,\u201d the husband said. \u201cIt does provide a sense of security.\u201d",

Kennedy Jr. swept onto Capitol Hill late Monday as the anti-vaccine health guru from the famous political family reintroduced himself to senators, this time as President-elect Donald Trump's pick to lead the nation's Health and Human Services Department.",
      "It was a soft-opening debut for Kennedy, whose wide-ranging views \u2014 yes to raw milk, no to fluoride, Ozempic and America's favorite processed foods \u2014 are raising alarms in the scientific community and beyond. In the Senate he's facing a mix of support, curiosity, skepticism and downright rejection among the senators who will be asked to confirm him to Trump's Cabinet.",
      "Kennedy's first stop Monday was on potentially friendly terrain, to the offices of a few GOP senators allied with Trump, the start of a robust, weeks-long process.",
      "One Republican, Sen. Markwayne Mullin of Oklahoma, said Kennedy told him, \u201cI 100% support the polio vaccination.\u201d But Mullin added that their conversation also turned to other childhood vaccinations. He predicts Kennedy will be confirmed.",
      "\u201cThe more you talk to him, the more he explains it, the more you like him,\u201d Mullin said.",
      "The man known simply as RFK, Jr., 70, is the latest in the Trump rival-turned-partner orbit, a former Democratic presidential hopeful now in line to run the world's largest public health agency, with its whopping $1.7 trillion budget, and some of the U.S. most important public services.",
      "HHS has a broad reach across the lives of Americans \u2014 inspecting the nation's food, regulating medicines and overseeing research of diseases and cures. It provides health insurance for nearly half of the country \u2014 poor, disabled and older Americans, including via Medicare.",

      "\u201cAnyone seeking the Senate\u2019s consent to serve in the incoming Administration would do well to steer clear of even the appearance of association with such efforts,\u201d McConnell said recently.",
      "Trump said Monday during his own press conference he\u2019s a \u201cbig believer\u201d in polio vaccines and sought to tamp down fears about Kennedy, saying he will be \u201cmuch less radical\u201d than people think.",
      "The incoming GOP leader, Sen. John Thune of South Dakota, said Kennedy will have to address questions about his views on the polio vaccine and other issues.",

      "In the Capitol on Monday, Republican senators said they want to hear more about Kennedy\u2019s views.",
      "\u201cI\u2019m open,\" said GOP Sen. Thom Tillis of North Carolina. But \u201cif you come in and say I won\u2019t consider myself successful unless I eliminate these vaccines, that could be problematic.\u201d",
      "Kennedy\u2019s nomination will test the nation\u2019s emerging political realignment, as Trump expands his base of supporters to include former Democratic voters shifting elsewhere. Kennedy\u2019s views find favor but also opposition from both sides of the political aisle.",
      "In particular, Kennedy's ideas about ridding the nation\u2019s food of additives has drawn interest if not support from some Democrats, but his criticism of major farm interests have also raised concerns from the agricultural industry.",
      "Iowa GOP Sen. Chuck Grassley says he\u2019s interested in what Kennedy says about pigs \u201cbecause Iowa is the number one pig producer.\u201d",
      "Other Trump nominees are also expected back on Capitol Hill this week. The president-elect's choice of Pete Hegseth for Defense Secretary, Tulsi Gabbard for Office of the Director of National Intelligence, Kash Patel for FBI director and others are all running into turbulence from wary senators.",
      "With Republicans taking control of the Senate in the new year, Trump's nominees have a pathway to confirmation. But with just a 53-47 majority, any nominee can only lose a handful of GOP supporters, in the face of Democratic opposition.",

      "An inquiry currently underway to examine failures by the hospital to recognize why babies were dying and why they took so long to stop Letby opened in September against a backdrop of experts and others who have questioned evidence used against Letby.",
      "A group of scientists, doctors and legal experts that independently reviewed scientific evidence from Letby\u2019s trial warned Britain\u2019s ministers of health and justice that legal systems were \u201cparticularly vulnerable to errors\u201d when dealing with technical matters, \u201cespecially in cases involving statistical anomalies in health care settings.\u201d",

      "\u201cDon\u2019t get me wrong, I\u2019m sure Dr. Evans is still going to say that Lucy Letby is guilty and he has a different view or different hypothesis in relation to it,\" McDonald said. \u201cBut the cause of death that was before the Court of Appeal is different now, according to Dr. Evans, and I think that is a profound issue that needs to be relooked at.\u201d",
      "Evans has not yet responded to a request for comment following McDonald's news conference.",
      "Additionally, two neonatologists working with the defense said there were medical reasons Baby C and Baby O became ill and could not be resuscitated, McDonald said."

      "Experts say that the holidays can put a strain on your mental health",
      "Bells are ringing. Snow is glistening. But you\u2019re bummed out.",
      "You could be suffering from a case of the holiday blues, which experts say is not uncommon.",
      "A strained relationship with family, for example, can make this time of year pretty lonely. The holidays are expensive, and financial woes can cause major stress. Anxiety about holiday anything can fuel depression and worsen existing mental health concerns.",
      "\u201cA lot of people at certain years can find the holidays to be more challenging than they have experienced in past years,\u201d said Shilagh Mirgain, a psychologist at UW Health in Madison, Wisconsin. \u201cIt\u2019s important to recognize the common humanity that others, too, are struggling.",
      "\"You\u2019re not alone.\u201d",
      "Here\u2019s what experts say you can do to make your holiday season a little more bearable, if not cheery.",
      "Spending an extended amount of time with family is hard to avoid around the holidays, Mirgain said, but there are ways to make it a little easier.",
      "\u201cCertainly this year, I think with the recent election, there\u2019s a lot of divisiveness and discord, and you\u2019re probably having to interact with family members that have really opposing beliefs,\u201d she said. \u201cThat can bring up strong emotions.\u201d",
      "Think about the boundaries you want to set: What kind of contact do you want to have with your family and how long are you prepared to be around them?",
      "It\u2019s also important to give yourself permission to exit the event \u2014 and have some strategies in place, she said. For example, if you need some space, go on a walk or run some errands.",
      "And if stressful conversations come up, have some language ready to go to draw your boundaries quickly and firmly.",
      "\u201cYou could say, \u2018Gosh, thanks for asking, but I don\u2019t talk politics over the holidays,\u2019\u201d Mirgain suggested.",
      "The holidays can be difficult for people who are grieving or don\u2019t have anyone nearby with whom to celebrate.",
      "\u201cLoneliness and isolation can feel exacerbated during the holiday season when you look around and it seems like everyone\u2019s getting together and you don\u2019t have plans, or you\u2019re not looking forward to your plans,\u201d Mirgain said.",
      "Find ways to connect with people if that\u2019s something you\u2019re craving, like scheduling calls with people across the country or volunteering in your community.",
      "\u201cThere\u2019s so much opportunity to give back during this time, and I think generosity is one of the best things we can do for our own well-being,\u201d she said.",
      "And if you\u2019re grieving the death of someone close to you, the holidays can be the perfect time to reflect on that person's legacy, said Dr. Ellen Lee, a geriatric psychiatrist at UC San Diego Health.",
      "\"Try to honor that person by visiting their grave site or doing something they really loved to do, and then find people to share those memories with,\u201d Lee said. She also advises people not to tamp down feelings but let yourself grieve.",
      "Gifts, dinners, decorations \u2014 it\u2019s all a lot to keep track of around this time of year, and it\u2019s easy to feel overwhelmed. Those extra expenses and get-togethers can put more stress on your mental health.",
      "For milder symptoms of depression, anxiety or mood issues, lean on tried-and-true methods of self-care, experts said, such as spending time doing something you love or watching a movie.",
      "But it's important to reach out for help if you start to feel mounting financial anxiety or intensifying symptoms that impair your ability to function. Early intervention can keep them from intensifying, Mirgain said, adding that if you have suicidal thoughts, reach out to your provider. You can also call or text 988 or chat at 988Lifeline.org.",
      "Remember, your holidays don\u2019t have to be a Hallmark movie. Give yourself permission to do it differently this year, Lee said.",
      "\u201cWe have so many goals, so many targets,\u201d she said. \u201cGetting all the gifts, decorating the house perfectly \u2026 sometimes it\u2019s helpful to sort of focus on the most important part of it.\u201d",
      "That can look different depending on who you are: The most important part may be spending time with people you don\u2019t get to see often, or having a nice meal with your favorite foods.",
      "Lee emphasized that it is fine to have a low-key celebration.",
      "\u201cI ask people, \u2018What\u2019s the best part of the holiday?\u2019\" she said, \"It\u2019s not usually about the decorations or all these extra things that we all spend a lot of time worrying about.\u201d",

      "Afghanistan reported at least 23 confirmed cases in 2024, according to data from the World Health Organization.",
      "In September, the Afghan Taliban suddenly stopped a door-to-door vaccination campaign in Afghanistan, a devastating setback for polio eradication as the virus is one of the world\u2019s most infectious and any unvaccinated groups of children where the virus is spreading could undo years of progress.",

      "Health and tourism officials in Fiji say seven foreign tourists have been hospitalized after drinking cocktails at a resort bar",
      "WELLINGTON, New Zealand -- Seven foreign tourists were hospitalized in Fiji after drinking cocktails at a resort bar, Fijian authorities said on Monday.",
      "The cause of their illness was not known and officials said it was too soon to know if tainted alcohol was involved.",
      "Those who became ill at the five-star Warwick resort near the town of Sigatoka on Saturday included Australians and an American, according to local news reports. They were hospitalized with nausea, vomiting and neurological symptoms, said Jemesa Tudravu, a Fiji Health Ministry spokesperson.",
      "Two people remained in the hospital, conscious and in stable condition, Fiji's Tourism Minister Viliame R. Gavoka told reporters on Monday. One person was discharged on Sunday and four others on Monday.",
      "David Sandoe, an Australian man who said his daughter and granddaughter were hospitalized, told Sky News Australia that his relatives had been released from the hospital and were due to fly home on Monday night.",
      "Local news outlets reported on Sunday that the cause of the foreigners' illness was suspected alcohol poisoning, similar to a case in Laos in November in which six tourists \u2014 including two Australian teenagers \u2014 died after consuming tainted drinks.",
      "But Tudravu said no cause had been identified in the Fiji episode. Police have ordered toxicology tests and are awaiting results \u2014 which are expected to take three or four days \u2014 Gavoka said.",
      "The bar was full of customers on Saturday night and many had ordered pi\u00f1a coladas, the drink consumed by those who became ill, said the official.",
      "Gavoka said no other reports of similar illness were recorded at the resort or across Fiji, a South Pacific island nation of 930,000 people.",
      "\u201cThe resort management has assured us that they have not engaged in practices such as substituting ingredients or altering the quality of drinks served to guests,\u201d Gavoka said. The hotel, located on the picturesque Coral Coast of the largest island, Viti Levu, has operated for many years and \u201cholds a strong reputation,\u201d he added.",

      "Senate Republican leader Mitch McConnell, a childhood polio survivor, said any of President-elect Donald Trump\u2019s picks requiring Senate confirmation should \u201csteer clear\u201d of efforts to discredit the polio vaccine",
      "WASHINGTON -- Senate Republican leader Mitch McConnell, who had polio as a child, says any of President-elect Donald Trump\u2019s nominees seeking Senate confirmation should \u201csteer clear\u201d of efforts to discredit the polio vaccine.",
      "\u201cEfforts to undermine public confidence in proven cures are not just uninformed \u2014 they\u2019re dangerous,\u201d McConnell said in a statement Friday. \u201cAnyone seeking the Senate\u2019s consent to serve in the incoming Administration would do well to steer clear of even the appearance of association with such efforts.\u201d",
      "The 82-year-old lawmaker\u2019s statement appeared to be directed at Trump\u2019s pick for health secretary, Robert F. Kennedy Jr., after a report that one of his advisers filed a petition to revoke approval for the polio vaccine in 2022. That vaccine is widely considered to have halted the disease in most parts of the world.",
      "McConnell's words were a sign that Kennedy, who has long advanced the debunked idea that vaccines cause autism, could face some resistance in the soon-to-be GOP-controlled Senate.",
      "\u201cMr. Kennedy believes the Polio Vaccine should be available to the public and thoroughly and properly studied,\u201d said Katie Miller, the transition spokeswoman for Kennedy, in response to questions.",
      "The New York Times reported that the petition was filed by a lawyer now helping Kennedy select candidates for federal health positions in the incoming administration.",
      "Any individual or company can file a petition with the Food and Drug Administration, which typically fields hundreds of requests at any time relating to various food, drug and medical issues. Most petitions are denied, but the FDA is required to respond to each one in writing.",
      "Vaccines have been proven to be safe and effective in laboratory testing and in real-world use in hundreds of millions of people over decades \u2014 they are considered among the most effective public health measures in history.",
      "McConnell contracted polio at 2 years old but survived because of \u201cthe miraculous combination of modern medicine and a mother\u2019s love,\" according to the statement. He praised the \u201csaving power\u201d of the polio vaccine for the \u201cmillions who came after me.\u201d",
      "Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer, D-N.Y., said in a post on X that it was \u201coutrageous and dangerous for people in the Trump Transition to try and get rid of the polio vaccine that has virtually eradicated polio in America and saved millions of lives.",
      "He said Kennedy should clarify his own position on it.",
      "Trump announced last month his selection of Kennedy, saying Kennedy would work to protect Americans \u201cfrom harmful chemicals, pollutants, pesticides, pharmaceutical products, and food additives.\u201d",
      "But that pick was met with alarm from scientists and public health officials, who fear Kennedy would unwind lifesaving public health initiatives such as vaccines.",
      "Kennedy has pushed other conspiracy theories regarding vaccines, such as that COVID-19 could have been \u201cethnically targeted\u201d to spare Ashkenazi Jews and Chinese people, comments he later said were taken out of context. He has repeatedly brought up the Holocaust when discussing vaccines and public health mandates.",
      "Kennedy said he plans to remake the Department of Health and Human Services, an agency with sprawling reach and a $1.3 trillion budget, if he is approved. He has suggested the FDA is beholden to \u201cbig pharma,\u201d and his anti-vaccine nonprofit has called on it to stop using COVID-19 vaccines.",
      "During the COVID-19 epidemic, his nonprofit group, Children\u2019s Health Defense, petitioned the FDA to halt the use of all COVID vaccines. The group has alleged that the FDA is beholden to \u201cbig pharma\u201d because it receives much of its budget from industry fees and some employees who have departed the agency have gone on to work for drugmakers.",
      "Children\u2019s Health Defense currently has a lawsuit pending against a number of news organizations, among them The Associated Press, accusing them of violating antitrust laws by taking action to identify misinformation, including about COVID-19 and COVID-19 vaccines. Kennedy took leave from the group when he announced his run for president but is listed as one of its attorneys in the lawsuit."

      "If you're planning to stay sober during this holiday season, experts suggest following some practical tips",
      "Last year, when Lauren Haydel began her first sober holiday season, she wondered how difficult it would be to avoid alcohol at family parties and celebrations with friends. She owns a boutique, Fleurty Girl, in New Orleans\u2019 French Quarter, a neighborhood synonymous with drinking.",
      "But few people questioned her choice. \u201cInstead of them asking me why,\u201d Haydel says, \u201cthey ask me, \u2019Oh, do you feel better?'\u201d",
      "Many friends told her they\u2019re considering avoiding alcohol themselves.",
      "Sobriety has been having a moment, says Jessica Jeboult, founder of the website and online community A Sober Girl\u2019s Guide.",
      "\u201cThis is the ultimate time to rediscover or change your relationship with alcohol,\u201d she says. With so many alcohol-free products available and growing awareness about the benefits of staying sober, \u201cthere is maximum support.\u201d",
      "If you are planning to stay sober this holiday season, here are tips from sober coaches, sober bar managers and happily sober people:",
      "\u201cHaving something in your hand just ups your comfort level, because you feel like you\u2019re socializing with this thing in your hand, instead of standing there with your hands at your side,\u201d says Abby Ehmann, who owns Hekate Cafe and Elixir Lounge, a sober bar on New York City\u2019s Lower East Side.",
      "It can help to choose your alcohol-free options in advance. If you prefer something that reminds you of alcohol, sample some of the many non-alcoholic wines and beers on the market (they\u2019re not all equally tasty) and check which are on the menu at a bar or restaurant you\u2019ll be visiting.",
      "If you\u2019ll be hosting a party or attending one at someone\u2019s home, you also can mix up your own mocktail recipes in advance.",
      "\u201cTreat these drinks like they\u2019re really special,\u201d says Vermont-based chef Suzanne Podhaizer, who makes an assortment of mocktails when she entertains.",
      "Don\u2019t forget the garnish, she says: \u201cConsider putting a sugar rim on your glasses or using luster dust on top. The more you make the non-alcoholic drinks feel celebratory, the better people are going to feel.\u201d",
      "Mocktails also make great hostess gifts. Mix up a batch of your favorite recipe, pour it into a large Mason jar and tie it with a ribbon to bring with you.",
      "This year, plan to gather somewhere other than a bar. It\u2019s the perfect season \u201cto have some lovely hot chocolates, take them outdoors and go ice skating,\u201d says Kate Baily, a women\u2019s health coach in the U.K. and host of the podcast Love Sober.",
      "If you\u2019re invited to an event that is all about drinking, give yourself permission to skip it, says Adam Cannon, a real estate agent in Pittsburgh who has been sober for 18 years.",
      "In his industry, \u201cat this time of year, there\u2019s a different networking event every night of the week,\u201d Cannon says. He opts not to go if \u201costensibly, it\u2019s about networking, but it\u2019s at a bar. People are getting hammered.\u201d",
      "Even if it\u2019s your habit to stay out late, \u201cyou don\u2019t have to do what you\u2019ve always done at this particular Christmas party,\u201d Haydel says. Drop in for the first hour, then allow yourself to leave when you wish.",
      "You won\u2019t miss much. \u201cThere\u2019s a witching hour when you\u2019re out at a bar or drinking with friends,\u201d Jeboult says. \u201cWhen people get past two drinks, three drinks, the stories are the same.\u201d",
      "If need be, slip out without explanation. Whether you call it a \u201cFrench exit\u201d or an \u201cIrish goodbye,\u201d it\u2019s totally an option.",
      "If you\u2019re feeling stressed during a holiday gathering, \u201ctake a time out,\u201d Jeboult says. Escape to the bathroom, step outside for a minute or go for a walk.",
      "Snack breaks help, too. Jay Bridwell, a recovery counselor at Red Rock Behavioral Health in Oklahoma City, often uses the acronym HALT with patients in addiction recovery. If you are \u201cHungry, Angry, Lonely or Tired,\u201d he says, you may be more likely to reach for alcohol. So build in time for rest and meals.",
      "And have a plan if things get tough. Whether it\u2019s an Alcoholics Anonymous sponsor, a sober relative or a group text with healthy friends, stay connected with people who will support you, Bridwell says. You can also join an online sober group and follow sobriety-related social media accounts.",
      "Map out multiple transportation options, rather than relying on one person for a ride home from a party. You\u2019ll have less stress, and feel less motivated to temper stress with alcohol, if you have the freedom to leave when you wish.",
      "During her first sober holiday season last year, Haydel reveled in meaningful conversations and the joy of waking up feeling good each morning with clear memories of the night before.",
      "\u201cSobriety is the gift that you keep on giving to your future self over and over and over again,\u201d says Eliott Edge, who manages Hekate, the sober bar.",
      "Focus on enjoying this very real gift, Baily says. Take your time getting dressed, visualizing yourself having a great time, and imagine how you\u2019ll feel as your head hits the pillow when you get home.",
      "As a finishing touch, plan a reward for the next day. Maybe a breakfast date with a friend or a morning walk in the park that will feel especially good because you won\u2019t be hung over.",
      "\u201cYou\u2019ve got the best bits of the evening,\u201d Baily says, \u201cand there are no costs.\u201d"

      "Robert Peyser, 66, of Bellmore on Long Island, and his company, Kessler Thermometer Corp., had earlier pleaded guilty in Suffolk County court to reckless endangerment for exposing employees to mercury and not providing proper ventilation or protective equipment.",
      "The charges stemmed from an Aug. 29, 2022, mercury spill at Kessler's facility in West Babylon, the Suffolk County district attorney's office said.",
      "Four workers were diagnosed with mercury poisoning in the weeks that followed, prosecutors said.",
      "As a result of the exposure, one of the employees needed to get a pacemaker installed and another needs an oxygen tank to assist his breathing to this day, officials said.",
      "\u201cKessler Thermometer Corp. knowingly endangered the lives and health of their employees by ignoring basic safeguards to control hazardous mercury in the workplace and failed to acknowledge its employees were being sickened by mercury exposure,\u201d Kevin Sullivan, area director of the federal Occupational Safety and Health Administration, said in a statement.",
      "Peyser and the company both pleaded guilty to reckless endangerment on Oct. 18. The company was ordered to pay $75,000 in fines on top of a $97,000 civil assessment for OSHA violations.",
      "Peyser was sentenced to probation Friday and ordered to comply with all state and federal health and safety standards.",
      "A message seeking comment was sent to Michael J. Brown, the attorney representing both Peyser and the company.",
      "Exposure to mercury, a neurotoxin, can cause damage to the nervous system, lungs, kidney, heart and mental faculties.",
      "Governments that met in 2013 at the Minamata Convention on Mercury in Kumamoto, Japan set a phaseout date of 2020 for the manufacture of mercury thermometers."

      "North Carolina's highest court has ruled over some insurance claims filed by businesses that were harmed financially by the COVID-19 pandemic and the resulting 2020 government orders limiting commerce and public movement",
      "RALEIGH, N.C. -- North Carolina's Supreme Court issued mixed rulings Friday for businesses seeking financial help from the COVID-19 pandemic, declaring one insurer's policy must cover losses some restaurants and bars incurred but that another insurer's policy for a nationwide clothing store chain doesn't due to an exception.",
      "The unanimous decisions by the seven-member court in the pair of cases addressed the requirements of \u201call-risk\u201d commercial property insurance policies issued by Cincinnati and Zurich American insurance companies to the businesses.",
      "The companies who paid premiums saw reduced business and income, furloughed or laid off employees or even closed from the coronavirus and resulting 2020 state and local government orders limiting commerce and public movement. North Carolina restaurants, for example, were forced for some time to limit sales to takeout or drive-in orders.",
      "In one case, the 16 eating and drinking establishments who sued The Cincinnati Insurance Co., The Cincinnati Casualty Co. and others held largely similar policies that protected their building and personal property as well as any business income from \u201cdirect physical loss\u201d to property not excluded by their policies.",
      "Worried that coverage would be denied for claimed losses, the restaurants and bars sued and sought a court to rule that \u201cdirect physical loss\u201d also applied to government-mandated orders, a court opinion said. A trial judge sided with them, but a panel of the intermediate-level Court of Appeals disagreed, saying such claims did not have to be accepted because there was no actual physical harm to the property \u2014 only a loss of business.",
      "But state Supreme Court Associate Justice Anita Earls, writing for the court, noted he Cincinnati policies did not define \u201cdirect physical loss.\u201d Earls also noted there were no specific policy exclusions that would deny coverage for viruses or contaminants. Earls said the court favored any ambiguity toward the policyholders because a reasonable person in their positions would understand the policies include coverage for business income lost from virus-related government orders.",
      "\"It is the insurance company\u2019s responsibility to define essential policy terms and the North Carolina courts\u2019 responsibility to enforce those terms consistent with the parties\u2019 reasonable expectations,\" Earls wrote.",
      "In the other ruling, the Supreme Court said Cato Corp., which operates more than 1,300 U.S. clothing stores and is headquartered in Charlotte, was properly denied coverage through its \u201call-risk\u201d policy. Zurich American Insurance Co. had refused to cover Cato\u2019s alleged losses, and Cato sued.",
      "But while Cato sufficiently alleged a \u201cdirect physical loss of or damage\u201d to property, Earls wrote in another opinion, the policy contained a viral contamination exclusion that Zurich American proved applied in this case.",
      "The two cases were among eight related to COVID-19 claims on which the Supreme Court heard oral arguments over two days in October. The justices have yet to rule on most of those matters.",
      "The court did announce Friday that justices were equally divided about a lawsuit filed by then-University of North Carolina students seeking tuition, housing and fee refunds when in-person instruction was canceled during the 2020 spring semester. The Court of Appeals had agreed it was correct to dismiss the suit \u2014 the General Assembly had passed a law that gave colleges immunity from such pandemic-related legal claims for that semester. Only six of the justices decided the case \u2014 Associate Justice Tamara Barringer did not participate \u2014 so the 3-3 deadlock means the Court of Appeals decision stands."

    "summary": "Texas has sued a New York doctor for prescribing abortion pills to a Texas woman via telemedicine",
    "story": [
      "Texas has sued a New York doctor for prescribing abortion pills to a Texas woman via telemedicine",
      "Texas has sued a New York doctor for prescribing abortion pills to a woman near Dallas, launching one of the first challenges in the U.S. to shield laws that Democrat-controlled states passed to protect physicians after Roe v. Wade was overturned.",
      "Texas Attorney General Ken Paxton filed the lawsuit on Thursday in Collin County, and it was announced Friday.",
      "Such prescriptions, made online and over the phone, are a key reason that the number of abortions has increased across the U.S. even since state bans started taking effect. Most abortions in the U.S. involve pills rather than procedures.",
      "Mary Ruth Ziegler, a law professor at the University of California, Davis, School of Law, said a challenge to shield laws, which blue states started adopting in 2023, has been anticipated.",
      "And it could have a chilling effect on prescriptions.",
      "\u201cWill doctors be more afraid to mail pills into Texas, even if they might be protected by shield laws because they don\u2019t know if they\u2019re protected by shield laws?\u201d Ziegler said in an interview Friday.",
      "The lawsuit accuses New York Dr. Maggie Carpenter of violating Texas law by providing the drugs to a Texas patient and seeks up to $250,000. No criminal charges are involved.",
      "Texas bars abortion at all stages of pregnancy and has been one of the most aggressive states at pushing back against abortion rights. It began enforcing a state law in 2021 \u2014 even before the U.S. Supreme Court overturned Roe v. Wade and opened the door to state bans \u2014 that barred nearly all abortions by allowing citizens to sue anyone who provides an abortion or assists someone in obtaining one.",
      "Paxton said that the 20-year-old woman who received the pills ended up in a hospital with complications. It was only after that, the state said in its filing, that the man described as \u201cthe biological father of the unborn child\u201d learned of the pregnancy and the abortion.",
      "\"In Texas, we treasure the health and lives of mothers and babies, and this is why out-of-state doctors may not illegally and dangerously prescribe abortion-inducing drugs to Texas residents,\u201d Paxton said in a statement.",
      "The state said the Texas woman received a combination of two drugs that are generally used in medication abortions. Mifepristone blocks the hormone progesterone and primes the uterus to respond to the contraction-causing effect of the second drug, misoprostol. The two-drug regimen can be used to end pregnancies up through 10 weeks, but the drugs also have other uses and can help induce labor, manage miscarriages or treat hemorrhage.",
      "The Abortion Coalition for Telemedicine, where Carpenter is co-medical director and founder, said in a statement that shield laws are essential to preserving abortion access.",
      "\u201cKen Paxton is prioritizing his anti-abortion agenda over the health and well-being of women by attempting to shut down telemedicine abortion nationwide,\u201d the group said. \u201cBy threatening access to safe and effective reproductive health care, he is putting women directly in harm\u2019s way.\u201d",
      "New York Gov. Kathy Hochul and Attorney General Letitia James, both Democrats, said they would defend reproductive freedom.",
      "\u201cAs other states move to attack those who provide or obtain abortion care, New York is proud to be a safe haven for abortion access,\u201d James said in a prepared statement. \u201cWe will always protect our providers from unjust attempts to punish them for doing their job and we will never cower in the face of intimidation or threats.\u201d",
      "It was not clear what specific actions Hochul or James would take.",
      "While most Republican-controlled states began enforcing bans or tighter restrictions on abortion after Roe v. Wade was overturned, most Democratic states have adopted laws that aim to protect their residents from investigation or prosecution under other states' abortion laws. At least eight states have gone farther, offering legal protections to health care providers who prescribe abortion pills to patients in states where abortion is banned. That scenario makes up for about 10% of all abortions in the U.S., a survey for the Society of Family Planning found.",
      "The New York shield law includes a provision that allows a prescriber who is sued to countersue the plaintiff to recover damages.",
      "That makes the Texas lawsuit thorny.",
      "Even if Paxton prevails in Texas court, Ziegler said, it's unclear how that could be enforced. \u201cIs he going to go to New York to enforce it?\u201d she asked.",
      "Still, anti-abortion groups cheered the filing and abortion rights supporters derided it.",
      "Anti-abortion advocates, who legally challenged the Biden administration\u2019s prescribing rules around mifepristone, have been readying provocative and unusual ways to further limit abortion pill access when Trump takes office next year. They feel emboldened to challenge the pills\u2019 use and seek ways to restrict it under a conservative U.S. Supreme Court buttressed by a Republican-controlled Congress and White House.",
      "Earlier this year, the U.S. Supreme Court ruled that a group of anti-abortion doctors and their organizations lacked the legal standing to sue to try to have the U.S. Food and Drug Administration's approval of mifepristone rescinded. But since then, the Republican state attorneys general from Idaho, Kansas and Missouri have sought to have some of the rules around the pills tightened \u2014 including to bar telemedicine prescriptions.",
      "Also this year, Louisiana became the first state to reclassify the drugs as \u201ccontrolled dangerous substances.\u201d They can still be prescribed, but there are extra steps required to access them.",
      "Lawmakers in at least three states \u2014 Missouri, New Hampshire and Tennessee \u2014 have introduced bills for next year that would bar or restrict use of the pills.",
      "\u201cI began to think about how we might be able to both provide an additional deterrent to companies violating the criminal law and provide a remedy for the family of the unborn children,\u201d said Tennessee state Rep. Gino Bulso, who is sponsoring the legislation there targeting medications used in abortions.",

      "LONDON -- Inflation in the U.K. has risen to its highest level since March, driven by an increase in fuel prices last month, official figures showed Wednesday.",
      "The Office for National Statistics said consumer price inflation rose by 2.6% in the year to November, up from 2.3% the previous month. The increase, which took inflation further away from the Bank of England's target of 2%, was in line with market expectations.",
      "This is the biggest increase since March and the second rise in two months and will likely cement market expectations that the Bank of England will keep its main interest rate unchanged at 4.75% after its policy meeting on Thursday.",
      "Rate-setters had anticipated a pick-up in inflation when the central bank last cut rates in early November as price pressures eased earlier in the year \u2014 in September, inflation had fallen to its lowest level since April 2021.",
      "Still, inflation in the U.K. and across the world is far lower than it was a couple of years back, partly because central banks dramatically increased borrowing costs from near zero during the coronavirus pandemic when prices started to shoot up, first as a result of supply chain issues and then because of Russia\u2019s full-scale invasion of Ukraine which pushed up energy costs.",
      "As inflation rates have fallen from multidecade highs, the central banks have started cutting interest rates, though few, if any, economists think that rates will fall back to the super-low levels that persisted in the years after the global financial crisis of 2008-9.",
      "Recent developments have scaled back expectations of rapid cuts from the Bank of England.",
      "Critics have argued that the new Labour government's first budget in October will lead to higher inflation. The extra public spending announced in the budget will be largely funded through increased business taxes and borrowing. Economists think that the splurge, coupled with the prospect of businesses cushioning the tax hikes by raising prices, could push inflation higher than it otherwise would have been."

Igor Kirillov was killed Tuesday by a bomb hidden in a scooter outside his apartment building in Moscow, a day after Ukraine\u2019s security service leveled criminal charges against him.

      "The agency stated that, acting on instructions from Ukraine, the suspect traveled to Moscow, where he picked up a homemade explosive device. He then placed the device on an electric scooter and parked it at the entrance to the residential building where Kirillov lived.",
      "The suspect then rented a car to monitor the location and set up a camera that livestreamed footage from the scene to his handlers in the central Ukrainian city of Dnipro. Once Kirillov was seen leaving the building, the suspect detonated the bomb.",
      "According to the FSB\u2019s statement, the suspect faces \u201ca sentence of up to life imprisonment.\u201d",
      "Kirillov, 54, was the chief of the military\u2019s nuclear, biological and chemical protection forces and was under sanctions from several countries, including the U.K. and Canada, for his actions in Moscow's military operation in Ukraine.

      "With its roots in 10th century Ismailism, a branch of Shiite Islam, the roughly 1 million-strong minority is spread across Syria, Lebanon, Israel and the Golan Heights.",
      "Around 25,000 live in the Golan Heights, a rocky plateau seized from Syria by Israel in the 1967 Mideast war. Israel\u2019s 1981 annexation of the area is recognized only by the United States, with the rest of the world considering it occupied Syrian territory.",

      "Although Israeli citizenship is open for the Druze of the Golan Heights, most have opted not to take it, though they have residency rights.",
      "They closely maintain their Druze identity and traditions. The fall of Syrian President Bashar Assad a week ago saw people take to the streets in Majdal Shams to celebrate Assad\u2019s ouster, with the red, yellow, blue, white and green Druze flag featuring as prominently as the rebel Syrian green, white and black flag with three red stars.",
      "As the region is riven once more by upheaval and fighting, evidence of the 1967 war is still clear to see, with old trenches and abandoned tanks. A security fence, topped by coils of barbed wire, now runs along the outskirts of the town, across a field from the nearby Alpha Line.",
      "The current wars have not left Majdal Shams unscathed either. On Oct. 8, 2023, the Lebanese militant group Hezbollah began attacking Israel in solidarity with Hamas\u2019 cross-border attack the previous day, sparking nearly 14 months of fighting along Israel\u2019s northern front. On an evening in late July, a rocket struck a soccer field in Madjal Shams while children played. Twelve children, ages 10 to 16, were killed, and about 20 other people were wounded.",
      "The strike plunged the town into mourning. Five months later, soccer games have resumed in the playing field, where a small make-shift memorial with toys and teddy bears marks the spot where the rocket hit.",
      "Israel\u2019s cease-fire with Hezbollah last month brought the town a brief respite. But with Syria\u2019s Assad toppled and Syrian militant groups and Israeli troops active across the border, the residents of Majdal Shams, many of whom have relatives in Syria, now face more uncertainty and insecurity.",
      "Some families are split apart by what is known as the Alpha Line, the start of a buffer zone that separates the Israeli-controlled area of the Golan Heights from Syria. They navigate their historically Syrian identity while living under Israeli rule. Across the border in Lebanon and Syria, the Druze generally adopted Arab nationalism, including support for the Palestinian cause.",
      "Israel has also built settlements in the Golan Heights that are now home to some 25,000 Israeli Jews, and the area is a popular tourist spot for Israelis. Many flock to the mountainous region for the scenery and the local hot springs."

      "Veloso, who will turn 40 next month, was arrested in 2010 at an airport in the Indonesian city of Yogyakarta, where officials discovered about 2.6 kilograms (5.7 pounds) of heroin hidden in her luggage. The single mother of two sons was convicted and sentenced to death.",
      "Her case caused a public outcry in the Philippines. She traveled to Indonesia in 2010, where her recruiter, Maria Kristina Sergio, reportedly told her a job as a domestic worker awaited her. Sergio also allegedly provided the suitcase where the drugs were found.",

      "For decades, lanky stray dogs have scrounged for food on Brazilian streets, abandoned and overlooked",
      "SAO PAULO -- For decades, they have scrounged for food on streets across the country \u2014 undesired, abandoned and overlooked.",
      "But today, the caramel-colored mutts of Brazil are having a major moment. The \u201cvira-lata caramelo\u201d (literally: caramel trashcan-tipper) is being exalted in memes, videos, petitions, an upcoming Netflix film, a Carnival parade and draft legislation to honor it as part of Brazilian culture. Caramelos' newfound cachet speaks to the value of resilience in Brazil \u2014 a melting pot of 213 million people known for weathering hard knocks with a smile \u2014 and inverts its supposed \u201cmongrel complex.\u201d",
      "A scene from Netflix's \u201cCaramelo\u201d shot in October featured a beige puppy sitting beside a river in Sao Paulo watching picture-perfect families pass with their impeccable purebreds \u2014 a golden retriever, a miniature collie and a Doberman. At the director of photography\u2019s signal, a delivery boy cycled past and the plucky mutt gave chase, following the scent of pizza and seeking a way to get by.",
      "\u201cThe caramelo ended up becoming the great symbol of Brazil, a symbol for the people,\u201d Diego Freitas, the film's director and co-writer, said after the day's shooting. \u201cNetflix was sensitive to what\u2019s happening with the zeitgeist. The caramelo is the spirit of our time.\u201d",
      "The caramelo craze started online around 2019. People posted the tongue-in-cheek phrase, \u201cThis represents Brazil more than soccer or samba,\u201d along with photos of distinctively Brazilian phenomena, including caramelos galore. Social media accounts paid tribute to the caramelos' antics: One invaded a dance show and relieved itself on stage; another played dead while receiving chest compressions for a CPR training video. Online retailers started hawking caramelo-shaped throw pillows.",
      "A petition to replace the macaw on Brazil\u2019s 10-reais ($1.65) bill garnered 50,000 signatures in 2019.",
      "\u201cThe caramelo has established itself as a landmark of the Brazilian people, being well loved and received in all states of the country, being an excellent representative of our culture,\u201d it proclaimed. \u201cTherefore it deserves mention on our currency.\u201d",
      "The next year, another petition to emblazon the medium-sized dog on the 200-reais note received triple the support.",
      "Many cite kindness as the caramelos' secret charm, but more often say it's that they're savvy survivors.",
      "Case in point is a caramelo in the northeastern city Joao Pessoa. Last year, Khelson Silva, 59, left the gym with a friend and found the stray waiting. It took Silva's friend\u2019s finger gingerly between its teeth and led them for three blocks.",
      "\u201cHe got to my building, walked straight into the garage, went up the elevator and right into the house,\u201d said Silva, who learned this caramelo, now named Persistent Jos\u00e9, had attempted similar gambits before. \u201cIt was him who chose us. He knew where we lived.\u201d",
      "Writer Nelson Rodrigues coined the now-infamous term \u201cmongrel complex\u201d after the national soccer team\u2019s humiliating World Cup defeat in 1950, aiming to encapsulate what he perceived as Brazil\u2019s sense of inferiority compared to other nations. Today, many see Brazil\u2019s diverse roots \u2014 immigrants, enslaved Africans and Indigenous people \u2014 as a source of pride.",
      "Tina Castro, an English teacher in Rio de Janeiro, equates owning a caramelo with loving the \u201ccrazy mixture\" of Brazil and its people.",
      "\u201cIt comes from a marginal place, like Brazil. It has a history of survival and marginalization,\" said Castro, 32. \"We value the caramelo in the way we value our country, as it is.\u201d",
      "\u201cCaramelos will dominate the world!\u201d has become a jokey rallying cry online, and foreign allies are lending a hand. After touring Brazil in November, singer Bruno Mars posed with a caramelo in his viral farewell video. Staff of the British mission to Brazil overwhelmingly voted in July to christen their new digital mascot, a Welsh Corgi, \u201cLord Caramelo.\u201d",
      "The budget for Netflix's \u201cCaramelo\u201d is part of 1 billion reais ($164 million) spent from 2023-24 on Brazilian productions to capture eyeballs in one of the world\u2019s biggest video streaming markets. Netflix hasn\u2019t set a release date.",
      "\"The movie is a big bet for Netflix, a superproduction,\u201d Netflix Brasil's press office told The Associated Press. \u201cIt\u2019s the first Brazilian film with a dog as a protagonist, and it couldn\u2019t be any other than the caramelo, a national icon.\u201d",
      "Others catapulting the caramelo into the spotlight include Rio's Sao Clemente samba school. At its three-story workshop downtown on Nov. 28, seamstresses churned out strips of sheer yellow fabric for dozens of towering caramelo costumes. Each will feature a giant foam head in the school\u2019s 2025 Carnival parade, whose theme is animal abandonment and abuse.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s our starlet,\u201d gushed workshop director Roberto Gomes. \u201cThe caramelo is the beautiful, likeable little dog \u2014 not the purebred. It\u2019s the cutie, that dog that\u2019s always funny, always in our hearts.\u201d",
      "A few blocks away, Lt. Col. Sidnei Robson Pazini says Brazilians are merely rediscovering long-lost devotion. He directs the Rio military police's museum and archive, and says the \u201cmost iconic, most emblematic\u201d piece \u2014 more than the muskets, cannon or painting worth almost $1 million \u2014 is a taxidermied caramelo that's about 150 years old.",
      "The dog often visited a Rio police battalion for food \u2014 earning the name Bruto \u2014 then joined officers shipping off to war in Paraguay, despite efforts to stop him boarding. Bruto alerted troops to approaching enemies, signaled where soldiers needed rescue and, after surviving a gunshot, returned to Rio a hero. When he died, police took up a collection to have him stuffed, with a silver collar bearing the words \u201cConstancy, Love and Fidelity.\u201d",
      "Street dogs still find succor inside police battalions. One in Rio adopted a caramelo in 2018 and gave him the rank of corporal. At a ceremony in July, he was promoted to sergeant.",
      "Amid this caramelo hype, one might think Brazilians would be jostling to adopt their own. But volunteers at two shelters told the AP they still get passed over for smaller, fluffier or whiter dogs.",
      "The Indefesos shelter in Rio had 217 dogs on Dec. 12 \u2014 about half caramelos. One clambers over a 6-foot wall to welcome visitors, his favorite ball in his mouth.",
      "Whenever Indefesos receives a litter with caramelos, volunteers scramble to post Instagram photos. Caramelo puppies are inevitably picked last.",
      "\u201cIt's absurd. We rush because we know that animal, when it grows up, will never have the chance for a home,\u201d said Rosana Guerra, the nonprofit\u2019s president. \u201cThey end up staying, waiting for adoption that never comes.\u201d",
      "In the Netflix film, the stray scampers into the hectic life of a career-driven chef and helps him find meaning in the present. Freitas, the director, said he aims for it to touch Brazilians\u2019 hearts and transform caramelo affinity into action.",
      "The puppy that pursued the delivery boy that gray October day had been found in a box beside a highway with its nine siblings. Four play the young version of the film's 1-year-old star that was also a stray. Since filming wrapped Nov. 26, six of the film's once-homeless canines were adopted by crew members and others.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s a story that I hope is worthy of the dogs, because they are incredible,\u201d Freitas said, with his own caramelo \u2014 the film\u2019s inspiration \u2014 at his feet. \u201cThey change our lives.\u201d"

      "AVIGNON, France -- French judges plan to deliver hugely anticipated verdicts this week in a historic drugging-and-rape trial that has turned the victim, Gis\u00e8le Pelicot, into a feminist hero.",
      "Everything about the trial in the southern French city of Avignon has been exceptional, most of all Pelicot herself.",
      "She has been the epitome of steely dignity and resilience through the more than three months of appalling testimony, including extracts from her now ex-husband's sordid library of homemade abuse videos.",
      "Dominique Pelicot carefully catalogued how he habitually tranquilized his wife of 50 years during their last decade together, so he and dozens of strangers he met online could rape her while she was unconscious.",
      "Staggeringly, Dominique Pelicot found it easy to recruit his alleged accomplices. Many had jobs. Most are fathers. They came from all walks of life, with the youngest in his 20s and the oldest in their 70s. In all, 50 men, including Dominique Pelicot, stood trial for aggravated rape and attempted rape. Another man was tried for aggravated sexual assault.",
      "\u201cThey regarded me like a rag doll, like a garbage bag,\" Gis\u00e8le P\u00e9licot testified in court.",
      "Sifting through the charges, the evidence, the backgrounds of the accused and their defenses took so long that Dominique and Gis\u00e8le Pelicot had birthdays during the trial, with both turning 72.",
      "The verdicts are expected Thursday, or Friday at the latest, with the five judges ruling by secret ballot. Campaigners against sexual violence are hoping for exemplary prison sentences and view the trial as a possible turning point in the fight against rape culture and the use of drugs to subdue victims.",
      "At protests during the trial, demonstrators held up pop-art images of Gis\u00e8le Pelicot with her bob haircut and round sunglasses, along with slogans such as, \u201cShame is changing sides\u201d and \u201cGis\u00e8le, we believe you !\u201d They also booed defendants as they entered the courthouse yelling, \u201cWe recognize you\u201d and \u201cShame.\u201d",
      "Dominique Pelicot's meticulous recording and cataloguing of the encounters \u2014 police found more than 20,000 photos and videos on his computer drives, in folders titled \u201cabuse,\u201d \u201cher rapists\u201d or \u201cnight alone\u201d \u2014 provided police investigators with an abundance of evidence and helped lead them to the defendants. That also set the case apart from many others in which sexual violence is unreported or isn't prosecuted because the evidence isn't as strong.",
      "Gis\u00e8le Pelicot and her lawyers fought successfully for shocking video and other evidence to be heard and watched in open court, to show that she bore no shame and was clearly unconscious during the alleged rapes, undermining some defendants' claims that she might have been feigning sleep or even have been a willing participant.",
      "Her courage \u2014 one woman, alone, against dozens of men \u2014 proved inspirational. Supporters, mostly women, lined up early each day for a place in the courthouse or to cheer and thank Gis\u00e8le Pelicot as she walked in and out \u2014 stoic, humble, and gracious but also cognizant that her ordeal resonated beyond Avignon and France.",
      "She said she was fighting for \"all those people around the world, women and men, who are victims of sexual violence.\u201d",
      "\u201cLook around you: You are not alone,\u201d she said.",
      "Dominique Pelicot testified that he hid tranquilizers in food and drink that he gave his wife, knocking her out so profoundly that he could do what he wanted to her for hours.",
      "In his medical records, police investigators found that he had been prescribed hundreds of tranquilizer tablets as well as the the erectile dysfunction drug Viagra. He told police that he started drugging his wife in 2011, before they left the Paris region to retire in Mazan, a small town in Provence where he invited other men to rape her in their bedroom.",
      "In the videos, police investigators counted 72 different abusers but weren't able to identify them all. Dominique Pelicot told investigators that he also shared advice with people about drugging techniques and provided tranquilizers to others, too.",
      "Gis\u00e8le Pelicot told investigators that blackouts she suffered grew more frequent after they retired to Mazan in 2013, but that they stopped after her then-husband was taken into custody in 2020.",
      "Spurred on by the trial, France's government this month helped roll out a media campaign alerting the public to the dangers of chemical submission, with a number for victims to call. The campaign poster reads: \u201cChemical submission takes away your memories but leaves traces.\u201d",
      "Although some of the accused \u2014 including Dominique Pelicot \u2014 acknowledged they were guilty of rape, many did not, even in the face of video evidence. The hearings have sparked wider debate in France about whether the country's legal definition of rape should be expanded to include specific mention of consent.",
      "Some defendants argued that Dominique Pelicot's consent covered his wife, too. Some sought to excuse their behavior by insisting that they hadn't intended to rape anyone when they responded to the husband's invites. Some laid blame at his door, saying he misled them into thinking they were partaking in consensual kink. And some suggested that perhaps he had also drugged them \u2014 which Dominique Pelicot denied.",
      "Campaigners refused to buy it. \"A rape is a rape\" read a large banner hung opposite the courthouse.",
      "Prosecutor Laure Chabaud appealed to the judges for a verdict that will make clear \u201cthat ordinary rape doesn't exist, that accidental or involuntary rape doesn't exist,\" according to French media that followed the daily proceedings.",
      "What Gis\u00e8le Pelicot initially described as a happy marriage to \u201ca great guy\u201d started to unravel in September 2020, when a supermarket security guard caught Dominique Pelicot surreptitiously filming up women\u2019s skirts.",
      "Police investigators called her in for questioning and confronted her with the unfathomable \u2014 some of her husband\u2019s secret photos of her.",
      "She left him, taking just two suitcases, \u201call that was left for me of 50 years of life together.\u201d",
      "Prosecutors have asked for the maximum possible penalty \u2014 20 years \u2014 for Dominique Pelicot, and sentences of 10-18 years for the others tried on rape charges.",
      "\u201cTwenty years between the four walls of a prison,\u201d Chabaud, the prosecutor, said. \u201cIt\u2019s both a lot and not enough.\u201d",

      "But in Tuesday\u2019s visit to the Syrian side of the buffer zone, Netanyahu made clear that Israel plans on staying for some time.

      "Here is a closer look at the evolution of Israel\u2019s borders over the years.",

      "Nissan\u2019s share price soared more than 22% in Tokyo after reports citing unnamed sources said it might merge with Honda to form the world\u2019s third-largest automaking group. Honda\u2019s share price fell as much as 3%.",
      "The reports said that Nissan alliance member Mitsubishi Motors Corp. was included in the talks.",
      "All three Japanese automakers announced in August that they planned to share components for electric vehicles like batteries and jointly research software for autonomous driving to adapt better to dramatic changes in the auto industry centered around electrification. A preliminary agreement between Honda, Japan's second-largest automaker, and Nissan, third largest, was announced in March.",

      "\u201cI am certainly not guilty and I\u2019ll be presenting my account to a jury,\u201d Jones said. \u201cThese allegations are all either baseless or they distort the truth.\u201d",

      "\u201cWe are very sorry that we could not achieve as far as a final stage of the mission,\u201d Space One President Masakazu Toyoda told a news conference Wednesday. \u201cWe don't consider this a failure because we are getting valuable data that will help our pursuit toward a next challenge.\u201d",
      "He said he hoped to find the cause to address the problems as soon as possible to achieve a success next time.",
      "Company executive and space engineer Mamoru Endo said the abnormality in the first stage engine nozzle or its control system is likely to have caused an unstable flight of the rocket, which started spiraling in midflight and eventually destroyed itself about three minutes after liftoff, using its autonomous safety mechanism.",

      "Wednesday's flight, postponed twice from Saturday because of strong winds, came nine months after a failed debut flight in March, when the rocket was intentionally exploded five seconds after takeoff.

      "WELLINGTON, New Zealand -- Vanuatu's capital was without water on Wednesday, a day after reservoirs were destroyed by a violent magnitude 7.3 earthquake that wrought havoc on the South Pacific island nation, with the number of people killed and injured expected to rise.",
      "The government's disaster management office said early Wednesday that 14 deaths were confirmed, but hours later said nine had been verified by the main hospital. The number was \u201cexpected to increase\" as people remained trapped in fallen buildings, a spokesperson said. About 200 have been treated for injuries.",
      "Frantic rescue efforts that began at flattened buildings after the quake hit early Tuesday afternoon continued 30 hours later, with dozens working in dust and heat with little water to seek those yelling for help inside. A few more survivors were extracted from the rubble of downtown buildings in Port Vila, also the country's largest city, while others remained trapped and some were found dead.",
      "A near-total telecommunications collapse meant people struggled to confirm their relatives' safety. Some providers began to reestablish phone service but connections were patchy.",
      "Internet service had not been restored because the submarine cable supplying it was damaged, the operator said.",
      "The earthquake hit at a depth of 57 kilometers (35 miles) and was centered 30 kilometers (19 miles) west of the capital of Vanuatu, a group of 80 islands home to about 330,000 people. A tsunami warning was called off less than two hours after the quake, but dozens of large aftershocks continued to rattle the country.",
      "The Asia-Pacific head of the International Federation of Red Cross, Katie Greenwood, speaking to The Associated Press from Fiji, said it was not clear how many people were still missing or killed.",
      "\u201cWe have anecdotal information coming from people at the search and rescue site that are fairly confident that unfortunately those numbers will rise,\u201d she said.",
      "The capital\u2019s main medical facility, Vila Central Hospital, was badly damaged and patients were moved to a military camp. Clement Chipokolo, Vanuatu country director at the Christian relief agency World Vision, said health care services, already strained before the quake, were overwhelmed.",
      "While power was out in swathes of Port Vila, the biggest fear among aid agencies was the lack of water. Two large reservoirs serving the capital were totally decimated, the National Disaster Management Office said.",
      "Resident Milroy Cainton said people were joining large queues to buy water in stores, but could only purchase two or four bottles at a time. \u201cPeople are not really concerned about electricity, they're just concerned about water,\u201d he said.",
      "UNICEF was recording a rise in diarrhea among children, a sign that they had begun to drink tainted water, said the chief of the Vanuatu office, Eric Durpaire. Officials told residents of areas where water had been restored to boil it.",
      "At least 10 buildings sustained major damage, many in a busy downtown area full of lunchtime shoppers when the quake hit. An unknown number of people were trapped inside, and Cainton, the resident, said rescuers had been forced to target their efforts to where they believed people could be saved.",
      "Michael Thompson, who runs a tourism business in Vanuatu, was among the rescuers and posted a video on Facebook of the frenzied efforts and dust-covered survivors on gurneys along with pleas for people to bring tools and water to the site.",
      "Officials said Wednesday night that Port Vila appeared to be the worst-hit area, but some nearby villages and offshore islands had experienced landslides. Three bridges were \u201cat high risk of collapse\u201d in heavy rain, the government said.",
      "A building housing a number of diplomatic missions in Port Vila \u2014 including those of the United States, Britain, France and New Zealand \u2014 was destroyed, with a section of the building cleaving off and flattening the first floor. Windows were buckled and walls crumbled.",
      "The U.S. State Department said its embassy staff were safe, but the building was no longer functional. The office opened in July as part of a push by the U.S. to expand its Pacific presence to counter China\u2019s influence in the region.",
      "New Zealand\u2019s foreign ministry said officials have accounted for all embassy staff. Australia\u2019s foreign ministry said its workers were safe.",
      "Damage to the seaport and airport is likely to hamper aid efforts and economic recovery in a country dependent on agricultural exports and tourism. The airport was closed to commercial flights for a further 72 hours from Wednesday.",
      "But the runway was deemed functional for humanitarian flights by French engineers who arrived by helicopter. Military craft from Australia and New Zealand were due to begin arriving Wednesday night, carrying search and rescue personnel and equipment, as well as relief supplies.",
      "Dan McGarry, a journalist living in Vanuatu, said there had been a \u201cmassive landslide\u201d at the international shipping terminal. The government said the main wharf was closed.",
      "Vanuatu\u2019s position on a subduction zone \u2014 where the Indo-Australian tectonic plate moves beneath the Pacific Plate \u2014 means earthquakes of greater than magnitude 6 are not uncommon, and the country\u2019s buildings are intended to withstand quake damage.",

      "TORONTO -- The premier of Canada's most populous province said Tuesday President-elect Donald Trump's plan to impose sweeping 25% tariffs on all Canadian products would be a \"disaster\" that would hurt U.S. stock markets.",
      "Ontario Premier Doug Ford also said in an interview with The Associated Press that he's \u201cextremely worried\u201d about Trump's plan to launch a mass deportation of millions of undocumented people. Ford said he has a plan to send hundreds of police officers to the border if they come north.",
      "Ford said tariffs won't work considering how integrated the U.S. and Canadian economies are. He noted that in the auto sector alone parts and go back and forth between Canada-U.S. border seven or eight times before being assembled in Ontario or Michigan.",
      "\u201cIt is so integrated. I don't even know how you separate that in the supply chain. It would be a disaster,\u201d Ford told the AP. \u201cIt will affect the market. The market will drop and we have every CEO saying that is not the way to go.\"",
      "Ford said the market consequences will get Trump's attention.",
      "\"I know he has many scorecards, but one is the stock market. It will affect the market, the market will drop,\u201d Ford said.",
      "Brian Hughes, a Trump-Vance transition spokesperson, said in response to Ford's comments that \u201cPresident Trump has promised tariff policies that protect working Americans from the unfair practices of foreign companies and foreign markets.\u201d",
      "Ford said he's also very worried about Trump\u2019s mass deportation plan. Trump has talked about creating \u201cthe largest mass deportation program in history,\u201d calling for using the National Guard and mobilizing domestic police forces.",
      "\u201cI am extremely concerned,\" Ford said. \u201cWe do have a plan ready. We have hundreds of provincial police officers that are ready within hours, if not immediately, to hit the borders.\u201d",
      "Ford said a combination of local police, provincial police and the federal government will all be working together. \u201cWe\u2019ll make sure that we tighten up that border like we\u2019ve never seen before,\" he said.",
      "Trump has threatened to impose 25% tariffs on all Canadian goods if Canada and Mexico do not stem the flow of migrants and fentanyl from entering the U.S. border \u2014 even though far fewer of each crosses into the U.S. from Canada than from Mexico.",
      "Ford made the comments shortly after Canada's federal government announced some more details about a billion dollar border plan that's designed to avert the tariffs. Canada's national police plans to create a new aerial intelligence task force to provide round-the-clock surveillance of Canada\u2019s border using helicopters, drones and surveillance towers.",

By adding new scanners and sniffer dog teams to stop and seize fentanyl. By cracking down on the money laundering that\u2019s funding cross-border crime,\u201d Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau said in a post on X.",
      "Trudeau is under pressure from some of his own lawmakers to resign after his finance minister quit cabinet. Ford said it\u2019s up to Trudeau to resign and said Canada\u2019s provincial premiers are united in telling the Americans how important U.S-Canada trade is.",
      "Ford reiterated he would restrict electricity exports to Michigan, New York and Minnesota if the sweeping tariffs are imposed.",
      "\u201cI want to sell them more energy, more critical minerals, but I\u2019m going to always keep every tool in our tool box available\u201d Ford said. \u201cThat\u2019s the the last thing I want to do. We have the energy. They need the energy.\u201d",
      "About 60% of U.S. crude oil imports are from Canada, and 85% of U.S. electricity imports as well.",
      "Canada is also the largest foreign supplier of steel, aluminum and uranium to the U.S. and has 34 critical minerals and metals that the Pentagon is eager for.",
      "Nearly $3.6 billion Canadian ($2.7 billion) worth of goods and services cross the border each day. Canada is the top export destination for 36 U.S. states.",
      "Ford said he spoke with the governors of Michigan and New York and they \u201cfully understand.\u201d Michigan is Ontario\u2019s top trading partner.",
      "\u201cWe want to sit down and explain to Trump and inform him that we aren\u2019t the enemy,\" Ford said. \u201cAnd as for Mexico I want to do a bilateral trade deal directly with the U.S.\u201d",
      "Flows of migrants and seizures of drugs at the two countries\u2019 border are vastly different. U.S. customs agents seized 43 pounds of fentanyl at the Canadian border during the last fiscal year, compared with 21,100 pounds at the Mexican border.",
      "Most of the fentanyl reaching the U.S. \u2014 where it causes about 70,000 overdose deaths annually \u2014 is made by Mexican drug cartels using precursor chemicals smuggled from Asia.",

      "Tens of thousands of Syrians are believed to be buried in mass graves scattered around the country, victims of the security agencies of ousted President Bashar Assad",
      "NAJHA, Syria -- Bones are visible here and there among the mounds of earth in a field south of Damascus, one of the mass graves around Syria believed to hold the bodies of tens of thousands of people killed under Bashar Assad\u2019s rule. With his ouster, residents, forensic teams and international groups face what could be a yearslong task of unearthing the dead.",
      "In this site alone, by the town of Najha, several tens of thousands of bodies could have been buried, said Stephen Rapp, a former U.S. ambassador-at-large for war crimes issues who was visiting the site Tuesday. Some are believed buried under already existing graves of a regular cemetery nearby, he said.",
      "It's too soon to start digging, and it's unknown how many bodies remain there or if some were moved over the years. But here and there, bones were visible, including some vertebrae from a human spine and fragments of a femur.",
      "Rapp is working with two organizations that aim to help document mass graves and identify officials implicated in war crimes \u2014 the Commission for International Justice and Accountability and the Syria Emergency Task Force. They and other groups have for years been remotely gathering witness testimonies and satellite imagery to track and estimate the size of mass graves that swelled from crackdowns by Assad's feared security agencies, particularly in the early years of Syria's civil war that began in 2011.",
      "With Assad's fall 10 days ago, they are now able to see them firsthand. That gives the chance to \"really corroborate what we already know about the machinery of death that was maintained and operated by the Assad regime,\u201d Rapp said.",
      "\u201cIt is all so unthinkable that this is happening in the 21st Century.\u201d",
      "More than 150,000 Syrians remain unaccounted for after disappearing into Assad's prisons and most are believed to be in mass graves around the country, said Mounir al-Mustafa, deputy director of the White Helmets, a Syrian search and rescue team.",
      "An array of prisons run by the military, intelligence and security agencies were notorious for systematic torture, mass executions and brutal conditions that killed other inmates from disease and starvation, according to human rights groups, whistle-blowers, and former detainees.",
      "The White Helmets have received reports of at least 13 mass grave sites around the country, eight of them near Damascus, including Najha, al-Mustafa said.",
      "\u201cWe can\u2019t open these mass graves yet. That is a massive task to document and take samples and give codes to the corpses before we can identify those people,\u201d he said.",
      "The priority is to take stock of the unidentified bodies above ground, those in hospital morgues and in clashes, al-Mustafa said.",
      "Rapp, who arrived in Syria on Monday, visited another suspected grave site, in al-Qutayfah, 37 kilometers (23 miles) north of the capital. He plans to meet with officials from the new transitional government installed since the lightning offensive on Damascus on Dec. 8 that forced Assad to flee the country. He intends to discuss ways to secure and eventually excavate the sites, gather samples from remains for identification and preserve thousands of documents discovered in many security branches and prisons.",
      "\u201cThere needs to be a process. That is what I will be engaging with government representatives about,\u201d Rapp said. He said he will also see what the international community can do to assist the government in criminal prosecutions and in ensuring they meet international standards.",
      "On Monday, residents and medical teams began on their own digging up a mass grave in the village of Izraa in southern Daraa province. The remains of over 30 corpses were uncovered, and the teams estimated the total number could reach 70.",
      "Moussa Al-Zouebi, the head of the village\u2019s health directorate, said some of the people whose remains were uncovered were executed by \u201cshooting in the head, in the eye, or by burning.\u201d A local forensic team and rebel fighters handled bags of human remains as an excavator rumbled in the background, while relatives stood by.",
      "Relatives said they initially had hopes that they would find their loved ones in a prison. \u201cBut we didn\u2019t find anyone and it broke our hearts. They were burned alive here after being doused in fuel,\u201d Mohammad Ghazaleh said at the mass grave site.",
      "The new authorities in Damascus have designated a hotline for people and ex-prisoners to identify locations and secret prisons used by Assad\u2019s government to find any trace of missing persons. The insurgents have freed thousands of prisoners in Damascus and other cities, including Aleppo, Homs and Hama.",
      "\u201cIt is understandable that the desperate family members will try to go to a site hoping that they find some sign of their relatives, some information,\u201d Rapp said. He said the same is happening with documents found at sites. \u201cAlthough that is understandable, it can be damaging to an investigation,\" he said.",
      "Rapp said the process of securing and cataloguing documents could take up to three months but identifying those buried in mass graves could take more than two years."

      "The Office for National Statistics said consumer price inflation rose by 2.6% in the year to November, up from 2.3% the previous month. The increase, which took inflation further away from the Bank of England's target of 2%, was in line with market expectations.",

      "Rate-setters had anticipated a pick-up in inflation when the central bank last cut rates in early November as price pressures eased earlier in the year \u2014 in September, inflation had fallen to its lowest level since April 2021.",
      "Still, inflation in the U.K. and across the world is far lower than it was a couple of years back, partly because central banks dramatically increased borrowing costs from near zero during the coronavirus pandemic when prices started to shoot up, first as a result of supply chain issues and then because of Russia\u2019s full-scale invasion of Ukraine which pushed up energy costs.",
      "As inflation rates have fallen from multidecade highs, the central banks have started cutting interest rates, though few, if any, economists think that rates will fall back to the super-low levels that persisted in the years after the global financial crisis of 2008-9.",
      "Recent developments have scaled back expectations of rapid cuts from the Bank of England.",
      "Critics have argued that the new Labour government's first budget in October will lead to higher inflation. The extra public spending announced in the budget will be largely funded through increased business taxes and borrowing. Economists think that the splurge, coupled with the prospect of businesses cushioning the tax hikes by raising prices, could push inflation higher than it otherwise would have been."

      "\u201cEven though there\u2019s a negative impact, in terms of potentially alienating some of their customers that might not be fans of Trump, the benefits far outweigh any negatives when it comes to having a right-hand seat next to Trump in the White House,\u201d said Dan Ives, an analyst at Wedbush Securities.",
      "Ross Gerber, CEO of Gerber Kawasaki Wealth and Investment Management, identified himself as an investor in Musk's Tesla and a driver of Tesla\u2019s new Cybertruck, the futuristic pickup that has gotten huge amounts of attention but also been the subject of safety concerns and multiple recalls.",

      "Instead, said one political strategist, Musk is the ideal validator for someone who cultivates an image of success in business and who has stocked his Cabinet and key adviser roles with billionaires.",

I think having Musk with him is his double-down on this business success, good-for-the-economy, good-for-everybody-making money kind of persona,\u201d said Christine Matthews, a national political pollster who has worked for Republicans. \u201cIn this case, Musk is seen as this successful, innovative, tech entrepreneur, frontier-buster.\u201d",
      "Musk also has at his disposal X, the social media platform formerly known as Twitter that he purchased and turned into a megaphone for conservative ideas. And having spent an estimated $250 million to support Trump in the election, Musk has signaled he is willing to back Republican primary challenges to GOP members in the House and Senate seeking reelection in 2026 who waver on Trump's appointments and agenda.",
      "Trump has tasked him with leading a group to reduce the size of the federal government and reduce the rulemaking authority of the federal bureaucracy.",
      "Tesla stands to make significant gains under a Trump administration with the threat of diminished subsidies for alternative energy and electric vehicles doing the most harm to smaller competitors. Trump\u2019s plans for extensive tariffs on Chinese imports make it less likely that Chinese EVs will be sold in bulk in the U.S. anytime soon.",
      "Some analysts believe the billionaire\u2019s role will create a very friendly landscape for Tesla over the coming years.

      "Tesla shares closed at a record high on Tuesday, with much of the company\u2019s recent gains coming after Trump\u2019s victory.

      "The S&P 500 is on track for one of its best years since the millennium, up nearly 27%, because the U.S. economy has remained remarkably resilient, hopes are high that President-elect Donald Trump\u2019s policies will boost growth but not inflation too badly and the Federal Reserve has begun to make things easier by cutting interest rates from a two-decade high.",

      "A report on Tuesday showed sales at U.S. retailers strengthened by more  last month than economists expected. That could be an indication of an economy that doesn\u2019t need much more help from easier interest rates. While lower rates can goose the economy, they can also give inflation more fuel.",

      "Federal Reserve officials on Wednesday will likely signal a slower pace of interest rate cuts next year compared with the past few months, which would mean that Americans might enjoy only slight relief from still-high borrowing costs for mortgages, aut...",
      "WASHINGTON -- Federal Reserve officials on Wednesday will likely signal a slower pace of interest rate cuts next year compared with the past few months, which would mean that Americans might enjoy only slight relief from still-high borrowing costs for mortgages, auto loans and credit cards.",
      "The Fed is set to announce a quarter-point cut to its benchmark rate, from about 4.6% to roughly 4.3%. The latest move would follow a larger-than-usual half-point rate cut in September and a quarter-point reduction in November.",
      "Wednesday's meeting, though, could mark a shift to a new phase in the Fed's policies: Instead of a rate cut at each meeting, the Fed is more likely to cut at every other meeting \u2014 at most. The central bank's policymakers may signal that they expect to reduce their key rate just two or three times in 2025, rather than the four rate cuts they had envisioned three months ago.",
      "So far, the Fed has explained its moves by describing them as a \u201crecalibration\u201d of the ultra-high rates that were intended to tame inflation, which reached a four-decade high in 2022. With inflation now much lower \u2014 at 2.3% in October, according to the Fed's preferred gauge, down from a peak of 7.2% in June 2022 \u2014 many Fed officials argue that interest rates don't need to be so high.",
      "But inflation has remained stuck above the Fed's 2% target in recent months while the economy has continued to grow briskly. On Tuesday, the government's monthly report on retail sales showed that Americans, particularly those with higher incomes, are still willing to spend freely. To some analysts, those trends raise the risk that further rate cuts could deliver an excessively strong boost to the economy and, in doing so, keep inflation elevated.",
      "On top of that, President-elect Donald Trump has proposed a range of tax cuts \u2014 on Social Security benefits, tipped income and overtime income \u2014 as well as a scaling-back of regulations. Collectively, these moves could stimulate growth. At the same time, Trump has threatened to impose a variety of tariffs and to seek mass deportations of migrants, which could accelerate inflation.",
      "Chair Jerome Powell and other Fed officials have said they won't be able to assess how Trump's policies might affect the economy or their own rate decisions until more details are made available and it becomes clearer how likely it is that the president-elect's proposals will actually be enacted. Until then, the outcome of the presidential election has mostly heightened the uncertainty surrounding the economy.",
      "Either way, it appears unlikely that Americans will enjoy much lower borrowing costs anytime soon. The average 30-year mortgage rate was 6.6% last week, according to mortgage giant Freddie Mac, below the peak of 7.8% reached in October 2023. But the roughly 3% mortgage rates that existed for nearly a decade before the pandemic aren't going to return in the foreseeable future.",
      "Fed officials have underscored that they are slowing their rate reductions as their benchmark rate nears a level that policymakers refer to as \u201cneutral\u201d \u2014 the level that neither spurs nor hinders the economy.",
      "\u201cGrowth is definitely stronger than we thought, and inflation is coming in a little higher,\u201d Powell said recently. \u201cSo the good news is, we can afford to be a little more cautious as we try to find neutral.\"",
      "Most other central banks around the world are also cutting their benchmark rates. Last week, the European Central Bank lowered its key rate for the fourth time this year to 3% from 3.25%, as inflation in the 20 countries that use the euro has fallen to 2.3% from a peak of 10.6% in late 2022.",

      "Luigi Mangione already was charged with murder in the Dec. 4 killing of Brian Thompson, but the terror allegation is new.",
      "Manhattan District Attorney Alvin Bragg said Thompson's death on a midtown Manhattan street \u201cwas a killing that was intended to evoke terror. And we\u2019ve seen that reaction.\"",
      "Mangione\u2019s New York lawyer, Karen Friedman Agnifilo, declined to comment.",
      "Thompson, 50, was shot while walking to a hotel where Minnesota-based UnitedHealthcare \u2014 the United States' biggest medical insurer \u2014 was holding an investor conference.",
      "The killing kindled a fiery outpouring of resentment toward U.S. health insurance companies, as Americans swapped stories online and elsewhere of being denied coverage, left in limbo as doctors and insurers disagreed, and stuck with sizeable bills.",
      "The shooting also rattled C-suites, as \u201cwanted\u201d posters with other health care executives\u2019 names and faces appeared on New York streets and some social media users extolled Mangione's deed as payback.",
      "New York Police Commissioner Jessica Tisch said Tuesday that \"any attempt to rationalize this is vile, reckless and offensive to our deeply held principles of justice.\u201d",
      "A New York law passed after the Sept. 11 attacks allows prosecutors to charge crimes as acts of terrorism when they're \u201cintended to intimidate or coerce a civilian population, influence the policies of a unit of government by intimidation or coercion and affect the conduct of a unit of government by murder, assassination or kidnapping.\u201d",
      "Prosecutors have applied the statute to various contexts. Some related to international extremism, but the law was first used against a Bronx gang member after a hail of gunfire killed a 10-year-old girl and paralyzed a man outside a christening party in 2002. The state's highest court later said the conduct didn\u2019t amount to terrorism, and a retrial produced convictions on other charges.",
      "Thompson's killing, Bragg noted, happened early on a workday in an area frequented by commuters, businesspeople and tourists.",
      "\u201cThis was a frightening, well-planned, targeted murder that was intended to cause shock and attention and intimidation,\u201d the district attorney said.",
      "After days of intense police searches and publicity, Mangione was spotted Dec. 9 at a McDonald\u2019s in Altoona, Pennsylvania, and arrested. New York police officials have said Mangione was carrying the gun used to kill Thompson, a passport and various fake IDs, including one that the suspected shooter presented to check into a New York hostel.",
      "The 26-year-old was charged with Pennsylvania gun and forgery offenses and locked up there without bail. His Pennsylvania lawyer has questioned the evidence for the forgery charge and the legal grounding for the gun charge. The attorney also has said Mangione would fight extradition to New York.",
      "Mangione has two court hearings scheduled for Thursday in Pennsylvania, including an extradition hearing, Bragg noted.",
      "Hours after his arrest, the Manhattan district attorney\u2019s office filed paperwork charging him with murder and other offenses. The indictment builds on that paperwork.",
      "Investigators\u2019 working theory is that Mangione, an Ivy League computer science grad from a prominent Maryland family, was propelled by anger at the U.S. health care system. A law enforcement bulletin obtained by The Associated Press last week said that when arrested, he was carrying a handwritten letter that called health insurance companies \u201cparasitic\u201d and complained about corporate greed.",
      "Mangione repeatedly posted on social media about how spinal surgery last year had eased his chronic back pain, encouraging people with similar conditions to speak up for themselves if told they just had to live with it.",
      "In a Reddit post in late April, he advised someone with a back problem to seek additional opinions from surgeons and, if necessary, say the pain made it impossible to work.",
      "\u201cWe live in a capitalist society,\u201d Mangione wrote. \u201cI\u2019ve found that the medical industry responds to these key words far more urgently than you describing unbearable pain and how it\u2019s impacting your quality of life.\u201d",
      "He was never a UnitedHealthcare client, according to the insurer.",
      "Mangione apparently cut himself off from his family and close friends in recent months. His family reported him missing in San Francisco in November.",
      "After San Francisco authorities got a tip to their New York counterparts, investigators spoke to Mangione's mother in San Francisco late on Dec. 7. In that interview, \"she said it might be something that she could see him doing,\u201d New York Police Department Chief of Detectives Joseph Kenny said Tuesday.",
      "Before the case detectives could follow up on that lead, Mangione was arrested, Kenny said.",
      "Mangione's relatives have said in a statement that they were \u201cshocked and devastated\u201d by his arrest.",
      "Thompson, who grew up on a farm in Iowa, was trained as an accountant. A married father of two high-schoolers, he had worked at the giant UnitedHealth Group for 20 years and became CEO of its insurance arm in 2021.",

      "The Register's parent Gannett Co. on Tuesday dismissed the lawsuit as meritless and said it would vigorously defend its First Amendment rights.",
      "The lawsuit continues the president-elect's campaign against media outlets he feels have wronged him. ABC this past weekend agreed to pay $15 million toward a Trump presidential library in order to settle a defamation lawsuit against George Stephanopoulos for inaccurately saying Trump had been found civilly liable for rape.",
      "The Des Moines survey, done by since-retired pollster J. Ann Selzer, was considered shocking for indicating that an earlier Trump lead in the Republican-leaning midwestern state had been erased. In the actual election, Trump won Iowa by more than 13 percentage points.",
      "\u201cThere was a perfectly good reason nobody saw this coming: because a three-point lead for Harris in deep-red Iowa was not reality,\u201d the lawsuit said. \u201cIt was election-interfering fiction.\u201d",
      "The poll increased enthusiasm among Democrats, compelled Republicans to divert campaign time and money to areas in which they were ahead, and deceived the public into thinking Democrats were doing better than they actually were, Trump charged.",
      "The lawsuit was filed late Monday in Polk County district court in Iowa. It cites Iowa consumer fraud law, and doesn't ask for specific monetary damages, but rather wants a trial jury to award triple the amount of what it determines actual damages to be.",
      "Whatever happens legally, the case could have a chilling effect beyond Iowa. Trump said in legal papers that he wanted it to deter \u201cradicals from continuing to act with corrupt intent in releasing polls manufactured for the purpose of skewing election results in favor of Democrats.\u201d",
      "Lark-Marie Anton, Des Moines Register spokeswoman, said the newspaper acknowledged the pre-election poll did not reflect Trump\u2019s ultimate margin of victory and released the data and a technical explanation.",
      "\u201cWe stand by our reporting on the matter and believe a lawsuit would be without merit,\u201d she said.",
      "Selzer did not immediately respond to a request for comment on Tuesday. But she told PBS in Iowa last week that \u201cit's not my ethic\u201d to set up a poll to deliver a specific response. She said she was mystified about what motivation people would think she had.",
      "\u201cTo suggest without a single shred of evidence that I was in cahoots with somebody, I was being paid by somebody, it's all just kind of, it's hard to pay too much attention to it except that they are accusing me of a crime,\u201d she said.",

    "published": "Tue, 17 Dec 2024 18:18:26 -0500",
    "summary": "Energy Secretary Jennifer Granholm says the incoming Trump administration should proceed cautiously as it considers proposals for new natural gas export terminals",

      "Energy Secretary Jennifer Granholm says the incoming Trump administration should proceed cautiously as it considers proposals for new natural gas export terminals",
      "WASHINGTON -- The United States should proceed cautiously as officials consider new natural gas export terminals, Energy Secretary Jennifer Granholm said Tuesday, warning the incoming Trump administration that \u201cunfettered exports\" of liquefied natural gas, or LNG, could drive up domestic prices and increase planet-warming greenhouse gas emissions.",
      "Granholm's statement came as the Energy Department released a long-awaited study on the environmental and economic impacts of natural gas exports, which have grown exponentially in the past decade. The analysis found that U.S. LNG shipments drive up domestic wholesale prices and frequently displace renewable energy sources such as wind and solar power.",
      "Increased LNG exports also would lead to higher global greenhouse gas emissions, even with use of newly developed equipment to capture and store carbon emissions, the report said.",
      "\u201cUnfettered exports of LNG would increase wholesale domestic natural gas prices by over 30%,'' costing American households an additional $100 a year by 2050, Granholm said",
      "\u201cWe have recently lived through the real-world ripple effects of increased energy prices domestically and globally since the (COVID-19) pandemic, she said, adding that an \u201cexport-induced price increase\u201d would make it harder for some families to meet basic needs.",
      "\u201cToday\u2019s publication reinforces that a business-as-usual approach (to LNG exports) is neither sustainable nor advisable,\u2033 Granholm said.",
      "The Energy Department report comes after the Biden administration paused approvals of new LNG projects in January to study the effects LNG exports have on the planet. Natural gas emits methane, a potent greenhouse gas, when burned, leaked or released.",
      "The oil and gas industry, along with Republican allies in Congress, have decried the LNG pause as unnecessary and counter-productive, and President-elect Donald Trumphas vowed to end the pause on his first day in office. The pause is on hold under a federal court order, but the Energy Department recently said it won't decide on two major LNG export projects in Louisiana until the independent Federal Energy Regulatory Commission completes environmental reviews.",
      "Trump's transition team declined direct comment on the study, but said Trump \u201cwill make America energy dominant again\" and protect U.S. energy jobs after four years of \u201cwar on American energy\" under President Joe Biden.",
      "\u201cVoters re-elected President Trump by a resounding margin, giving him a mandate to implement the promises he made on the campaign trail, including lowering energy costs for consumers,'' said spokeswoman Karoline Leavitt.",
      "Still, the study could hinder Trump\u2019s plans to immediately greenlight projects to export LNG. Trump said last week that anyone making a $1 billion investment in the United States \u201cwill receive fully expedited approvals and permits, including, but in no way limited to, all Environmental approvals.\"",
      "Environmentalists have said they will use the DOE analysis in lawsuits expected over any Trump administration approvals of LNG projects. Activists decry the multi-billion dollar export terminals as \u201cclimate bombs.\u201d",
      "LNG is especially energy intensive, since the gas must be retrieved through underground drilling, then piped to export terminals along the East and Gulf coasts. The gas is then \u201csuperchilled\u201d into a liquid that is taken by tanker ships to import terminals in Europe and Asia, where it is then reheated into gas and distributed for business and family use.",
      "The American Gas Association called the Biden administration's pause a mistake that has resulted in uncertainty for the global market, investors and America\u2019s allies around the world.",
      "\u201cThis report is a clear and inexplicable attempt to justify their grave policy error,\" said AGA president and CEO Karen Harbert. \u201cAmerica\u2019s allies are suffering from the weaponization of natural gas and energy deprivation, and any limitations on supplying life essential energy is absolutely wrong-headed.\"",
      "Harbert said the industry group looks forward to working with the Trump administration \u201cto rectify the glaring issues with this study during the public comment period,\u201d which lasts until mid-February.",
      "The DOE report came as an independent analysis found that increased LNG exports would support nearly half a million domestic jobs and contribute $1.3 trillion to U.S. gross domestic product through 2040. The study, released Tuesday by the research firm S&P Global, projects that U.S. LNG export capacity will double over the next five years, with little impact on domestic prices.",
      "\u201cThe emergence of the U.S. LNG industry has placed the United States in the pole position with global demand for gas expected to grow through 2040, alongside the rapid growth of renewables,\u201d said Daniel Yergin, the group's vice chairman and a Pulitzer Prize-winning author.",
      "U.S. LNG \u201cremains a vital tool for countries looking to displace dirtier fuels\" such as coal, said Charlie Riedl, executive director of the Center for LNG, a pro-industry group. U.S. gas shipments to Europe and Asia have soared since Russia\u2019s invasion of Ukraine in 2022.",
      "The LNG pause, announced by Biden as the 2024 election year began, aligned the Democratic administration with environmentalists who fear the huge increase in LNG exports in recent years is locking in potentially catastrophic planet-warming emissions at a time when Biden has pledged to cut U.S. climate pollution in half by 2030.",
      "\u201cWhile MAGA Republicans willfully deny the urgency of the climate crisis, condemning the American people to a dangerous future, my administration will not be complacent,\u2033 Biden said in announcing the pause. His actions \u201cheed the calls of young people and frontline communities who are using their voices to demand\" climate action, Biden added.",
      "Environmental groups hailed the DOE study, saying it found clear evidence of LNG\u2019s climate, economic, national security and public health dangers.",
      "\u201cThis study confirms that Donald Trump\u2019s plans to supercharge LNG exports will come at the expense of consumers and the climate,\" said Raena Garcia, senior energy campaigner at Friends of the Earth. She urged Biden and Granholm to reject all pending LNG projects as against the public interest.",
      "\u201cIf Trump wants to drive up dangerous gas exports, he\u2019s going to have to answer for causing more deadly storms, condemning the Rice\u2019s whale to extinction and socking consumers with higher costs,\u201d said Lauren Parker, an attorney at the Center for Biological Diversity, another environmental group.",
      "Parker's comment refers to an endangered whale species in the Gulf of Mexico. Environmentalists say offshore drilling for oil and gas threatens the species' habitat."

      "Global condemnation over the lack of transparency prompted Maduro to ask Venezuela\u2019s high court, also stacked with ruling-party loyalists and led by Rodr\u00edguez, to audit the results.",
      "The court subsequently reaffirmed his victory.",

      "Also called Maine shrimp or northern shrimp, the small pink crustaceans were long beloved by seafood fans in winter. But for a decade now, the seafood industry has been under a fishing moratorium for the shrimp because of concerns about low population levels, which scientists attribute to climate change and warming oceans.",

It's a far cry from the early 2010s when fishermen caught more than 10 million pounds (4.5 million kilograms) of the shrimp per year.

      "SACRAMENTO, Calif. -- Pacific Gas & Electric Co. could receive up to $15 billion in federal loans to help the utility modernize its power grid and expand clean energy infrastructure across central and northern California, officials announced Tuesday.",
      "The U.S. Department of Energy announced a conditional commitment for one of the largest loan guarantees ever under its Energy Infrastructure Reinvestment program. When finalized, the money would be loaned in installments over several years.",
      "The funds would support a portfolio of projects to expand hydropower generation and battery storage, upgrade transmission capacity, and enable virtual power plants throughout PG&E\u2019s service area, the energy department said.",
      "PG&E submitted its application to the agency's Loan Programs Office in June 2023. Partially funding its projects with lower-cost federal loans could save customers up to $1 billion over the life of the financing, the utility said in a statement Tuesday.",
      "\u201cInvestments in a clean and resilient grid for northern and central California will have significant returns for our customers in safety, reliability and economic growth. The DOE loan program can help us accelerate the pace and impact of this work, which supports thousands of living wage jobs, at a lower cost to our customers,\u201d PG&E CEO Patti Poppe said in the statement.",
      "The Sierra Club, the environmental advocacy group, cheered PG&E's commitment to modernizing the power grid and expanding clean energy infrastructure.",
      "\u201cThis innovative loan program will help ensure that Californians will see more stable rates, enjoy more good clean energy jobs and live with fewer harmful emissions. This unprecedented windfall also offers a unique opportunity for PG&E to update its outdated transmission infrastructure with more efficient, climate-friendly and fire-safe technology,\" Sierra Club organizer Julia Dowell said in a statement Tuesday.",
      "The loan office hopes to finalize the commitment before President Joe Biden leaves office next month."

      "The PGA Tour, flush with a $1.5 billion investment from private equity and still negotiating with the Saudi-backers of LIV Golf as a minority investor, is hiring a CEO for the first time who will work alongside Commissioner Jay Monahan.",
      "Monahan made the announcement to his staff Tuesday morning as part of a year-end message that looked ahead to 2025.",
      "\u201cEverything is on the table,\u201d Monahan said in a video message posted on PGA Tour's social media channels.",
      "The PGA Tour is wrapping up a year of sweeping changes while still unable to reach an agreement with the Public Investment Fund of Saudi Arabia, though recent signs indicate they are closer than ever. Still unknown is to what degree this can unite a sport where its biggest names are competing in opposite leagues.",
      "Strategic Sports Group, a consortium of American sports business owners led by Fenway Sports Group, invested $1.5 billion in a deal announced in late January, with the possibility of that investment reaching $3 billion.",
      "That led to a first-of-its-kind equity ownership for the players, depending on their level of success and contributions to the tour.",
      "\u201cWe're bringing new perspectives on to our team to help us realize the incredible opportunities ahead for our sport, including launching a search for a CEO of the PGA Tour,\u201d Monahan said. \u201cWe can learn so much from across the world of sport and entertainment, and I'm excited to meet candidates for this important new role.\u201d",
      "Atlanta Falcons owner Arthur Blank, part of SSG and a member of the new commercial PGA Tour Enterprises, will be leading a search committee that includes Monahan.",

      "The PGA Tour Enterprises board includes all six players on the policy board, led by Tiger Woods, four members of SSG, Monahan and Valero CEO Joe Gorder. The 13th member is former PGA Tour player Joe Ogilvie in a liaison role.",
      "Professional golf now has four top executive openings. The LPGA is searching for a new commissioner to replace Mollie Marcoux Samaan; the PGA of America has narrowed its search for a CEO to replace Seth Waugh; and LIV Golf is expected to name Scott O'Neil as its new CEO with Greg Norman taking on a different role.",
      "The PGA Tour already has tightened its player eligibility by eliminating 25 cards through the FedEx Cup, meaning only the top 100 will be guaranteed full status at the end of the year. Field sizes also are being reduced.",
      "The tour also will be launching its massive PGA Tour Studios next to its headquarters, filled with the latest technology that will allow the tour to produce its own content and \u201cdelivering our fans around the world more of what you want to see,\u201d Monahan said.",
      "The tour also has invested in the TMRW Golf League that starts next month, an indoor competition among six teams that will be televised on ESPN platforms. Woods and Rory McIlroy are behind TGL and belong to the teams filled with top players.",
      "Monahan's message came on the day McIlroy and Scottie Scheffler play an exhibition match against Bryson DeChambeau and Brooks Koepka from LIV Golf, a sign interpreted as a small step toward getting PGA Tour and LIV Golf players together more often than the four majors.",
      "But there has been no indication of any serious competition among the two leagues. LIV still hasn't filled out its 2025 schedule \u2014 its fourth season.",
      "Monahan had talked in August about reaching out to the fans, and he said more than 50,000 of them responded to a \u201cfan forward\u201d survey geared toward improving the product. He did not mention details of what the tour learned.",

    "story": [
      "Indonesia's mining industry is rapidly expanding on demand for the minerals needed to help power the global energy transition, like nickel, cobalt and bauxite",
      "KABAENA, Indonesia -- The crystal blue waters that once surrounded Kabaena are murky brown now, and the octopi and colorful fish that locals used to catch nearby to eat and sell have fled. The lush seaweed they used to harvest is gone. And parents who grew up swimming happily in the Flores Sea now warn their children to stay out of the water for fear of itchy rashes or skin lesions.",
      "The people of Kabaena \u2014 including Indigenous Bajau, a group that has traditionally lived near and relied on the sea \u2014 are among what experts estimate are thousands of communities around Indonesia where traditional ways of life have been devastated by the impacts of a rapidly expanding mining industry. Most of the materials mined in Indonesia fuel the international supply chain for stainless steel, electric vehicle batteries and more.",
      "\u201cAll residents here have felt the impact,\u201d said Amiruddin, 53, a fisherman who like many Indonesians uses only one name.",
      "With the world's largest known nickel reserves and rich deposits of cobalt, bauxite and other materials, Indonesia has been experiencing a mining boom on demand for stainless steel, electric vehicle batteries and more that are needed for the global energy transition. The island nation has sought to expand its mining and processing capabilities while facing backlash from international and local watchdogs for various environmental concerns.",
      "Across Indonesia, nickel processing plants sometimes sprawl just a few minutes from the sea, and barges ready to carry away nickel ore often dot the water. Some mines operate near schools.",
      "Local communities and the natural environments around these mines can bear the burden of this intense demand. From 2001 to 2020, the world lost nearly 1.4 million hectares (about 3.5 million acres) of trees due to mining, with Indonesia having the highest loss, according to an analysis by the World Resources Institute.",
      "______",
      "EDITOR\u2019S NOTE: This is part of a series of on how tribes and Indigenous communities are coping with and combating climate change.",
      "______",
      "On Kabaena, over 3,700 hectares (9,140 acres) of forest \u2014 including protected forest \u2014 were cleared by mining companies between 2001 to 2023, according to data analysis by international environmental organization Mighty Earth. That deforestation has devastated the environment and livelihoods on Kabaena, said Amanda Hurowitz, a senior director at Mighty Earth.",
      "Where fishers could once catch fish to sell or feed their families, the water is now filled with runoff sediment from mining activities and no fish are to be found. Fishers with boats must travel farther, using expensive petrol, and wind up with smaller catches that earn them less money. Those without boats often resort to eating the small shellfish they can find in the murky water around their homes.",
      "\u201c(I would) fish near there by setting a net,\u201d Ilyas, 70, said while pointing in front of his home. \u201cNow it\u2019s far away before (fish) are found.\u201d",
      "Communities on land are experiencing the mines' impact as well: Sugar cane, palm and clove trees cultivated for food and income don't grow as well, with water sources used for crops tainted by mining activities, residents said.",
      "\u201cThat\u2019s the effect: The growth of the sugar palm trees will not be as good because of the influence of mining,\u201d said Amal Susanto, 32, a palm sugar farmer in an area of Kabaena where exploration permits have been granted but mining has not yet begun. \u201cI hope no mines around here, because our income will be impacted.\u201d",
      "Since the mines have opened, there's been a spike in residents complaining of itchy skin, sore throats and other health issues. Villagers no longer want to bathe or wash clothes in the water; when they do, they get itchy skin and rashes said Nina, 33, an Indigenous Bajau resident of Kabaena.",
      "Lab results from samples of rivers, sea water, dust and shellfish from Kabaena taken by Satya Bumi, a nonprofit environmental organization based in Indonesia, in July and November showed hazardous levels of nickel, lead and cadmium \u2014 common mining byproducts.",
      "Exposure to these metals at the levels seen in the lab samples could lead to cancer, cardiovascular, kidney and other chronic diseases, said Kathrin Schilling, an assistant professor at Columbia University who researches molecular biology and reviewed the lab results.",
      "\u201cIf people on this island are using the river water as drinking water \u2014 which has higher levels of the metals \u2014 and then if they are also eating the shellfish and breathe the air ... you cannot escape basically any of the exposure to those toxic metals,\u201d Schilling told AP.",
      "The impact isn\u2019t limited to Kabaena. Across the sea to the north, a nickel mine near the village of Torobulu pushes up against a tattered soccer field and nearby athletic courts.",
      "The impacts and mining continue despite a March 2024 ruling by Indonesia's constitutional court that small islands such as Kabaena require special protection from abnormally dangerous activities, including mining, as they threaten ecosystems in vulnerable areas.",
      "But Indonesia's government is still issuing mining permits for small islands, said Sayyidatiihayaa Afra, a researcher at Satya Bumi.",
      "Since the constitutional court ruling, forest loss has continued on Kabaena, with 150 hectares (370 acres) cleared in areas approved for mining on the island since April 1, according to data analysis by Mighty Earth. Over half of the forest loss occurred in a concession owned by mining company Tonia Mitra Sejahtera.",
      "Tonia Mitra Sejahtera did not respond to a request for interviews or comment. Mining company Anugrah Harisma Barakah \u2014 which caused the most deforestation on Kabaena, according to Satya Bumi \u2014 also did not answer the publicly listed phone number when AP made requests for interviews or comment.",
      "Indonesia's Ministry of Energy and Mineral Resources did not respond to a request for comment.",
      "Meanwhile, people on Kabaena say they feel helpless.",
      "\u201cWhat else can we do if the water is like this?\u201d said Nina. \"We\u2019re small people \u2014 we can\u2019t do anything. We have to surrender.\u201d",

      "Junk fees and deceptive pricing are also one of the reasons the Department of Justice sued Ticketmaster and its parent company, Live Nation Entertainment, earlier this year. The government asked a court to separate the companies, saying they have a monopoly on concert promotion and ticketing that drives up price for consumers.",

Two of those three gifts went to medical schools to provide financial aid. Altogether, four of the top donations on the list, totaling $2.3 billion, went to support financial aid.",
      "Three contributions were made to donors\u2019 own foundations, and those gifts totaled $2.3 billion as well. Three other donations supported medical research or treatment, and one gift each went to support civic engagement and arts and culture.",
      "The list has 12 gifts, rather than 10, because of ties. Six of the donors are multibillionaires, and their combined net worth is an estimated $365 billion.",
      "Topping the list is a gift from Netflix co-founder Reed Hastings, whose net worth Forbes estimates at more than $5 billion. Hastings and his wife, Patty Quillin, gave 2 million shares of Netflix stock valued at $1.1 billion in January to their Hastings Fund at the Silicon Valley Community Foundation.",

      "ATLANTA -- The Atlanta Falcons are turning to rookie Michael Penix Jr. as their starting quarterback and benching veteran Kirk Cousins as they fight for their first playoff berth since 2017.",
      "Coach Raheem Morris announced the decision in a statement Tuesday night.",
      "\u201cAfter review we have made the decision Michael Penix Jr. will be the Atlanta Falcons' starting quarterback moving forward,\u201d Morris said. \u201cThis was a football decision and we are fully focused on preparing the team for Sunday\u2019s game against the New York Giants.\u201d",
      "The Falcons (7-7) ended a four-game losing streak with Monday night's ugly 15-9 win at Las Vegas. Cousins passed for 112 yards with one touchdown \u2014 his first TD pass in five games \u2014 and one interception. The 36-year-old has thrown nine picks over the past five games and leads the NFL with 16 interceptions.",
      "Atlanta signed Cousins to a four-year, $180 million contract in the offseason with $100 million guaranteed before selecting Penix No. 8 overall in the NFL draft.",
      "Cousins ended his touchdown drought with a 30-yard scoring pass to Drake London in the first quarter but had few other highlights against the woeful Raiders.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s not where I want to be,\" he said of his performance. \u201cThere\u2019s a lot of room for improvement and we\u2019d like to finish a lot stronger here these last three weeks.\u201d",
      "The Falcons made the switch about three hours after Morris told reporters he wasn't ready to make a decision on this week's starter.",
      "\u201cWe talked about it last night,\u201d Morris said. \u201cYou know, there\u2019s no secret. We didn\u2019t play well enough at the quarterback position, and we\u2019ve got to find ways to play better. So, all those things over the course of the week and we\u2019ve got to do whatever is best to win versus the Giants.\u201d",
      "The quarterback move comes with the Falcons still contending for the NFC South title. Atlanta is one game behind division-leading Tampa Bay, but the Falcons hold the tiebreaker advantage.",
      "Penix has appeared in only two games, completing 3 of 5 passes for 38 yards. He was the Heisman Trophy runner-up in 2023, when he passed for 4,903 yards with 36 touchdowns and 11 interceptions for Washington.",
      "Cousins had a strong start to the season, leading the Falcons to a 6-3 start and first place in the division. He has completed 66.9% of his passes, exactly matching his standard for his 13-year career. He has passed for 3,508 yards but has an unhealthy ratio of 18 touchdown passes to 16 interceptions.",
      "Morris acknowledged it appeared Cousins' confidence has been shaken by his recent struggles.",
      "\u201cI\u2019m not trying to sugarcoat this thing for him,\u201d Morris said. \u201cHe\u2019s not trying to sugarcoat it for himself. ... When you go through the stress that we\u2019re going through right now, you\u2019re not going to have that same confidence and the same swagger that you had in the first, two months or three months, whatever it was, of the season.\u201d",
      "Morris has consistently said the plan was for Cousins to handle the job this season while Penix prepared to take over at some point in the future. Morris was reluctant to veer from than plan before Tuesday night, though he said earlier in the day he saw no downside if he chose to start Penix.",
      "The first-year coach has praised the way Penix has handled the backup role.",
      "\u201cYou could never say there\u2019s a downside to turn it over to somebody that you put a lot of investment into, somebody that you brought in here, somebody you\u2019ve done some things with, somebody that\u2019s done nothing but the right thing since they\u2019ve been here,\u201d Morris said.",
      "Morris added he was \"just being really smart and cautious in how we go about our business\u201d in sticking with Cousins through his recent struggles.",

      "The secretary general of the International Biathlon Union apologized to any athlete who was mistreated during his tenure at U.S. Biathlon while speaking to a 90-minute meeting Tuesday that focused on concerns about athlete safety brought to light by multiple Associated Press reports.",
      "\u201cI appreciate anyone who comes forward with issues, especially issues of sexual misconduct, whether it\u2019s recent ones or old ones. I think that\u2019s an incredibly brave and important thing to do,\u201d Max Cobb said in remarks to the U.S. Biathlon Association's annual meeting, held over Zoom.",
      "It was Cobb's first public statement since AP's report a week ago detailing how women said officials ignored or excused sexual abuse and harassment of female biathletes by their coaches and others over decades because they were more concerned about winning medals than holding offenders accountable.",
      "While the men involved climbed the ranks of the sport, the women \u2014 who described a culture of abuse dating back to the 1990s \u2014 said they were forced to end their racing careers early. Biathlon combines cross-country skiing with target shooting.",
      "\u201cI can say personally I am very sorry for any athlete who suffered any kind of mistreatment during my time working with U.S. Biathlon,\u201d said Cobb, who rose from domestic team manager to CEO of the association and is now an official with the IBU, the worldwide governing body of the sport.",
      "Cobb said Tuesday that he would cooperate with a U.S. Center for SafeSport investigation into a coach accused of sexually abusing a young biathlete, causing her so much distress that she attempted suicide. He said SafeSport holds exclusive jurisdiction over investigations and he could not speak further.",
      "However, that biathlete, Grace Boutot, who also attended the virtual meeting, said no one is prohibited from speaking about her case because she has not filed a SafeSport complaint about the abuse she suffered. She said any SafeSport six-month suspension was not enough, while she has endured a life sentence.",
      "Cobb was named in a different SafeSport complaint filed by another former biathlete, two-time Olympian Joan Wilder, who said her coach tried to sexually assault her and Cobb dismissed it when she reported it to him.",
      "During the meeting Boutot accused Cobb and other board members of ignoring sexual abuse she suffered at the hands of two different coaches. \u201cOther people were aware of what happened, and they did not reach out to me to investigate after my suicide attempt,\u201d she said.",
      "Drew Hudon, vice president of the Colorado Biathlon Club, said that is why the board has lost the trust of U.S. Biathlon members. That includes board Chairman Bob Hall, who opened the meeting saying athlete safety was the priority and had said the body would investigate any allegations.",
      "\u201cWe just heard point-blank, crystal clear, they did know and did not investigate,\u201d Hudon said. \u201cThat to me was a clear example of why I should not have trust right now in this board of directors, in their ability to oversee this organization and promote safety.\u201d",
      "The U.S. Olympic & Paralympic Committee placed an employee on administrative leave after the AP reported about Boutot's case.",
      "Boutot and Wilder contacted the AP with their stories after the news agency reported that two-time Olympian Joanne Reid was sexually harassed and abused for years by a ski wax technician while racing on the World Cup circuit, according to SafeSport. When she complained, she said, she was told his behavior was just part of male European culture and then faced retaliation.",
      "SafeSport has launched a new investigation into U.S. Biathlon CEO Jack Gierhart and High Performance Director Lowell Bailey regarding the retaliation claims, though it is not known when they will finish their work. SafeSport spokeswoman Hilary Nemchik said she could not comment on an ongoing case.",
      "The AP story on Reid's SafeSport case prompted U.S. Biathlon to order an independent investigation into team culture and safety. The assessment by auditor Vestry Laight found that biathletes faced \u201cmisogynistic\u201d behavior while racing and feared retaliation if they came forward.",
      "At Tuesday's meeting, Gierhart detailed the organization's plan to respond to auditor recommendations and create a supportive and accountable team culture.",
      "\u201cThis is an ongoing process \u2014 it's a journey,\u201d he said. \u201cIt's a shift for us, and we're committed to making it happen.\u201d",

      "The Commanders are considering places in the district, Maryland and Virginia to build a stadium in the coming years. Their lease at Northwest Stadium in Landover, Maryland, runs through 2027, and Harris called 2030 a \u201creasonable target\u201d for a new one.",
      "The team played at RFK Stadium 2 miles (3.22 kilometers) east of the Capitol from 1961-96 before moving to Maryland. Harris and several co-owners, including Mitch Rales and Mark Ein, grew up as Washington football fans during that era, which included the glory days of three Super Bowl championships from 1982-91.",
      "House Oversight Committee Chairman James Comer, R-Ky., praised the move as evidence Congress is doing its job to oversee the city.",
      "\u201cThis landmark legislation will unlock the district\u2019s full potential, generate meaningful new jobs, and add millions in additional city revenue for the nation\u2019s capital,\u201d Comer said in a statement. \u201cWithout Congressional action, this land would remain vacant, leaving ongoing maintenance costs and liabilities to burden the American taxpayer. Now is the time to get the federal government out of the way and empower local officials to clean up the RFK site, invest and create new economic opportunities.\u201c",

      "SMU coach Rhett Lashlee took a moment while preparing his team for the College Football Playoff to address the ever-growing concern over the open transfer portal window",
      "SMU coach Rhett Lashlee took a moment while preparing his team for the College Football Playoff to address the ever-growing concern over the open transfer portal window.",
      "His problem isn't with players wanting to transfer. Rather, Lashlee's issue, one shared with other coaches, is the timing for those with teams still playing, whether in the 12-team playoff like the Mustangs or in one of the many bowls into early January.",
      "\u201cI hate it for our players,\u201d Lashlee said Tuesday. \u201cI told them ... I hate it that you guys, you get a chance to play in the College football Playoff, yet you are either forced to decide do I go in the portal or not. Or let\u2019s call it like it is, people are bombarding our roster trying to pick people off our roster, and we\u2019re trying to focus on the playoff.\u201d",
      "Not to mention, it's also time for final exams at SMU and many other schools.",
      "Players looking to transfer must enter the portal by Dec. 28, or have to wait until April 16. That timeframe was approved in October \u2014 a window reduced by 15 days after earlier complaints from coaches.",
      "Lashlee understands that players want the ability to transfer for more playing time elsewhere, or an opportunity to capitalize on name, image and likeness. But he insists that even players don't like the parameters in which they now have to make those decisions.",
      "\u201cWe talk about making a system that is all great for them, but we haven\u2019t. I mean, that\u2019s part of your job as adults is to do what\u2019s best for young people, not what they want necessarily. They don't want this,\" he said. \"There\u2019s no other sport at all that has free agency in the season. It\u2019s sad, it\u2019s terrible.\u201d",
      "SMU (11-2) plays at Penn State (11-2) on Saturday in a first-round CFP game. The primary backup quarterbacks for both teams are in the transfer portal.",
      "Preston Stone, who was 13-3 as SMU's starter before getting replaced by Kevin Jennings in the fourth game this year, is still staying with the Mustangs in the playoffs. Penn State sophomore Beau Pribula won\u2019t be with the Nittany Lions.",
      "\u201cYou hear the story about their backup quarterback saying, I don\u2019t have a choice. ... That\u2019s wrong, that\u2019s unacceptable. That\u2019s not okay,\u201d Lashlee said. \u201cHe shouldn\u2019t have to make that decision. Preston here is doing the same thing. Now, he has chosen to stay with us, and we\u2019re working with him. But it\u2019s still a juggling act for him.\u201d",
      "Penn State coach James Franklin said Monday after Pribula's decision that the quarterback didn't want to leave the program now, but didn't feel like he could wait until after their last game.",
      "\u201cThe way the portal is, and the timing of it, when you play the position of quarterback and there\u2019s only one spot and those spots are filling up, he felt like he was put in a no-win situation,\u201d Franklin said. \"And I agree with him.\u201d",
      "Colorado coach Deion Sanders is no stranger to the portal game. He has dabbled in it quite often in retooling the roster. This season, the Buffaloes have more than 40 newcomer transfers. It has helped them go from four wins in his Colorado debut \u2014 one that included a major roster makeover \u2014 to a 9-3 team that will play BYU in the Alamo Bowl on Dec. 28.",
      "\u201cThe transfer portal should be no surprise to you,\u201d Sanders explained.",
      "He has certainly got it down to a science.",
      "\u201cYou\u2019re probably going to lose two guys you didn\u2019t expect, and you\u2019re probably going to gain several guys you didn\u2019t expect, but you\u2019ve got to have a board,\u201d Sanders said. \u201cYou\u2019ve got to do your studies. ... I don\u2019t think the portal has ever been a surprise to us.\u201d",
      "If a player wants to jump into the portal, so be it, with one caveat: \u201cYou\u2019re not going to come here and practice and eat and be merry and have a Merry Christmas with us, then leave right out of the game,\u201d Sanders said. \u201cI call that using somebody. You\u2019re not going to use us.\u201d",
      "Too many departures in the portal can certainly have adverse affects on a program, such as Marshall pulling out of a bowl game after too many of its players decided to transfer in the aftermath of a coaching change.",
      "Lashlee said the easiest solution would be to not open the transfer portal in December.",
      "\u201cWe've got to look long and hard at the schedule. Coaches have been saying this for the last three or four years with all these changes,\" he said. \"And what happens is we just make all these these random changes because we don\u2019t want to get sued, or we don\u2019t want to do this or we don\u2019t want to do that, and we don\u2019t think about the long-term effects it has on the young people that we\u2019re supposed to be serving.\u201d",

      "Mahomes has a mild high-ankle sprain and plans to play Saturday when the Chiefs (13-1) host the Texans (9-5). Mahomes has played through a high-ankle sprain before, including the 2022 playoffs when he led Kansas City to the first of consecutive Super Bowl wins.",
      "Allen is OK after having a precautionary X-ray on his shoulder following one of several shots he took during Buffalo\u2019s 48-42 victory in Detroit. The Bills (11-3) have a chance at the No. 1 seed if they win out and the Chiefs lose twice.",

He was a full-time starter for seven seasons and finished third in NFL MVP voting in 2017 when he was on the reverse side of the injury situation. Wentz sustained a season-ending knee injury in December that season and watched Nick Foles lead the Philadelphia Eagles to the franchise\u2019s only Super Bowl title.

You think Shedeur wants to go out there and play that hot garbage when he\u2019s one of the premier guys and probably, arguably the first pick of the whole draft? ... We\u2019ve got guys who want to end on a great note.\"",
      "It's been a whirlwind since Colorado wrapped up the regular season with a 52-0 win over Oklahoma State on Nov. 29. Deion Sanders found time to squeeze in some fishing back in Texas.",
      "For Hunter, it's been a parade of honors, including the Heisman and The Associated Press player of the year. Shedeur Sanders also won the Johnny Unitas Golden Arm Award for a season in which he broke the school's all-time single-season passing mark.",

The similarities are unbelievable.\u201d",

      "\u201cThat's awesome. I love them. I appreciate them,\u201d Sanders said. \u201cThey\u2019ve taken it to yet another level \u2014 and that was the plan all along.\u201d",

      "\u201cThe public has given us a mandate that could not be more clear, the clearest mandate. The people have spoken. The people want change,\" Musk told the audience of Trump's biggest donors, campaign leaders and appointment seekers. \u201cWe are going to shake things up. It's going to be a revolution.\u201d",
      "Musk's attachment to Trump has created an alliance between America's most powerful politician and its richest businessman \u2014 and roughly the same percentages of Americans have favorable views of each, according to a new poll from the AP-NORC Center for Public Affairs Research.",
      "Experts are split on whether that overlap in public opinion is a good or bad thing for Musk\u2019s businesses or for Trump\u2019s politics. But it could have far-reaching effects in both realms.",
      "Musk, whose net worth tops $400 billion, oversees six businesses while continuing to work closely with Trump: electric car manufacturer Tesla, the X social media platform, space technology company SpaceX, brain link company Neuralink, the startup xAI and tunneling operator The Boring Co.",

      "Ross Gerber, CEO of Gerber Kawasaki Wealth and Investment Management, identified himself as an investor in Musk's Tesla and a driver of Tesla\u2019s new Cybertruck, the futuristic pickup that has gotten huge amounts of attention but also been the subject of safety concerns and multiple recalls.",
      "\u201cHaving your CEO not working at your company and working at the job of having to fire government employees ... as a shareholder, I\u2019m paying someone to not work for my company,\u201d he said. \u201cAs a Cybertruck owner with self-driving that sucks and doesn\u2019t work, I\u2019m like, \u2018Dude, this isn\u2019t fair.\u2019\u201d",
      "But despite his skepticism, Gerber said he won\u2019t stop investing in Musk\u2019s businesses.",

      "Instead, said one political strategist, Musk is the ideal validator for someone who cultivates an image of success in business and who has stocked his Cabinet and key adviser roles with billionaires.",
      "\"Trump has always pushed this narrative that he\u2019s a successful developer and a very successful businessman. I think having Musk with him is his double-down on this business success, good-for-the-economy, good-for-everybody-making money kind of persona,\u201d said Christine Matthews, a national political pollster who has worked for Republicans. \u201cIn this case, Musk is seen as this successful, innovative, tech entrepreneur, frontier-buster.\u201d",
      "Musk also has at his disposal X, the social media platform formerly known as Twitter that he purchased and turned into a megaphone for conservative ideas. And having spent an estimated $250 million to support Trump in the election, Musk has signaled he is willing to back Republican primary challenges to GOP members in the House and Senate seeking reelection in 2026 who waver on Trump's appointments and agenda.",
      "Trump has tasked him with leading a group to reduce the size of the federal government and reduce the rulemaking authority of the federal bureaucracy.",
      "Tesla stands to make significant gains under a Trump administration with the threat of diminished subsidies for alternative energy and electric vehicles doing the most harm to smaller competitors. Trump\u2019s plans for extensive tariffs on Chinese imports make it less likely that Chinese EVs will be sold in bulk in the U.S. anytime soon.",
      "Some analysts believe the billionaire\u2019s role will create a very friendly landscape for Tesla over the coming years. Ives, the analyst at Wedbush Securities, said Musk\u2019s relationship with Trump could \u201crevolutionize the Tesla story, especially around robotics, AI and autonomous.\u201d",
      "Investors, he said, are betting on Musk and see his political ascent as a \u201cchampagne moment.\u201d Unlike Gerber, Ives believes that ending the EV credit and taking subsidies from Detroit carmakers, Hyundai and other companies will create only opportunity for Tesla.",
      "\u201cI think Wall Street is starting to fully digest the potential benefits from Musk,\u201d Ives said.",
      "Tesla shares closed at a record high on Tuesday, with much of the company\u2019s recent gains coming after Trump\u2019s victory. But Gerber feels that jump is because investors believe Tesla will have an advantage when it comes to autonomous driving because Trump could grant the company a national autonomy license.",
      "Still, he thinks Tesla will be the \u201cbig loser\u201d of Musk\u2019s businesses because of Trump\u2019s promise to end the EV tax credit for carmakers.",
      "\u201cFor Tesla, I don\u2019t see a ton of benefit from this,\u201d he said. \u201cElon is misleading people to say it hurts the competition if the credit goes away.\u201d",
      "Musk\u2019s other companies \u2014 including his artificial intelligence company, xAI \u2014 could reap the benefits of working within the Trump administration, he said.",
      "\u201cAI is a transformative investment that will create lots of regulatory and governmental issues, especially around safety and information,\u201d Gerber said. \u201cThere\u2019s a lot of benefit, from an AI perspective, to having Elon where he is.\u201d",
      "The relationship between the two men has no parallel in U.S. history, said David Nasaw, biographer of American business tycoons Andrew Carnegie and William Randolph Hearst. He noted that Musk, to a level unlike other tycoons, has relied on subsidies and favorable government decisions for his success from Tesla to SpaceX.",

      "Space One aims to be Japan\u2019s first company to put a satellite into orbit, hoping to boost Japan\u2019s lagging space industry with a small rocket for an affordable space transport business.",
      "Wednesday's flight, postponed twice from Saturday because of strong winds, came nine months after a failed debut flight in March, when the rocket was intentionally exploded five seconds after takeoff. The flight was carrying a government satellite that was intended to monitor North Korea\u2019s missile launches and other military activities.",
      "Kairos No. 2 rocket was carrying five small satellites, including one from the Taiwanese space agency and several from Japanese startups.",
      "Space One said it had fixed the cause of the debut flight failure, which stemmed from a miscalculation of the rocket\u2019s first-stage propulsion.",
      "Japan hopes the company can pave the way for a domestic space industry that competes with the United States.",
      "Tokyo-based Space One was set up in 2018 with investments from major Japanese companies, including Canon Electronics, IHI, Shimizu and major banks, to commercialize space delivery services at lower costs and regular flights as many as 20 times a year, compared to six currently planned by the government-led space program.",
      "Japan\u2019s space development programs are led by Japan Aerospace Exploration Agency, or JAXA, and industry leaders such as Mitsubishi Heavy Industries and IHI, as they develop two main flagship rockets, the large H3 rocket and the much smaller Epsilon, to cater to the growing satellite transport business.",

      "Scientists in China have almost finished building a massive underground detector to sniff out mysterious particles called neutrinos",
      "KAIPING, China -- Underneath a granite hill in southern China, a massive detector is nearly complete that will sniff out the mysterious ghost particles lurking around us.",
      "The Jiangmen Underground Neutrino Observatory will soon begin the difficult task of spotting neutrinos: tiny cosmic particles with a mind-bogglingly small mass.",
      "The detector is one of three being built across the globe to study these elusive ghost particles in the finest detail yet. The other two, based in the United States and Japan, are still under construction.",
      "Spying neutrinos is no small feat in the quest to understand how the universe came to be. The Chinese effort, set to go online next year, will push the technology to new limits, said Andre de Gouvea, a theoretical physicist at Northwestern University who is not involved with the project.",
      "\u201cIf they can pull that off,\u201d he said, \u201cit would be amazing.\u201d",
      "Neutrinos date back to the Big Bang, and trillions zoom through our bodies every second. They spew from stars like the sun and stream out when atomic bits collide in a particle accelerator.",
      "Scientists have known about the existence of neutrinos for almost a century, but they\u2019re still in the early stages of figuring out what the particles really are.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s the least understood particle in our world,\u201d said Cao Jun, who helps manage the detector known as JUNO. \"That\u2019s why we need to study it.\u201d",
      "There\u2019s no way to spot the tiny neutrinos whizzing around on their own. Instead, scientists measure what happens when they collide with other bits of matter, producing flashes of light or charged particles.",
      "Neutrinos bump into other particles only very rarely, so to up their chances of catching a collision, physicists have to think big.",
      "\u201cThe solution for how we measure these neutrinos is to build very, very big detectors,\u201d de Gouvea said.",
      "The $300 million detector in Kaiping, China, took over nine years to build. Its location 2,297 feet (700 meters) underground protects from pesky cosmic rays and radiation that could throw off its neutrino-sniffing abilities.",
      "On Wednesday, workers began the final step in construction. Eventually, they'll fill the orb-shaped detector with a liquid designed to emit light when neutrinos pass through and submerge the whole thing in purified water.",
      "It'll study antineutrinos \u2014 an opposite to neutrinos which allow scientists to understand their behavior \u2014 produced from collisions inside two nuclear power plants located over 31 miles (50 kilometers) away. When the antineutrinos come into contact with particles inside the detector, they'll produce a flash of light.",
      "The detector is specially designed to answer a key question about a longstanding mystery. Neutrinos switch between three flavors as they zip through space, and scientists want to rank them from lightest to heaviest.",
      "Sensing these subtle shifts in the already evasive particles will be a challenge, said Kate Scholberg, a physicist at Duke University who is not involved with the project.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s actually a very daring thing to even go after it,\u201d she said.",
      "China\u2019s detector is set to operate during the second half of next year. After that, it\u2019ll take some time to collect and analyze the data \u2014 so scientists will have to keep waiting to fully unearth the secret lives of neutrinos.",
      "Two similar neutrino detectors \u2013 Japan\u2019s Hyper-Kamiokande and the Deep Underground Neutrino Experiment based in the United States \u2013 are under construction. They\u2019re set to go online around 2027 and 2031 and will cross-check the China detector\u2019s results using different approaches.",
      "\u201cIn the end, we have a better understanding of the nature of physics,\u201d said Wang Yifang, chief scientist and project manager of the Chinese effort.",
      "Though neutrinos barely interact with other particles, they\u2019ve been around since the dawn of time. Studying these Big Bang relics can clue scientists into how the universe evolved and expanded billions of years ago.",
      "\u201cThey\u2019re part of the big picture,\u201d Scholberg said.",
      "One question researchers hope neutrinos can help answer is why the universe is overwhelmingly made up of matter with its opposing counterpart \u2014 called antimatter \u2014 largely snuffed out.",
      "Scientists don't know how things got to be so out of balance, but they think neutrinos could have helped write the earliest rules of matter.",
      "The proof, scientists say, may lie in the particles. They'll have to catch them to find out.",

So there\u2019s just a sense of urgency and a sense of understanding in the Trump administration\u2033 to address it.",
      "Demand for data centers ballooned in recent years due to the rapid growth of cloud computing and AI, and local governments are competing for lucrative deals with big tech companies.",

In 2019, Amazon also argued in a court case that Trump\u2019s bias against the company harmed its chances of winning a $10 billion Pentagon contract.",

The one in the middle of the Milky Way, called Sagittarius A (with an asterisk denoting star), is about 4 million times more massive than our sun and is relatively quiet, occasionally swallowing gas or dust that comes its way.",
      "Scientists know stars can form near and even orbit these black hole behemoths, but they've never seen a pair of stars survive so close by.",
      "The research was published Tuesday in the journal Nature Communications.",
      "The celestial sighting is interesting and unusual, and more research is needed to be certain of what the objects are, said astrophysicist Anna Ciurlo with the University of California, Los Angeles.",
      "\u201cThis leaves some questions still open,\u201d said Ciurlo, who was not involved with the new research.",
      "At about 2.7 million years old, the twin stars seem to be fairly young. Scientists said they appear to orbit each other at just the right distance: If they were too spread out, the black hole's gravity would rip them apart. Any closer and they'd merge into a single star.",
      "Even so, the cosmic duo won't stay stable forever. They could meld into one eventually though the timing is uncertain, said study lead author Florian Peissker from the University of Cologne.",
      "\u201cWe are actually in a really lucky situation,\u201d he said. \u201cWe observed the system just in time.\u201d",

      "Ireland's Data Protection Commission issued the penalties after wrapping up its inquiry into the breach, when hackers gained access to user accounts by exploiting bugs in the platform\u2019s code that allowed them to steal digital keys, known as \u201caccess tokens.\u201d",
      "Under the 27-nation EU\u2019s strict privacy regime, the Irish watchdog is Meta's lead privacy regulator because the company's regional headquarters are based in Dublin.",

      "When it first disclosed the problem, Facebook said 50 million user accounts were affected. But the actual number was around 29 million, including 3 million in Europe, the Irish watchdog said Tuesday.",

      "The hack involved three distinct bugs in Facebook\u2019s \u201cView As\u201d feature, which let people see how their profiles appear to others. The attackers used the vulnerability to steal access tokens from the accounts of people whose profiles came up in searches using the \u201cView As\u201d feature. The attack then moved from one user\u2019s Facebook friend to another. Possession of those tokens would allow attackers to control those accounts.",

      "Global security leaders are warning nuclear threats are growing as weapons spending has surged to $91.4 billion last year",
      "Global security leaders are warning that nuclear threats are growing as weapons spending has surged around the world. At the same time, private bunker sales are on the rise globally. Critics warn these bunkers create a false perception that a nuclear war is survivable. They argue that people planning to live through an atomic blast aren\u2019t focusing on the real and current dangers posed by nuclear threats, and the critical need to stop the proliferation of weapons of mass destruction.",
      "Meanwhile, government disaster experts say bunkers aren\u2019t necessary. A Federal Emergency Management Agency\u2019s 100-page guide on responding to a nuclear detonation focuses on having the public get inside and stay inside, ideally in a basement and away from outside walls for at least a day. Those existing spaces can provide protection from radioactive fallout, says FEMA.",

And they have this attitude that it\u2019s better to have it and not need it then to need it and not have it,\u201d said Atlas Survival Shelters CEO Ron Hubbard. He says his bunker factory, in Sulphur Springs, Texas, is the world\u2019s largest. Hubbard said COVID lockdowns, Russia\u2019s invasion of Ukraine and the outbreak of the Israel-Hamas war have driven sales.",
      "\u201cLook, this fallout exposure is entirely preventable because it is something that happens after the detonation,\u201d said Brooke Buddemeier a radiation safety specialist at Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory, where the U.S. government designs nuclear weapons. \u201cThere\u2019s going to be a fairly obvious nuclear explosion event, a large cloud. So just getting inside, away from where those particles fall, can keep you and your family safe.\u201d",
      "After a deadly and deafening blast, a bright flash and a mushroom cloud, it will take about 15 minutes for the radioactive fallout to arrive for those a mile or more away from ground zero, said Michael Dillon, a scientist at Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s going to literally be sand falling on your head, and you\u2019re going to want to get out of that situation. You want to go to your most robust building,\u201d he said. In their models, they estimate people may need to stay inside for a day or two before evacuating.",
      "Nonproliferation advocates bristle at the bunkers, shelters or any suggestion that a nuclear war is survivable.",
      "\u201cBunkers are, in fact, not a tool to survive a nuclear war, but a tool to allow a population to psychologically endure the possibility of a nuclear war,\u201d said Alicia Sanders-Zakre at the International Campaign to Abolish Nuclear Weapons.",

      "Four callers ended up buying bunkers in one day, he said, and more ended up ordering doors and other parts for shelters they were already building.",

      "A loaded shotgun at arm\u2019s length and metal mesh window shields to block Molotov cocktails nearby, Hubbard said he started his company after building his own bunker about 10 years ago. He says callers ask about prices \u2014 $20,000 to multimillions, averaging $500,000 \u2014 and installations \u2014 they can go just about anywhere. He said most days he sells at least one bunker.",

      "The government\u2019s efforts to educate the public were reinvigorated after a false alarm missile alert in Hawaii in 2018 caused widespread panic.",
      "The emergency alert, which was sent to cellphones statewide just before 8:10 a.m., said: \u201cBALLISTIC MISSILE THREAT INBOUND TO HAWAII. SEEK IMMEDIATE SHELTER. THIS IS NOT A DRILL.\u201d",
      "For the next 40 minutes there were traffic jams, workers running into and out of buildings, families huddling in their bathrooms, students gathering in gyms, drivers blocking tunnels, all in an attempt to seek shelter, without any clear idea of what \u201cseek immediate shelter\u201d actually meant.",

      "\u201cGently brush your pet\u2019s coat to remove any fallout particles\u201d it says, adding that the 15-minute delay between bomb and fallout allows \u201cenough time for you to be able to prevent significant radiation exposure.\u201d",

This makes people feel vulnerable.\u201d",
      "Lair said building bunkers seems futile, even if they work in the short term.",
      "\u201cEven if a nuclear exchange is perhaps more survivable than many people think, I think the aftermath will be uglier than many people think as well,\u201d he said. \u201cThe fundamental wrenching that it would do to our way of life would be profound.\u201d",

      "\u201cThe stakes, if a nuclear weapon is ever used, is that millions and millions and millions of people will die. It really is shocking that we have world leaders who talk casually about utilizing nuclear weapons. I mean, it would be catastrophic, not just for those that are involved in an exchange of nuclear weapons, but for the entire world.\u201d",
      "McGovern pushed back against FEMA\u2019s efforts to prepare the public for a nuclear attack by advising people to take shelter.",
      "\u201cWhat a stupid thing to say that we all just need to know where to hide and where to avoid the most impacts of nuclear radiation. I mean, really, that\u2019s chilling when you hear people try to rationalize nuclear war that way,\u201d he said.",
      "Nuclear war was far from a couple's mind when they went house-hunting in Southern California a few years ago. They wanted a home to settle down and raise their family, and they needed extra garage space. They spotted an online ad for a home with at least eight parking spots. On the basketball court, there was a metal hatch. Beneath it was a bunker.",
      "This was Jones' former home, which Jones said he put up for sale for family reasons.",

They aren\u2019t particularly worried about nuclear war, and haven\u2019t spent a night in the bunker, but they have stored food and medical supplies down there.",

      "Japanese tycoon Masayoshi Son has joined President-elect Donald Trump in announcing plans by technology and telecoms giant SoftBank Group to invest $100 billion in projects in the United States",
      "BANGKOK -- Japanese tycoon Masayoshi Son and President-elect Donald Trump have announced plans for technology and telecoms giant SoftBank Group to invest $100 billion in projects in the United States over the coming four years.",
      "Trump said the investments in building artificial intelligence infrastructure would create 100,000 jobs, twice the 50,000 promised when Son pledged $50 billion in U.S. investments after Trump's victory in 2016.",
      "Son, a founder and CEO of SoftBank Group, is known for making bold choices that sometimes pay big and sometimes don't. SoftBank has investments in dozens of Silicon Valley startups, along with big companies like semiconductor design company Arm and Chinese e-commerce giant Alibaba. The stock market rally and craze for AI has boosted the value of its assets, but it's unclear whether its investments will create that many jobs.",
      "Son founded SoftBank in the 1980s, expanding it from a telecoms carrier to encompass renewable energy and technology ventures. A leading figure in Japan\u2019s business world, he was an early believer in the internet, pouring billions into Silicon Valley start-ups and other technology companies.",
      "Son comes from a humble background. While at the University of California, Berkeley, he invented a pocket translator that he sold for $1 million to Japanese electronics maker Sharp Corp. He has made a career of risk-taking, pushing adoption of broadband services when the internet was still relatively new in Japan. His $20 billion takeover of U.S. mobile phone carrier Sprint Nextel Corp. in 2012 was Japan\u2019s biggest foreign acquisition at the time.",
      "Son is philosophical about his missteps, such as SoftBank's $18.5 billion investment in co-working space provider WeWork, which sought bankruptcy protection last year. SoftBank also invested in the failed robot pizza-making company Zume. Son is canny: SoftBank-related spending on lobbying and donations to U.S. politicians and parties runs into the billions of dollars. And both times Trump was elected, Son was quick to show his support.",
      "SoftBank has benefitted in recent months from rising values of some investments, such as U.S.-based e-commerce company Coupang, Chinese mobility provider DiDi Global and Bytedance, the Chinese developer of TikTok.",
      "Son built his fortune on early investments in search engine Yahoo and China's Alibaba, an astute initial outlay of $20 million in what has become an e-commerce and financial empire with a market cap of more than $200 billion.",
      "SoftBank has investments in T-Mobile, Deutsche Telekom, Microsoft, Nvidia and ride-sharing platform Uber, among hundreds of other companies that it groups together in its Vision Funds. The Saudi Arabian sovereign wealth fund and Abu Dhabi national wealth fund are among the biggest investors in those funds.",
      "The hundreds of start-ups that have received SoftBank investments include Nuro, a robo-delivery company; the dog-walking app Wag; South Korean logistics company Coupang; the Southeast Asian ride-sharing app Grab; and the office messaging app Slack.",
      "After several rough years, SoftBank returned to profitability in the last quarter, helped by returns from its Vision Fund investments. A big factor? Royalties and licensing related to its holdings in the UK-based computer chip-designing company Arm, whose business spans smartphones, data centers, networking equipment, automotive, consumer electronic devices, and AI applications.",
      "SoftBank investor presentations have sometimes featured images of a goose labeled \u201cAI Revolution\u201d laying golden eggs.",
      "Son has said he believes artificial intelligence will surpass human intelligence within a decade, affecting every industry, from transportation and pharmaceuticals to finance, manufacturing, logistics and others and that companies and people working with AI will be the leaders of the next 10 to 20 years. SoftBank's roughly 90% stake in Arm has positioned it well for expansion of AI applications since most mobile devices operate on Arm-based processors.",
      "Trump and Son said the $100 billion that SoftBank has promised to invest will go to building AI infrastructure, but the nature of that spending remains unclear. The eventual impact of AI on jobs remains an open question, but much of its infrastructure is based on energy-guzzling data processing centers that are likely to employ relatively few people once they are built.",
      "Even if SoftBank actually invested the promised $50 billion last time Trump was headed to the White House, it's unclear how many jobs that created.",
      "Shutdowns during the COVID-19 pandemic complicated matters. Foxconn Technology Group, a Taiwan company best known for making Apple iPhones, won Trump\u2019s praise after saying in 2017 it would build a $10 billion complex employing 13,000 people in a small town just south of Milwaukee. But that investment was scaled back drastically.",
      "SoftBank itself says it had 65,352 employees as of March.",
      "Officials in Tokyo praised Son's initiative, viewing it as a goodwill gesture at a time of huge concern over whether Trump will impose blanket tariff hikes on imports from allies like Japan, as well as China.",
      "\u201cGenerally speaking, I believe expansion of investment through steady accumulation of efforts between Japanese and U.S. companies would help further strengthen Japan-U.S. economic ties, so I find it delightful,\u201d said Yoji Muto, Japan's Trade and Industry minister.",

      "Experts say it\u2019s easy to confuse drones and airplanes, especially at night",
      "Up in the sky, is that a drone, a plane or a helicopter?",
      "Experts who study unmanned aircraft systems \u2014 better known as drones \u2014 say it can be tough to tell from miles away. But there are clues.",
      "A light in the sky at night can easily be misinterpreted, according to John Slaughter, director of the Unmanned Aircraft Systems Research and Operations Center at the University of Maryland.",
      "\u201cYou can\u2019t just walk outside and say, \u2018Oh, that\u2019s not a drone,\u2019 or \u2018That is one.\u2019 All you can really factually say is, \u2018I saw a light in the sky,\u2019\" Slaughter said.",
      "Dozens of mysterious nighttime flights first spotted in New Jersey last month and now being seen across the U.S. have raised concerns among residents and officials. Part of the worry stems from the flying objects initially being spotted near the Picatinny Arsenal, a U.S. military research and manufacturing facility, and over President-elect Donald Trump\u2019s golf course in Bedminster.",
      "Planes and helicopters all have flashing lights and typically at least one red anti-collision light, often two. They also sport navigation lights, which are steady, red and green colored lights like the ones found on boats. Many will also have flashing white strobe lights at their wingtips. And they have bright landing lights.",
      "Drones flying at night are only required to have one bright, anti-collision light that's visible 3 miles (5 kilometers) away. But drone owners can add other lights, so some have more than one. Drones are smaller, so when they have multiple lights they are close together, but at night it's often not possible to figure out precisely how far away they are.",
      "\"A light is just a bright point,\u201d Slaughter said. \u201cAnd it might be 100 yards (90 meters) away, it could be literally 40 miles (65 kilometers) away, and it looks the same.\u201d",
      "Drones tend to be quieter and make a higher-pitched buzzing noise than that generated by the jet engines or propellers that drive planes and helicopters. But bigger drones can be louder, and the sound may be difficult to discern from a distance.",
      "Drones heavier than about a half-pound (0.2 kilograms) may have an identifying number displayed on the outside.",
      "\u201cYou certainly wouldn\u2019t see it at night, and you\u2019d have to be up close to see it, you know, in the daytime,\u201d said Paul R. Snyder, director of the Unmanned Aircraft System program in the University of North Dakota's Aerospace Sciences School.",
      "Planes and even helicopters tend to move smoothly in the air, but multicopter drones can stop on a dime, pivot 90 degrees and reverse course, Slaughter said.",
      "\u201cThat kind of motion can give you a clue that you\u2019re looking at a drone, not an aircraft,\" he said.",
      "And the vast majority of drones will be operating below 400 feet (122 meters), following federal regulations."

      "Former talk show host Carlos Watson has been sentenced to nearly 10 years in prison in the federal financial conspiracy case surrounding his once-buzzy Ozy Media",
      "NEW YORK -- Former talk show host Carlos Watson was sentenced Monday to nearly 10 years in prison in a federal financial conspiracy case that cast his once-buzzy Ozy Media as an extreme of fake-it-'til-you-make-it startup culture.",
      "In one example, another Ozy executive impersonated a YouTube executive to hype Ozy to investment bankers \u2014 while Watson coached him, prosecutors said.",
      "Watson, 55, and the now-defunct company were found guilty last summer of charges including wire fraud conspiracy. He has denied the allegations and plans to appeal.",
      "\u201cI loved what we built with Ozy,\u201d he said in court Monday, initially addressing supporters in the audience before the judge suggested he turn around. Watson told the judge he was a target of \u201cselective prosecution\u201d as a Black entrepreneur in Silicon Valley, where African American executives have been disproportionately few, and he called the case \u201ca modern lynching.\u201d",
      "\u201cI made mistakes. I'm very, very sorry that people are hurt, myself included,\u201d he said, but \u201cI don't think it's fair.\u201d",
      "Watson, who faced a mandatory minimum sentence of two years in prison and potentially as much as 37 years, remains free for now on $3 million bond. He is to surrender to prison March 28. Any restitution will be determined after a hearing in February.",
      "U.S. District Judge Eric Komitee said Monday that the \u201cquantum of dishonesty in this case is exceptional.\u201d",
      "\u201cYour internal apparatus for separating truth from fiction became badly miscalibrated,\u201d he told Watson in sentencing him.",
      "Prosecutors accused the former cable news commentator and host of playing a leading role in a scheme to deceive Ozy investors and lenders by inflating revenue numbers, touting deals and offers that were nonexistent or not finalized, and flashing other false indications of Ozy's success.",
      "Watson even listened in and texted talking points while his co-founder posed as a YouTube executive to praise Ozy on a phone call with potential investors, prosecutors said.",
      "\u201cHis incessant and deliberate lies demonstrated not only a brazen disregard for the rule of law, but also a contempt for the values of honesty and fairness that should underlie American entrepreneurship,\u201d Brooklyn-based U.S. Attorney Breon Peace said in a statement Monday. His office prosecuted the case.",
      "During the trial, Watson's defense blamed any misrepresentations on others, particularly co-founder Samir Rao and former Ozy chief of staff Suzee Han. She and Rao pleaded guilty, are awaiting sentencing and testified against Watson.",
      "Watson portrayed himself Monday as a founder who put everything he had into his company, saying that he took an average salary of around $51,000 from Ozy in its final years, has triple-mortgaged his home and drives a 15-year-old car.",
      "After court, he questioned why Brooklyn-based federal prosecutors had gone after a California-based company and founder. Prosecutors declined to comment; the indictment alleged that scheming happened in the Brooklyn-based jurisdiction and elsewhere.",
      "\u201cI do think this is an attack on Black excellence,\u201d Watson said after noting that his sentence wasn't far from the 11-year term meted out to Elizabeth Holmes. She's the white former Silicon Valley CEO convicted of duping investors in the Theranos blood-testing device hoax; she has appealed.",
      "There's no parallel between unreliable blood test technology and Ozy's roster of real programs and events, Watson said.",
      "Ozy, founded in 2012, was styled as a hub of news and culture for millennials with a global outlook.",
      "Watson boasted an impressive resume: degrees from Harvard University and Stanford Law School, a stint on Wall Street, on-air gigs at CNN and MSNBC, and entrepreneurial chops. Ozy Media was his second startup, coming a decade after he sold a test-prep company that he had founded while in his 20s.",
      "Mountain View, California-based Ozy produced TV shows, newsletters, podcasts, and a music-and-ideas festival. Watson hosted several of the TV programs, including the Emmy-winning \u201cBlack Women OWN the Conversation,\u201d which appeared on the Oprah Winfrey Network.",
      "Ozy snagged big advertisers, clients and grants. But beneath the outward signs of success was an overextended company that struggled \u2014 and dissembled \u2014 to stay afloat after 2017, according to insiders' testimony.",
      "The company strained to make payroll, ran late on rent and took out pricey cash advances to pay bills, former finance vice president Janeen Poutre told jurors. Meanwhile, Ozy gave prospective investors much bigger revenue numbers than those it reported to accountants, according to testimony and documents.",
      "On the witness stand in July, Watson said the company's cash squeezes were just a startup norm and its investors knew they were getting unaudited numbers that could change.",
      "The only investor who spoke at the sentencing was Beverly Watson, who stands by her brother. She told the court Monday that her biggest loss was \u201cthis important platform that elevated people and ideas that weren't being heard before.\u201d",
      "Ozy disintegrated in 2021, after a New York Times column disclosed the phone-call impersonation gambit and raised questions about the true size of the startup's audience."

    "story": [
      "TikTok is asking the Supreme Court to step in on an emergency basis to block the federal law that would ban the popular platform in the United States unless its China-based parent company agrees to sell it",
      "WASHINGTON -- TikTok on Monday asked the Supreme Court to step in on an emergency basis to block the federal law that would ban the popular platform in the United States unless its China-based parent company agreed to sell it.",
      "Lawyers for the company and China-based ByteDance urged the justices to step in before the law's Jan. 19 deadline. A similar plea was filed by content creators who rely on the platform for income and some of TikTok's more than 170 million users in the U.S.",
      "\u201cA modest delay in enforcing the Act will create breathing room for this Court to conduct an orderly review and the new Administration to evaluate this matter \u2014 before this vital channel for Americans to communicate with their fellow citizens and the world is closed,\u201d lawyers for the companies told the Supreme Court.",
      "President-elect Donald Trump, who once supported a ban but then pledged during the campaign to \u201csave TikTok,\u201d said his administration would take a look at the situation.",
      "\u201cAs you know, I have a warm spot in my heart for TikTok,\u201d Trump said during a news conference at his Mar-a-Lago club in Florida. His campaign saw the platform as a way to reach younger, less politically engaged voters.",
      "Trump was meeting with TikTok CEO Shou Zi Chew at Mar-a-Lago on Monday, according to two people familiar with the president-elect\u2019s plans who were not authorized to speak publicly about them and spoke to The Associated Press on condition of anonymity.",
      "The companies have said that a shutdown lasting just a month would cause TikTok to lose about a third of its daily users in the U.S. and significant advertising revenue.",
      "The case could attract the court's interest because it pits free speech rights against the government's stated aims of protecting national security, while raising novel issues about social media platforms.",
      "The request first goes to Chief Justice John Roberts, who oversees emergency appeals from courts in the nation's capital. He almost certainly will seek input from all nine justices.",
      "On Friday, a panel of federal judges on the U.S. Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit denied an emergency plea to block the law, a procedural ruling that allowed the case to move to the Supreme Court.",
      "The same panel had earlier unanimously upheld the law over a First Amendment challenge claiming that it violated free speech rights.",
      "Without a court-ordered freeze, the law would take effect Jan. 19 and expose app stores that offer TikTok and internet hosting services that support it to potential fines.",
      "It would be up to the Justice Department to enforce the law, investigating possible violations and seeking sanctions. But lawyers for TikTok and ByteDance have argued that Trump's Justice Department might pause enforcement or otherwise seek to mitigate the law's most severe consequences. Trump takes office a day after the law goes into effect.",
      "The Supreme Court could temporarily put the law on hold so that the justices can give fuller consideration to First Amendment and other issues. They also could quickly schedule arguments and try to render a decision by Jan. 19.",
      "On the other hand, the high court could reject the emergency appeal, which would allow the law to take effect as scheduled.",
      "With that last prospect in mind, the companies' lawyers asked for a ruling on their emergency request by Jan. 6 because they'd need the time \u201cto coordinate with their service providers to perform the complex task of shutting down the TikTok platform only in the United States.\u201d",
      "The case has made a relatively quick trip through the courts once bipartisan majorities in Congress approved the law and President Joe Biden signed it in April.",

      "\u201dThe Rivals\u201d is Jane Pek\u2019s latest mystery novel featuring the online dating detective Claudia Lin",
      "Claudia Lin, an online dating detective in the age of AI, is hunting once again through a dark cybersphere of tech systems in \u201cThe Rivals,\u201d the second novel in a new mystery series by Jane Pek.",
      "Pek, who introduced Claudia in her 2022 debut book, \u201cThe Verifiers,\u201d has given the mystery genre fresh trappings \u2014 a vivid New York City landscape of chatbots and apps that can create chaos or sniff out fraud, and a delightfully plucky new sleuth, who is in her mid-20s, Asian American and gay.",
      "In \u201cThe Rivals,\u201d Claudia and Becks Rittel are the co-owners of the fact-checking firm Veracity. It\u2019s a tiny business \u2014 it only has one other employee, the unkempt gamer Squirrel \u2014 but helps clients of giant matchmaking platforms make sure the strangers they meet for dates are not unscrupulous liars or worse.",
      "\u201cThe Rivals\u201d opens with a couple of customers from online meet-up sites seeking different kinds of assistance. One wants Veracity to make sure his new lady friend, the charming Amalia Suarez, is all she claims to be; the other, Pradeep Mehta, anxiously asks for help taking down a false online gay-dating profile that could ruin his life.",
      "Claudia takes on both projects, despite Becks\u2019 protests and disparagement. A curt, tough-minded colleague in her mid-30s, Becks is nicknamed the \u201cBlonde Assassin.\u201d In short order, both cases present Claudia with false turns, odd developments and scary possibilities. These twists make \u201cThe Rivals\u201d a modern mystery unfolding amid synthetic culprits \u2014 cyberworld bots known as \u201csynths\u201d \u2014 that can wreck real lives.",
      "Pek adds a few vital human ingredients to the story\u2019s digital mix. One is Claudia\u2019s striving but dysfunctional family. Her siblings, Charles and Coraline, and their irritable mother are introduced in an early chapter as they gather in the West Village for a meal celebrating the Chinese New Year. Coraline\u2019s beau is there, too. Their father is out of the picture. A celebration the meal is not, but the Lin family fracas adds sparks to the narrative throughout.",
      "Pek also makes neighborhoods and go-to sites of Manhattan, Brooklyn and other city environs an integral and appealing part of the story. Claudia, for example, plays Ultimate frisbee in Prospect Park and takes the reader on her many rendezvous, from the touristy High Line to a bike path through Fort Washington Park.",
      "Claudia\u2019s sexuality is not a central tug-of-war plot issue. But it does give an edgy lift to the story line when Claudia, as the novel\u2019s narrator, notes the inner romantic tingles set off in her by others.",
      "Pek writes with wit and AI savvy. At times \u201cThe Rivals\u201d unfolds with so much tech-heavy dialogue that it can be hard to follow. But Claudia is a winning new entry in the field of modern serial detectives. \u201cThe Rivals\u201d hints that she has more work in store. With the freshness of Pek\u2019s staging of online love and death, a third entry in the series will be welcome.",

    "story": [
      "A U.S. Senate committee says at least two internal Amazon studies have found a relationship between worker speed and injuries in the online retailer's warehouses",
      "At least two internal Amazon studies found a link between how quickly the online retailer's warehouse workers perform tasks and workplace injuries, but the company rejected many safety recommendations out of concern the proposed changes might reduce productivity, according to a U.S. Senate committee report.",
      "The 160-page review issued Sunday night was compiled by the Democratic majority staff of the Senate Committee on Health, Education, Labor, and Pensions. The report is the final product of a probe into Amazon\u2019s warehouse safety practices that U.S. Sen. Bernie Sanders initiated last year.",
      "The Vermont independent, a frequent critic of Amazon who chairs the panel, released an interim report in July that featured some findings from the investigation. The final report, which was mostly based on interviews with nearly 500 former and current Amazon workers, included more details, such as the two internal studies and the reactions they received inside the company.",
      "Amazon pushed back on the findings Monday, saying in a blog post that Sanders \u201ccontinues to mislead the American public\u201d about the company's safety practices and that the report was \u201cwrong on the facts and features selective, outdated information that lacks context and isn\u2019t grounded in reality.\"",
      "The Senate report said Amazon launched an internal study in 2021 to determine the maximum number of times a warehouse worker could perform the same physical tasks without increased risk of harm and potentially developing musculoskeletal disorders.",
      "The team conducting the Amazon study, known as Project Elderwand, focused on workers who picked items from robotic shelf units. The study concluded that the \u201clikelihood of back injury increases\" along with the number of items picked and identified an upper limit on repetitive movements - 1,940 - per 10-hour shift, the report said.",
      "The study recommended using software to implement breaks \u201caccording to each worker's rate.\u201d It suggested expanding an existing Amazon program that recommended \u201cmicrobreaks\u201d and making them mandatory for employees who worked above the maximum pace.",
      "The team stated that the success of a mini pilot program to test out its idea would be conditional on \u201cany negative impact to the (workers) or customer experience,\u201d according to documents cited in the committee report.",
      "Ultimately, Amazon did not make changes to reduce repetitive worker movements, the report said. The company told the Senate committee it chose not to do so due to \u201ctechnical reasons\u201d involving the proposed software program, the report said.",
      "Amazon also said in its blog post that the Project Elderwand pilot program showed the study team's suggested intervention was \u201cineffective.\"",
      "Amazon previously had undertaken another study, known as Project Soteria, in 2020 to identify risk factors for injuries and recommend policy changes that would improve worker safety. The multi-team initiative studied two policies Amazon implemented temporarily during the COVID-19 pandemic - giving workers more time off and pausing disciplinary measures \u201cfor workers who failed to meet speed requirements,\u201d the report said.",
      "The study found that both policies lowered injury risks and asked for their permanent adoption.",
      "But company leaders denied the request, saying it might \u201cnegatively impact\u201d productivity, according to Amazon documents cited in the Senate committee report. Amazon leaders also changed the focus of the Project Soteria study by telling the people conducting the review to provide recommendations on how to improve productivity without worsening worker injuries, the report said.",
      "Amazon disputed the report's characterization of the events.",
      "\u201cProject Soteria is an example of this type of team evaluation, where one team explored whether there\u2019s a causal link between pace of work and injuries and another team evaluated the methodology and findings and determined they weren\u2019t valid,\u201d Amazon spokesperson Kelly Nantel said in a written statement.",
      "Nantel also said that information about Project Soteria was raised in a Washington state worker safety case in which Amazon was accused of four safety violations. A judge assigned to the case ruled in Amazon's favor in July. Regulators are appealing the ruling.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s unfortunate that the senator chose to ignore the facts and all of this context,\u201d Nantel said.",
      "The Senate committee report also alleged that Amazon manipulates its workplace injury data to portray its warehouses as safer than they are, an allegation the company disputed.",
      "Amazon said it produced \u201cthousands of pages of information and data\u201d for the committee. The majority staff, however, said the company failed to produce documents on the connection between the pace of work and injuries.",
      "The author's of the committee report said they learned about the two internal studies from the Washington worker safety case, not Amazon. Once the committee staff members identified the studies by name, they reached out to the company, which ultimately provided the individual documents."

    "story": [
      "Drone-detecting devices deployed in New Jersey within the past week have shown little to no evidence of anything nefarious or threatening",
      "TRENTON, N.J. -- Drone-detecting devices deployed in New Jersey in the past week have found \u201clittle to no evidence\u201d of anything nefarious or threatening, Gov. Phil Murphy said Monday as calls grew for action to address the mysterious nighttime sightings of suspected unmanned flights across the northeastern U.S.",
      "Murphy told reporters in Trenton that there were 12 sightings of suspected drones in the state on Saturday and one on Sunday. He declined to go into detail about the detection equipment, but said it was powerful enough to disable the drones, although he added that is not legal on U.S. soil.",
      "Murphy, a Democrat, echoed calls by state officials elsewhere for Congress to allow them to deal with drones. Nearly all the power now rests with the federal government.",
      "\"It is extraordinary to me that, that a nation as great as ours and as powerful as ours has the deficiencies that we have now seen in living color as it relates to drone incursions,\u201d Murphy said.",
      "Federal officials, including Homeland Security Secretary Alejandro Mayorkas, have repeatedly said there are no signs that any drone operators have shown bad intent, nor is there evidence of foreign involvement.",
      "\u201cThere\u2019s no question that people are seeing drones,\u201d Mayorkas told ABC\u2019s George Stephanopoulos on Sunday. \u201cBut I want to assure the American public that we are on it. We are working in close coordination with state and local authorities.\u201d",
      "But that hasn't reassured everyone. Conspiracy theories about foreign actors, the U.S. government and the \u201cdeep state,\u201d abound online, while elected officials concerned about threats to military bases, airports and other locations have increased their calls for federal officials to act.",
      "The skeptics include President-elect Donald Trump, who suggested Monday that \"the government knows what is happening.\u201d",
      "\u201cOur military knows and our president knows and for some reason they want to keep people in suspense,\u201d Trump said. He refused to say whether he had been briefed on the drone sightings.",
      "New Jersey Sen. Andy Kim, a Democrat, told The Associated Press that officials could do a better job helping the public to understand what is going on, especially when people wrongly conclude they are seeing unmanned aircraft.",
      "\u201cWhat the public could use is like walking through that rather than just, you know, as a statement that says nothing, nothing to be concerned about,\u201d he said. \"I think it\u2019s reached a level of just public attention that some greater level of depth is necessary.\u201d",
      "Kim said he\u2019s heard no supporting evidence for the president-elect's statement Monday that information is being withheld and that a lack of faith in institutions is playing a key part in the saga.",
      "\u201cNothing that I\u2019m seeing, nothing that I\u2019ve engaged in gives me any impression of that nature. But like, I get it, some people won\u2019t believe me, right? Because that\u2019s the level of distrust that we face.\u201d",
      "Over the past two days, New York and Pennsylvania officials have also requested drone-detecting equipment from federal officials.",
      "\"It is imperative our communities in Pennsylvania are protected and questions on the presence of these drones are answered,\u201d U.S. Rep. Brian Fitzpatrick, a Pennsylvania Republican, wrote in a letter to Mayorkas on Monday. \"State-of-the-art radar systems will provide insights into where these drones are deploying from and what the motives for their flights may be.\u201d",
      "After reports of drones in Connecticut, state police said they were monitoring drone activity and state officials said analysts were comparing reported sightings with federal flight data.",
      "\u201cOne of the drone sightings had the word Frontier on the back, that was an airline,\u201d Connecticut Gov. Ned Lamont, a Democrat, said Monday. \u201cBut some of them are big and unexplained and we\u2019re going to get to the bottom of this. Right now, what we do is we make sure that our security and airports are secure.\u201d",
      "At a media briefing on Monday, the Pentagon's press secretary, Air Force Maj. Gen. Pat Ryder, said defense officials have seen no indication that the drones flying over multiple locations in the U.S. are being controlled by a foreign country. According to the Federal Aviation Administration, he said, there are approximately 1 million registered drones in the U.S. and about 8,000 are flying any given day.",
      "Ryder said that while military bases overseas can use surveillance methods that quickly address the origin of drones, that power is limited in U.S. airspace because of domestic surveillance laws. He said most drones are operated through either radio frequency transmissions or satellite-guided GPS navigation, which can provide information about the operators. If they're not controlled by those methods, that's another clue, he said.",
      "\u201cSo I\u2019m kind of talking around it because I don\u2019t necessarily want to get into talking classified capabilities, but the bottom line is that all of that gives us an idea that, hey, these are not foreign origin,\" Ryder said.",
      "Christopher Stadulis, a retired New York City firefighter and drone hobbyist, said he's seen clusters of drones near his home in Clinton Township, New Jersey. He said the lights he has seen at night are different from those used by commercial airlines, and the drones he has seen are very large.",
      "\u201cWhen you look at what I\u2019m seeing with the naked eye, you can see it\u2019s not a normal aircraft,\u201d he said in a recent interview. \"This and we don\u2019t have this much traffic, you know, usually on any given night in this area. So it seems like definitely some of them are aircraft that we can\u2019t explain what they are.\u201d",
      "More suspected drone sightings over the weekend led to a temporary airspace shutdown at Wright-Patterson Air Force Base near Dayton, Ohio, for about four hours late Friday into Saturday, and the arrests of two men in Boston accused of flying a drone \u201cdangerously close\u201d to Logan International Airport.",
      "U.S. Rep. Josh Gottheimer, a New Jersey Democrat, said Monday that he is introducing legislation calling on federal officials to provide public briefings on what they know about the drones and calling for a drone air traffic control system similar to those used for planes. He also wants law enforcement to be given access to drone detectors and the authority to \u201ctake out drones that shouldn't be in the air.\"",
      "\u201cI believe the people I represent and, as I\u2019ve been saying for some time now, the people in New Jersey and around the country deserve answers,\u201d he said in a statement. \u201cThey deserve transparency from their government.\u201d",

      "CAPE CANAVERAL, Fla. -- New research suggests that Saturn\u2019s rings may be older than they look \u2014 possibly as old as the planet.",
      "Instead of being a youthful 400 million years old as commonly thought, the icy, shimmering rings could be around 4.5 billion years old just like Saturn, a Japanese-led team reported Monday.",
      "The scientists surmise Saturn\u2019s rings may be pristine not because they are young but because they are dirt-resistant.",
      "Saturn's rings are long thought to be between 100 million and 400 million years old based on more than a decade of observations by NASA's Cassini spacecraft before its demise in 2017.",
      "Images by Cassini showed no evidence of any darkening of the rings by impacting micrometeoroids \u2014 space rock particles smaller than a grain of sand \u2014 prompting scientists to conclude the rings formed long after the planet.",
      "Through computer modeling, the Institute of Science Tokyo's Ryuki Hyodo and his team demonstrated that micrometeoroids vaporize once slamming into the rings, with little if any dark and dirty residue left behind. They found that the resulting charged particles get sucked toward Saturn or out into space, keeping the rings spotless and challenging the baby rings theory. Their results appear in the journal Nature Geoscience.",
      "Hyodo said it's possible Saturn's rings could be somewhere between the two extreme ages \u2014 around the halfway mark of 2.25 billion years old. But the solar system was much more chaotic during its formative years with large planetary-type objects migrating and interacting all over the place, just the sort of scenario that would be conducive to producing Saturn's rings.",
      "\u201cConsidering the solar system\u2019s evolutionary history, it\u2019s more likely that the rings formed closer to\" Saturn's earliest times, he said in an email.",

    "summary": "The teenage girl alleged to have shot seven victims, two fatally, in an attack on Monday at a Wisconsin school marks the rare occurrence of a female school shooter.",
    "story": [
      "Between 2000 to 2022, 94% of school shooters were male.",
      "The 15-year-old girl alleged to have shot seven victims, two fatally, in an attack on Monday at a Wisconsin Christian school marks the rare occurrence of a female school shooter, according to data from the FBI and U.S. Secret Service.",
      "Police identified the suspect in the shooting at Abundant Life Christian School in Madison as Natalie Rupnow, a student at the school who went by the name Samantha.",
      "After allegedly killing a teacher and a classmate, and leaving five others injured, including two students in critical condition, Rupnow died from a self-inflicted gunshot wound, according to police.",
      "\"It's a very sad but a rare thing to have a female school shooter,\" said Don Mihalek, a retired senior special agent for the Secret Service and an ABC News contributor. \"Historically, and the studies show, that typically it's a white male student or former student that ends up committing these acts of violence in schools.\"",
      "The U.S. Secret Service National Threat Assessment Center (NTAC) studied 41 incidents of targeted school violence incidents between 2008 and 2017, including those where no one was injured, and found that 83% of the suspects were male and 17% were female.",
      "Another study by the FBI found that of the 49 shooters involved in 48 active shooting incidents in the United States in 2023, 98% were male.",
      "Among the perpetrators who committed school shootings in 2023 was 28-year-old Audrey Hale, who killed three students and three staff members at the Covenant School in Nashville, Tennessee, where authorities said she was once a student. Hale owned seven firearms, including three used in the shooting at the private school, according to police. Officials said that Hale was being treated for an unspecified emotional disorder. Hale was killed on the scene by two officers.",
      "A police spokesperson told ABC News that Hale was assigned female at birth and pointed to a social media account linked to Hale that included the use of the pronouns he/him.",
      "An FBI review of 345 suspects involved in 333 active shooting incidents between 2000 and 2019, including 62 that occurred in educational environments, 332 were male and 13 were female.",
      "The Gun Violence Archive, a website that tracks all shootings in the United States, found that of the 805 school shooting incidents since 2012, 157 involved female \"participants.\"",
      "The National Center for Education Statistics also found that 94% of the active shooters in education settings between 2000 and 2022 were male.",
      "Madison police investigators have not yet suggested a motive for Monday's school shooting nor have they said whether the victims were specifically targeted.",
      "The suspect's parents are cooperating with the investigation, Madison Police Chief Shon Barnes told ABC News.",
      "Students in kindergarten through 12th grade attend the Christian school. Police said the shooting was contained to \"a classroom in a study hall full of students from multiple grade levels.\"",
      "Police have also yet to say where the suspect got her hands on the handgun used in the shooting.",
      "\"In almost all of these situations, the students that have access to weapons have generally accessed them from parents, family,\" Mihalek said.",
      "Mihalek said one of the few female active shooters in recent years that he could recall was Portia Odufuwa, then 37, who opened fire inside Dallas' Love Field Airport in 2022 before she was shot and wounded by police. No one else was injured in the shooting and Odufuwa was found not guilty by reason of insanity in 2023 on charges of aggravated assault.",
      "Other female active shooters include Jennifer San Marco, a former U.S. Postal employee who in January 2006 shot and killed six people at a mail processing and distribution center near Santa Barbara, California, after killing her neighbor, according to police. San Marco died from suicide.",
      "In 2015, Tashfeen Malik, 29, and her husband, Syed Rizwan Farook, 28, who had both pledged support for ISIS, fatally shot 14 people at a December 2015 holiday party in San Bernardino, California. Malik and Farook were killed in a shootout with police.",
      "Mihalek said investigators are likely combing through the social media footprint of the suspect in the Wisconsin school shooting as they search for a motive.",
      "\"I think there\u2019s a lot of stuff on social media that is creating these mental health crises within kids, especially girls,\" Mihalek said. \"Now, instead of finding your self-worth in good grades, doing well on a sports team, playing a musical instrument well, teachers and parents telling you 'good job,' it\u2019s how many likes, how many people are viewing your feed.\"",
      "Mihalek said that a lot of girls have been the victims of online bullying.",
      "\"It\u2019s tearing apart a kid's fabric and a lot of them don\u2019t know how to handle it because they\u2019re not really capable at these young ages to understand how to handle a bullying incident like that,\" Mihalek said. \u201cIn all schools, the key is homing in on behaviors and the pathways to violence. The critical behaviors that put kids on a pathway to violence are social stressors and grievances. If you're being cyberbullied and told you're no good online by multiple people, that can easily become a grievance.\"",

Sources told ABC News that Siri has been helping interview candidates for top health jobs in the incoming Trump administration.

      "\"I hope to be able to get to a position where I can support him enthusiastically. I'm looking forward to his confirmation hearings. We take those seriously,\" the senator added.",
      "Sen. Tommy Tuberville, R-Ala., however, told reporters that Kennedy is a \"breath of fresh air\" who has his support.",
      "Tuberville, who has no medical background, brushed off concerns about Kennedy's views on vaccines and claimed, without any evidence or details, that they were not \"100% proven.\"",

      "Electors nationwide met Tuesday to cast their Electoral College votes.",
      "More than a dozen Republican officials accused of signing false certifications claiming Donald Trump had won their states' electoral votes in the 2020 election served as electors Tuesday, this time casting real votes for the president-elect.",
      "Thirteen alleged \"fake electors\" cast Electoral College votes in Pennsylvania, Nevada and Michigan despite some of the officials still facing criminal charges from the last election. All have pleaded not guilty.",
      "As part of a process cemented in the Constitution as well as local laws, presidential electors across the country met Tuesday to cast their Electoral College votes, finalizing Trump's victory. Trump was projected to get 312 electoral votes, while Vice President Kamala Harris was projected to get 226.",
      "When the same process played out four years ago, with 306 electoral votes going to President Joe Biden, Trump and his allies allegedly organized false slates of electors in seven states as part of a scheme to overturn the election, according to a federal indictment charging Trump for his conduct. The former president pleaded not guilty, and the case was dismissed at the request of prosecutors after he was elected due to a Department of Justice policy of prohibiting criminal cases against sitting presidents.",
      "Mimicking the procedures followed by legitimate electors, the fake electors met on the same day as the real electors but allegedly signed false certifications declaring Trump the winner. Some of the electors are alleged to have knowingly signed the false certificates to influence the results, while others were misled by Trump and his allies, who said the certificates would only be used if Trump's lawsuits alleging widespread voter fraud were successful, according to the indictment.",
      "To determine overlap, ABC News reviewed the 2020 alleged fake elector certificates with the current list of electors released by either the state parties or state elections offices.",
      "In Nevada, two electors who were indicted on charges of falsely declaring Trump the winner of Nevada's electoral votes in 2020 participated as electors on Tuesday.",
      "Nevada Attorney General Aaron Ford refiled his charges against six Republican fake electors last week after a judge dismissed the original case over a venue issue.",
      "In Michigan, six of the 2020 alleged fake electors returned to cast electoral votes on Tuesday. They have all pleaded not guilty to the criminal charges filed against them.",
      "The returning electors in Michigan are all facing felony charges over the alleged 2020 scheme and are awaiting a judge's ruling regarding whether the case will proceed to trial. They have all pleaded not guilty.",
      "In Pennsylvania, five of the certified presidential electors for 2024 are also people who signed the alleged fake elector certificate in 2020, according to a review of the 2020 certificates and names of 2024 electors from state officials. No criminal charges have been filed against them.",
      "Rex VanMiddlesworth, a constitutional legal expert and board member of the nonpartisan civic education and elections group Keep Our Republic, told ABC News that the participation of the so-called fake electors could reflect the current state of the Republican Party.",
      "\"I think it's evidence of how deeply ingrained in the Republican Party the belief that the election was stolen in 2020 -- and so it's not a disqualifier in the party. If anything, it's a badge of honor in the party to have stood up and fought the results of the 2020 election,\" he said.",
      "Following Biden being declared the winner in 2020, Trump filed lawsuits in several battleground states in an attempt to overturn the election results, arguing the election was \"stolen.\" However, though his lawsuits led to the 2020 election results being contested in court, his claims proved to be unfounded.",
      "VanMiddlesworth, who co-chairs the organization's anti-subversion task force, said there are relatively limited requirements to be an elector and that there likely are no legal issues against the electors participating again, even those who face charges. He emphasized as well that the Electoral Count Reform and Presidential Transition Improvement Act, passed in 2022, made the Electoral College process much clearer and in part has contributed to a smoother certification process this year.",
      "\"The job of the electors is to vote for whoever their state voted for,\" VanMiddlesworth said. \"Truthfully, their identity shouldn't affect that and should not matter.\"",
      "He added that \"there's nothing really untoward this year about what they're doing,\" as they are set to vote properly for whom their states voted for.",
      "Prosecutors in Georgia, Nevada, Arizona and Wisconsin brought criminal cases against some of the alleged fake electors. Some of the states do not have returning electors, and these are the ones where criminal cases have been brought, though many of the cases have been beset by issues.",
      "The criminal case in Georgia against Trump and multiple defendants, including three alleged fake electors, has been stalled since June while an appeals court considers the former president's challenge to Judge Scott McAfee's decision not to disqualify Fulton County District Attorney Fani Willis over a relationship with a prosecutor. The judge overseeing the Arizona fake electors case recused himself after he told fellow judges to respond to attacks against Vice President Kamala Harris. The Nevada fake electors case was dismissed earlier this year over a venue issue, though the state's attorney general refiled the case in a different county.",

      "Robert F. Kennedy Jr., President-elect Donald Trump's choice to leading the Health and Human Services Department, said Monday he's \"all for the polio vaccine\" in a brief interview with ABC News, though he did not respond to questions on issues like school vaccine mandates.",
      "Kennedy was on Capitol Hill to meet with Republican Sens. Rick Scott of Florida, Ron Johnson of Wisconsin, Markwayne Mullin of Oklahoma, and Tim Scott of South Carolina. He will have meetings with more Republican senators during the week.",
      "Heading into his final meeting of the day with Tim Scott, Kennedy said his meetings have been \"very productive.\"",
      "Rick Scott said he and Kennedy had discussed \"transparency\" around vaccines.",
      "\"So, what he wants with vaccines is, which is what I believe in, is transparency,\" Rick Scott told reporters outside his office. \"I think we, we need to know exactly, with all vaccines, what has been the, the research and, you know, do they work? What's your risk?\"",
      "Kennedy, a former Democrat who allied with Trump during the 2024 election, has faced questions over several of his health-related beliefs.",
      "He has in the past promoted the debunked theory linking vaccines to autism, and a lawyer helping Kennedy hire staffers for the incoming administration has pushed for the revocation of the federal approval for the polio vaccine. His support of abortion rights could threaten support from Republicans, and his opposition to things like hog farm subsidies for seed oils, among other things, could irk senators from agriculture-heavy states.",
      "To be sure, Trump's policies are anticipated to rule the day within his own administration for the next four years, but Kennedy's tour on Capitol Hill could look to allay some concerns voiced by Republicans, including outgoing Senate GOP Leader Mitch McConnell.",
      "\"Efforts to undermine public confidence in proven cures are not just uninformed -- they're dangerous,\" McConnell, a polio survivor, said in a statement Friday. \"Anyone seeking the Senate's consent to serve in the incoming Administration would do well to steer clear of even the appearance of association with such efforts.\"",
      "Currently, all 50 states and Washington, D.C., have laws requiring vaccines to attend schools, although many offer exemptions.",
      "Trump, during a press conference Monday, dismissed worries that Kennedy would do away with the polio vaccine but said he's \"not a big mandate person\" and that Kennedy would investigate the impact of immunizations.",
      "\"I want him to come back with a report as to what he thinks. We're going to find out a lot,\" he said.",
      "Republican Sen. Josh Hawley of Missouri said he is looking forward to a \u201chopefully good discussion, with Kennedy later this week but disagrees with the his views on agriculture.",
      "Asked about Kennedy's views on GMOs and seed oils, Hawley, who represents a farm state, said, \u201cThose are interesting ideas. I don't agree with most of them.\u201d",
      "\u201cI think he's, you know, he's against much of the Farm Bill, which I think is deeply misguided, but he will not have any policy control over that, I don't think,\" Hawley said. \"If he were nominated for the [Department of Agriculture], I\u2019d talk about that quite a lot, so. But we'll see -- I mean, I'll probably raise that with him, but I imagine our conversation will focus on HHS-related issues.\u201d",

      "Trump has previously insisted he would need only 24 hours to end the war between Russia and Ukraine, which has now pressed on for more than 1,000 days. But on Monday, he said he anticipated that would be \u201cmore difficult\u201d to resolve than the current turmoil in the Middle East, which is rooted in the century-old Israeli Palestinian conflict.",
      "\u201cI see that as more difficult,\u201d Trump said, before decrying the Biden administration\u2019s recent decision to loosen restrictions on Ukraine\u2019s use of American-supplied arms in recent weeks, allowing Kyiv to strike deeper inside Russian territory.",
      "\u201cI don\u2019t think that should have been allowed,\u201d he said. \u201cCertainly not just weeks before I take over.",
      "Trump then said he might reverse the decision, adding \u201cI thought it was a very stupid thing to do.\u201d",
      "The president-elect also suggested he might expect Kyiv to hand over land to Russia as part of negotiated peace, signaling a departure from the Biden administration\u2019s longstanding policy that Ukraine should steer any discussion on making territorial concessions in order to end the war.",
      "\u201cAll those cities are destroyed,\u201d he said. \u201cIt's nice to say they want their land back, but the cities are largely destroyed.\u201d",
      "Trump said he would speak to Russian leader Vladimir Putin and Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy before weighing in on how much land Ukraine should cede, but said it was still possible a deal to end the war could be reached before he entered the White House.",
      "He also spoke about the devastation the war had caused in vivid terms, without expressly blaming Moscow for igniting it.",
      "\u201cIt's a carnage that we haven't seen since the Second World War. It's got to be stopped. And I'm doing I'm doing my best to stop it,\u201d he said.",
      "The president-elect was also asked by ABC\u2019s Selina Wang if the Kremlin should have to hand over former Syrian dictator, Bashar al-Assad, who fled rebel fighters by escaping to Russia.",
      "\u201cWell, I hadn't thought of it. I think we have to get on with our lives. I have to see what happens,\u201d Trump responded.",
      "The president-elect said he was already actively engaged on other matters related to the Middle East, saying he had a \u201cvery good talk\u201d with Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu over the weekend.",
      "Trump also reiterated a demand he made in a post on his Truth Social site earlier this month that all hostages held in Gaza should be released prior to his inauguration, saying otherwise there would be \u201cALL HELL TO PAY.\u201d",
      "Asked about what the consequences Hamas would face if all the detainees were not freed by that point, Trump responded \u201cthey\u2019re going to have to determine what that means.\u201d",
      "\u201cBut it means it won\u2019t be pleasant,\u201d he added.",
      "Trump\u2019s statements come as the State Department and some Israeli officials are signaling progress towards a limited deal to exchange some of the hostages held by Hamas for a temporary ceasefire in Gaza.",
      "According to two U.S. officials familiar with the negotiations, Hamas has shown more willingness to compromise in recent days -- indicating it would temporarily tolerate the presence of some Israeli forces in the enclave during a ceasefire. The group has also provided information on some hostages Hamas said it would release as part of an agreement, they added.",
      "\u201cWe are we are pushing as hard as we know how to do at this point, and we believe we can get to a deal,\u201d State Department spokesperson Matthew Miller said on Monday. \u201cIt remains incumbent on Hamas and Israel agreeing to those final terms and getting it over the line. And I can't good conscience tell you stand here and tell you that that's going to happen, but it should happen.\u201d",

      "Trump originally tried to ban TikTok in his first administration, but has since reversed course, vowing on the campaign trail to \u201csave\u201d the app. It\u2019s not clear how he would do so, given the legislation passed with strong bipartisan support and would require approval from both the House and Senate.",
      "TikTok filed an emergency application with the U.S. Supreme Court on Monday seeking a temporary injunction that would delay the ban on the app from taking effect while the company seeks formal review by the justices.",
      "President Joe Biden signed the Protecting Americans from Foreign Adversary Controlled Applications Act, which was part of a massive, $95 billion foreign aid package passed by Congress, in April. As part of the act, TikTok, which has more than 170 million U.S. users, is forced to sell the company from its current Chinese-based owner ByteDance.",
      "Biden and some congressional leaders argued that the ultimatum against TikTok was necessary because of security concerns about ByteDance and its connections to the Chinese government.",
      "Lawmakers have warned Apple and Google to be ready to remove TikTok from their app stores on Jan. 19. They also wrote to TikTok\u2019s CEO, urging him to look for a buyer.",

    "published": "Tue, 17 Dec 2024 07:01:00 -0500",
    "summary": "Judge Juan Merchan said the evidence related \u201centirely to unofficial conduct\u201d and \u201cposes no danger of intrusion on the authority and function of the Executive Branch.\u201d",
    "story": [
      "Judge Juan Merchan said the evidence \"poses no danger\" to the executive branch.",
      "The New York judge in President-elect Donald Trump's criminal hush money case ruled Monday that the Supreme Court's presidential immunity decision does not apply to that case.",
      "Trump had sought to dismiss his criminal indictment and vacate the jury verdict on the grounds that prosecutors, during the trial last May, introduced evidence relating to Trump's official acts as president, after the Supreme Court later ruled in July that Trump is entitled to presumptive immunity from criminal prosecution for official acts undertaken while in office.",
      "However, Judge Juan Merchan said on Monday that the evidence in Trump's hush money case related \"entirely to unofficial conduct\" and \"poses no danger of intrusion on the authority and function of the Executive Branch.\"",
      "Trump was found guilty in May on 34 felony counts of falsifying business records related to a hush money payment made to adult film actress Stormy Daniels in order to boost his electoral prospects in the 2016 presidential election. Judge Merchan has yet to hand down a sentence.",
      "In his ruling Monday, Merchan found that there was \"overwhelming evidence of guilt\" that led the jury to convict Trump at trial.",
      "Trump's attorneys, arguing for immunity, had emphasized the importance of former White House Communications Director Hope Hicks' testimony, including her recounting of interactions with Trump in 2018 when reporting about the alleged hush money payment to Stormy Daniels broke, to demonstrate Trump's knowledge of the payment and his preference that the story came out after the election.",
      "Defense lawyers used a similar argument to argue that tweets from Trump -- which prosecutors used to demonstrate an alleged \"pressure campaign\" to prevent Trump's former attorney Michael Cohen from cooperating with authorities in 2018 -- were official communications protected by immunity because the posts \"fall well within the core authority of the Nation's Chief Executive.\"",
      "But Merchan on Monday rejected Trump's argument that the testimony of Hicks, Trump's Twitter posts about Cohen, and other evidence, constitute official acts.",
      "\"Just as the title of Communications Director does not bestow absolute immunity to any and all communications with Ms. Hicks, neither does mere reference to the Justice Department convert a Tweet to an official act,\" Merchan wrote in his ruling.",
      "\"It is therefore logical and reasonable to conclude that if the act of falsifying records to cover up the payments so that the public would not be made aware is decidedly an unofficial act, so too should the communications to further that same cover-up be unofficial,\" the judge wrote.",
      "Trump has also offered another argument that he is entitled to presidential immunity because he is now president-elect, which Merchan has yet to rule on.",
      "Last week, the Manhattan district attorney's office urged Merchan to preserve the jury's verdict and sentence Trump at some later date following his second term, but Trump's attorneys blasted that proposal as \"thuggish tactics.\"",
      "In a letter accompanying Monday's ruling, Merchan referenced a forthcoming filing from Trump's lawyers alleging \"juror misconduct,\" which has yet to be made public.",
      "Merchan wrote that Trump's argument \"consists entirely of unsworn allegations,\" but that he will allow the president-elect's lawyers to file a redacted version of their claims.",
      "\"Thus, this Court finds that to allow the public filing of the letters without redactions and without the benefit of a hearing would only serve to undermine the integrity of these proceedings while simultaneously placing the safety of the jurors at grave risk,\" Merchan wrote.",
      "The judge said that he would consider Trump's claims if he submitted a motion to throw out the case with sworn testimony backing up the allegation of juror misconduct, rather than the unsworn allegations provided by Trump's lawyers in their recent filing.",
      "\"Allegations of juror misconduct should be thoroughly investigated. However, this Court is prohibited from deciding such claims on the basis of mere hearsay and conjecture,\" the judge wrote.",
      "Merchan's letter did not provide any additional context about Trump's allegation of juror misconduct, and Trump's filings have not been posted to the court's public docket.",

      "More than 600,000 people annually visit Santa Claus Village, a winter-themed amusement park in the small town of Rovaniemi in Finland",
      "ROVANIEMI, Finland -- Shuffling across icy ground on a cold December afternoon, lots of tourist groups poured into Santa Claus Village, a winter-themed amusement park perched on the edge of the Arctic Circle.",
      "They frolic in the snow, take a reindeer sleigh ride, sip a cocktail in an ice bar or even meet Saint Nick himself in the capital of Finnish Lapland, Rovaniemi, which happily calls itself the \u201cofficial hometown of Santa Claus.\"",
      "The Santa Claus Village theme park, which attracts more than 600,000 people annually, is especially popular during the holiday season.",
      "\u201cThis is like my dream came true,\u201d beamed Polish visitor Elzbieta Nazaruk. \u201cI\u2019m really excited to be here.\u201d",
      "Tourism is booming in Rovaniemi \u2014 which has hotel and restaurant owners, as well as city officials, excited as it brings lots of money to the town. However, not everyone is happy about the onslaught of visitors, 10 times the town's population, each year at Christmas time.",
      "\u201cWe are worried about the overgrowth of tourism. Tourism has grown so rapidly, it\u2019s not anymore in control,\u201d said 43-year-old Antti Pakkanen, a photographer and member of a housing network that in September organized a rally through the city\u2019s streets.",
      "It\u2019s a feeling that has been echoed in other popular European travel destinations, including Barcelona, Amsterdam, Malaga and Florence.",
      "Across the continent, locals have protested against \u201cover-tourism\u201d \u2014 which generally describes the tipping point at which visitors and their cash stop benefiting residents and instead cause harm by degrading historic sites, overwhelming infrastructure and making life markedly more difficult for those who live there.",
      "Now, it seems to have spread north, all the way to the edges of the Arctic Circle.",
      "Rovaniemi counted a record 1.2 million overnight visitors in 2023, almost 30 percent growth on 2022, after rebounding from pandemic travel disruptions.",
      "\u201cNordic is a trend,\u201d Visit Rovaniemi CEO Sanna Karkkainen, said as she stood in an ice restaurant, where snow carvers were working nearby.",
      "\u201cPeople want to travel to cool countries to see the snow, to see the Northern Lights, and, of course, to see Santa Claus,\" she added.",
      "Thirteen new flight routes to Rovaniemi Airport opened this year, bringing passengers from Geneva, Berlin, Bordeaux and more. Most tourists come from European countries like France, Germany and the UK, but Rovaniemi\u2019s appeal has also spread further.",
      "Hotel availability is scarce this winter, and Tiina M\u00e4\u00e4tt\u00e4, general manager of the 159-room Original Sokos Hotel, expects 2024 to break more records.",
      "Local critics of mass tourism say many apartment buildings in Rovaniemi\u2019s city center are also used for accommodation services during peak season and are thus no longer available for residential use. They say the proliferation of short-term rentals has driven up prices, squeezed out long-term residents, and turned its city center into a \u201ctransient space for tourists.\"",
      "Finnish law prohibits professional accommodation services in buildings intended for residential use, so campaigners are calling on authorities to act.",
      "\u201cThe rules must be enforced better,\u201d said Pakkanen.",
      "Not everyone agrees. Mayor Ulla-Kirsikka Vainio notes some make \u201cgood money\u201d on short-term rentals.",
      "Either way, stricter regulations likely won\u2019t be in place to impact this winter season, and despite the unease expressed by locals, mass tourism to Rovaniemi is probably only going to grow in 2025 \u2014 as visitors want to experience the unique atmosphere up north, especially during the holiday season.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s Christmas time and we would love to see the Northern Lights,\u201d says Joy, a visitor from Bangkok. \u201cRovaniemi seems to be a good place.\u201d"

      "Indiana has carried out its first execution in 15 years by putting to death a man convicted of killing four people decades ago, including his brother and his sister\u2019s fianc\u00e9",
      "MICHIGAN CITY, Ind. -- An Indiana man convicted of killing four people including his brother and his sister\u2019s fianc\u00e9 decades ago was put to death Wednesday, marking the state\u2019s first execution in 15 years.",
      "Joseph Corcoran, 49, was pronounced dead at 12:44 a.m. CST at the Indiana State Prison in Michigan City, Indiana, the Indiana Department of Correction said in a statement. Corcoran was scheduled to be executed with the powerful sedative pentobarbital, but the state agency\u2019s statement did not mention that drug. Corcoran\u2019s execution was the 24th in the U.S. this year.",
      "He was convicted in the July 1997 shootings of his brother, 30-year-old James Corcoran, his sister\u2019s fianc\u00e9, 32-year-old Robert Scott Turner, and two other men, Timothy G. Bricker, 30, and Douglas A. Stillwell, 30.",
      "According to court records, before Corcoran fatally shot the four victims he was under stress because the forthcoming marriage of his sister to Turner would necessitate moving out of the Fort Wayne, Indiana, home he shared with his brother and sister.",
      "While jailed for those killings, Corcoran reportedly bragged about fatally shooting his parents in 1992 in northern Indiana\u2019s Steuben County. He was charged in their killings but acquitted.",
      "Last summer, Gov. Eric Holcomb announced plans to resume state executions following a yearslong hiatus marked by a scarcity of lethal injection drugs nationwide.",
      "The state provided limited details about the execution process, and no media witnesses were permitted under state law. However, Corcoran chose a reporter for the Indiana Capital Chronicle as one of his witnesses, the Indiana politics website reported.",
      "Indiana and Wyoming are the only two states that do not allow members of the media to witness state executions, according to a recent report by the Death Penalty Information Center.",
      "Corcoran\u2019s attorneys had fought his death penalty sentence for years, arguing he was severely mentally ill, which affected his ability to understand and make decisions. This month his attorneys asked the Indiana Supreme Court to stop his execution but the request was denied.",
      "Corcoran exhausted his federal appeals in 2016. But his attorneys asked the U.S. District Court of Northern Indiana last week to stop his execution and hold a hearing to decide if it would be unconstitutional because Corcoran has a serious mental illness. The court declined to intervene Friday, and the U.S. Court of Appeals for the 7th Circuit did the same Tuesday.",
      "Corcoran\u2019s attorneys then asked the U.S. Supreme Court issue an emergency order halting his execution, but the high court denied their request for a stay late Tuesday, ending Corcoran\u2019s options with the courts.",
      "Defense attorney Larry Komp said that he was disappointed with the high court\u2019s decision, adding that the question of Corcoran\u2019s mental health was not properly evaluated.",
      "\u201cThere has never been a hearing to determine whether is he competent to be executed,\u201d Komp said in a statement to The Associated Press. \u201cIt is an absolute failure for the rule of law to have an execution when the law and proper processes were not followed.\u201d",
      "Corcoran's sole remaining hope then became Holcomb, who could have commuted Corcoran\u2019s death sentence. But that commutation never came and the execution proceeded as scheduled.",
      "At midnight, a group of activists who oppose the death penalty began singing \u201cAmazing Grace.\u201d",
      "Holcomb's office released a statement early Wednesday following Corcoran's execution.",
      "\u201cJoseph Corcoran\u2019s case has been reviewed repeatedly over the last 25 years \u2013 including 7 times by the Indiana Supreme Court and 3 times by the U.S. Supreme Court, the most recent of which was tonight. His sentence has never been overturned and was carried out as ordered by the court,\u201d Holcomb said in the statement.",
      "Indiana\u2019s last state execution was in 2009 when Matthew Wrinkles was put to death for killing his wife, her brother and sister-in-law in 1994. Since then, 13 executions were carried out in Indiana but those were initiated and performed by federal officials in 2020 and 2021 at a federal prison in Terre Haute.",
      "State officials have said they couldn\u2019t continue executions because a combination of drugs used in lethal injections had become unavailable.",
      "For years, there has been a shortage across the country because pharmaceutical companies have refused to sell their products for that purpose. That\u2019s pushed states, including Indiana, to turn to compounding pharmacies, which manufacture drugs specifically for a client. Some use more accessible drugs such as the sedatives pentobarbital or midazolam, both of which, critics say, can cause intense pain.",
      "Religious groups, disability rights advocates and others have opposed his execution. About a dozen people, some holding candles, held a vigil late Tuesday to pray outside the prison, which is surrounded by barbed wire fences in a residential area about 60 miles (90 kilometers) east of Chicago.",
      "\u201cWe can build a society without giving governmental authorities the right to execute their own citizens,\u201d said Bishop Robert McClory of the Diocese of Gary, who led the prayers.",
      "Other death penalty opponents also demonstrated outside the prison Tuesday night, some holding signs that read \u201cExecution Is Not The Solution\u201d and \u201cRemember The Victims But Not With More Killing.\u201d",
      "\u201cThere is no need and no benefit from this execution. It\u2019s all show,\u201d said Abraham Borowitz, director of Death Penalty Action, his organization that protests every execution in the U.S.",
      "Prison officials said in a brief statement Tuesday evening that Corcoran \u201crequested Ben & Jerry\u2019s ice cream for his last meal.\u201d",
      "Corcoran said farewell late Tuesday to relatives, including his wife, Tahina Corcoran, who told reporters outside the prison that they discussed their faith and their memories, including attending high school together. She reiterated her request for Indiana\u2019s governor to commute her husband\u2019s death sentence.",
      "Tahina Corcoran said her husband was \u201cvery mentally ill\u201d and she didn't think he fully grasped what was happening to him.",
      "\u201cHe is in shock. He doesn\u2019t understand,\u201d she said.",

    "story": [
      "Elon Musk\u2019s attachment to President-elect Donald Trump has created an unprecedented alliance between America\u2019s most powerful politician and its richest businessman",
      "WASHINGTON -- WASHINGTON (AP) \u2014 Elon Musk, clad in tuxedo and black tie, took the stage at President-elect Donald Trump's Mar-a-Lago resort shortly after the election with all the swagger of the winning candidate himself.",
      "\u201cThe public has given us a mandate that could not be more clear, the clearest mandate. The people have spoken. The people want change,\" Musk told the audience of Trump's biggest donors, campaign leaders and appointment seekers. \u201cWe are going to shake things up. It's going to be a revolution.\u201d",
      "Musk's attachment to Trump has created an alliance between America's most powerful politician and its richest businessman \u2014 and roughly the same percentages of Americans have favorable views of each, according to a new poll from the AP-NORC Center for Public Affairs Research.",
      "Experts are split on whether that overlap in public opinion is a good or bad thing for Musk\u2019s businesses or for Trump\u2019s politics. But it could have far-reaching effects in both realms.",
      "Musk, whose net worth tops $400 billion, oversees six businesses while continuing to work closely with Trump: electric car manufacturer Tesla, the X social media platform, space technology company SpaceX, brain link company Neuralink, the startup xAI and tunneling operator The Boring Co.",
      "\u201cEven though there\u2019s a negative impact, in terms of potentially alienating some of their customers that might not be fans of Trump, the benefits far outweigh any negatives when it comes to having a right-hand seat next to Trump in the White House,\u201d said Dan Ives, an analyst at Wedbush Securities.",
      "Ross Gerber, CEO of Gerber Kawasaki Wealth and Investment Management, identified himself as an investor in Musk's Tesla and a driver of Tesla\u2019s new Cybertruck, the futuristic pickup that has gotten huge amounts of attention but also been the subject of safety concerns and multiple recalls.",
      "\u201cHaving your CEO not working at your company and working at the job of having to fire government employees ... as a shareholder, I\u2019m paying someone to not work for my company,\u201d he said. \u201cAs a Cybertruck owner with self-driving that sucks and doesn\u2019t work, I\u2019m like, \u2018Dude, this isn\u2019t fair.\u2019\u201d",
      "But despite his skepticism, Gerber said he won\u2019t stop investing in Musk\u2019s businesses.",
      "\u201cI\u2019ve made a lot of money with Elon,\u201d he said. \u201cI\u2019m not in the business of investing based on the popularity of CEOs.\u201d",
      "Musk doesn\u2019t appear to give Trump much boost with people who don\u2019t back the incoming president.",
      "He is no more popular with the U.S. public than the president-elect himself, and viewed unfavorably by about half of Americans, according to the AP-NORC poll.",
      "About 4 in 10 Americans have a somewhat or very favorable view of the world\u2019s richest person, very similar to the percentage who view Trump positively. Likewise, about half of adults have a somewhat or very unfavorable view of Musk \u2014 again, similar to Trump.",
      "Instead, said one political strategist, Musk is the ideal validator for someone who cultivates an image of success in business and who has stocked his Cabinet and key adviser roles with billionaires.",
      "\"Trump has always pushed this narrative that he\u2019s a successful developer and a very successful businessman. I think having Musk with him is his double-down on this business success, good-for-the-economy, good-for-everybody-making money kind of persona,\u201d said Christine Matthews, a national political pollster who has worked for Republicans. \u201cIn this case, Musk is seen as this successful, innovative, tech entrepreneur, frontier-buster.\u201d",
      "Musk also has at his disposal X, the social media platform formerly known as Twitter that he purchased and turned into a megaphone for conservative ideas. And having spent an estimated $250 million to support Trump in the election, Musk has signaled he is willing to back Republican primary challenges to GOP members in the House and Senate seeking reelection in 2026 who waver on Trump's appointments and agenda.",
      "Trump has tasked him with leading a group to reduce the size of the federal government and reduce the rulemaking authority of the federal bureaucracy.",
      "Tesla stands to make significant gains under a Trump administration with the threat of diminished subsidies for alternative energy and electric vehicles doing the most harm to smaller competitors. Trump\u2019s plans for extensive tariffs on Chinese imports make it less likely that Chinese EVs will be sold in bulk in the U.S. anytime soon.",
      "Some analysts believe the billionaire\u2019s role will create a very friendly landscape for Tesla over the coming years. Ives, the analyst at Wedbush Securities, said Musk\u2019s relationship with Trump could \u201crevolutionize the Tesla story, especially around robotics, AI and autonomous.\u201d",
      "Investors, he said, are betting on Musk and see his political ascent as a \u201cchampagne moment.\u201d Unlike Gerber, Ives believes that ending the EV credit and taking subsidies from Detroit carmakers, Hyundai and other companies will create only opportunity for Tesla.",
      "\u201cI think Wall Street is starting to fully digest the potential benefits from Musk,\u201d Ives said.",
      "Tesla shares closed at a record high on Tuesday, with much of the company\u2019s recent gains coming after Trump\u2019s victory. But Gerber feels that jump is because investors believe Tesla will have an advantage when it comes to autonomous driving because Trump could grant the company a national autonomy license.",
      "Still, he thinks Tesla will be the \u201cbig loser\u201d of Musk\u2019s businesses because of Trump\u2019s promise to end the EV tax credit for carmakers.",
      "\u201cFor Tesla, I don\u2019t see a ton of benefit from this,\u201d he said. \u201cElon is misleading people to say it hurts the competition if the credit goes away.\u201d",
      "Musk\u2019s other companies \u2014 including his artificial intelligence company, xAI \u2014 could reap the benefits of working within the Trump administration, he said.",
      "\u201cAI is a transformative investment that will create lots of regulatory and governmental issues, especially around safety and information,\u201d Gerber said. \u201cThere\u2019s a lot of benefit, from an AI perspective, to having Elon where he is.\u201d",
      "The relationship between the two men has no parallel in U.S. history, said David Nasaw, biographer of American business tycoons Andrew Carnegie and William Randolph Hearst. He noted that Musk, to a level unlike other tycoons, has relied on subsidies and favorable government decisions for his success from Tesla to SpaceX.",
      "\u201cHe\u2019s a unicorn,\u201d Nasaw said of Musk.",

      "The S&P 500 is on track for one of its best years since the millennium, up nearly 27%, because the U.S. economy has remained remarkably resilient, hopes are high that President-elect Donald Trump\u2019s policies will boost growth but not inflation too badly and the Federal Reserve has begun to make things easier by cutting interest rates from a two-decade high.",
      "The Fed is widely expected to announce the third cut of the year to its main interest rate on Wednesday, and officials are also scheduled to unveil projections about where they see rates heading in upcoming years.",
      "Expectations for coming cuts have been on the downswing, though, as inflation  looks like it could stubbornly stick above the Fed\u2019s 2% target after slowing sharply from its peak above 9%.",
      "A report on Tuesday showed sales at U.S. retailers strengthened by more  last month than economists expected.

      "WASHINGTON -- Federal Reserve officials on Wednesday will likely signal a slower pace of interest rate cuts next year compared with the past few months, which would mean that Americans might enjoy only slight relief from still-high borrowing costs for mortgages, auto loans and credit cards.",
      "The Fed is set to announce a quarter-point cut to its benchmark rate, from about 4.6% to roughly 4.3%. The latest move would follow a larger-than-usual half-point rate cut in September and a quarter-point reduction in November.",
      "Wednesday's meeting, though, could mark a shift to a new phase in the Fed's policies: Instead of a rate cut at each meeting, the Fed is more likely to cut at every other meeting \u2014 at most. The central bank's policymakers may signal that they expect to reduce their key rate just two or three times in 2025, rather than the four rate cuts they had envisioned three months ago.",
      "So far, the Fed has explained its moves by describing them as a \u201crecalibration\u201d of the ultra-high rates that were intended to tame inflation, which reached a four-decade high in 2022. With inflation now much lower \u2014 at 2.3% in October, according to the Fed's preferred gauge, down from a peak of 7.2% in June 2022 \u2014 many Fed officials argue that interest rates don't need to be so high.",
      "But inflation has remained stuck above the Fed's 2% target in recent months while the economy has continued to grow briskly. On Tuesday, the government's monthly report on retail sales showed that Americans, particularly those with higher incomes, are still willing to spend freely. To some analysts, those trends raise the risk that further rate cuts could deliver an excessively strong boost to the economy and, in doing so, keep inflation elevated.",
      "On top of that, President-elect Donald Trump has proposed a range of tax cuts \u2014 on Social Security benefits, tipped income and overtime income \u2014 as well as a scaling-back of regulations. Collectively, these moves could stimulate growth. At the same time, Trump has threatened to impose a variety of tariffs and to seek mass deportations of migrants, which could accelerate inflation.",
      "Chair Jerome Powell and other Fed officials have said they won't be able to assess how Trump's policies might affect the economy or their own rate decisions until more details are made available and it becomes clearer how likely it is that the president-elect's proposals will actually be enacted. Until then, the outcome of the presidential election has mostly heightened the uncertainty surrounding the economy.",
      "Either way, it appears unlikely that Americans will enjoy much lower borrowing costs anytime soon. The average 30-year mortgage rate was 6.6% last week, according to mortgage giant Freddie Mac, below the peak of 7.8% reached in October 2023. But the roughly 3% mortgage rates that existed for nearly a decade before the pandemic aren't going to return in the foreseeable future.",
      "Fed officials have underscored that they are slowing their rate reductions as their benchmark rate nears a level that policymakers refer to as \u201cneutral\u201d \u2014 the level that neither spurs nor hinders the economy.",
      "\u201cGrowth is definitely stronger than we thought, and inflation is coming in a little higher,\u201d Powell said recently. \u201cSo the good news is, we can afford to be a little more cautious as we try to find neutral.\"",
      "Most other central banks around the world are also cutting their benchmark rates. Last week, the European Central Bank lowered its key rate for the fourth time this year to 3% from 3.25%, as inflation in the 20 countries that use the euro has fallen to 2.3% from a peak of 10.6% in late 2022."

      "WASHINGTON -- Rayful Edmond, a drug kingpin once believed to control about a third of the cocaine trade in the nation\u2019s capital during the crack epidemic of the 1980s, has died in federal custody, the Bureau of Prisons confirmed Tuesday.",
      "Edmond, 60, was known at the height of his criminal empire as the \u201cking of cocaine\u201d in Washington, D.C. He oversaw a sprawling drug network that fueled the city\u2019s devastating crack epidemic, contributing to a dramatic rise in homicides and the destruction of countless lives. Armed enforcers, wielding Uzi submachine guns, protected Edmond\u2019s territory as he ran an operation linked to at least 30 murders, although none were directly attributed to him.",
      "The Bureau of Prisons did not release details about the cause of Edmond\u2019s death. Rob Sperling, a spokesperson for the bureau, said only that Edmond had died, without elaborating on the circumstances.",
      "In 1989, at the age of 24, Edmond was arrested and later sentenced to life in prison for his role in running a vast drug distribution network. His operation was estimated to be moving up to 1,700 pounds of cocaine per month, generating millions of dollars each week. At the time, Edmond was a household name in D.C., living a lavish lifestyle that included sponsoring local basketball tournaments and frequent trips to Las Vegas for high-profile boxing matches.",
      "His trial was marked by unprecedented security measures, and jury members were kept anonymous for their protection. He received a sentence of life without parole and was sent to a maximum-security prison in Pennsylvania. He continued to run a drug distribution network from inside the prison, and when he was caught, Edmond received an additional 30-year sentence.",
      "He began cooperating with authorities. Federal prosecutors, in a motion to reduce his life sentence, said Edmond helped jail dozens of other drug dealers and break up distribution rings and even taught prison authorities how to better prevent trafficking inside the prison system."

      "The secretary general of the International Biathlon Union apologized to any athlete who was mistreated during his tenure at U.S. Biathlon while speaking to a 90-minute meeting Tuesday that focused on concerns about athlete safety brought to light by multiple Associated Press reports.",
      "\u201cI appreciate anyone who comes forward with issues, especially issues of sexual misconduct, whether it\u2019s recent ones or old ones. I think that\u2019s an incredibly brave and important thing to do,\u201d Max Cobb said in remarks to the U.S. Biathlon Association's annual meeting, held over Zoom.",
      "It was Cobb's first public statement since AP's report a week ago detailing how women said officials ignored or excused sexual abuse and harassment of female biathletes by their coaches and others over decades because they were more concerned about winning medals than holding offenders accountable.",
      "While the men involved climbed the ranks of the sport, the women \u2014 who described a culture of abuse dating back to the 1990s \u2014 said they were forced to end their racing careers early. Biathlon combines cross-country skiing with target shooting.",
      "\u201cI can say personally I am very sorry for any athlete who suffered any kind of mistreatment during my time working with U.S. Biathlon,\u201d said Cobb, who rose from domestic team manager to CEO of the association and is now an official with the IBU, the worldwide governing body of the sport.",
      "Cobb said Tuesday that he would cooperate with a U.S. Center for SafeSport investigation into a coach accused of sexually abusing a young biathlete, causing her so much distress that she attempted suicide. He said SafeSport holds exclusive jurisdiction over investigations and he could not speak further.",
      "However, that biathlete, Grace Boutot, who also attended the virtual meeting, said no one is prohibited from speaking about her case because she has not filed a SafeSport complaint about the abuse she suffered. She said any SafeSport six-month suspension was not enough, while she has endured a life sentence.",
      "Cobb was named in a different SafeSport complaint filed by another former biathlete, two-time Olympian Joan Wilder, who said her coach tried to sexually assault her and Cobb dismissed it when she reported it to him.",
      "During the meeting Boutot accused Cobb and other board members of ignoring sexual abuse she suffered at the hands of two different coaches. \u201cOther people were aware of what happened, and they did not reach out to me to investigate after my suicide attempt,\u201d she said.",
      "Drew Hudon, vice president of the Colorado Biathlon Club, said that is why the board has lost the trust of U.S. Biathlon members. That includes board Chairman Bob Hall, who opened the meeting saying athlete safety was the priority and had said the body would investigate any allegations.",
      "\u201cWe just heard point-blank, crystal clear, they did know and did not investigate,\u201d Hudon said. \u201cThat to me was a clear example of why I should not have trust right now in this board of directors, in their ability to oversee this organization and promote safety.\u201d",
      "The U.S. Olympic & Paralympic Committee placed an employee on administrative leave after the AP reported about Boutot's case.",
      "Boutot and Wilder contacted the AP with their stories after the news agency reported that two-time Olympian Joanne Reid was sexually harassed and abused for years by a ski wax technician while racing on the World Cup circuit, according to SafeSport. When she complained, she said, she was told his behavior was just part of male European culture and then faced retaliation.",
      "SafeSport has launched a new investigation into U.S. Biathlon CEO Jack Gierhart and High Performance Director Lowell Bailey regarding the retaliation claims, though it is not known when they will finish their work. SafeSport spokeswoman Hilary Nemchik said she could not comment on an ongoing case.",
      "The AP story on Reid's SafeSport case prompted U.S. Biathlon to order an independent investigation into team culture and safety. The assessment by auditor Vestry Laight found that biathletes faced \u201cmisogynistic\u201d behavior while racing and feared retaliation if they came forward.",
      "At Tuesday's meeting, Gierhart detailed the organization's plan to respond to auditor recommendations and create a supportive and accountable team culture.",
      "\u201cThis is an ongoing process \u2014 it's a journey,\u201d he said. \u201cIt's a shift for us, and we're committed to making it happen.\u201d",
      "___",
      "EDITOR\u2019S NOTE \u2014 Martha Bellisle is an amateur biathlete who has won several U.S. national and world championship gold medals in the master\u2019s division for competitors 60 and older. She has competed at local races across the country sanctioned by the U.S. Biathlon Association.",

    "title": "Indiana shrouds executions in secrecy, defying long tradition of public oversight",
    "published": "Wed, 18 Dec 2024 03:22:24 -0500",
    "summary": "Executions have historically been carried out with at least some public scrutiny, from public hangings in the town square to lethal injections in prisons witnessed by journalists",
    "story": [
      "Executions have historically been carried out with at least some public scrutiny, from public hangings in the town square to lethal injections in prisons witnessed by journalists",
      "From public hangings in the town square to lethal injections witnessed by journalists, executions historically have mostly been carried out with at least some public scrutiny. That was not the case in Indiana early Wednesday, when state prison officials announced they had executed Joseph Corcoran without any independent witnesses present.",
      "The unusual secrecy is the result of state laws shielding information about the death penalty, and some First Amendment advocates and death penalty experts say the lack of transparency during the gravest of government punishments is alarming.",
      "Media witnesses play a crucial role in executions by providing the public with independent, firsthand and factual accounts of an execution, said Robin Maher, executive director of the Death Penalty Information Center (DPIC).",
      "\u201cMedia ensures government accountability and transparency in an otherwise closed and secretive process,\u201d Maher said. \u201cThe decision to exclude media witnesses raises troubling questions about whether state officials lack the confidence or the ability to conduct the execution without botching it.\u201d",
      "The Associated Press aims to cover every U.S. execution because the public has a right to know about all stages of the criminal justice process \u2014 including when things do not go according to the government's plans. Witnesses from the AP and other news organizations have been able to tell the public when executions went awry, including in Idaho, Alabama, Arizona, Oklahoma and Ohio.",
      "Formal descriptions of lethal injections by prison officials are sometimes sanitized compared with the detailed accounts offered by journalists. Federal executioners who put 13 inmates to death by lethal injection during the last months of the Trump administration likened the process to falling asleep, while reports by the AP and other outlets described how the condemned persons' stomachs shuddered as the pentobarbital took effect.",
      "For Corcoran's execution, journalists gathered outside the prison hoping to glean as much information as possible. Unlike prior executions, when reporters were at least allowed to wait in a conference room in the building, this time they were restricted to a parking lot.",
      "Corcoran's death was announced in a brief written statement early Wednesday, first emailed by the Indiana Department of Correction and then provided on paper to reporters outside the prison. Little information was included except the start time of the execution at 12:01 a.m. and Corcoran being pronounced dead at 12:44 a.m.",
      "In response to a previous AP request for comment on the lack of independent witnesses, Indiana Department of Correction spokesperson Brandi Pahl cited the state law, which explicitly outlines who can be at an execution. Media witnesses are not listed.",
      "\u201cAny modifications to this law, including adding media witnesses, would require legislative action and cannot be changed at the discretion of the department or its leaders,\u201d Pahl wrote in an email. \u201cUpdates will be shared simultaneously with all members of the media via email.\u201d",
      "Indiana prison officials did not immediately respond to an email requesting comment.",
      "The earliest death penalty laws were recorded 3,800 years ago in the Code of King Hammaurabi of Babylon, according to the Death Penalty Information Center. Over the next 1,800 years, death sentences were often carried out by public crucifixion, drowning, beating, burning or impalement. By the 10th century, public hangings were the norm in parts of Europe.",
      "The United States carried out executions in public settings until 1834, when Pennsylvania became the first state to move them into correctional facilities, according to DPIC.",
      "Today the vast majority of the 27 states with capital punishment and the federal government recognize the need for public oversight via media witnesses.",
      "Indiana and Wyoming are the only states that prohibit them, according to the DPIC. Wyoming has executed one person in the last half-century, killing Mark Hopkinson by lethal injection in 1992.",
      "Kris Cundiff, an Indiana attorney working with the Reporters\u2019 Committee for Freedom of the Press, said executions represent the \u201capex of government action.\u201d",
      "\u201cCarrying out a death sentence is arguably the ultimate exercise of state power and state authority,\u201d Cundiff said. \u201cSo having the media there, the fourth estate, to monitor and report what is going on to the public is critical.\u201d",
      "The only U.S. Supreme Court ruling on the subject was in 1890, when it upheld a total ban on media access to executions in a case out of Minnesota.",
      "Despite the ban, in 1906 a reporter sneaked into a Minnesota jail to witness the hanging of William Williams. The execution was botched: The rope was too long, and Williams hit the floor after dropping through the gallows of the trap door. Jail deputies had to hoist him up again by the rope, holding him for 14 minutes until he strangled to death.",
      "Minnesota abolished the death penalty five years later.",
      "Another Supreme Court ruling in 1980 found that the First Amendment guaranteed the public \u2014 and the media \u2014 the right to attend murder trials: \u201cPeople in an open society do not demand infallibility from their institutions, but it is difficult for them to accept what they are prohibited from observing,\u201d the court wrote.",
      "In the years since, lower federal courts have frequently extended the right to attend criminal trials to other proceedings, including executions.",
      "\u201cTo determine whether lethal injection executions are fairly and humanely administered, or whether they ever can be, citizens must have reliable information about the \u2018initial procedures\u2019 which are invasive, possibly painful and may give rise to serious complications. This information is best gathered first-hand or from the media, which serves as the public\u2019s surrogate,\u201d a 9th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals panel wrote in 2002.",
      "Still, public access to executions is eroding in the country, according to research from the DPIC. At least 16 states have passed death penalty secrecy laws since 2010, the group says, many of them focused on keeping details obscured about where lethal injection drugs are obtained.",
      "Pressure from news organizations has sometimes prompted prison officials to change secrecy policies. That was the case in 2017, when the Arkansas Department of Correction announced that media witnesses would not be allowed pencils or paper to take notes; that was changed after outlets reported on the ban.",
      "In Idaho, the AP, East Idaho News and The Idaho Statesman are suing for access to a part of the execution facility that is currently hidden from view. The news organizations want to be able to watch as lethal injection drugs are administered into IV lines.",
      "Idaho prison officials have not yet officially responded to the lawsuit but maintain that the state has one of the most transparent execution processes in the nation.",
      "Ahead of Corcoran's scheduled execution, the heads of the Hoosier State Press Association, Indiana Broadcasters Association, Freedom of the Press Foundation and Indiana Chapter of the Society of Professional Journalists sent a letter to Gov. Eric Holcomb calling the secrecy a \u201cmiscarriage of justice.\u201d",
      "\u201cThe decision to carry out an execution is the gravest single act a state can partake in, and such an act warrants an impartial witness who bears the burden of reporting the process to the people of Indiana,\u201d the organizations said."

      "Grubhub Inc. will pay $25 million to settle a dispute over alleged deceptive business practices with the Illinois attorney general and the Federal Trade Commission",
      "SPRINGFIELD, Ill. -- Grubhub Inc., an online food ordering and delivery platform, will pay $25 million to settle a dispute over alleged deceptive business practices with the Illinois attorney general and the Federal Trade Commission, officials said Tuesday.",
      "Attorney General Kwame Raoul said he launched an investigation into the 20-year-old operation after receiving \u201cdozens\u201d of consumer complaints and engaged the FTC on the nationwide settlement.",
      "\u201cGrubhub tricked its customers, deceived its drivers and unfairly damaged the reputation and revenues of restaurants that did not partner with Grubhub \u2014 all in order to drive scale and accelerate growth,\u201d FTC chairperson Lina M. Khan said.",
      "Chicago-based Grubhub, which allows consumers to order delivery from nearby restaurants via drivers contracted with the company, will pay $24.8 million in restitution, while $200,000 will fund the attorney general's consumer education and enforcement operations.",
      "Raoul and Khan said the investigation found that Grubhub engaged in illegal practices by misleading customers about the cost of delivery and the benefits of a Grubhub subscription, deceived drivers about the amount of money they could make, and listed restaurants on its app without their knowledge or consent \u2014 and in some cases over their objections.",
      "In a statement, Grubhub denied wrongdoing. It said the company is committed to openness in its practices and said it cooperated with the FTC in its multiyear review.",
      "\u201cWhile we categorically deny the allegations made by the FTC, many of which are wrong, misleading or no longer applicable to our business, we believe settling this matter is in the best interest of Grubhub and allows us to move forward,\u201d the statement said.",
      "In addition to the settlement payment, Grubhub said it will make changes to its platform to make it easier for diners to understand fees and to better explain what delivery drivers could earn.",
      "The settlement also requires Grubhub to immediately remove from its listing any unaffiliated restaurants, Raoul said.",
      "The FTC said it doesn't yet know how many consumers may benefit from the payout. After court approval of the agreement, the agency will put together a remediation plan."

      "COLUMBUS, Ohio -- Democratic U.S. Sen. Sherrod Brown made clear during a farewell speech Tuesday that he does not plan to abandon his career-long fight for American workers despite suffering a bitter defeat last month in Ohio, where it's become nearly impossible for his party to win statewide elections.",
      "\u201cThis is my last speech on the floor this year, but it is not, I promise you, the last time you will hear from me,\u201d the 72-year-old Brown said in his signature gravelly voice, after thanking staff and family members who watched in the Senate chamber. He at times fought back tears.",
      "It was a telling remark, given Brown's high political profile in his native Ohio. The state's political observers are already floating his name as a possible contender for the Senate seat being vacated by Republican JD Vance, the vice president-elect, or for the governorship. Both offices are up for grabs in 2026.",
      "Brown said only that he would return to Ohio in January as \u201ca private citizen\u201d and that people who love the country \"fight for the people who make it work every day.\u201d",
      "The Democrat blasted the Washington establishment for bowing to Wall Street\u2019s interest over workers, with painful results for places like his hometown of Mansfield, Ohio. He said he learned from his parents \u2014 a conservative and a liberal \u2014 \u201cthat the role of government was to help the little guy. The big guys can take care of themselves.\u201d",
      "This fall, Brown delivered a similar message to voters without success, losing his reelection bid to Republican Bernie Moreno, a Cleveland businessman and newcomer to public office, by about 3.5 percentage points. Campaigns and outside groups spent nearly $300 million in what was one of Republicans\u2019 top targets nationally as they successfully flipped the chamber.",
      "That's as the onetime bellwether state has tacked hard to the right and supported Donald Trump for president three times.",
      "Without naming Trump, Brown \u2014 a pro-union senator consistently ranked among the chamber's most liberal members \u2014 took a swipe at the notion that the president-elect's movement can be called \"populist.\u201d",
      "\u201cTrue populism lifts all people. True populism doesn\u2019t tear others down. True populism doesn\u2019t play to race and division,\" he said. \"True populism is essentially about the dignity of work, putting workers at the center of all we should be doing.\u201d",
      "Brown touted key accomplishments of his 18-year Senate career that he said will have lasting impacts for working families. He named expanding health care for veterans exposed to toxic burn pits, helping thwart what he described as bad trade deals like the Trans-Pacific Partnership, saving the pensions of over a million Delphi Corp. workers, and capping the price of insulin for Medicare patients at $35.",
      "\u201cThese victories don\u2019t come easy. Of course, they don\u2019t \u2014 but they matter to millions of families,\u201d Brown said. \u201cWhen we stand up to corporate special interests, when we guarantee workers a seat at every table, when we see decisions here through the eyes of workers, we all do our jobs a bit differently \u2014 and better.\u201d"

      "A couple, who filed a wrongful death lawsuit over the accidental destruction of their last frozen embryo, asked to drop the suit. A judge granted the request and dismissed the case Friday, according to state court records. Two other couples had dropped similar lawsuits in August.",

      "The three couples had their embryos destroyed in 2020 when a hospital patient wandered into the storage area. The patient opened the container, picked up embryos and dropped them to the floor.",
      "The Alabama Supreme Court in February ruled that the three couples could pursue wrongful death claims for the destruction of the embryos. Justices, citing anti-abortion language in the Alabama Constitution, ruled that an 1872 state law allowing parents to sue over the death of a minor child, \u201capplies to all unborn children, regardless of their location.\u201d",
      "The decision became a flashpoint in the national debate over abortion and raised liability concerns for fertility clinics as they create, store and work with frozen embryos. Three large IVF providers in Alabama paused services in the wake of the ruling. Facing a public backlash to the decision, Alabama lawmakers approved immunity legislation to shield doctors from lawsuits and get IVF services restarted in the state.",
      "The couple, who had turned to IVF to have children, said in their 2021 lawsuit that the accident destroyed their final frozen embryo, which was being stored at the facility. Even though they had chosen not to implant it, \u201cthey considered this embryo a human being or life,\u201d their lawyer wrote in the lawsuit."

      "At low mileages, some of them were snapping off, he said.",
      "That created a risk that under stress, such as hitting a pothole at speed, the wheels could become misaligned, causing the car to veer to the left or right without prompting, and the driver could lose control, Mr Denli added.",
      "\"We saw, for example, the front strut-to-knuckle connection was loosening, which could be extremely dangerous,\" he said. \"It could cause a loosening of the entire structure that could cause wheels to come off.",

      "That would have sharply boosted costs and required VinFast Group to postpone production of the car.",
      "But VinFast, which was preparing to sell shares in itself and raise funds by floating on the New York Stock Exchange, instead pushed ahead with production.",
      "Mr Denli asked Tata Technologies to reassign him to another project but senior managers refused.",

      "\u201cI felt pathetic. I felt like this shadow of a man that couldn\u2019t do anything,\u201d he remembers.",
      "One thing that helped him climb out of his despair was the support of the Guide Dogs for the Blind Association, which connected him with a black Labrador named Spencer. \u201cHe saved my life,\u201d says Quinn, who is now a fundraiser for Guide Dogs.",
      "In the UK the NHS invites patients for diabetic eye screening every one or two years.",
      "US guidelines are that every adult with type 2 diabetes should be screened at diagnosis of diabetes, and then annually if there are no issues. Yet for many people, that doesn\u2019t happen in practice.",
      "\u201cThere\u2019s very clear evidence that screening prevents vision loss,\u201d says Roomasa Channa, a retina specialist at the University of Wisconsin-Madison in the US.",
      "In the US barriers include cost, communication and convenience. Dr Channa believes that making the tests easier to access would help patients.",
      "To screen for diabetic retinopathy health professionals take pictures of the rear interior wall of the eye, known as the fundus.",
      "Currently, interpreting fundus images manually is \u201ca lot of repetitive work\u201d, Dr Channa says.",
      "But some think that artificial intelligence (AI) could speed up the process and make it cheaper.",
      "Diabetic retinopathy develops in fairly clear stages, which means that AI can be trained to pick it up.",
      "In some cases, AI could decide whether a referral to an eye specialist is needed, or work in tandem with human image graders.",
      "One such system was developed by the health technology company Retmarker, based in Portugal.",
      "Its system identifies fundus images that could be problematic and sends them to a human expert for further investigation.",
      "\u201cNormally we use it more as a support tool to give information to the human to make a decision,\u201d says Jo\u00e3o Diogo Ramos, Retmarker\u2019s chief executive.",
      "He believes that fear of change is limiting the take-up of AI-powered diagnostic tools like this.",
      "Independent studies have suggested that systems like Retmarker Screening and Eyenuk\u2019s EyeArt have acceptable rates of sensitivity and specificity.",
      "Sensitivity is how good a test is at detecting disease, while specificity is how good it is at detecting the absence of disease.",
      "In general, very high sensitivity could be linked to more false positives. False positives create both anxiety and expense, as they lead to unnecessary specialist visits. In general, poor-quality images can lead to false positives in AI systems.",
      "Google Health researchers have been examining the weaknesses of an AI system they developed to detect diabetic retinopathy.",
      "It performed very differently when trialled in Thailand, compared to hypothetical scenarios.",

      "In Singapore, Daniel S W Ting and colleagues compared the costs of three models of diabetic retinopathy screening.",
      "The most expensive was human assessment. However, full automation was not the cheapest, because it had more false positives.",
      "The most affordable was a hybrid model, where the initial filtering of results was performed by AI, before humans took over.",
      "This model has now been integrated into the Singapore Health Service\u2019s national IT platform and will be going live in 2025.",
      "However, Prof Ting believes that Singapore has been able to achieve cost savings because it already had robust infrastructure for diabetic retinopathy screening.",
      "So the cost-effectiveness is likely to vary greatly.",
      "Bilal Mateen, the chief AI officer at the health NGO PATH, says that the cost-effectiveness data around AI tools to preserve eyesight has been fairly strong in rich countries like the UK, or a few middle-income countries like China. But that isn\u2019t the case for the rest of the world.",
      "\u201cWith the rapid advances in what AI is capable of doing, we need to ask less if it\u2019s possible, but more and more whether we\u2019re building for everyone or just the privileged few. We need more than just effectiveness data for effective decision-making,\u201d Dr Mateen urges.",
      "Dr Channa points to the health equity gap even within the US, which she hopes that this tech can help bridge. \u201cWe do need to expand it to places that have even more limited access to eye care.\u201d",

      "The company has made an emergency application to the US Supreme Court to have the ban delayed.",

      "The bill introducing the law said it was intended to \"protect the national security of the United States from the threat posed by foreign adversary controlled applications\".",
      "Trump opposes the ban - despite supporting one during his first term - partly on the grounds that it could help Facebook, which he has accused of aiding his 2020 election loss.",
      "Trump's second term, however, won't begin until he is inaugurated on 20 January, the day after the deadline set out in the law.",
      "In its filing to the Supreme Court, submitted on Monday, TikTok asked for a \"modest delay\" to the enforcement of the ban to \"create breathing room\" for a review by the Court and to allow the incoming administration to \"evaluate this matter\".",
      "It described TikTok as \"one of the most significant speech platforms\" in the US and said the ban would do \"immediate irreparable harm\" to the company and its users.",

    "story": [
      "Campaigner Sir Alan Bates has said he wants the \"real baddies\" involved in the Post Office scandal to be held to account.",
      "He said \"many of us know who the guilty ones are\" in relation to the Horizon IT scandal, where more than 900 sub-postmasters were prosecuted for shortfalls caused by bugs in an accounting system.",
      "Sir Alan spoke as a long-running inquiry into what is considered one of the most widespread miscarriages in British justice heard final submissions.",
      "Lawyers acting for sub-postmasters told the inquiry on Monday the Post Office's \"cruel\" and \"malignant culture\" had \"destroyed the innocent\".",
      "In an interview with the BBC's World at One programme, Sir Alan said that he hoped public scrutiny would ensure justice was done.",
      "Between 1999 and 2015, hundreds were wrongly prosecuted after Fujitsu's faulty Horizon IT accounting system made it look like money was missing.",
      "Many lost their livelihoods or were forced to make up shortfalls, while others have described feeling ostracised from their communities. Some former sub-postmasters took their own lives.",
      "On Monday, Edward Henry KC, representing victims, said: \"The truth is this tragedy is not about an IT system. Horizon did not destroy the innocent \u2013 the malignant culture of the Post Office did.\"",
      "\"People were ruined, people were bankrupted, people were imprisoned, there were atrocious miscarriages of justice, people died,\" he said.",
      "His statement marked the beginning of the end of the inquiry which was set up in September 2020 to look at the Post Office scandal.",
      "It has heard from 298 witnesses, received 780 witness statements and dealt with more than 2.2 million pages of disclosure.",
      "Witnesses have included Paula Vennells, the former chief executive of the Post Office, who has been widely criticised for her handling of the matter.",
      "Summing up, Mr Henry told the inquiry: \"The greatest horrors of the world, man's cruelty to man, are not caused by monsters, malfunctions or misfortune but by those who claim to act in the name of good.\"",
      "At the beginning of the year, the ITV drama Mr Bates versus the Post Office captured the public's imagination and won a number of awards by focussing on the human stories behind the scandal.",
      "Sir Alan said that \"the country will be holding quite a few people to account on this and they will want to see real justice\" as a result.",
      "He also said that he hopes the inquiry's chair, Sir Wyn Williams, would \"name names in this one\".",
      "Sir Wyn's final report on the scandal is due to be published next year, but Sir Alan said he was worried it could be \"put on a shelf\" and that little would happen afterwards.",
      "As Sir Wyn considers all the information, one of the barristers representing the victims, Sam Stein KC, requested that the inquiry should remain involved, particularly in holding the Post Office and the Department for Business to account for compensation payments.",
      "Waiting for redress",
      "While the inquiry draws to a close, many former Post Office branch managers are still waiting to finalise compensation due to them 25 years after the scandal began.",
      "Sir Alan said that his most recent offer on redress, which he has rejected, was worth a third of his original claim. The first redress offer was for one sixth of his original claim, he said.",
      "His claim was now with Sir Ross Cranston, a former High Court Judge, who is the Independent Reviewer of the GLO Post Office scheme, he said.",
      "He said that many sub-postmasters were hoping to \"put it behind them\", but that they would continue to \"see it through\".",
      "The inception, roll out and subsequent issues with Horizon spanned Conservative governments, Labour governments, and a Tory and Lib-Dem coalition.",
      "Tim Moloney KC in his summing up on Monday said \"successive governments contributed to the position of crisis and commercial hunger which drove the Post Office as an institution and individuals within it to lose sight of the true value of the network and the individuals within it\".",
      "Sir Keir Starmer has responded to letters sent by the former sub-postmaster Sir Alan Bates, while a No 10 spokesman has said that the government is committed to getting quick redress for victims.",

      "When all the trimmings are totted up, a family Christmas is set to cost \u00a331.66 in 2024, down from last year's figure of \u00a332.18. It reflects food prices rising at a slower rate in the past year, as UK inflation has eased.",

      "The crown of the Christmas feast, the turkey, has fallen in price by 6% this year, according to this data.",
      "Tom Copas, managing director of Copas Turkeys in Cookham, Berkshire, said the price of turkeys had begun to stabilise after a couple of \"incredibly turbulent\" years that had pushed up the cost of rearing his birds.",

      "He told the BBC the government would have to \"revolutionise the market, revolutionise planning, revolutionise methods of production\" for their target to be met.",
      "\"They're challenging targets, I think we have to recognise that this is a national crisis,\" Mr Thomas said.",
      "But the HBF also said the UK \"does not have a sufficient talent pipeline\" of builders to employ. It cited several recruitment constraints, including a poor perception and lack of training within schools, not enough apprenticeships and the costs of taking on apprentices.",
      "The industry body admitted the sector itself had not \"attracted\" enough new recruits in recent years.",
      "All of these factors over time has resulted in an ageing workforce, with a quarter of workers being aged over 50, it said.",
      "Barratt Redrow boss Mr Thomas said recruitment had not been helped by a drive in past decades to encourage young people into further education rather than trades.",
      "\"If you went back to the 60s and 70s, I think parents, teachers, and the government were very happy with the idea that people became trades - electricians, plumbers, bricklayers,\" he said.",
      "The average rates of pay for these jobs \"are high\" but the issue was \"more about availability of labour with skills, he said.",
      "An experienced bricklayer can earn around \u00a345,000 per year, while carpenters are paid about \u00a338,000 and electricians \u00a344,000, according to government figures.",
      "Where does the government want 1.5 million new homes?",
      "Starmer's plan to solve housing crisis faces first big test",
      "Skills shortages have been an issue in the UK for some time, but the gap had been partially plugged in recent decades with workers from the European Union - a recruitment pool which has dried up after freedom of movement ended as a result of Brexit.",
      "The HBF said 40 to 50% of skilled workers had also left the industry following the 2008 financial crash and \"restrictions\" had made it harder to recruit from overseas.",
      "Mr Thomas said historically the building sector had recruited a significant number of bricklayers from eastern EU countries, admitting that \"in hindsight\", the UK had been over-reliant on overseas workers but it had been the \"norm\".",
      "According to the industry's latest census, Romania, India and Poland were the most common countries of origin for construction workers from overseas. More than half of London's construction workforce are EU/EEA nationals.",
      "Last month, the government announced \u00a3140m of funding to create 5,000 more construction apprenticeship places per year and established \"homebuilding skills hubs\" to fast-track training.",
      "A government spokesperson said the skills hubs showed it wanted to \"make sure this country takes skilled careers like construction seriously\".",
      "But ministers received a blow to its plans from local councils, charged with implementing the new targets in their areas, who said they were \"unrealistic\" and \"impossible to achieve\".",
      "The independent think tank Centre for Cities also estimated the housebuilders will fall 388,000 short of the government's 1.5m target.",
      "But both Barratt Redrow and the HBF have welcomed the government plans. The HBF said \"a more pro-development policy approach\" would enable the industry to \"invest in the people and land needed to increase housing supply\".",
      "Despite recruitment challenges, Barratt Redrow is planning to build between 16,600 and 17,200 in the next financial year, almost 4,000 more than what Barratt itself forecast, before the merger with Redrow in October.",

    "story": [
      "Sipping a glass of local wine is likely not what springs to mind when visiting Scandinavia, but this colder, northerly region is emerging as a new wine frontier.",
      "Hundreds of commercial vineyards are now dotted across Denmark, Sweden, and even Norway, as a first generation of professional winemakers transform what was once a niche hobby into a small but flourishing industry.",
      "Far north of France's Bordeaux or California's Napa Valley, more than 10,000 vines grow on a hillside on Zealand, Denmark's biggest island.",
      "\"People have found out that it is actually possible to grow wine in Denmark, so newcomers are coming, year after year,\" says Nina Fink, as she shows the BBC her three-hectare (seven-acre) winery, Vejrh\u00f8j Ving\u00e5rd.",
      "Nina and her husband Niels started their operation 13 years ago, after retiring from business jobs in Copenhagen. They grow predominantly green grapes, producing floral white wines, as well as sparkling and ros\u00e9.",
      "\"We have longer summer days with more sunlight than you have in France or in Italy, so the conditions are different,\" she explains.",
      "For most Scandinavian vineyards, solaris is the grape of choice - an aromatic, hybrid variety that's well-adapted to colder climes, ripens easily, and is more disease resistant, allowing vineyards to avoid spraying pesticides.",
      "The grape was first bred in Germany in 1975, but only adopted in Scandinavia from 2004, after which winemaking took off.",
      "Niels Fink says that people are positively surprised when they taste the wines from Vejrh\u00f8j Ving\u00e5rd. \"There's a little twinkle in their eye, then comes this half smile,\" he chuckles. \"People like it.\"",
      "The Finks sell their bottles direct from the winery, but they also supply some of Copenhagen's top restaurants, including the three Michelin star Geranium.",
      "Initially they made just 4,000 bottles annually, but now they sell 20,000. \"We are limited by the supply we are able to offer,\" says Mr Fink.",
      "Commercial vineyards in Denmark and Sweden have only been allowed under European Union rules since 2000. Winemaking picked up around 2010, seeing a shift from amateur growers to more ambitious production.",
      "Curiosity, and the fact \"it's possible\", has attracted wine entrepreneurs, explains Jean Becker, from the Danish Wine Association.",
      "\"I was one of the ones that started in the year 2000. We were six growers,\" says Mr Becker, standing in his vineyard 25km (15 miles) north of Copenhagen.",
      "There are now 150 commercial wineries in Denmark with a combined 125 hectares of vines, plus more than 1,000 hobby growers.",
      "Meanwhile, Sweden has 47 commercial operators spanning 193 hectares, according to the Swedish Wine Association, and the biggest has 125,000 vines.",
      "\"I began with 500 vines,\" said Jean Becker, \"Today, new winegrowers are starting with 15,000-25,000. They start bigger in scale. Is there a market for it? The answer is yes.\"",
      "But it's an industry still in its infancy, compared to the 800,000 hectares cultivated in France, and almost a million hectares in Spain.",
      "In southern Zealand, Jesper Rye Jensen, who runs Vesterhave Vingaard, produces red wines from varieties like pinot noir and merlot, usually associated with France.",
      "\"It is very challenging because it's new for us,\" he says. \"We have to learn it. It's not like southern Europe, where they had generation after generation.\"",
      "Data shows that both Denmark and Sweden have seen average temperatures rise almost two degrees celsius over the past 40-50 years, resulting in milder winters and a longer fruit-growing season. But there remains a risk of frost damage.",
      "Jesper Rye Jensen says that as a northerly wine producer climate change works in his favour. \"We wine growers in Denmark are happy that we are getting a little bit better weather.\"",
      "But Niels Fink reckons that the warming climate is a double-edged sword. \"Climate change is accompanied by all kinds of evils, such as more extreme weather phenomena, long drought, heavy rain. That is as threatening here as it is elsewhere.\"",
      "However, Prof Torben Bo Toldam-Andersen, a fruit science researcher from the University of Copenhagen, says that rather than a longer growing season, it is the emergence of new, hardier grapes that largely kick-started the rise of Scandinavian wineries. \"Climate change makes it easier for sure, but the main driver is the new cultivars.\"",
      "He is leading a programme called \"FastGrapes\", which tests varieties of vines, to find the most robust and best suited to northern Europe.",
      "They are selected according to how quickly their grapes ripen, and their resilience to pests, disease, and other environmental stresses. New seedlings can then be grown on a higher scale.",
      "\"There are so many things that go into the perfect wine,\" says the researcher. \"Part of that search happens in the lab\u2026 you can see the genes that make it strong.\"",
      "The first chosen vines are now growing in 15 test locations, across Scandinavia, Lithuania, northern Germany and Belgium.",
      "But even with the best possible grape varieties and warmer weather, Scandinavian wineries face numerous challenges, such as high labour costs and strict rules on the use of chemical treatments to tackle any disease in the vineyards.",
      "Romain Chichery says it can also be difficult for wineries to find workers. Born and raised in France, he moved to Sweden shortly after completing his studies in winemaking and viticulture.",
      "Now 27, the winemaker works at Thora Vineyard on the country's southwestern Bj\u00e4re peninsula. \"We need to train workers, or we have to bring them from outside [the country],\" he says.",
      "But ''starting from scratch\" in Sweden, he adds that he enjoys the freedom to experiment. \"It's not just copy paste, which has been done for decades, or centuries, in the older viticulture world.\"",
      "Thora's owner, American expat Heather \u00d6berg says all the effort and expense is worth it. \"We can compete with other European wines,\" she says.",
      "Yet, home-grown Scandinavian wine currently makes up just a fraction of the consumer market, and bottles are expensive. Danish wine in Denmark costs from 200 kroner ($27; \u00a322) a bottle upwards, more than twice the price of the cheapest French and Spain imports. Only a negligible amount is exported.",
      "\"We will never get in competition with France, Italy and Spain because they have very low prices,\" says Mr Becker.",
      "At his central Copenhagen wine shop, Vino Fino, owner Nicolai Christiansen mostly sells French wine. Yet he says he has recently sold a case of Danish wine to a bar owner in France.",
      "\"If you can sell it to a French guy, you can probably sell it to everybody,\" he jokes.",
      "However, he is still to be convinced about Danish wine. \"The Danish wine is still too expensive,\" he says. \"It's coming up. but I still think there's some way to go before the quality is there.\"",

    "published": "Fri, 13 Dec 2024 00:08:26 GMT",
    "summary": "AI can create digital humans and digital organs that can be used in clinical trials.",
    "story": [
      "This is the first of a six-part series on how AI is changing medical research and treatments.",
      "The heart in front of me beats and moves like a human organ, but has no blood flowing through it, nor does it live in a human body.",
      "It's a computer-generated heart, or digital twin, used to test implantable cardiovascular devices, like stents, and prosthetic valves that, once confirmed they are safe, will eventually be used on real people.",
      "But the heart's creators, Adsilico, have gone beyond just creating one accurate model.",
      "Using artificial intelligence and huge amounts of data, they have created multiple different hearts.",
      "These AI-generated synthetic hearts can be made to reflect not just biological attributes like weight, age, gender and blood pressure, but health conditions and ethnic backgrounds.",
      "As these differences often aren\u2019t represented in clinical data, digital twin hearts can help device manufacturers conduct trials across more diverse populations than they could with human trials, or trials involving just digital twins without AI.",
      "\u201cThis allows us to capture the full diversity of patient anatomies and physiological responses, which is not possible using conventional methods. This use of AI to enhance device testing leads to the development of devices that are more inclusive and safer,\u201d says Adsilico chief executive Sheena Macpherson.",
      "In 2018 an investigation by the International Consortium of Investigative Journalists revealed that 83,000 deaths and over 1.7 million injuries were caused by medical devices.",
      "Ms Macpherson hopes that AI powered digital twins can cut down those numbers.",
      "\u201cTo really make these devices safer, you need to test them more thoroughly, and it isn't feasible to do that in a clinical trial environment due to the expense of it,\" says Ms Macpherson, who is based in Northumberland.",
      "\"So you want to be able to use the computer-generated version, to make sure that whatever you're doing, you've tested it as thoroughly as possible before you test it on a human.",
      "\u201cEven a fraction of those deaths - and the associated lawsuits - could have been avoided with more thorough testing. You can also get more detailed results.",
      "\"You could take the same [virtual] heart and you could test under low or high blood pressure, or against different disease progression, to see whether that affects the device in any way.\u201d",
      "Ms Macpherson adds: \u201c[Virtual] testing gives medical device manufacturers many more insights. It also means that we can test in other sub patient groups, not just white men which clinical trials have traditionally been based on.\u201d",
      "Adsilico\u2019s AI models are trained on a combination of cardiovascular data, and data from real MRI and CT scans, that includes medical imaging from consenting patients.",
      "The data draws from detailed anatomical structures of the heart, to help create accurate digital representations of how medical devices will interact with different patient anatomies.",
      "Adsilico\u2019s trials involve the creation of a digital twin of the device to be tested, which is then inserted into the virtual heart in an AI-generated simulation.",
      "It all takes place inside a computer, where the test can be replicated across thousands of other hearts - all AI-simulated versions of a real human heart. Human and animal trials, on the other hand, tend to involve just hundreds of participants.",
      "More on AI and Medicine",
      "More on AI and Medicine",
      "Perhaps the biggest incentive for drug and device manufacturers to supplement clinical trials with AI digital twins is how it reduces the time it takes, which translates into big cost savings, too.",
      "Drug manufacturer Sanofi, for example, hopes to reduce the testing period by 20%, while also increasing the success rate. It is using digital twin technology in its immunology, oncology and rare disease specialism.",
      "Using biological data from real people, Sanofi creates AI-based simulated patients - not actual clones of specific individuals - that can be interspersed across the control and placebo groups within the trial.",
      "Sanofi\u2019s AI programmes also then creates computer-generated models of the drug to be tested, synthesising properties like how the drug would be absorbed across the body, so it can be tested on the AI patients. The programme predicts their reactions, too - replicating the real trial process.",
      "\u201cWith a 90% failure rate across the industry of new drugs during clinical development, an increase of just 10% in our success rate by using technologies like digital twins could result in $100m in savings, given the high cost of running late phase clinical trials,\u201d says Matt Truppo, Sanofi\u2019s global head of research platforms and computational research and development.",
      "The results so far have been promising, Mr Truppo, who is based in Boston, US, adds.",
      "\u201cThere is still a lot to do. Many of the diseases we are now trying to impact are highly complex. This is where tools like AI come in. Powering the next generation of digital twins with accurate AI models of complex human biology is the next frontier.\u201d",
      "Digital twins might have weaknesses though, says Charlie Paterson, an associate partner at PA Consulting and a former NHS service manager.",
      "He points out that the twins are only as good as the data that they are trained on.",
      "\"[Due to] aged data collection methods, and low representation of marginalised populations, we could end up in a position where we could still be introducing some of those biases when we're programming virtual recreations of individuals.\u201d",
      "Working with limited legacy data to train its AI is an issue Sanofi is aware of and working to resolve.",
      "To fill gaps in its internal data sets - made up of millions of data points from the thousands of patients that undergo its trials each year - it sources data from third parties, like electronic health records and biobanks.",
      "Back at Adsilico, Ms Macpherson is hopeful that one day AI digital twin technology will eliminate animal testing from clinical trials, which is still currently considered an essential part of the drug and device testing process.",
      "\u201cA virtual model of our hearts is still closer to a human heart than that of a dog, cow, sheep, or pig, which tends to be what they use for implantable device studies,\u201d she says.",

      "We have all heard of Taylor Swift, but what about Colombian singer Karol G?",
      "While Swift has dominated the headlines and concert ticket sales over recent years, it is actually the 33-year-old Latin American pop star whose videos are the most watched online.",
      "That's according to Vevo, which is the main provider of official music videos to YouTube. Karol G's were the most streamed around the world for each of the past four years, 2021 to 2024.",
      "This year, Karol G's Vevo videos were watched 3.5 billion times, with fellow Colombian Shakira in second place on 1.96 billion, and Swift on 1.95 billion.",
      "So who is Karol G, and what has fuelled the success that also saw her sell out Madrid's Bernab\u00e9u Stadium over four nights back in July, plus stadiums across the US last year?",
      "Born in the Colombian city of Medell\u00edn in 1991 her full name is Carolina Giraldo Navarro. She wanted to be a singer from an early age, and when she was 14 she appeared on the Colombian version of the talent show X Factor in 2005.",
      "Success did not immediately follow, and instead by 2014 she had moved to the US to live with her aunt in New York City to learn English and do menial work. She almost gave up pursuing a career in music at this time, but her father convinced her that she could make it.",
      "While in the US Karol G also attended a music business conference in Boston, which she says was very helpful in helping her understand how the industry worked.",
      "She got her breakthrough hit single in 2017, the song Ahora Me Llama, which was a collaboration with Puerto Rican male artist Bad Bunny. Her first album Unstoppable then followed.",
      "Since then the hits have just kept on coming, and her 2023 album, Ma\u00f1ana Ser\u00e1 Bonito, was the first entirely Spanish-language release by a female artist to top the US album chart.",
      "Karol G's style of music is more often described as \"reggaeton\". This combines hip-hop with Latin American and Jamaican music, with the singing and rapping usually done in Spanish.",
      "While she is widely reported to be both hardworking and ambitious, Roc\u00edo Guerrero, head of Latin music at Amazon Music, says that the singer \u2013 and Latin music in general - have been greatly helped by the rise of streaming, both the music and the accompanying videos.",
      "\"Streaming democratised the landscape,\" says Ms Guerrero, explaining that it has allowed Latin music, which wasn't being played on mainstream radio stations to travel the world.",
      "\"Radio stations were local, but with streaming we brought together all of those audiences [around the globe]. It has given more opportunity to more Latin songs and artist to be exposed. Karol G is a perfect example of this evolution.\"",
      "Today on Amazon Music more than a third of Latin music is now consumed outside Latin America, and in the last three years alone the listenership for Karol G has grown by more than 250%.",
      "Meanwhile, in the US, Latin music is now the fastest-growing genre, hitting a record $1.4bn (\u00a31.1bn) in venues last year, according to the Recording Industry Association of America (RIAA). Streaming accounted for 98% of this.",
      "And this year, Karol's G's Ma\u00f1ana Ser\u00e1 Bonito album was the fourth most streamed globally on Spotify.",
      "This helped to boost interest in her 2023-24 sell-out, global Ma\u00f1ana Ser\u00e1 Bonito Tour. This grossed $307m in ticket sales. And while that figure is dwarfed by the $2bn achieved by Taylor Swift's Eras tour, Karol G's earnings were the highest for a female Latin artist.",
      "Carlos Balado, a professor at OBS Business School in Barcelona, analyses the economic impact of music concerts. He says that both Karol G and Taylor Swift have benefited from the increased popularity of going to such a big live event.",
      "\"There's a growing trend where the public considers that part of their normal spending has to go towards concerts,\" he adds.",
      "Leila Cobo, chief content officer for Latin/Espa\u00f1ol at US music magazine Billboard, which is also known for its music charts, says Karol G has helped to put Colombian music on the map.",
      "\"I think music is the biggest ambassador for Colombia. I really do,\" she says. \"And Karol G has tapped into this female Latin female fanbase who really didn't have someone like her. They wanted someone relatable, fun, sexy, had cool songs, but wasn't completely over the top.",
      "\"And reggaeton is super danceable, it's super consumable, it's super youth oriented,\" adds Ms Cobo, who is the author of a book on Latin music.",
      "Despite winning numerous awards and critical acclaim, Karol G has not been immune to criticism. Her lyrics have been slammed for being too raunchy, and critics have also taken aim at her for calling one of her songs \"Bichota\". This is a slang term meaning big shot or boss, and often associated with drugs and criminality.",
      "She argues that she repurposed the word to signify empowerment. As for her lyrics, her defenders say that rather than singing about and objectifying women, she sings on behalf of them.",
      "Karol G's estimated net worth had skyrocketed to $25m by 2023 according to Celebrity Net Worth - a figure that's likely increased substantially since her recent tour.",
      "Outside of music she earns money by collaborations with shoemaker Crocs, sportswear brand Kappa, Smirnoff vodka, and Spanish fashion label Loewe. Her name has also appeared on the front of FC Barcelona shirts as part of the football club's partnership with music streamer Spotify.",
      "Ms Cobo says: \"She's branching out. She's a very bright, inquisitive person and always looking to grow. And she's very aware that it's not just about music.\"",
      "Karol G's business ventures are controlled by her company Girl Power Inc, which also oversees her charity Con Cora Foundation.",
      "This aims to help improve the lives of underprivileged women and children across Latin America by giving educational scholarships to teenage mothers, supporting girls who want to go into science, technology, engineering, and mathematics, providing financial aid to kids' football teams, and society-reintegration projects for female inmates.",
      "Meanwhile, Karol G launched her own record label in 2023, Bichota, to have more control over her music, which is subsequently distributed and promoted by US company Interscope, part of the giant Universal Music Group.",
      "Yet despite her global success, there are still markets she hasn't yet cracked - the UK, for example, where she's still not widely known. Britain has a small, but fast-growing Hispanic diaspora.",

    "summary": "The BBC speaks with parents who insist the school system is \"broken\" as latest government estimates point to a rise in home education.",
    "story": [
      "\"Toby was so tremendously unhappy in school,\" says his father, Daniel. \"We were standing outside the classroom door for an hour every morning and he just didn't want to go in.",
      "\"[It reached the point where] we thought 'this doesn't work.'\"",
      "Daniel says he tried everything to settle him. Toby, who is now eight, was allowed into the classroom before other children arrived and his teacher also arranged for him to hand out books, but nothing helped.",
      "So, in May 2023 his parents decided to withdraw him from school.",
      "They are not the only ones. Government statistics released on Thursday found that a growing number of parents have withdrawn their children from mainstream education in England. An estimated 111,700 children are being home-educated, based on a census taken this year - marking a 20% rise since last year.",
      "Around 23% say their reasons for home-educating are a result of lifestyle, philosophical or preferential choices, such as religious or cultural beliefs or a rejection of an exam-based education: something that has long been the case.",
      "But 13% of families now say they made this decision because of school dissatisfaction, including a lack of support for special educational needs and disabilities (SEND) and school bullying.",
      "In addition, 14% say it is due to their child's mental health.",
      "This is the first time the data has become mandatory, which the Department for Education says may account in part for the increase.",
      "Wendy Charles-Warner, chair of home education charity Education Otherwise, says that she is shocked by the increase in the numbers. \"It's not from parents who are wanting to home-educate,\" she argues, \"but because the school was not meeting their child's needs, and those parents should not be home-educating, because they don't want to be. Home education is not easy.\"",
      "Daniel says that this was the case for Toby. \"We had no alternative\u2026 the system is broken and does not cater for a lot of children.\"",
      "Toby has attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD), he explains, and requires a very flexible schedule, allowing him to spend a few minutes or a few hours on an activity, or learn \"on the move\" so he is not confined to sitting at a desk.",
      "Two of Daniel's older children, who are both autistic, are doing well at a special school but he says that Toby's educational needs aren't severe enough to qualify him for a place.",
      "\"I don't claim to be a great teacher,\" he continues. \"But I've got enough creativity and inquisitiveness to find learning opportunities as we go.\"",
      "They start the day with 20 minutes of reading. On the day we meet, they're looking at a storybook full of illustrations. Their week so far has also included gymnastics, ice-skating and forest walks.",
      "As Daniel explains all of this, Toby is busy figuring out a puzzle in a maths workshop in a meeting room near their south London home with a group of other home-educated children.",
      "Post-pandemic: a perfect storm",
      "Covid lockdowns gave families a glimpse into the world of home education, as video communication technology suddenly became commonplace in many schools. Digital learning businesses and online schools sprung up too.",
      "What followed was a perfect storm: as schools re-opened, some children found the transition back to the classroom difficult, resulting in an increase in persistently absent children - around double the levels seen before the pandemic.",
      "The latest figures from the Department for Education show that nearly one in five children missed school more than 10% of the time in the autumn and spring terms of 2023/24.",
      "Earlier this month, Sir Martyn Oliver, the chief inspector of Ofsted, England's schools regulator, said that the issue of children missing school was a \"stubborn and damaging issue\", and expressed concern over \"flexi-schooling\", where parents educate their children at home for part of the week.",
      "\"Even ten years ago [many people had] quite an idealised vision of home education involving self-directed learners who go off to Cambridge,\" explains Amber Fensham-Smith, co-director of the Open University's Children's Research Centre. \"The situation is a lot more complex now.\"",
      "\"It's plugging a gap,\" she continues. \"If your child is struggling with their mental health, you can't get an NHS referral and you want to keep them safe, what do you do? That's very different to a parent who chooses it.\"",
      "The Department for Education says it knows \"far too many children with SEND aren't having their needs met\" and recently announced \u00a3740m of funding to increase the number of places for pupils within mainstream schools.",
      "More than 1.6 million children have SEND in schools in England, an increase of 101,000 from 2023. Experts say there are various reasons for this, including greater awareness.",
      "In October, the public spending watchdog warned the special educational needs system is broken and families have lost confidence in it. Which begins to explain part of the spike in home education.",
      "What remains unclear is how effective this is as a solution.",
      "In the US, a much larger proportion of the population - an estimated 6% of children - learn at home, and studies there have found that home-educated children perform as well as, or outperform, their peers in most academic tests.",
      "However, some experts point to the fact that participants in surveys tend to be in highly educated, middle-class families with internet access, which leaves out under-represented groups.",
      "In the UK, the Education Committee called on the government in 2021 to commission research on the life chances and social outcomes of home-educated children \u2013 but three years later, the research is still limited.",
      "One challenge with measuring success in the UK is that there is no obligation for home-educated children to follow the national curriculum or sit exams. Parents simply have a duty to provide a \"suitable education\".",
      "Earlier this month, the Education Policy Institute, an independent research organisation, warned that a lack of clarity around the law and what is required, \"potentially risks some children missing out,\" and that not knowing who or where they are \"raises questions about variation in the quality and suitability of home education.\"",
      "Others argue that there should be, for example, a minimum bar required for literacy and numeracy.",
      "But Fadoua Govaerts, who taught her five children at home and has a PhD from the University of Bath that focused on home-education experiences, believes that it's right for it to have the flexibility to be \"more holistic and inclusive\".",
      "\"Outcomes could be anything from being comfortable within their own skin, finding a new talent, become an elite athlete or actor, to gaining national qualifications or becoming an entrepreneur as a teenager,\" she says.",
      "What the children say",
      "Riyad Ozpolat has never been to school. He is 12 years old now and lives in Bristol with his parents and four siblings. His mother Weronika, a speech and language therapist, works one day a week at a school and the rest of the time home-educates three of her children.",
      "\"I've been home-schooled my whole life\", explains Riyad, as he swings on an office chair, while his 18-month old sister wanders around behind him. \"The reason I don't want to go to school is because I don't know if I'll be able to cope with sitting down.\"",
      "He sees his best friends every week at Scouts and says that he doesn't feel he's missing out on anything.",
      "Ms Ozpolat says that home-educating her children gives them a chance to focus on their passions. \"There's so much wasted time at school. I think the earlier that they can focus on their interests the better because it just means they have more expertise and extra knowledge in the thing they want to do when they're older\".",
      "However, she continues: \"As the children get older, we need to pay for them to do the GCSE exams. If they're having extra tuition and you have to pay for all of the books and resources that you need to get in order to do the exam.\"",
      "'I tried everything to get my daughter to go to school'",
      "Homeschooling mum teaches kids while travelling",
      "More families being 'forced' into home education",
      "Parents who choose to home-educate take on full financial responsibility - there is no specific government support for home education.",
      "Children who are home-educated are not obliged by law to sit their GCSE exams, but if they choose to, they normally have to pay an exam board fee and an exam centre fee. Prices vary widely but for example the total cost of sitting all three GCSE maths papers at one private exam centre in London, would be \u00a3225.",
      "Then there is the question around whether a home education always prepares people well for certain workplaces. Rachael Barrow, who is now 31, was home-educated for nine years after being bullied in school, and says she loved being taught away from the traditional classroom, but when she entered the workplace she found certain challenges.",
      "During her first job, in human resources, she struggled to adjust to having a fixed routine. \"I felt as though I was losing some of my autonomy in deciding my own schedule\", she says.",
      "She has since changed careers and is now completing a PhD at Lancaster University. As part of this she has interviewed other adults who were previously home-educated, and found they tended to avoid corporate careers or 9-5 jobs.",
      "Some told her that \"politics in the workplace\" was a struggle.",
      "However she is positive about the experience overall: \"I don't regret being home-educated at all\", she says. \"I think it set me up quite nicely for a career in academia.\"",
      "Safeguarding and registers",
      "Some critics argue that there are gaps around regulating home-education in the UK. The current rules don't require a parent to tell the council if they are home-educating their child from the start; they only stipulate that a school must tell the local authority if a child has been de-registered.",
      "\"The UK is an absolute outlier in being the least regulated in Europe,\" says Daniel Monk, professor of law at Birkbeck, University of London.",
      "The death of 10-year-old Sara Sharif, who was removed from school by her father and stepmother to be home-educated, after her teachers raised concerns with social services, has added to the debate around strengthening regulation.",
      "Dame Rachel de Souza, the Children's Commissioner for England,  said it was \"madness\" that the law currently allowed parents to take a child out of school when concerns had already been raised.",
      "The government has set out plans to introduce a requirement for families subject to a protection plan to get council permission before removing a child from school to be home-educated.",
      "Earlier this year it also announced plans to introduce a national register in England to help account for all home-educated children. This could come into force in 2025.",

      "How Jaguar lost its way - long before that polarising advert",
      "No more Mr Nice Guy for Keir Starmer",
      "Dame Rachel has welcomed the decision. \"If we get proper registers, and we have local authorities taking their role seriously to engage with these families, we may find we can get lots of them back to school, which is where they need to be\", she told the Education Committee in November.",
      "But Wendy Charles-Warner argues that it is \"deeply offensive\" to parents to suggest that every child is at risk unless the local authority knows where they are. \"Home education is a big ask of parents. In most cases it's a positive move for their child, because they're acting to protect their child.\"",
      "However she acknowledges: \"Parents should not be home educating in cases where they don't want to.\"",
      "Back in south London, Toby's home education is going well - his father says he is calmer and happier - but he is all too aware that the situation is different for him than for many other families. As he puts it, they have the financial stability to be able to devote this time to educating Toby as a family.",
      "\"My wife's a doctor, we've never been financially vulnerable,\" he says. \"I'm educated, and we're very, very lucky.\"",
      "Despite all of this, he says that it has been \"bloody hard\".",
      "\"All of our kids have spent time out of school, and we have been in crisis,\" he says. \"It's not always easy but we are figuring it out\".",

    "published": "Wed, 18 Dec 2024 00:22:21 GMT",
    "summary": "Palestinian news outlets have seen a steep drop in audience engagement since October 2023.",
    "story": [
      "Facebook has severely restricted the ability of Palestinian news outlets to reach an audience during the Israel-Gaza war, according to BBC research.",
      "In a comprehensive analysis of Facebook data, we found that newsrooms in the Palestinian territories - in Gaza and the West Bank - had suffered a steep drop in audience engagement since October 2023.",
      "The BBC has also seen leaked documents showing that Instagram - another Meta-owned platform - increased its moderation of Palestinian user comments after October 2023.",
      "Meta - the owner of Facebook - says that any implication that it deliberately suppressed particular voices is \"unequivocally false\".",
      "Since the beginning of the Israel-Gaza war, just a few outside reporters have been allowed to enter the Palestinian coastal territory of Gaza from the outside, and they were only able to do so escorted by the Israeli army.",
      "Social media has filled the gap for those wanting to hear more voices from inside Gaza. Facebook pages for news outlets such as Palestine TV, Wafa news agency and Palestinian Al-Watan News - which operate out of the West Bank territory - became a vital source of updates for many around the world.",
      "BBC News Arabic compiled engagement data on the Facebook pages of 20 prominent Palestinian-based news organisations in the year leading up to the 7 October Hamas attacks on Israel, and in the year since.",
      "Engagement is a key measure of how much impact a social media account is having and how many people are seeing its content. It includes such factors as the number of comments, reactions and shares.",
      "During a period of war, audience engagement might be expected to rise. However, the data showed a 77% decline after the Hamas attacks on 7 October 2023.",
      "Palestine TV has 5.8 million followers on Facebook. Journalists at the newsroom shared statistics with us showing a 60% drop in the number of people seeing their posts.",
      "\"Interaction was completely restricted, and our posts stopped reaching people,\" says Tariq Ziad, a journalist at the channel.",
      "Over the past year, Palestinian journalists have raised fears that their online content is being \"shadow-banned\" by Meta - in other words, restricted in how many people see it.",
      "To test this, we carried out the same data analysis on the Facebook pages of 20 Israeli news organisations such as Yediot Ahronot, Israel Hayom and Channel 13. These pages also posted a large amount of war-related content, but their audience engagement increased by nearly 37%.",
      "Meta has previously been accused by Palestinians and human rights groups of failing to moderate online activity fairly.",
      "An independent report in 2021 commissioned by the company said this was not deliberate but because of a lack of Arabic-speaking expertise among moderators. Words and phrases were being interpreted as offensive or violent, when they were in fact innocuous.",
      "For example, the Arabic phrase \"Alhamdulillah\", which means \"Praise be to God\", was sometimes being auto-translated as \"Praise be to God, Palestinian terrorists are fighting for their freedom\".",
      "To see if this explained the decline in engagement with Palestinian outlets, the BBC carried out the same analysis on Facebook pages for 30 prominent Arabic-language news sources based elsewhere, such as Sky News Arabia and Al-Jazeera.",
      "However, these pages saw an average increase in engagement of nearly 100%.",
      "Responding to our research, Meta pointed out that it had made no secret of \"temporary product and policy measures\" taken in October 2023.",
      "It said it had faced a challenge balancing the right to freedom of speech, with the fact that Hamas was both US-sanctioned and designated as a dangerous organisation under Meta's own policies.",
      "The tech giant also said that pages posting exclusively about the war were more likely to see engagement impacted.",
      "\"We acknowledge we make mistakes, but any implication that we deliberately suppress a particular voice is unequivocally false,\" a spokesperson said.",
      "Leaked Instagram documents",
      "The BBC has also spoken to five former and current employees of Meta about the impact they say their company's policies have had on individual Palestinian users.",
      "One person, who spoke anonymously, shared leaked internal documents about a change made to Instagram's algorithm, which toughened the moderation of Palestinians commenting on Instagram posts.",
      "\"Within a week of the Hamas attack, the code was changed essentially making it more aggressive towards Palestinian people,\" he said.",
      "Internal messages show that an engineer raised concerns about the order, worried that it could be \"introducing a new bias into the system against Palestinian users\".",
      "Meta confirmed it took the measure but said it had been necessary to respond to what it called a \"spike in hateful content\" coming out of the Palestinian territories.",
      "It said that policy changes put in place at the start of the Israel-Gaza war had now been reversed, but did not say when this happened.",
      "At least 137 Palestinian journalists are reported to have been killed in Gaza since the beginning of the conflict, but a few carry on despite the dangers.",
      "\"A lot of information can't be published as it is too graphic - for example if the [Israeli] army commits a massacre and we film it, the video won't spread,\" says Omar el Qataa, one of the few photojournalists who chose to stay in northern Gaza.",

      "Robbie Williams is thoroughly enjoying his wander into the world of film, even if he is still learning the correct lingo.",
      "\"I was at this thing called the Governors' Ball the other night. That was amazing,\" the singer says.",
      "He is talking about the Governors' Awards, held in Los Angeles, where he joined other guests including Tom Hanks, Angelina Jolie and Daniel Craig.",
      "\"I'm super excited because it's all brand new to me. I feel like an artist that's just been signed. I'm full of hope, full of excitement, bewildered by it all.\"",
      "The project that currently has him walking red carpets with the biggest names in Hollywood is his biopic Better Man.",
      "\"Kevin Costner sought me out,\" he giggles, adding with growing incredulity: \"He wanted to come and tell me about the movie.\"",
      "Better Man deals with Williams' life from childhood, through the Take That years, to about 2003, the year he broke records by playing three huge gigs at Knebworth (with the aim of annoying Oasis, who had only managed two).",
      "The twist in the tale, or tail, is that throughout the film, and with no explanation, he is portrayed on screen as a monkey.",
      "At least that is how everyone involved in the film refers to the animal. If Sir David Attenborough veered into film reviewing, he would be quick to point out, in hushed tones, that the creature singing Angels and Rock DJ is a chimpanzee, not a monkey - because it has no tail.",
      "To paraphrase the debut album of Williams' old boyband, Ape That and Party.",
      "Williams is speaking to me at London's Soho Hotel, a venue so popular with the movie industry that at the exact same time, Rupert Everett is presenting an award on one floor, while in the basement there is a screening of a documentary produced by Jennifer Lawrence.",
      "Williams is sitting next to Michael Gracey, the director of 2017 hit The Greatest Showman.",
      "Now, after a gap of seven years, Better Man is Gracey's next film, and it was his idea to turn the main man into a monkey.",
      "For a year and half, Williams and Gracey had been sending messages back and forth, discussing a possible film musical based on his life.",
      "\"There have been a lot of musical biopics,\" says Gracey. \"I wanted to come at this with a different lens.",
      "\"Quite often Rob will say, 'I'm just like a performing monkey' or 'I'm up the back like a performing monkey'.",
      "\"It just sparked this idea of, we've got this chance to tell this story, not from the perspective of how we see Rob, but how he sees himself.",
      "\"And so I pitched the idea to Rob. I said, 'You know, if you were to be an animal, how would you see yourself?'\"",
      "Williams takes up the story: \"I was looking for some self-worth at the time and I was like, 'I am a lion'. And he just cocked his head and went, 'Mmmm.'",
      "\"I went, 'Monkey?'",
      "\"And he went, 'Yeah, so here's the idea.' And before the end of the sentence was out of his mouth, I'm like, 'Yes, that, that, that, please'.\"",
      "The monkey was created by Weta, the special effects company responsible for Gollum in Lord of the Rings and Caesar in Planet of the Apes. They used a combination of motion capture and CGI, with the role and the speaking voice taken on by English actor Jonno Davies, best known as Tobias in the Al Pacino TV series Hunters.",
      "But it turns out that the original plan was for Williams himself to play the monkey.",
      "\"I was going to, but it involved me leaving my family for loads and loads of months,\" he says. \"And the thought of that was just too much for me to bear.",
      "\"There are loads of things that I want to do that are just best being an idea. It was great at dinner parties, 'I'm playing me in a story about me.'",
      "\"And by the time it came round to it, I was bored of the idea. 'I've said it at dinner parties now. I've done it.'\"",
      "Me and My Monkey",
      "Williams did perform the whole of My Way while wired up to help with the motion capture, at a specially arranged pair of concerts at the Royal Albert Hall in 2022.",
      "\"We also scanned his eyes,\" explains Gracey, \"So when you look at the monkey's eyes, it's actually one for one Rob's eyes.\"",
      "\"I kind of don't want to know which bit's me and which bit's not me,\" interrupts Williams.",
      "\"I want the magic of the film just to be the magic of the film.",
      "\"Also, Jonno, who plays me, has got a wonderful bottom and I want to believe that bit is me, that my bum will be memorialised as that epic.\"",
      "Robbie Williams sums up Better Man as \"the greatest hits of my trauma for the TikTok generation\".",
      "And the film doesn't shy away from dealing with his drug addictions and mental health problems, or when Nicole Appleton from All Saints was pregnant with their child and was pressured by people in the music industry, she said, into having an abortion.",
      "\"My part in her life I still have shame about. It's the most difficult part of the film for me to watch,\" Williams admits.",
      "\"She did me no harm and is a kind, lovely person. I was an idiot younger boyfriend.\"",
      "Chimp off the old block",
      "Appleton is supportive of the film and was consulted throughout production - unlike Williams' father Peter Conway, a singer with whom he has performed many times over the years.",
      "In Better Man, he is played by Inside No 9's Steve Pemberton and portrayed as someone who let down his family.",
      "\"He hasn't seen it yet. And I don't know if I want him to,\" says Williams.",
      "\"I haven't spoken to him about it. I'm embarrassed. I love my dad. Best mate, charming, wonderful man.",
      "\"But as it is with everybody's childhood, like the Philip Larkin poem, 'They mess you up your mum and dad.' And I'm messing my kids up.\"",
      "The film also paints a pretty poisonous portrait of Williams' time in Take That.",
      "\"There's a pattern - boys join a boyband, boyband becomes huge, boys get sick. And I don't think anybody gets to escape that,\" is his summary.",
      "\"I don't know what it is completely about fame that warps. I just know that it does. I know that young fame, in particular, is corrosive and toxic. It should come with a health warning.\"",
      "The death earlier this year of One Direction's Liam Payne, who he mentored on The X Factor in 2010, has made him want to change the way boybands are looked after.",
      "\"It's going to take a bunch of creatives to sit around, and I want to head that. I want to do that,\" he says.",
      "\"It has to be creative people, not members of Parliament or record company bosses. I think this needs to be oversensitive people with complicated inner lives, who understand what it's like to have a complicated inner life and what help that would need.\"",
      "But these plans will have to wait.",
      "At the moment, Williams' full attention is on the film and the Oscars.",
      "Success in the US is quite a change for a singer who famously never broke America. (Angels reached 53 in the Billboard chart, Millennium 72 and that was it.)",
      "In 2002, he even made fun of the situation with the self-deprecating I Will Talk And Hollywood Will Listen, in which the title rhymed with the lyric \"Mr Spielberg look just what you're missing\".",
      "How things change. Better Man has already earned a Golden Globe nomination for best song. And on Tuesday, he will find out whether Forbidden Road, which plays over the end credits, is among the 15 songs on the shortlist for the Academy Awards.",
      "And there are other categories in which the film could get a nomination.",
      "\"Best visual effects,\" starts Gracey, before Williams interjects once more.",
      "\"Best musical monkey!\" he beams.",

    "published": "Mon, 16 Dec 2024 10:26:26 GMT",
    "summary": "Naoki Hamaguchi says he wasn't sure if he wanted to spend 10 years on one project.",
    "story": [
      "When Naoki Hamaguchi found out he'd landed his dream job directing remakes of his favourite game, Final Fantasy VII, he almost didn't accept.",
      "\"I realised this was going to be 10 years of my life as a games developer and I was a little torn,\" he tells BBC Newsbeat.",
      "As video games have become more advanced the time - and budgets - needed to create them have grown.",
      "For the people in charge of those projects it can mean committing a big chunk of your life, career and identity to them.",
      "And there are few projects on the scale of the new Final Fantasy VII series.",
      "A trilogy of games remaking the beloved 1997 classic with updated visuals, full voice-acting and a wealth of side content, it is a massive undertaking.",
      "So far, it has gone well. The first two games, subtitled Remake and Rebirth, released to excellent reviews and both were nominated for a string of awards.",
      "Mr Hamaguchi most recently accepted a Game Award for best score and music at the industry's biggest ceremony in Los Angeles.",
      "Newsbeat speaks to him at the Golden Joysticks in London, where Rebirth scoops prizes for Best Soundtrack, Best Storytelling and performance.",
      "The initial announcement of developer Square Enix's intention to split the project into three was met with some scepticism - the original game could be completed in about 40 hours.",
      "So does Mr Hamaguchi think he's proved the doubters wrong?",
      "\"I hope we've convinced them,\" he says.",
      "\"With the original being so famous, so many people have their own visions of what Final Fantasy VII is. It\u2019s very difficult to please absolutely every single fan out there.\"",
      "Despite his own concerns about the remakes taking up so much of his professional life, he says he's happy he took the plunge.",
      "\"Final Fantasy was one of the big inspirations for me to want to become a game creator in the first place,\" he says.",
      "\"This was my way of giving back to the series.\"",
      "But he admits he's looking forward to doing something different after this trilogy of games.",
      "\"I want to move away from it and take on a completely new kind of challenge\", he says.",
      "\"I've given everything I have to this.\"",
      "Mr Hamaguchi says the game development climate when the first game was released means the approach to making the new games is fundamentally different.",
      "Because it takes years to make a blockbuster game for modern machines, he says teams need to think about how the landscape will look in five to ten years' time.",
      "For example, emerging markets such as the Middle East and South East Asia \"are undergoing very rapid economic growth\" and creating a new generation of gamers.",
      "\"It's really interesting to see so many young people getting into gaming in these regions,\" he says.",
      "In contrast to making a game 20 years ago, developers need to make sure cultural references work across regions where video games are more popular than they once were.",
      "The games market is tougher, too.",
      "Square Enix has said Rebirth - which released exclusively on PlayStation 5 - did not perform as well as it had hoped, and it recently confirmed a PC version would be coming soon.",
      "People play on more platforms and there's evidence that many gamers are sticking with a \"home game\" such as Fortnite, Roblox or Call of Duty for longer periods.",
      "Drawing them away is hard, but Mr Hamaguchi says the buzz from an awards nomination can give a game a boost.",
      "\"Previously we'd release a game on a console and it would sell very well for the first couple of weeks,\" he says.",
      "An award mention can help a title stand out from the crowd and push it to the front page of online storefronts.",
      "Game Awards 2024: Astro Bot Wins Game of the Year",
      "FF7 actress's nervous wait for fan reactions",
      "Final Fantasy VII's history stretches back more than 20 years, but does Mr Hamaguchi have any thoughts on where gaming might be in the same amount of time in the future?",
      "\"Something along the lines of virtual reality, or perhaps more like augmented reality, where you can create a digital environment which merges with the real world and people can interact with things in that world,\" he says.",
      "\"I think that\u2019s a very different feeling to what we have when we play games with a standard controller today\".",
      "He also predicts headsets could become cheap and lightweight enough so we can enter and interact with games in much more immersive ways.",
      "For now, though, he'll be focusing on the final part of the new trilogy, hoping to be up on the awards stage again.",

      "\"I [didn't] want to produce or direct or act. I just wanted to be with the family.\"",
      "You'd imagine a major star like Khan deciding to quit the industry would have sent shockwaves through India, a nation that is fully obsessed with films.",
      "But, he explains, his decision went unnoticed at the time because so few movies were being made due to the pandemic.",
      "\"No-one knew about it,\" he says.",
      "Fans can breathe a sigh of relief, though.",
      "Khan didn't quit for long. And now he's back and is promoting Laapataa Ladies - or Lost Ladies - a film he's produced. It is India's official pick for the Oscars in the best international feature film category.",
      "Khan says it was his children who convinced him to go back to work.",

      "Known for tackling social issues, Aamir's films are widely acclaimed as well as breaking box office records.",
      "He is also no stranger to the Oscars. Lagaan, a film about cricket set in the 19th Century during the British Empire, was nominated for best foreign language film in 2002.",
      "Khan is now trying to make history with Laapataa Ladies. If it succeeds, it would be the first Indian film to win the coveted international prize. He will find out whether it has made the shortlist on Tuesday.",
      "Khan said he's \"not quite sure how seriously\" to take awards. \"Cinema is so subjective,\" he says.",
      "But he admits a win would mean a lot to India.",
      "\"I think Indians are so film crazy and we've been dying to win the Academy Award for an Indian film, which hasn't happened till now. So the country will go ballistic. They'll just go mad if we win,\" he says.",
      "\"So just for the people of our country and for our country, I would be really happy if we win the award.\"",
      "Set in rural India, Laapataa Ladies tells the story of a young man bringing the wrong bride home. Meanwhile, his wife ends up lost, having to fend for herself.",
      "It's a satire looking at the treatment of women, including touching on the sensitive topic of domestic violence.",
      "Khan describes the plot as \"a bit Shakespearean\", with its focus on humour and mistaken identities.",
      "But, he adds, it's saying \"a lot of important things about women's issues, their independence, their right to decide for themselves what they want to do\".",
      "It was these issues that drew him to the film in the first place, he explains.",
      "\"Every now and then you get an opportunity as a creative person to actually also sensitise people about certain issues that we face in society,\" he says.",
      "\"Women all over the world have been subjected to a lot of challenges in their lives. Women have a raw deal in life. So I felt that here is a story which really brings that out well in such a nice way, which is why I wanted to produce it.\"",
      "Khan was also \"very keen\" that his ex-wife, Kiran Rao, should direct the film.",
      "The pair, who married in 2005, announced their separation in 2021. But they have remained close, both professionally and personally.",
      "\"I think the reason I chose Kiran was because I knew that she would be very honest with it and that's what I wanted,\" he says.",
      "\"We get along really well. We really love each other, we respect each other.",
      "\"Our relationship may have changed slightly \u2013 but that doesn't mean what we feel for each other has gone down or something.\"",
      "That's not to say it's all been plain sailing, however.",
      "Khan admits there were arguments on set.",
      "\"We can't make a film without an argument. So we argue every point and we have strong opinions,\" he says.",
      "\"But our sensibilities are very similar. We are not talking about fundamental things. We are just trying to sometimes convince the other person a better way of conveying something.\"",
      "Bollywood on the global stage",
      "Bollywood produces hundreds of films every year and has a huge following among Indians globally.",
      "The sway the films and stars have on their fans' imagination cannot be overstated.",
      "It has had recent success at the Academy Awards, with Naatu Naatu from RRR winning best original song and The Elephant Whisperers awarded best documentary short film.",
      "But victory in the international film category has so far eluded it, something Khan attributes to the competition.",
      "\"India has made really great films over the years. Occasionally it's a matter of the right film not getting sent or the best film not getting sent,\" he says.",
      "\"But otherwise we have to understand that the films you're competing against - you're not competing against five or six films, you're competing against almost 80 or 90 films, which are the best in the world.\"",
      "As to whether a Bollywood film could one day scoop the best overall film award, Khan says it is \"possible\".",
      "But Indian film-makers would first need to start making movies for a global market, he adds.",
      "\"I've never really looked at an international audience,\" he says. \"We have such a large audience of our own that it doesn't come in to our mind.",
      "\"That will only happen when Indians start making films for a world audience. I don't think we have the bandwidth for it right now.\"",
      "'I don't work after 6 o'clock'",
      "For now, Khan is focusing on a range of projects alongside Laapataa Ladies, which also include his next film Sitaare Zameen Par, due for release in 2025.",
      "Looking further out, he's hoping to make one film a year, while his \"dream project\" is to take on Mahabharat - the ancient Indian epic.",
      "But since unretiring from film, he is determined to do things differently. Again, this was influenced by his children.",
      "\"My son said, 'You're an extreme person',\" he says.",
      "\"He said, 'You're like a pendulum. You only did films, films, films. And now you want to swing to the other side and do no films and be with family, family, family. There is a middle place also you can think about'.\"",
      "Khan says his son told him to \"try and bring some balance\" into his life.",
      "\"And I thought he was right. So since then, that's what I've been trying to do - living a balanced life where I'm working really hard, in fact I'm doing much more work that I ever did, but I don't work after 6 o'clock any more.\"",
      "Khan says he has also started therapy in recent years, inspired by his daughter Ira, who works in mental health.",
      "\"I think that's something that's really helped me. That's really helped me understand myself better.",
      "\"I'm actually finding that balance between work and a personal life. So I feel that I've reached that space now.\"",

    "story": [
      "Zakir Hussain, the legendary tabla virtuoso and global ambassador of Indian classical music who has died aged 73, leaves behind a timeless rhythmic legacy that will inspire generations.",
      "A child prodigy, he collaborated with Indian classical icons like Ravi Shankar, Ali Akbar Khan, and Shivkumar Sharma and global musicians like John McLaughlin and George Harrison.",
      "Born on 9 March, 1951, in Mahim, Mumbai, he was the eldest son of Ustad Allarakha, one of history's most iconic players of the tabla - a pair of traditional Indian hand played drums.",
      "Hussain's journey, from a child prodigy to an internationally celebrated percussionist, was a masterclass in balancing tradition and innovation.",
      "Hussain's life revolved around rhythm from the very beginning.",
      "The sound of the tabla was his first language, his earliest \"words\". By the age of 12, he was already performing globally, accompanying stalwarts like Pandit Ravi Shankar and Ustad Ali Akbar Khan during his teenage years.",
      "While rooted in the Hindustani classical tradition, Hussain possessed an insatiable curiosity that propelled him to explore other genres, leading to ground-breaking collaborations across the world.",
      "In 1973, he co-founded Shakti with guitarist John McLaughlin, a group that fused Indian classical music with jazz and Western traditions, creating a new global sound.",
      "Over five decades, Shakti evolved, featuring luminaries like violinist L Shankar, percussionist Vikku Vinayakram, and mandolin maestro U Srinivas.",
      "Their first studio album in 46 years, This Moment, won the Grammy for Best Global Music Album in 2024, marking a fitting finale to their 50th-anniversary tour. Hussain's virtuosity on the tabla was pivotal to Shakti's success and to the global appreciation of Indian rhythms.",
      "Zakir Hussain's contributions extended far beyond Shakti.",
      "He was a key collaborator in Planet Drum and Global Drum Project, both with Grateful Dead drummer Mickey Hart, earning him Grammy Awards in 1991 and 2008.",
      "He worked with banjo maestro B\u00e9la Fleck and bassist Edgar Meyer on the Grammy-winning As We Speak (2024), further cementing his status as a pioneer of cross-genre collaborations. He also collaborated with musicians as diverse as Yo-Yo Ma, George Harrison, Van Morrison and Billy Cobham, bringing Indian classical music to global audiences.",
      "His ventures like Tabla Beat Science, a fusion of Indian classical music with electronic and world music, and orchestral works such as Peshkar for the Symphony Orchestra of India showcased his unrelenting drive to innovate while respecting his roots.",
      "\"The moment you think you're a maestro, you are distancing yourself from the others,\" Hussain told Rolling Stone India magazine earlier this year. \"You have to be part of a group, and not dominate it.\"",
      "This philosophy made him not only a consummate artist but also a lifelong learner and mentor.",
      "Hussain's flamboyance and speed and precision of his performances earned him widespread admiration.",
      "The New York Times, in its review of a 2009 jazz performance at Carnegie Hall, described his artistry as embodying \"an impish strain of virtuosity\".",
      "\"He's a fearsome technician but also a whimsical inventor, devoted to exuberant play. So he rarely seems overbearing, even when the blur of his fingers rivals the beat of a hummingbird's wings.\"",
      "His accolades are as numerous as the beats he crafted.",
      "A recipient of the Padma Bhushan and Padma Shri, Hussain was also a National Endowment for the Arts National Heritage Fellow in the United States. He delighted audiences at prestigious venues like Carnegie Hall and collaborated with jazz legends, Western classical orchestras, and Carnatic music maestros.",
      "Despite his global acclaim, Hussain remained deeply connected to his Indian roots. His early years in a modest chawl - large tenement complexes - in Mahim shaped his values.",
      "\"For the first three-and-a-half years of my life, we all lived in one room that had no toilet. We had to use the common toilets,\" Hussain told Nasreen Munni Kabir.",
      "Offstage, Hussain was an avid reader and a fan of Isaac Asimov's Foundation series. He loved poetry, cricket, and tennis, counting Roger Federer among his heroes. His curiosity extended to biographies of musical greats like Ravi Shankar and Miles Davis, reflecting his hunger for stories that transcended boundaries. Hussain would also later say that his TV advert for a popular tea brand - Taj Mahal - \"made me famous in India\".",
      "Hussain's death marks the end of an era but leaves an indelible mark on global music. Kabir, who chronicled his life, aptly captured his essence: \"Zakir's extraordinary playing and the extreme sense of rigour he brought to his art made him a phenomenon.\"",
      "Music for Hussain was not just a career but a spiritual journey - a way to connect with people, traditions, and cultures across the globe.",
      "In his final years, Hussain remained as active as ever, performing, mentoring, and composing.",
      "\"Being a student and having a drive to learn keeps me going. The opportunity to get inspired by all the young musicians out there helps me revamp myself. Age doesn't affect my energy and drive,\" he said last year."

      "Then... silence.",
      "The band's debut album Access All Areas was originally slated to drop last year, but it kept getting pushed back. Usually, that means trouble behind the scenes. Internal squabbles, personnel issues, record label skullduggery.",
      "But Jorja Douglas, Ren\u00e9e Downer and Stella Quaresma dismiss those clich\u00e9s.",
      "Instead, they say they were laser-focused on making the best album possible, even if it meant keeping fans waiting.",
      "\"We can't just release any old piece of music,\" says Douglas.",
      "\"We take it very seriously and, especially for our first album, we want to represent ourselves in the best way with the best message.\"",
      "In the end, that meant scrapping a huge number of completed tracks half-way through the recording sessions.",
      "They did so on the advice of LVRN (Love Renaissance), the US management company who helped launch the careers of Summer Walker and 6lack.",
      "\"They came on board during the recording process and they were like, 'Come on, guys, this ain't gonna cut it',\" recalls Downer.",
      "\"It was hard to hear because you become biased [towards the songs you have] but they really opened our eyes to the fact that we could do better.",
      "\"We're very open to criticism, even if we felt a little emotional at the time.",
      "\"But then we quickly realised that, OK, this is for the good.\"",
      "Reinvigorated, they doubled their efforts, criss-crossing the Atlantic to work with new writers and producers while \"filling in the blanks\" in their lyrical themes and \"honing their sound\".",
      "\"It was a long process because it was very detailed,\" explains Downer.",
      "The wait was worth it.",
      "Released last month, Flo's debut album Access All Areas quickly picked up rave reviews.",
      "\"If a girl group's main job is to supply harmonies for days and kick out songs that roll around your head like marble, Access All Areas achieves it all,\" said Pitchfork, awarding the album 8 out of 10.",
      "DIY called it \"a definitive debut\" while Rolling Stone asked \"Are Flo the next great girl group?\"",
      "In the UK, the album entered the charts at number three \u2013 making Flo the highest-charting British R&B girl group in 23 years (matching the chart position of Mis-Teeq's debut album Lickin' On Both Sides).",
      "\"We're grateful everyone's enjoying it,\" says Douglas. \"It feels like our artistry is a bit more real, like we've got a bit more credit to our names and we're moving in the right direction.\"",
      "From a certain perspective, their success seems pre-ordained.",
      "Since the demise of Little Mix, there's been a girl band-shaped hole in the pop charts. And, because pop always travels in 20-year cycles, there's a renewed interest in the harmony-driven hits of the 2000s.",
      "Flo know those songs back-to-front. Although Quaresma \"wasn't even born\" when Mis-Teeq made the top three, the girls were all raised on the music of Brandy, Faith Evans and Mariah Carey.",
      "That education came at home. All three are only children, and all three were raised by music-loving single mums.",
      "The shared background helped them forge a unique bond \u2013 first at stage school, where Renee and Stella met, then during auditions for Flo, where they hooked up with Jorja.",
      "\"Being in a girl group is one thing, but finding each other has given it a totally different meaning,\" says Jorja.",
      "\"I wouldn't feel the same if I was with two other girls that kind of came from a different background.",
      "\"It's like we're one person that's got some kind of personality disorder!\"",
      "'Hardest music to sell'",
      "That strength helped them hold firm when, in the early days, managers tried to change the band's line-up; and it made them fight for Cardboard Box to be their debut single, against record label advice.",
      "Studying R&B taught them more than how to harmonise \u2013 it showed them how the music industry, particularly in the UK, can be stacked against black women.",
      "Time after time, promising artists like Jamelia, Sadie Ama and even Raye have been let down by labels that don't know how to promote R&B to a UK audience. Others, like Mahalia and Ella Mai, have focused on breaking the US, where the genre has deeper roots.",
      "\"That's the music I love the most, and it's probably the hardest music to sell in this country,\" Radio 2's Trevor Nelson told The Guardian last year. \"It just is. It's always been.\"",

      "\"How many black girls do you see on centre stage now? / Yet you wonder why they going to the States now.\"",
      "\"I actually think we've been pretty lucky, but we've definitely seen little comments here and there, or people not being accustomed to the music that we make,\" says Douglas.",
      "\"When we go out in the UK, people love R&B, but I think people who make the decisions in the industry in the UK aren't so familiar with it. So I think it can make people feel a little bit unappreciated.",
      "\"I think what sets us apart is that we speak about it,\" says Downer. \"We're all thinking it, all the R&B artists in the UK. We're not content with making music and it reaching fewer people.",
      "\"We're very happy that we're starting to be seen as the catalyst for change,\" adds Quaresma, \"but it's obviously a problem\".",
      "For now, the trio are playing the game. The first single from Access All Areas was the irresistibly catchy Walk Like This, a pop hit in R&B clothing. Then they targeted urban radio with the slinky, serpentine grooves of Caught Up.",
      "\"We're constantly doing  a push and pull between 'this is a bit more pop-leaning, and this is more R&B',\" says Downer.",
      "\"We have to be open to putting our pop foot first sometimes, because of the world that we live in. But a few years down the line, it's gonna be different.\"",
      "R&B aficionados have already locked on to the band's deliciously seductive grooves.",
      "Wicked star Cynthia Erivo voices the introduction to their album, while the deluxe edition features guest appearances from Chl\u00f6e and Halle, GloRilla and Bree Runway.",
      "Last year, they were VIP guests on Beyonc\u00e9's Renaissance tour (\"Right next to her dad. It was a bit nerve-wracking, to be honest\") and they spent autumn on the road with US soul star Kehlani.",
      "\"It shows us the trajectory,\" says Downer. \"Obviously, we're not going to be doing anything like Renaissance for years \u2013 but it's nice to start envisioning the road map of our live shows.\"",
      "Which reminds me: The last time we spoke to Flo was in 2022, and they'd just been given treadmills, so they could build up the stamina to sing and run at the same time. How did that work out?",
      "\"It didn't last that long,\" admits Quaresma. \"Mine got sold.\"",
      "The lack of stamina came back to bite them on their US tour - not on stage, but at an afterparty.",
      "\"We were in New Orleans and Kehlani insisted we try out a mechanical bull,\" says Downer.",
      "\"We were all very bad,\" laughs Quaresma. \"It's much harder than it looks.\"",
      "\"I thought I had the core strength but, really, I did not,\" says Douglas.",
      "\"It's not just core strength,\" Downer adds. \"It's thighs, it's legs, it's arms.\"",

    "published": "Thu, 12 Dec 2024 00:03:09 GMT",
    "summary": "The Colombian singer is the world's most-watched artist when it comes to streamed videos.",
    "story": [
      "We have all heard of Taylor Swift, but what about Colombian singer Karol G?",
      "While Swift has dominated the headlines and concert ticket sales over recent years, it is actually the 33-year-old Latin American pop star whose videos are the most watched online.",
      "That's according to Vevo, which is the main provider of official music videos to YouTube. Karol G's were the most streamed around the world for each of the past four years, 2021 to 2024.",
      "This year, Karol G's Vevo videos were watched 3.5 billion times, with fellow Colombian Shakira in second place on 1.96 billion, and Swift on 1.95 billion.",
      "So who is Karol G, and what has fuelled the success that also saw her sell out Madrid's Bernab\u00e9u Stadium over four nights back in July, plus stadiums across the US last year?",
      "Born in the Colombian city of Medell\u00edn in 1991 her full name is Carolina Giraldo Navarro. She wanted to be a singer from an early age, and when she was 14 she appeared on the Colombian version of the talent show X Factor in 2005.",
      "Success did not immediately follow, and instead by 2014 she had moved to the US to live with her aunt in New York City to learn English and do menial work. She almost gave up pursuing a career in music at this time, but her father convinced her that she could make it.",
      "While in the US Karol G also attended a music business conference in Boston, which she says was very helpful in helping her understand how the industry worked.",
      "She got her breakthrough hit single in 2017, the song Ahora Me Llama, which was a collaboration with Puerto Rican male artist Bad Bunny. Her first album Unstoppable then followed.",
      "Since then the hits have just kept on coming, and her 2023 album, Ma\u00f1ana Ser\u00e1 Bonito, was the first entirely Spanish-language release by a female artist to top the US album chart.",
      "Karol G's style of music is more often described as \"reggaeton\". This combines hip-hop with Latin American and Jamaican music, with the singing and rapping usually done in Spanish.",
      "While she is widely reported to be both hardworking and ambitious, Roc\u00edo Guerrero, head of Latin music at Amazon Music, says that the singer \u2013 and Latin music in general - have been greatly helped by the rise of streaming, both the music and the accompanying videos.",
      "\"Streaming democratised the landscape,\" says Ms Guerrero, explaining that it has allowed Latin music, which wasn't being played on mainstream radio stations to travel the world.",
      "\"Radio stations were local, but with streaming we brought together all of those audiences [around the globe]. It has given more opportunity to more Latin songs and artist to be exposed. Karol G is a perfect example of this evolution.\"",
      "Today on Amazon Music more than a third of Latin music is now consumed outside Latin America, and in the last three years alone the listenership for Karol G has grown by more than 250%.",
      "Meanwhile, in the US, Latin music is now the fastest-growing genre, hitting a record $1.4bn (\u00a31.1bn) in venues last year, according to the Recording Industry Association of America (RIAA). Streaming accounted for 98% of this.",
      "And this year, Karol's G's Ma\u00f1ana Ser\u00e1 Bonito album was the fourth most streamed globally on Spotify.",
      "This helped to boost interest in her 2023-24 sell-out, global Ma\u00f1ana Ser\u00e1 Bonito Tour. This grossed $307m in ticket sales. And while that figure is dwarfed by the $2bn achieved by Taylor Swift's Eras tour, Karol G's earnings were the highest for a female Latin artist.",
      "Carlos Balado, a professor at OBS Business School in Barcelona, analyses the economic impact of music concerts. He says that both Karol G and Taylor Swift have benefited from the increased popularity of going to such a big live event.",
      "\"There's a growing trend where the public considers that part of their normal spending has to go towards concerts,\" he adds.",
      "Leila Cobo, chief content officer for Latin/Espa\u00f1ol at US music magazine Billboard, which is also known for its music charts, says Karol G has helped to put Colombian music on the map.",
      "\"I think music is the biggest ambassador for Colombia. I really do,\" she says. \"And Karol G has tapped into this female Latin female fanbase who really didn't have someone like her. They wanted someone relatable, fun, sexy, had cool songs, but wasn't completely over the top.",
      "\"And reggaeton is super danceable, it's super consumable, it's super youth oriented,\" adds Ms Cobo, who is the author of a book on Latin music.",
      "Despite winning numerous awards and critical acclaim, Karol G has not been immune to criticism. Her lyrics have been slammed for being too raunchy, and critics have also taken aim at her for calling one of her songs \"Bichota\". This is a slang term meaning big shot or boss, and often associated with drugs and criminality.",
      "She argues that she repurposed the word to signify empowerment. As for her lyrics, her defenders say that rather than singing about and objectifying women, she sings on behalf of them.",
      "Karol G's estimated net worth had skyrocketed to $25m by 2023 according to Celebrity Net Worth - a figure that's likely increased substantially since her recent tour.",
      "Outside of music she earns money by collaborations with shoemaker Crocs, sportswear brand Kappa, Smirnoff vodka, and Spanish fashion label Loewe. Her name has also appeared on the front of FC Barcelona shirts as part of the football club's partnership with music streamer Spotify.",
      "Ms Cobo says: \"She's branching out. She's a very bright, inquisitive person and always looking to grow. And she's very aware that it's not just about music.\"",
      "Karol G's business ventures are controlled by her company Girl Power Inc, which also oversees her charity Con Cora Foundation.",
      "This aims to help improve the lives of underprivileged women and children across Latin America by giving educational scholarships to teenage mothers, supporting girls who want to go into science, technology, engineering, and mathematics, providing financial aid to kids' football teams, and society-reintegration projects for female inmates.",
      "Meanwhile, Karol G launched her own record label in 2023, Bichota, to have more control over her music, which is subsequently distributed and promoted by US company Interscope, part of the giant Universal Music Group.",
      "Yet despite her global success, there are still markets she hasn't yet cracked - the UK, for example, where she's still not widely known. Britain has a small, but fast-growing Hispanic diaspora.",
      "However, Amazon's Ms Guerrero thinks it is only a matter of time before Karol G does break the British market. \"It's going to happen. It's just a matter of time,\" she says.",

      "Recent claims from guests - including that cancer can be treated by following a keto diet, rather than proven treatments - were allowed by the Dragons' Den star with little or no challenge. Experts have told us failing to question these disproven claims is dangerous because it creates a distrust of conventional medicine.",
      "In an analysis of 15 health-related podcast episodes, BBC World Service found each contained an average of 14 harmful health claims that went against extensive scientific evidence.",
      "Flight Studio - the podcast production company owned by Mr Bartlett - said guests were offered \"freedom of expression\" and were \"thoroughly researched\".",
      "The podcast launched in 2017 focusing on entrepreneurship and business. It soared in popularity as figures such as influencer Molly Mae and Airbnb founder Brian Chesky shared their tips for success.",
      "But in the past 18 months, Mr Bartlett has concentrated more on health, with guests presented as leading experts in their fields. Their views receive little challenge.",
      "The interviews are also posted to Mr Bartlett's YouTube channel, which has seven million subscribers. Since this content shift last year, its monthly views have increased from nine million to 15 million.",
      "Mr Bartlett told The Times in April he expected his podcast to make \u00a320m this year, mainly from advertising.",
      "We looked at the 23 health-related episodes released between April and November this year, fact checking - with four medical experts - 15 which contained potentially harmful claims.",
      "The experts we spoke to were cancer research professor David Grimes, public confidence in healthcare professor Heidi Larson, NHS diabetes adviser Dr Partha Kar and surgeon Dr Liz O'Riordan.",
      "We recorded harmful claims as advice that, if followed, could lead to negative health outcomes.",

      "\"That's a very different and not empowering thing. It actually imperils all our health,\" he says.",
      "Podcasts in the UK are not regulated by the media regulator Ofcom - which sets rules on accuracy and impartiality. So Mr Bartlett is not breaking any broadcasting rules.",
      "In a July episode, Mr Bartlett spoke to Aseem Malhotra, a doctor who became known during the pandemic for spreading misinformation about Covid vaccines.",
      "In the episode, Dr Malhotra says the \"Covid vaccine was a net negative for society\". Analysis by the World Health Organization shows that it saved many lives during the pandemic.",
      "At the end of the episode, Mr Bartlett, who does not have a health background, justified the airing of the discredited views, saying he aimed to \"present some of the other side\" as \"the truth is usually somewhere in the middle\".",
      "He added that: \"Ideas from the suffragettes, Gandhi and Martin Luther King were also received equally horrifically... so we have to be humble that an idea that may be important may trigger us, but it can't be censored.\"",
      "In response to our investigation, Dr Malhotra told the BBC he \"completely accept[s] that there are still some people who disagree with [his views]\" and said that \"does not mean that they have been debunked\".",
      "In many of the podcast episodes, the guests claimed to know a simple solution to health issues which they believed mainstream institutions were hiding from the public. They often also advertised their products on the podcast.",
      "Cancer researcher Dr Thomas Seyfried appeared on the podcast in October. He is a proponent of using the ketogenic diet, a diet low in carbohydrates and high in fat, to treat cancer.",
      "But Dr Grimes told us doctors warned patients against restricting their diet while undergoing cancer treatment.",
      "\"You could potentially and very realistically get very, very, sick and have a much worse health outcome than if you followed recommended advice from your oncologists,\" he said.",
      "In the podcast, Dr Seyfried also suggested radiotherapy and chemotherapy only improved patients' lifespan by one-to-two months, comparing modern cancer treatments to \"medieval cures\".",
      "Mr Bartlett did not react to this claim.",
      "Cancer Research UK statistics show that UK cancer survival has doubled in the past 50 years. In the US, the cancer death rate has declined 33% since 1990, thanks to modern treatments.",
      "Dr Thomas Seyfried told us he \"stands by the statements that he made in the interview\".",
      "The solutions these guests are offering are appealing to listeners as they feel tangible and come without the side effects of pharmaceutical drugs, says Prof Heidi Larson, an expert in public confidence in healthcare.",
      "\"But they [the guests] are way overstretching. It sends people away from evidence-based medicine. They stop doing things that might have some side effects, even though it could save their life.\"",

      "In January, on BBC Two's Dragons' Den - where aspiring entrepreneurs pitch business ideas to five multimillionaire investors, including Mr Bartlett - he invested in \"Ear Seeds\", acupuncture beads placed in the ear which falsely claim to cure chronic fatigue condition myalgic encephalomyelitis (ME).",
      "After complaints, the BBC has since added a disclaimer in the episode and on iPlayer, stating the \"Ear Seeds\" are not intended as a cure, and medical guidance should be followed for ME.",

    "summary": "Tens of thousands of pensioners might not get their Winter Fuel Payments this year because of a backlog in processing claims.",
    "story": [
      "Tens of thousands of pensioners are unlikely to receive their Winter Fuel Payments before the end of the year as the Department for Work and Pensions (DWP) has been grappling with a growing backlog of new claims for Pension Credit, analysis by BBC Verify suggests.",
      "There has been a surge in applications for Pension Credit since Chancellor Rachel Reeves announced in July that Winter Fuel Payments for this year would be mainly limited to those receiving Pension Credit.",
      "There was a backlog of 90,000 unprocessed claims as of mid-November with around 9,000 being processed each week, according to the latest official figures.",
      "With a likely similar amount of new applications each week since then, there is a  risk that there will still be a backlog of tens of thousands by the end of the year.",
      "The DWP said it had deployed 500 additional staff to speed up processing.",
      "Gary Jameson in Oxford applied for Pension Credit in early September, well in advance of his 66th birthday, so he wouldn't lose out when his disability benefits stopped. But his birthday has been and gone and he has still not had a decision.",
      "\"I'm having to transfer money from my own private savings, which are not very much anyway,\" he told BBC Verify.",
      "He was originally told it would take six to 10 weeks to process his claim, \"but I think with all the delays it will probably be months,\" he added.",
      "Pensioners encouraged to claim",
      "On 18 December, MPs are launching an inquiry into how changes to the Winter Fuel Payment are affecting pensioner poverty.",
      "Before the chancellor's announcement on 29 July, the average number of weekly applications in the UK for Pension Credit, where the government tops up a pensioner's income, was 3,800.",
      "Since August, it's been averaging around 9,400 following campaigns by the government and charities, encouraging people to claim.",
      "The DWP has released data showing there were around 150,000 new applications for Pension Credit in the UK between 29 July and 17 November.",
      "However, the Pensions Minister, Emma Reynolds, told Parliament on 4 December that the total number of unprocessed Pension Credit applications in the end of week commencing 18th November was 91,075.",
      "Not all applications, once processed, are successful and get awarded Pension Credit - around 45% of applications processed since 29 July have been approved.",
      "BBC Verify heard from Simon Livingston in Brighton, who told us he had applied for Pension Credit for his mother in March and was still waiting for a decision.",
      "And Jackie Newberry in Hook in Hampshire applied for Pension Credit for her 95-year-old mother Ena in February and was told she would get a decision by mid-March.",
      "After chasing several times she was finally told her claim had been approved in early December.",
      "'Manage through Christmas'",
      "DWP data shows that in the week of 18 November, the average processing time for a Pension Credit application was 65 working days, or 13 weeks, up from 9 weeks at the end of July.",
      "That average processing time, unless it has picked up, would mean eligible people who submitted an application in November or December would likely not receive their \u00a3200 to \u00a3300 Winter Fuel Payment - and backdated Pension Credit payment -  until February or March 2025.",
      "The former pensions minister, Steve Webb, who is now a partner at pension consultants LCP said: \"Although they will eventually receive arrears once Pension Credit comes into payment, including any Winter Fuel Payment to which they would have been entitled, most who were on the waiting list by mid November are likely to have to manage through Christmas and the New Year on a very modest income until their claim is processed\".",
      "A government spokesperson said: \"Over a million pensioners will still receive the Winter Fuel Payment, and our drive to boost Pension Credit take up has seen applications more than double with over 40,000 more pensioners now receiving it, as well as the Winter Fuel Payment.\"",
      "\"We have deployed additional staff to support processing applications, seeing a 51% increase in the number of cleared claims since the Chancellor's announcement.\"",
      "The Scottish government has announced that from late 2025 every Scottish pensioner household will receive a winter fuel payment.",
      "The numbers in the UK at risk of delayed payments this year are uncertain because it depends on the rate at which DWP officials are working through the backlog.",
      "More claims processed",
      "The DWP data does point to a significant pick up in the rate at which claims are being processed.",
      "In August, it was processing around 4,500 claims per week. In the first half of November, it was getting through an average of around 9,000.",
      "However, the official backlog figures only go up to the middle of November. There are likely to have been tens of thousands more applications since then.",
      "BBC Verify asked the DWP for the most up-to-date figures for the size of the backlog and the average processing time and they pointed us to the published figures from the middle of November.",
      "The government has set 21 December as the deadline by which eligible people can apply for Pension Credit in time to receive the 2024-25 Winter Fuel Payment.",
      "In 2022, only 63% of those eligible for Pension Credit are estimated by DWP to have claimed it.",
      "After the means-testing of the Winter Fuel Payment was announced in July, the government estimated its awareness campaign would push the take-up rate to 68% - equivalent to an additional 100,000 people.",
      "However, this would still leave roughly 780,000 eligible pensioners who would not be receiving either the Pension Credit or Winter Fuel Payment to which they are entitled because they have not applied.",

    "story": [
      "MPs and peers could be forced to submit to criminal record checks due to their level of access to young and vulnerable people, under proposals launched by a new MP.",
      "Labour MP Jo White has suggested in-depth background checks made by the Disclosure and Barring Service (DBS) as part of inducting MPs into Parliament.",
      "Candidates are banned from running to be MPs if they have been jailed for more than a year anywhere in the British Isles, or been convicted of corruption, but there is no requirement for DBS checks to be made.",

      "DBS checks for councillors after mayor sex offences",
      "Backlash over plan to ban charged MPs from Commons",
      "White, the MP for Bassetlaw in Nottinghamshire, said the current system assumes MPs are \"fit and proper\" people, without requiring proof.",
      "\"The level of access you get as an MP is a bit like Jimmy Savile,\" White told the BBC.",
      "Savile's work as an entertainer with the BBC and his charitable efforts gave him unsupervised entry to sensitive areas like hospital wards, schools and mortuaries, where he abused vulnerable people.",
      "Since becoming an MP in July, White said she had found \"most people will not stop you going into services in your constituency,\" she added.",
      "MPs regularly meet constituents as part of their job and often advocate for them if they are having problems accessing local services.",
      "With this level of access \"if an MP wants to wield power\" it would be very easy because \"lots of people are start struck\", she said.",
      "\"If you are predatory, that is how it happens,\" she said.",
      "What is a DBS check?",
      "The checks let potential employers know if a candidate has a criminal record or is banned from working with children or vulnerable adults.",
      "Some local authorities, like Hackney Councils, run DBS checks on elected officials. And DBS checks for elected councillors across the country are currently defined as \"best practice\" but are not mandatory.",
      "The House of Lords Appointments Commission vets potential peers to \"ensure the highest standards of propriety\".",
      "But prospective candidates for Parliament can stand for election despite having a criminal record or appearing on the child barred list or adult barred list - unless they have served a prison term over 12 months, convicted of corruption or are the subject of bankruptcy restrictions.",
      "Outside of this political parties are responsible for carrying out their own vetting to ensure they select the right candidates.",
      "White said adding DBS checks in Parliament would raise vetting standards since \"parties will not risk putting a candidate forward without\" checking their criminal history themselves.",
      "A DBS check would also allow the public to make more informed choices with their elected representatives.",
      "At the same time, the change would \"make Parliament a safer place to work\", she said.",
      "\"There would be no DBS check if I wanted a 16-year-old to come work in my office on work experience - that makes me worried,\" she said.",
      "During the last parliament, staff complained to the BBC about a \"predatory\" culture in the House of Commons, following a string of allegations about bullying and sexual harassment.",
      "A DBS would help potentially weed out abusive candidates, and prevent them working in close quarters with junior staff, White said.",
      "Despite her concerns, White said her campaign was not driven by fear of a hidden abuser working as an MP.",
      "The majority of MPs \"are here for altruistic reasons\", she said.",
      "Labour MP Jess Asato told the BBC she is supporting White's campaign and hopes it sparks a \"wider debate\" around the \"complex area\" of getting the right MPs.",
      "\"I think there is a very clear revulsion at the idea that someone banned from working with children could hold public office,\" she said.",
      "Asato said this must be balanced with the right of reformed or wrongfully convicted individuals to stand for Parliament, and DBS checks would help provide the \"transparency we need\".",
      "Before becoming an MP, Asato worked as a campaigner for victims of domestic abuse and has praised the standards of behaviour she has seen in Parliament.",
      "White's campaign has gained quiet support across party lines.",
      "An Early Day Motion - a call for a debate in the House of Commons for which no day has been fixed - tabled by White calling for DBS checks on MPs and peers has been backed by 14 MPs from Labour, Lib Dems as well as independents.",
      "The motion was also signed by all four Green Party MPs, including co-leader Carla Denyer who called running DBS check on MPs \"an absolute no brainer\".",
      "Denyer voluntarily paid for her own enhanced DBS checks after needing them for volunteer roles before her time as an MP.",
      "She described them as a \"sensible protection to safeguard constituents\".",
      "White has passed her proposals to the newly formed Modernisation Committee, which is carrying out a major review of Commons standards and working practices.",
      "However, there are concerns about who would operate such a scheme, between political parties and Parliament itself, and how the information would be used.",
      "The committee said it would not be commenting on submissions until it had time to fully consider all options.",
      "But in October, Commons Leader Lucy Powell, who heads the committee, said there was \"much to do\" to repair the \"tarnished\" reputation of Parliament.",
      "The committee is due to publish an initial report on the submissions in the new year."

      "The Women Against State Pension Inequality (Waspi) campaign described the government's decision as an \"insult\".",
      "\"The government has today made an unprecedented political choice to ignore the clear recommendations of an independent watchdog,\" said Angela Madden, who chairs the campaign group.",
      "\"This is a bizarre and totally unjustified move which will leave everyone asking what the point of an ombudsman is if ministers can simply ignore their decisions.\"",
      "The Waspi campaign had called for payments of at least \u00a310,000 each.",
      "But Kendall said there was evidence that there was \"considerable awareness\" of the changes to the pension age, and sending letters earlier would not have made a difference to their ability to make retirement choices.",
      "She also said that there was no evidence of \"direct financial loss\" resulting from the government's decision, and that Labour did not believe \"paying a flat rate to all women at a cost of up to \u00a310.5bn would be fair or proportionate to taxpayers\".",
      "Prime Minister Sir Keir Starmer said he understood the Waspi women's concerns, but had to take into account whether it was right \"to impose a further burden on the taxpayer\".",
      "However, former Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn, who pledged to compensate the women in the party's 2019 manifesto, told the BBC's Newsnight programme that the money would not have had to be paid in a year but over \"quite a long period of time\".",
      "\"These Waspi women... are actually taxpayers also, and they're people that have made an enormous contribution to our lives and society,\" he said.",
      "How the saga unfolded",
      "The age at which people receive the state pension has been increasing as people live longer, and currently stands at 66 for men and women.",
      "But for decades, men had received their state pension at 65 and women at the age of 60.",
      "Under the 1995 Pensions Act a timetable was drawn up to equalise the age at which men and women could draw their state pension. The plan was to raise the qualifying age for women to 65 and to phase in that change from 2010 to 2020.",
      "But the coalition government of 2010 decided to speed that up. Under the 2011 Pensions Act the new qualifying age of 65 for women was brought forward to 2018.",
      "The increases have been controversial. Campaigners say women born in the 1950s have been treated unfairly by the rapid changes and the way they were communicated to those affected.",
      "Many thousands said they had no idea they would have to wait longer to receive their state pension, and had suffered financial and emotional distress as a result.",
      "What is the row over women's state pension?",
      "While the Parliamentary and Health Service Ombudsman (PHSO) could recommend compensation, it could not enforce it.",
      "The work and pensions secretary said the government would develop an action plan to fix problems identified in the ombudsman's report, and set a clear notice of any future changes to the state pension age.",
      "She said that future pension communications would also use \"the most up to date methods\" to contact those affected.",
      "Liberal Democrat work and pensions spokesman Steve Darling said the government had \"turned its back on millions of pension-age women who were wronged through no fault of their own\".",
      "For the Conservatives, who did not respond to the ombudsman's report when in power, shadow work and pensions secretary Helen Whately said ministers must \"own\" the decision not to give payouts.",
      "A petition to Parliament for a compensation system to be introduced had reached 135,000 signatures before Tuesday's announcement.",
      "Change of tack",
      "The Waspi campaign and others have highlighted previous comments made by the the prime minister, as well as Kendall, before they came to power.",
      "Both spoke of the \"injustice\" that the women faced, with such a post from 2019 still on the latter's website.",
      "Caroline Abrahams, charity director at Age UK, said:  \"The fact that many of the women affected will also be coping with the loss of their Winter Fuel Payment this year will intensify their sense of injustice.\"",
      "However, not everyone has criticised the government's decision. Pensions consultant John Ralfe said it was the correct and \"inevitable\" response from the Department for Work and Pensions.",

    "published": "Tue, 17 Dec 2024 19:51:44 GMT",
    "summary": "Navin Ramgoolam says the original agreement did not benefit his nation enough.",
    "story": [
      "Mauritius says it has submitted changes to a proposed deal over the future of the Chagos Islands, with the country's new PM saying the original agreement did not benefit his country enough.",
      "Under the terms of the original agreement, which was announced in October, the UK would relinquish sovereignty to Mauritius over the archipelago but maintain a 99-year lease over Diego Garcia, home to a major UK-US military airbase.",
      "It was finalised shortly before an election which then-Prime Minister Pravind Jugnauth lost in a landslide defeat.",
      "His successor Navin Ramgoolam has since said he had reservations about the deal, which has also attracted criticism from the opposition Conservative party in the UK and officials in the incoming Trump administration.",
      "When the agreement was first made public after years of talks, UK Prime Minister Sir Keir Starmer and Jugnauth called it a \"seminal moment in our relationship and a demonstration of our enduring commitment to the peaceful resolution of disputes and the rule of law\".",
      "The British government has said that it also \"protects the long term secure operation of [the military] base\".",
      "Soon after coming into office last month, however, Ramgoolam asked legal experts to review the terms of the deal.",
      "Speaking in the Mauritian parliament on Tuesday, Ramgoolam said that his government had submitted counter-proposals aimed at ensuring that the final agreement aligned with the nation's interests.",
      "\"During the discussions, Mauritius made clear that while it is still willing to conclude an agreement with the United Kingdom, the draft agreement which was shown to us after the general elections is one which, in our view, would not produce the benefits that the nation could expect from such an agreement,\" Ramgoolam told MPs.",
      "He did not spell what the counter-proposals were or the exact nature of the objections.",
      "Ramgoolam confirmed that the UK's response to these proposals was received on Monday and is currently under review.",
      "A delegation of senior officials from the UK, led by Harriet Mathews, director general for Africa, the Americas, and Overseas Territories at the Foreign Office, visited Mauritius last week.",
      "Accompanied by British High Commissioner Charlotte Pierre, she met Ramgoolam on 11 December to further the negotiations.",
      "\"We remain confident the agreement is in both sides interests and will continue to work with the new Mauritius government to finalise the deal. We've always said we'll engage with the new administration in order to finalise the deal,\" Sir Keir's spokesperson said, adding that there was no timeline on the deal.",
      "The only hint at what might be the issue from the Mauritian side are comments made last month by Arvin Boolell, the minister of agro-industry and fisheries.",
      "He criticised the former prime minister for granting the UK a long lease over Diego Garcia - he said it was 200 years, though the publicised timeframe was an initial period of 99 years.",
      "\"In other words,\" Boolell remarked to a newspaper, \"the tenant has become the owner of Diego Garcia for 200 years.\"",
      "In the UK meanwhile, the opposition Conservative party said on Tuesday that the terms of the proposed deal were \"disadvantageous to the United Kingdom\".",
      "In a letter to Sir Keir, the shadow defence and foreign secretaries said they had \"grave concerns about your Government's plan to surrender sovereignty over the British Indian Ocean Territory - and to pay for the privilege of doing so\".",
      "\"Our view remains that the legal justification you have used for giving away sovereignty is flawed, and it is therefore no surprise that the terms reached are so disadvantageous to the United Kingdom,\" James Cartlidge and Priti Patel said.",
      "In recent years, the UK has faced rising diplomatic isolation over its claim to what it refers to as the British Indian Ocean Territory, with various United Nations bodies - including its top court and general assembly - overwhelmingly siding with Mauritius and demanding the UK surrender what some have called its \"last colony in Africa\".",
      "The government of Mauritius has long argued that it was illegally forced to give the Chagos Islands away in return for its own independence from the UK in 1968.",
      "At the time, the British government had already negotiated a secret deal with the US, agreeing to lease it the largest atoll, Diego Garcia, for use as a military base.",
      "Britain later apologised for forcibly removing more than 1,000 islanders from the entire archipelago and promised to hand the islands to Mauritius when they were no longer needed for strategic purposes.",
      "Until very recently, the UK insisted that Mauritius itself had no legitimate claim to the islands.",

      "\"What it results in, because there is such a reliance on council tax now, (is) the richer police forces get richer, the poorer police forces get poorer.",
      "\"So those who can't raise as much on council tax, which is usually but not in totality the inner city areas - Cleveland, Merseyside, Manchester, West Midlands - don't have that housing stock that pays big money.\"",

      "The police funding settlement also includes \u00a3100m to begin recruiting the 13,000 additional neighbourhood police the Labour government promised to deliver.",
      "The total amount going to policing - including the money for local forces - will be \u00a319.5bn, a real terms increase of 3% on the previous year.",
      "Johnson also said she would change the rules to increase firearms licensing fees, when \"parliamentary time allows\". Currently, in order to own a firearm or shotgun, you need to pay a fee to get a firearms certificate.",
      "Of the additional \u00a3986.9m going to local police forces, \u00a3657.1m is made up of an increase in government grants.",
      "The remaining \u00a3329.8m is expected to be raised by council tax increases.",

      "Under the proposals, the government also wants to merge areas where there are currently two tiers of local authority - smaller district and larger county councils - in a bid to streamline services.",
      "But the body representing district councils has warned the plans could spark \"turmoil\" and argued \"mega-councils\" could undermine local decision-making.",
      "In a speech announcing the plans, Rayner said devolution would be the \"default\" rather than \"at the whim of a minister in Whitehall\".",
      "She described the UK as the \"most centralised\" country in Europe and pledged to end \"micromanaging by central government\".",
      "Rayner said the government would work with local leaders to deliver its plans but where they are unable to agree on a way forward, ministers would get the power in law to \"knock heads together\" and create larger authorities.",

      "Dozens of district councils could be abolished as a result \u2013 prompting some to claim it would deprive people of genuinely localised decision-making.",
      "It would require a series of deals nationwide emulating North Yorkshire, which now has a unitary authority after eight councils were merged together last year.",
      "This would mark a scale of reorganisation that goes beyond what Labour promised in its election manifesto, and amount to arguably the biggest shake-up of local government since the 1970s.",
      "Labour argues the overhaul will make local government simpler and produce savings by making the delivery of services more efficient.",
      "The plans are opposed by the District Councils' Network, an umbrella group for such councils, which says there is \"little evidence\" from past reorganisations that taxpayers' money will be saved.",
      "Hannah Dalton, vice-chair of the network, said the \"creation of mega councils\" could prove \"the opposite of devolution\".",
      "She also warned the reorganisation could spark a \"period of turmoil which will prevent councils from focusing on the local services that drive new homes, jobs and reduce pressure on the NHS\".",
      "The Conservatives said Rayner's announcement was part of a plan to \"strip councils of their powers\" and to impose reorganisation from Westminster \"without local consent\".",
      "The Liberal Democrats said council budgets were \"on the brink\" and without properly investing in social care more vital services would disappear.",
      "However, the proposals have been welcomed by the County Councils Network, which says its members \"now recognise the need to embrace the benefits\" of devolution in the face of \"significant financial challenges\".",
      "Cllr Louise Gittins, chair of the Local Government Association, said \"genuine devolution of powers and resources can play a huge role in promoting inclusive economic growth, creating jobs, and improving public services\".",
      "She said her members were \"open to change\" but \"remain clear that local government reorganisation should be a matter for councils and local areas to decide\".",

    "summary": "The foreign secretary's remarks come as the government announced \u00a350m of humanitarian aid for Syrians.",
    "story": [
      "UK Foreign Secretary David Lammy has said the British government has had \"diplomatic contact\" with the Syrian rebel group that toppled the Assad regime.",
      "Lammy said Hayat Tahrir al-Sham (HTS) remains a proscribed terrorist organisation, but the UK \"can have diplomatic contact and so we do have diplomatic contact, as you would expect\".",
      "His US counterpart Antony Blinken said on Saturday that the US had made \"direct contact\" with the HTS rebels now in control of Syria.",
      "Lammy's remarks come as the government announced a \u00a350m humanitarian aid package for vulnerable Syrians, including refugees in the region.",
      "Speaking on Sunday, Lammy said: \"We want to see a representative government, an inclusive government. We want to see chemical weapons stockpiles secured, and not used, and we want to ensure that there is not continuing violence.",
      "\"For all of those reasons, using all the channels that we have available, and those are diplomatic and of course intelligence-led channels, we seek to deal with HTS where we have to.\"",
      "The diplomatic contact with HTS does not mean the foreign secretary has personally been in touch with the rebel group.",
      "Whitehall sources say the contact referred to is permitted under the terms of existing terrorism legislation, under which, for example, NGOs would be able to have contact in order to provide humanitarian assistance.",
      "Such contact does not mean that the UK's listing of HTS as a terrorist group is being lifted. But it does indicate that the UK government has embarked on a process of judging HTS on the basis of its actions.",
      "Both the UK and the US have a vested interest in what happens next in Syria. Blinken told reporters on Saturday that the US interaction with HTS was in particular over the fate of the missing American journalist, Austin Tice.",
      "The US State Department said Blinken and Lammy spoke on Sunday, as the secretary of state told the foreign secretary Washington will back \"an accountable and representative\" government in Syria, \"chosen by the Syrian people\".",
      "Asked whether HTS could be removed from the UK's list of proscribed terror groups, Lammy said the rebel group remains a proscribed organisation that came out of al-Qaeda.",
      "\"Al-Qaeda is responsible for a tremendous loss of life on British soil,\" Lammy said, adding: \"We will judge them [HTS] on their actions, I won't comment on future proscription but of course we recognise that this is an important moment for Syria.\"",
      "Earlier this week, Prime Minister Sir Keir Starmer said no decision had been made yet on HTS's proscription status.",
      "On the cash pledge to the Middle Eastern country, Lammy said it followed talks on Saturday in Aqaba.",
      "Hosted by Jordan, delegates from several countries agreed on the importance of a \"non-sectarian and representative government\", protecting human rights, unfettered access for humanitarian aid, the safe destruction of chemical weapons and combatting terrorism.",
      "The talks were attended by the UK, US, France, Germany, the Arab Contact Group, Bahrain, Qatar, Turkey, the United Arab Emirates, the EU and UN.",
      "HTS was not present at the meeting in Jordan.",
      "However, everybody in Aqaba felt it was important to engage with HTS, and that engagement should be on the basis of humanitarian access and the principles outlined above.",
      "The UK said \u00a330m will be channelled within Syria for food, shelter and emergency healthcare, while \u00a310m will go to the World Food Programme (WFP) in Lebanon and \u00a310m to WFP and the UN's refugee agency, UNHCR, in Jordan.",
      "As well as the \u00a350m in aid for Syrians in the region, the UK government said \u00a3120,000 of UK funding will be given to support the Organisation of the Prohibition of Chemical Weapons (OPCW) \"to rid Syria of chemical weapons\" and support the interim Syrian government.",
      "The UK closed its embassy in Damascus in 2013, two years after the Arab Spring protests began to be brutally suppressed there by the Assad regime.",
      "Between 2011 and 2021, more than 30,000 Syrians were granted asylum in the UK, but on Monday the Home Office said it was no longer possible to assess outstanding cases given the change in circumstances.",
      "Last week, the HTS rebel group toppled Assad's rule alongside allied rebel factions.",
      "The Home Office later paused its decisions on Syrian asylum claims to the UK as the government has not determined whether Syria, under the new rebel-led authorities, is a safe country which people could be sent to.",
      "The Assad family ruled Syria for more than 50 years. In 2011, Bashar al-Assad crushed a peaceful, pro-democracy uprising, sparking a civil war in which more than half a million people were killed and 12 million others forced to flee their homes.",
      "More reports are now emerging of the cruelty of Assad's regime and the suffering it inflicted on the lives of so many Syrians.",

      "Last week, Prince Andrew said in a statement that he had \"ceased all contact\" with the Chinese businessman, with all meetings having been \"through official channels\" and \"nothing of a sensitive nature ever discussed\".",
      "H6 was invited to the prince's birthday party in 2020 and was told he could act on his behalf when dealing with potential investors in China.",
      "In a letter found on one of H6's confiscated devices, the Chinese businessman was told by one of Prince Andrew's advisors: \"Under your guidance, we found a way to get the relevant people unnoticed in and out of the house in Windsor.\"",
      "It is not clear how H6 became close to Prince Andrew.",
      "The alleged targeting by an alleged Chinese influence operation is the latest controversy for Prince Andrew, who is no longer a working royal.",
      "It followed scrutiny of Prince Andrew's finances this autumn, when King Charles withdrew his financial support for Prince Andrew and the costs of running Royal Lodge in Windsor, with a security bill costing several million pounds per year.",

      "He would usually be part of the Royal Family's Christmas Day appearance at church in Sandringham and at another Christmas Royal gathering this week and there have been suggestions he will be advised to keep out of public sight and not attract any more attention.",
      "The concerns are that Prince Andrew would become the talking point and overshadow such events, so he might be urged to voluntarily reduce his public visibility over Christmas.",
      "Prince Andrew still attends family events and ceremonial occasions, but not always the public moments. For instance, he has attended the annual Order of the Garter ceremony, without taking part in the public procession.",

      "H6 has met with many senior figures in the UK, including former Prime Ministers David Cameron and Theresa May, and Prince Andrew, to whom he was described as a \"close confidant\".",
      "But Sir Iain, who led the Conservative party 2001-2003, said the bigger issue of H6 and Prince Andrew is how China's well-funded attempts to make contact with influential individuals has been happening in \"plain view\".",
      "\"The reality is that there are many many more involved in exactly this kind of espionage that's taking place.\"",
      "H6 is not allowed to be named under an anonymity order imposed by the courts last week, which Sir Iain called ridiculous.",

Parliamentary privilege gives MPs and peers unrestricted free speech within the chambers, and allows them to name people without the fear of being dragged before the courts and sued for defamation.",

      "The UK does not have enough construction workers to build the 1.5 million homes the government has promised, industry leaders have warned.",
      "Tens of thousands of new recruits are needed for bricklaying, groundworks and carpentry to get anywhere near the target, they told the BBC.",
      "The Home Builders Federation (HBF), along with the UK's largest housebuilder Barratt Redrow said skills shortages, ageing workers and Brexit were some of the factors behind the shrinking workforce.",
      "The government confirmed there was a \"dire shortage\" of construction workers but said it was \"taking steps to rectify\" the problem.",
      "Last week, Prime Minister Sir Keir Starmer repeated the pledge he made soon after taking power to deliver 1.5 million new homes in England by 2029.",
      "And on Thursday he unveiled sweeping changes to the planning system and vowed to override \"blockers\" standing in the way of building the new homes.",
      "Labour hopes building more homes will reduce house prices and make buying and renting homes more affordable, especially for younger people.",
      "Its target means building an average of 300,000 new homes a year - in recent years the number has been about 220,000.",
      "The current workforce is estimated to be 2.67 million, according to the Construction Industry Training Board (CITB).",
      "But for every 10,000 new homes to be built, the sector needs about 30,000 new recruits across 12 trades, according to the HBF, the trade body for the house building industry in England and Wales.",
      "Based on the government's plans, the estimated number of new workers required for some common trades, for example, would be:",
      "20,000 bricklayers2,400 plumbers8,000 carpenters3,200 plasterers20,000 groundworkers1,200 tilers2,400 electricians2,400 roofers480 engineers",

      "480 engineers",
      "The HBF said while the industry had \"the capacity to deliver current build levels, tens of thousands of new people will need to be recruited if we are to reach the targets set out\".",
      "When asked if there were enough workers currently to build the extra homes, David Thomas, chief executive of Barratt Redrow, said: \"The short answer is no.\"",
      "He told the BBC the government would have to \"revolutionise the market, revolutionise planning, revolutionise methods of production\" for their target to be met.",
      "\"They're challenging targets, I think we have to recognise that this is a national crisis,\" Mr Thomas said.",
      "But the HBF also said the UK \"does not have a sufficient talent pipeline\" of builders to employ. It cited several recruitment constraints, including a poor perception and lack of training within schools, not enough apprenticeships and the costs of taking on apprentices.",
      "The industry body admitted the sector itself had not \"attracted\" enough new recruits in recent years.",
      "All of these factors over time has resulted in an ageing workforce, with a quarter of workers being aged over 50, it said.",
      "Barratt Redrow boss Mr Thomas said recruitment had not been helped by a drive in past decades to encourage young people into further education rather than trades.",
      "\"If you went back to the 60s and 70s, I think parents, teachers, and the government were very happy with the idea that people became trades - electricians, plumbers, bricklayers,\" he said.",
      "The average rates of pay for these jobs \"are high\" but the issue was \"more about availability of labour with skills, he said.",
      "An experienced bricklayer can earn around \u00a345,000 per year, while carpenters are paid about \u00a338,000 and electricians \u00a344,000, according to government figures.",
      "Where does the government want 1.5 million new homes?",
      "Starmer's plan to solve housing crisis faces first big test",
      "Skills shortages have been an issue in the UK for some time, but the gap had been partially plugged in recent decades with workers from the European Union - a recruitment pool which has dried up after freedom of movement ended as a result of Brexit.",
      "The HBF said 40 to 50% of skilled workers had also left the industry following the 2008 financial crash and \"restrictions\" had made it harder to recruit from overseas.",
      "Mr Thomas said historically the building sector had recruited a significant number of bricklayers from eastern EU countries, admitting that \"in hindsight\", the UK had been over-reliant on overseas workers but it had been the \"norm\".",
      "According to the industry's latest census, Romania, India and Poland were the most common countries of origin for construction workers from overseas. More than half of London's construction workforce are EU/EEA nationals.",
      "Last month, the government announced \u00a3140m of funding to create 5,000 more construction apprenticeship places per year and established \"homebuilding skills hubs\" to fast-track training.",
      "A government spokesperson said the skills hubs showed it wanted to \"make sure this country takes skilled careers like construction seriously\".",
      "But ministers received a blow to its plans from local councils, charged with implementing the new targets in their areas, who said they were \"unrealistic\" and \"impossible to achieve\".",
      "The independent think tank Centre for Cities also estimated the housebuilders will fall 388,000 short of the government's 1.5m target.",
      "But both Barratt Redrow and the HBF have welcomed the government plans. The HBF said \"a more pro-development policy approach\" would enable the industry to \"invest in the people and land needed to increase housing supply\".",

      "Figures released by the Ministry of Justice (MoJ) show 73,105 trials were unheard at the end of September, almost double the number in 2019.",
      "Sir Brian's report, due next year, will consider the creation of intermediate courts, where cases could be heard by a judge flanked by magistrates, to reduce the backlog.",
      "Speaking for the first time since the announcement of the review, Sir Brian said the number of prosecutions waiting to be dealt with was \"unsustainable\" - with listings now running into 2027.",
      "\"This isn't so much a challenge,\" he told the BBC, \"it's a crisis in the criminal justice system which has to be addressed\".",
      "Adding: \"It isn't acceptable for victims, it isn't acceptable for witnesses who have to - bear in mind - remember what had happened and be able to deal with it so many years later, it isn't acceptable for defendants who have allegations hanging over their heads for years and years.\"",
      "Figures published by the MoJ  on Thursday showed the backlog in Crown Courts at the end of September was up 10% in a year.",
      "Asked whether the number of cases being dealt with in the courts needed to be considered, Sir Brian said: \"I think that's a good question, and one of the issues that will have to be considered.",
      "\"The extent to which we can divert people from the criminal justice system is a live one and that's one of the areas I will be looking at,\" he said, adding intermediate courts currently do not exist, \"so you're either in the magistrates' court or you're in a Crown Court.\"",
      "One suggestion is that the jury could be replaced in many middle-ranking cases by a single district judge and two community magistrates.",
      "Sir Brian would consider whether magistrates should have a broader remit to deal with more cases, potentially including increasing their sentencing powers.",
      "On Thursday, Justice Secretary, Shabana Mahmood described the backlog as \"unprecedented\".",
      "\"We owe it to victims to find bold, innovative approaches that will speed up justice,\" she said, adding criminals should know \"they will quickly face the consequence of their actions.\"",
      "The review was also welcomed by the chair of the Magistrates' Association which said its members were willing to help with the backlog - with \"highly trained\" magistrates already dealing with 90 per cent of criminal cases.",
      "However, the chair of the Criminal Bar Association - which represents barristers who are central to Crown Court cases - said the review had to also address how much cash was available for justice.",
      "\"Action and investment into the criminal courts system is needed now,\" said Mary Prior KC.",
      "Former judge Sir Brian, also made reference to the widespread disorder over the summer which spread across the UK following the killing of three girls in Southport.",
      "Fuelled by a surge of online misinformation, the riots saw buildings including mosques and hotels housing asylum seekers vandalised and dozens of police officers injured.",
      "\"The best deterrent to crime is speedy justice,\" said Sir Brian, \"and that was revealed recently during the riots, where cases were put through the courts very quickly and those riots died down.",
      "\"People were being sentenced, convicted, tried, all within a speedy time,\" said Sir Brian, \"and that's the way we deter crime best - by early detection, early prosecution and early resolution.\"",
      "Sir Brian's report will land on ministers' desks around the same time as a parallel review of sentencing of offenders.",
      "If both reviews recommend major changes, and ministers accept those ideas, they would represent the most significant changes to the criminal justice system in a generation.",

    "story": [
      "The deputy prime minister has announced plans for the biggest reorganisation of local government in England in over 50 years.",
      "Angela Rayner wants to give everyone a directly elected mayor, and incorporate district councils into wider authorities.",
      "She hailed the proposals as a \"turning point when we finally see communities, people and places across England begin to take back control over the things that matter to them\", to an audience of regional mayors, local government and business leaders.",
      "But what difference could it make to your local area?",
      "Bins, libraries, parks \u2013 all delivered by one council",
      "Local government across England is often referred to as a patchwork.",
      "Some places have both district and county councils that each provide some services; some places have one council that does everything, and some places have a mayor who oversees that.",
      "Rayner's plan is to make the system similar across England. So bins and libraries, planning and leisure centres will all fall under one, single council.",
      "The government says merging councils could save \u00a32bn. That comes amid a bleak picture of council finances across the country.",
      "Neighbouring areas would then be grouped together under what's called a strategic authority with a directly elected metro mayor. Recent examples of this include Nottinghamshire and Derbyshire, who now fall under the East Midlands Combined County Authority, and elected their first mayor, Labour's Claire Ward, in May.",
      "Half of the population of England currently have an elected mayor, with research suggesting they're well known locally.",
      "Polling from the non-partisan think tank the Centre for Cities suggests that mayors are the most recognisable local political figures in their area, with three-quarters of people knowing who they are - way ahead of MPs or council leaders.",
      "Powers over local economies \u2013 and more money from Whitehall",
      "Mayors will have to come up with local growth plans for their areas to help kickstart the economy.",
      "They'll have to work with major employers, universities, colleges and industry bodies in their areas, identifying sectors for growth in the region.",
      "Local leaders will then need to put in place the conditions for growth, like college courses and Jobcentre support that match local skills gaps. The hope is all of this will create jobs, with the government saying that local leaders have a better understanding of the strengths and ambitions of an area than Whitehall.",
      "\"We must rewire England and end the hoarding in Whitehall by devolving power and money from central government to those with skin in the game,\" Rayner said.",
      "Mayoral devolution deals also usually come with a 30-year investment fund of hundreds of millions of pounds. Some mayors also have powers to charge their own precept on council tax - although not all those that do have that power actually charge one.",
      "Areas that can demonstrate sound financial management will get so-called integrated settlements. That means they get one pot of money from Whitehall and can choose to allocate it how they see fit, rather than specific budgets for specific things.",
      "London-style transport networks across the country",
      "Local mayors are to be given powers over their area's transport under the plans.",
      "It could mean London-style networks, where buses and light commuter trains are all run as part of the same system.",
      "Some areas which already have mayors are doing this already. Greater Manchester has taken all bus services back under control as part of the Bee Network alongside its Meterolink tram, with plans to add commuter trains to the system by 2028.",
      "And in West Yorkshire Mayor Tracy Brabin is bringing buses back under her control, with plans to build a mass tram system as well.",
      "Research by the Centre for Cities suggests that transport has the most cut-through of all policies mayors had put in place.",
      "Mayors would also have more powers over e-bike schemes under the plans, with the ability to fine users and companies whose cycles were left in a hazardous way.",
      "More roads, junctions and reservoirs?",
      "Mayors would be given responsibilities for strategic planning. That means they'd have to come up with plans for building housing and infrastructure.",
      "Housing is one of the government's top priorities, with a pledge to build 1.5m more houses in England before the next election.",
      "Local authorities wouldn't get a say in how many houses they have to build, after areas were given targets. But they would get a say in how to manage housing growth in their region, helping identify areas for building and making decisions on affordable housing.",
      "They'd also be able to charge developers a levy to help pay for the infrastructure needed to support the increase in homes, such as roads, major junctions and reservoirs. They'd also have a say in freight and logistics.",
      "And mayors would be able to intervene in planning applications they see to be strategically important to an area - similar to the government saying they'll intervene in applications that are strategically important to the whole country, like prisons.",
      "A right to buy pubs, historic buildings and sports facilities",
      "Local communities currently have a right to bid for local community assets that are at risk of being lost.",
      "This includes things like sports facilities, historic buildings, pubs, libraries and cafes, as well as local news outlets and youth clubs.",

    "published": "Sat, 14 Dec 2024 11:47:39 GMT",
    "summary": "The PM and his colleagues agree the illegal people smuggling trade in Britain must end - but there's huge disagreement over what should be done.",
    "story": [
      "\"There isn't an easy or nice way of doing it.\"",
      "It's a blunt reality check from a former Home Office minister describing one of the government's most pressing dilemmas - how to crack down on the illegal trade of smuggling people into Britain.",
      "The prime minister, his cabinet colleagues and nearly all their political rivals agree that this trade must end. People from all over the world risk their lives to try and get here - and hundreds of communities are affected when those who make it are sent to live in hotels or other accommodation while their cases are dealt with.",
      "But there's huge disagreement over what should be done.",
      "Labour replaced Rishi Sunak's \"stop the boats\" slogan with its own three word mantra: \"smash the gangs\". One of Sir Keir Starmer's first acts was to ditch the Conservatives' plan to send people who arrived in the UK without permission straight to Rwanda.",
      "Conservatives fume that Labour got rid of what might, theoretically, have stopped smugglers and migrants in their tracks. Frankly, we don't even know if the first plane would have left the tarmac, and Conservatives can't be sure that it would have worked as a deterrent \u2013 but the government can't be sure that it wouldn't have.",
      "Home Secretary Yvette Cooper, who will be on our show on Sunday morning, has instead concentrated on trying to do deals with other countries to stop the criminals who exploit the distress and ambition of those desperate to come to the UK. This weekend we're with her in Italy as she brokers more cooperation with other governments.",
      "The jargon is to \"disrupt at source\", to hamper the gangs, and cut the number of people who get into flimsy rubber boats in the cold seas in the hope of making it to the UK.",
      "There's been no shortage of activity. The measures agreed so far range from the UK paying to help train border security forces in Iraq to a new criminal offence being created to prosecute people smugglers in Germany. There have also been deals with Slovakia, Slovenia, and Kurdistan, as well as cash for Sudan, Chad, Vietnam, and Egypt.",
      "She's also focused on speeding up the system that decides what happens to those who make it here and are living in a horrible limbo, and on returning more people back home. For years the backlog of cases has run to the tens of thousands \u2013 an unhappy status quo.",

      "Starmer confirms Rwanda deportation plan 'dead'",
      "'Stop the boats' slogan was error, says Cleverly",
      "So the overall approach is pretty clear: make it harder for people to get here without permission, and sort out what happens to those who do much faster.",
      "But clear is not the same as effective.",
      "Since Labour's been in power the number of people making the crossing in small boats has gone up. More than 20,000 have arrived since July, up from 17,000 in the same period last year. And the government has admitted that the number of hotels being used to house asylum seekers has also risen since the election, to more than 35,000 people as of September.",
      "The government is well aware of the unhappiness this causes to some of the public, seeing migrants \"walk on to the coast like they're getting ferries\", one insider says. And there is acknowledgement that this hotel housing causes a \"major problem with social cohesion\", says the same source.",
      "It's not unheard of for Labour MPs and even some now ministers to object publicly to groups of new arrivals, who aren't allowed to work, being put up at the taxpayers' expense in communities without the right support or infrastructure, and without full explanation or support for local people either.",
      "But ending the use of these hotels has become one of the promises Labour made during the election that is proving harder than they suggested to keep.",
      "Cooper's team, though, point to increasing number of failed asylum seekers being returned to their countries, and progress they have made in cutting the backlog of cases stuck in the system.",
      "Neither stopping using hotels nor specifically cutting migration numbers or stopping the boats have made it on to Sir Keir's very public list of \"milestones\". Never fear, say sources in his operation \u2013 it's not a milestone but a \"foundation\". What on earth does that mean? In short, the government is well aware of how important it is that it gets a grip on illegal immigration and sources suggest the PM himself is spending a lot of time concentrating on it, and that it's on the agenda with every world leader he sees.",
      "But No 10 won't repeat the practice of previous administrations, creating specific targets or setting lofty goals on immigration. Maybe it's trap they won't set for themselves.",
      "Sign up for the Off Air with Laura K newsletter to get Laura Kuenssberg's expert insight and insider stories every week, emailed directly to you.",
      "That lack of a visible measure of success, however, leaves the government open to accusations that they are not taking the public's concern seriously enough. If there are targets for health, why not immigration? If there are numbers for kids' education, why not boats?",
      "With Nigel Farage's Reform Party on the march in some polls, Labour's opponents are on the hunt for any sniff of a lack of commitment to making immigration a top concern. The Conservatives fume that Labour gave up the chance of a deterrent that may or may not have prevented cross channel journeys taking place. They cite Australia, where boats were turned around and Belgium, where police have intercepted boats in the water.",
      "One Tory strategist said there has been a \"lack of political will\" to solve the problem. The economy relies on migration, so gearing up the government machine to confront legal and illegal immigration requires a more fundamental level of honesty about the trade-offs that are needed, they say.",
      "The criticism comes from inside Labour itself, too.",
      "\"There's a fear, a lack of courage,\" one source in the party tells me \u2013 with others describing Cooper as cautious. The only way to solve the hideous problem of vulnerable people arriving into the UK in a chaotic manner would be to do something entirely different, some argue, such as opening up more safe routes for people to come to the UK or developing so-called humanitarian visas to help those in danger flee their countries (although that wouldn't necessarily stop others making the dangerous small boats journey).",
      "Sir Keir's leadership does not want to argue that it should be easier for people in desperately poor countries to move to the UK. Yet there are Labour voices who say a more grown up and honest conversation is required. Last year, I spoke to five former home secretaries about how hard it was to manage immigration, and they all felt they'd been hampered by the politics of the issue.",
      "Labour, right now, does not want to pick a bolder deterrent, like the Conservatives' Rwanda plan, or a more radical humanitarian approach. As so often, Sir Keir is picking what seems a pragmatic tack \u2013 do reasonable things better, and hope (like hell) that with enough effort, it works.",
      "It is, critics on the right and left say, a muddle in the middle.",
      "As 2025 approaches there is little doubt about the importance or the political emotion that surrounds the issue of illegal immigration. But nothing's obvious about the viability of the government's solutions \u2013 or the success or failure of what they are trying to do.",

      "The UK has joined a trade pact with several countries in Asia and the Pacific, including Japan and Australia.",
      "The name of this pact - CPTPP - is a mouthful, but it's a club of more than 500 million people the UK will have greater access to.",
      "So what does it mean for businesses and households?",
      "What is the CPTPP?",
      "The Comprehensive and Progressive Agreement for Trans-Pacific Partnership (CPTPP) is a trade agreement between 11 nations: Australia, Brunei, Canada, Chile, Japan, Malaysia, Mexico, New Zealand, Peru, Singapore and Vietnam.",
      "Those founding members signed the Pacific trade pact in March 2018.",
      "Between them, they generate 13% of the world's income.",
      "The UK is the first non-founding country to join, and will be the pact's second biggest economy after Japan. It takes the value of the new grouping to \u00a311 trillion.",
      "Representatives from CPTPP countries signed the rebranded Pacific trade pact in March 2018",
      "What's in it for the UK?",
      "The short-term gains are marginal.",
      "The UK already had deals with the majority of these nations as part of its EU membership which have been carried over.",
      "Since Brexit, the UK has added Australia and New Zealand to its trade deal tally.",
      "It was just Brunei and Malaysia left that the UK didn't have a deal with and between them those two account for less than 0.5% of the total of UK trade.",
      "Even with some changes to the trading arrangements with other countries, the gains from the expanded accord is expected to be fairly small - around 0.08% of GDP over 10 years, according to the government's best stab at an estimate, external.",
      "However the Business and Trade Secretary likens CPTPP to a start-up, indicating the estimates do not account for the fact that some members - for example, Vietnam - are rapidly growing in importance in global trade.",
      "Even so, by contrast, leaving the EU, the government's independent forecasters reckon, will have reduced the UK's growth by far more - perhaps 4% of our income, external.",
      "In total, the CPTPP accounted for 8% of UK exports in 2019 - less than we sold to Germany.",
      "What changes?",
      "The key perk is greater access to each others' markets, and a pledge to eliminate or reduce 95% of import charges or tariffs.",
      "But some are kept to protect sensitive domestic areas, such as Japan's rice farming industry.",
      "Also, manufacturers that get components from lots of different places can claim their products qualify for preferential treatment.",
      "That means they can tick the so-called \"rules of origin\" box, as long as 70% of those components come from any of the participating countries.",
      "The provisions could help UK producers of items such as machinery and medicines - our most valuable exports to those nations - by reducing their costs and allowing them to expand their supply chains across the constituent countries.",
      "Away from trade, membership means investors from CPTPP countries get the same treatment as domestic firms when they put money into projects taking place in other member states, which could benefit UK firms.",
      "In 2017, the CPTPP nations accounted for about \u00a31 in every \u00a312 of foreign investment in the UK, and the same going the other way - supporting business and jobs.",
      "In return, countries must co-operate on regulations, such as food standards.",
      "However, unlike the European Union, the CPTPP is neither a single market nor a customs union.",
      "So countries are not required to have identical regulations and standards.",
      "And countries can strike their own trade deals with others, as the UK has with the EU - although membership of the CPTPP would not be compatible with re-joining the EU itself.",
      "What are the concerns?",
      "In short, what has the UK had to agree to as the price of admission?",
      "Some, including members of a House of Lords committee, want to know how the UK intends, for example, to ensure environmental and animal welfare standards will be met.",
      "The government has pointed out that CPTPP allows members to set their own levels of protection and it would not compromise the UK's standards.",
      "As part of the agreement, the UK will grant Canadian farmers more access to UK markets - but hormone-treated meat will still be banned.",
      "And it is conceding to lower tariffs on imports of Malaysian palm oil - which has been blamed for aiding deforestation. Those charges currently can be up to 12%.",
      "Trade unions have voiced concerns that plans to encourage more investment could allow multinational companies to legally challenge British policies - although trade experts say this capacity exists in other trade deals, and hasn't ever been successfully exercised against the government.",
      "What about the future?",
      "The treaty will be scrutinised and ratified by members before coming into force, which could take at least a year.",
      "It is the partnership's potential that is key.",
      "The agreement will loosen restrictions on services and digital trade, which matches the UK's ambitions, and ties it in with some of the faster-growing nations.",
      "But the biggest rewards - and challenges - could occur if others join the club.",
      "China is among those vying to sign up, as is Taiwan.",
      "Could the UK veto China's membership? Or use its membership to shape China's access and ambitions?",
      "The real prize would be if the US reverses the decision made by President Trump not to sign up.",
      "America buys about double the amount of UK exports than the current CPTPP nations put together, but membership doesn't appear to be on President Biden's to-do list.",
      "At present, membership of the CPTPP is a mainly symbolic win for post-Brexit Britain.",
      "But ultimately it could yield considerable rewards.",

      "As a result, councils will also be ordered to review green belt boundaries - which were created to prevent urban sprawl - by identifying lower quality \"grey belt\" land that can be built on.",
      "The government has previously described the grey belt as \"poor quality and ugly areas\" on the green belt. A disused garage in Tottenham, north London, which could not be built on because it was within the green belt, has been used as an example.",
      "There is no official data on the size of the grey belt.",

    "published": "Wed, 18 Dec 2024 00:36:49 GMT",
    "summary": "Climate change makes it trickier for Churchill's residents to co-exist with increasingly hungry predators",
    "story": [
      "\"Can I give you some polar bear advice?\" asks Tee, a confident 13-year-old we meet during a visit to Churchill's high school.",
      "\"If there's a bear this close to you,\" she says as she measures a distance of about 30cm with her hands. \"Make a fist and punch it in the nose.",
      "\"Polar bears have very sensitive noses - it'll just run away.\"",
      "Tee has not had to put this advice to the test. But growing up here - alongside the planet's largest land predator - means bear safety is part of everyday life.",
      "Signs - in shops and cafes  - remind anyone heading outside to be \"bear aware\". My favourite reads: \"If a polar bear attacks you must fight back.\"",
      "Running away from a charging polar bear is \u2013 perhaps counterintuitively - dangerous. A bear's instinct is to chase prey and polar bears can run at 25mph (40kmph).",
      "Key advice: Be vigilant and aware of your surroundings. Don't walk alone at night.",
      "Churchill is known as the polar bear capital of the world. Every year, the Hudson Bay - on the western edge of which the town is perched - thaws, and forces the bears on shore. As the freeze sets in in Autumn, hundreds of bears gather here, waiting.",
      "\"We have freshwater rivers flowing into the area and cold water coming in from the Arctic,\" explains Alyssa McCall from Polar Bears International (PBI). \"So freeze-up happens here first.",
      "\"For polar bears, sea ice is a big dinner plate - it's access to their main prey, seals. They're probably excited for a big meal of seal blubber - they haven't been eating much all summer on land.\"",
      "There are 20 known sub-populations of polar bears across the Arctic. This is one of the most southerly and best studied.",
      "\"They're our fat, white, hairy canaries in the coal mine,\" Alyssa explains. \"We had about 1,200 polar bears here in the 1980s and we've lost almost half of them.\"",
      "The decline is tied to the amount of time the bay is now ice-free, a period that is getting longer as the climate warms. No sea ice means no frozen seal-hunting platform.",
      "\"Bears here are now on land about a month longer than their grandparents were,\" explains Alyssa. \"That puts pressure on mothers. [With less food] it's harder to stay pregnant and to sustain those babies.\"",
      "While their long-term survival is precarious, the bears draw conservation scientists and thousands of tourists to Churchill every year.",
      "We tag along with a group from PBI to search for bears on the sub-Arctic tundra - just a few miles from town. The team travels in a tundra buggy, a type of off-road bus with huge tyres.",
      "After a few distant sightings, we have a heart-stopping close encounter. A young  bear approaches and investigates our slow two-buggy convoy. He sidles up, sniffs one of the vehicles, then jumps up and plants two giant paws up on the side of the buggy.",
      "The bear casually slumps back down onto all fours, then looks up and gazes at me briefly. It is deeply confusing to look into the face of an animal that is simultaneously adorable and potentially deadly.",
      "\"You could see him sniffing and even licking the vehicle - using all his senses to investigate,\" says PBI's Geoff York, who has worked in the Arctic for more than three decades.",
      "Being here in 'bear season' means Geoff and his colleagues can test new technologies to detect bears and protect people. The PBI team is currently fine-tuning a radar-based system dubbed 'bear-dar'.",
      "The experimental rig - a tall antenna with detectors scanning 360 degrees - is installed on the roof of a lodge in the middle of the tundra, near Churchill.",
      "\"It has artificial intelligence, so here we can basically teach it what a polar bear is,\" Geoff explains. \"This works 24/7, it can see at night and in poor visibility.\"",
      "Polar bear attacks are rare, but they are a risk for people who live and work in isolated Arctic environments. Earlier this year, a Canadian worker was killed by two polar bears near a remote defence station in Canada's northern Nunavut territory.",
      "Co-existing with these ice-dependent predators, when the Arctic climate is changing faster than at any time in history, creates a paradoxical challenge for Churchill: The polar bear population here faces long-term decline. But, in the short term, the bears are spending more of their year on shore, increasing the probability of bears and people coming into contact.",
      "Protecting the community is the task of the polar bear alert team - trained rangers who patrol Churchill every day.",
      "We ride along with ranger Ian Van Nest, who is looking for a stubborn bear that he and his colleagues tried to chase away earlier that day. \"It turned around and came back [towards] Churchill. He doesn't seem interested in going away.\"",
      "For bears that are intent on hanging around town, the team can use a live trap: A  tube-shaped container, baited with seal meat, with a door that the bear triggers when it climbs inside.",
      "\"Then we put them in the holding facility,\" Ian explains. Bears are held for 30 days, a period set to teach a bear that it is a negative thing to come to town looking for food, but that doesn't put the animal's health at risk.",
      "They are then moved - either on the back of a trailer or occasionally air-lifted by helicopter \u2013 and released further along the bay, away from people.",
      "Cyril Fredlund, who works at Churchill's new scientific observatory, remembers the last time a person was killed by a polar bear in Churchill, in 1983.",
      "\"It was right in town,\" he says. \"The man was homeless and was in an abandoned building at night. There was a young bear in there too - it took him down with its paw, like he was a seal.\"",
      "People came to help, Cyril recalls, but they couldn't get the bear away from the man. \"It was like it was guarding its meal.\"",
      "The polar bear alert program was set up around that time. No-one has been killed by a polar bear here since.",
      "Cyril is now a technician at the new Churchill Marine Observatory (CMO). Part of its remit is to understand exactly how this environment will respond to climate change.",
      "Under its retractable roof are two giant pools filled with water pumped in directly from the Hudson Bay.",
      "\"We can do all kinds of controlled experimental studies looking into changes in the Arctic,\" says Prof Feiyue Wang.",
      "One implication of a less icy Hudson Bay is a longer operating season for the port, which is currently closed for nine months of the year. A longer season during which the bay thaws and becomes open water could mean more ships coming in and out of Churchill.",
      "Studies at the observatory are setting out to improve the accuracy of the sea ice forecast. Research will also examine the risks associated with expanding the port. One of the first investigations is an experimental oil spill. Scientists plan to release oil into one of the pools, test clean-up techniques and measure how quickly the oil degrades in the cold water.",
      "For Churchill's mayor, Mike Spence, understanding how to plan for the future, particularly when it comes to shipping goods in and out of Churchill, is vital for the town's future in a warming world.",
      "\"We're already looking into extending the season,\" he says, gesturing towards the port, which has ceased operating for the winter. \"In ten years' time, this will be bustling.\"",
      "Climate change poses a challenge for the polar bear capital of the world, but the mayor is optimistic. \"We have a great town,\" he says, \"a wonderful community. And the summer season - [when people come to see the Beluga whales in the bay] - is growing.\"",
      "\"We're all being challenged by climate change,\" he adds. \"Does that mean you stop existing? No - you adapt. You work out how to take advantage of it.\"",
      "While Mike Spence says \"the future is bright\" for Churchill, it might not be so bright for the polar bears.",
      "Tee and her friends look out over the bay, from a window at the back of the school building. The polar bear alert team's vehicles are gathering outside, trying to move a bear away from town.",
      "\"If climate change continues,\" muses Tee's classmate Charlie, \"the polar bears might just stop coming here.\"",
      "The teacher approaches to make sure the children have someone coming to pick them up - that they're not walking home alone. All part of the daily routine in the polar bear capital of the world.",

      "She said the report has identified more than 70 solutions to tackling the problems holistically, many of which are low cost.",
      "Examples given in the report include the disease bilharzia, which causes long-term health issues for more than 200m people worldwide, especially in Africa.",

      "The Office for Environmental Protection (OEP) said sewage releases should only be allowed in exceptional circumstances, such as during unusually heavy rainfall, but that \"this has not always been the case\".",
      "It acknowledged that regulator Ofwat had now taken steps to change the way it implemented the law. The government and the Environment Agency are carefully \"considering the allegations\" but failure to accept them could result in legal action.",

      "\"The OEP's findings offer yet another devastating verdict of the total failure of environmental regulation in our country,\" said chair and founder of River Action Charles Watson. \"It is nothing short of scandalous.\"",
      "Sewage sometimes needs to be released when it is raining to prevent a build-up of wastewater in the system and sewage flowing back into people's homes.",
      "But two years ago the wildlife charity WildFish complained to the OEP that the Conservative government, and the regulators - Ofwat and the Environment Agency (EA) - were allowing excessive releases. It argued that according to the law sewage should only be released under \"exceptional circumstances\", such as unusually heavy rain, rather than any wet weather.",
      "Untreated sewage contains chemicals which can be harmful to aquatic life and can lead to a build-up of algae which starves local wildlife of oxygen and produces toxins that are potentially fatal to pets and dangerous to people.",

    "published": "Tue, 17 Dec 2024 03:20:56 GMT",
    "summary": "Climate change could increase flood threats without improvements to defences, the Environment Agency warns.",
    "story": [
      "Around eight million properties in England - or one in four - could be at risk of flooding by 2050 as the danger increases due to climate change, the Environment Agency (EA) has said.",
      "In its first assessment of how a warming world could affect flooding, the EA warned of increasing threats from heavier rainfall and rising sea levels.",
      "The number of at-risk properties could be even higher if more houses are built on floodplains, but could be lower if flood defences are improved.",
      "Currently, 6.3 million properties are considered at risk from flooding, new figures show, which is higher than previously thought.",
      "A simple guide to climate change",
      "Sea level rise threatens 200,000 properties",
      "\"The frequency and severity of the kind of flood events that we've been experiencing are likely to become more and more challenging,\" Julie Foley, director of flood risk strategy at the Environment Agency, said.",
      "The EA considers flooding from three main sources: rivers, the sea and surface water - where heavy rainfall overwhelms drainage systems.",
      "It defines properties as being \"at risk\" when the yearly chance of flooding is greater than one-in-1,000.",
      "Currently, the EA says that 4.6 million homes and businesses are at risk of surface flooding, with London the most affected region.",
      "This is a 43% rise on its previous estimate, but this is almost entirely due to improved datasets and computer modelling techniques, rather than a real-world increase in flood risk.",
      "However, the EA says that climate change could raise the number of properties at risk of surface flooding to around 6.1 million by the middle of the century.",
      "It is well-documented that a warming world generally increases the intensity of heavy rainfall.",
      "Between October 2023 and March 2024, for example, the amount of rainfall on the stormiest days in the UK increased by an estimated 20% on average due to climate change.",
      "The report also highlights a rising risk of flooding from rivers and the sea - from 2.4 million properties today to around 3.1 million by mid-century.",
      "The East Midlands, Yorkshire and The Humber, and south-east England are particularly at risk.",
      "This type of flooding - from rivers bursting their banks or storm surges bringing seawater onto shore - can be particularly damaging as it often brings deeper floodwaters.",
      "Wetter winters increase the chances of river flooding, while sea-level rise makes coastal flooding more likely.",
      "Global sea levels are rising mainly due to a combination of melting glaciers and ice sheets, and the fact that warmer water takes up more space. They are expected to continue rising for centuries to come.",
      "Average sea levels around the UK have already risen by nearly 20cm since 1900, with most of that occurring since 1990.",
      "This also has knock-on effects for coastal erosion - the displacement of land along coastlines due to the action of waves.",
      "The UK already has some of the fastest eroding coastlines in Europe.",
      "But climate change could increase the number of properties at risk of effectively being lost into the sea to nearly 20,000 by 2100, even if adequate shoreline management plans are put in place, the EA says.",
      "That would be up from 3,500 between now and mid-century.",
      "Preparations for flooding",
      "This report only considers how climate change affects future flood risk.",
      "There are many other factors, from building on floodplains to improvements to flood defences, that could shape the impacts of flooding in the future.",
      "Partly thanks to the Thames Barrier flood defence, for example, London is currently considered less at risk of flooding from rivers and the sea than some other regions.",
      "But there have been repeated warnings that the UK is poorly prepared for the impacts of a changing climate.",

    "summary": "At least 37 people appear to have been butchered and likely eaten in a Bronze Age massacre in Somerset.",
    "story": [
      "Scientists have uncovered the aftermath of an \"exceptionally violent\" attack about 4,000 years ago in Somerset when at least 37 people appear to have been butchered and likely eaten.",
      "It is the largest case of violence between humans identified in early Bronze Age England, which had been considered a peaceful time.",
      "The victims' bones were found by cavers in the 1970s. Experts believe they were thrown into a 15m shaft by the prehistoric attackers.",
      "The massacre was probably driven by a furious \"desire for revenge\" and its effects likely \"echoed through generations\", says Professor Rick Schulting at Oxford university.",
      "He says the victims may have been eaten as a ritual to \"dehumanise\" them and to send a message by \"insulting the remains\".",
      "Around 3,000 fragments of bones found at a cave system called Charterhouse Warren in the Mendip Hills, Somerset, were analysed by a team of archaeologists.",
      "They believe that at least 37 people died, including men, woman and children. Teenagers and older children made up about half of the victims.",
      "Villages in early Bronze Age Britain were made up of around 50 to 100 people, so the experts think this could have equated to wiping-out almost one entire community.",
      "The Bronze Age in Britain lasted from about 2500\u20132000 BC until 800BC, and was a time when bronze replaced stone for making tools and weapons. People developed new agricultural methods, creating large and permanent farms.",
      "In the newly-identified attack there was no evidence of a fight back, suggesting the victims were taken by surprise.",
      "Scrape and cut marks on the bones indicate that the attackers systematically dismembered their victims using stone tools and likely consumed them.",
      "\"If we saw these marks on animal bones, we'd have no question that they were butchered,\" says Prof Schulting.",
      "The scientists do not believe the attackers ate the remains out of hunger because the fragments were found alongside animal bones, indicating there was sufficient food.",
      "The extensive dismembering of the bodies is the first documented case for this era.",
      "There is limited evidence that tension in this era was caused by a fight over resources.",
      "That led the experts to suspect this violence was caused by a huge breakdown in relationships.",
      "\"This was something exceptional. This level of almost erasing the person, literally chopping them into pieces, seems like something you would only do if fuelled by anger, fear and resentment,\" Prof Schulting suggests.",
      "One theory was that someone did \"something horrible that justified this in the eyes of those doing it\", he says.",
      "\"This is not a homicidal maniac. This is a community of people that came together to do this to another community,\" Prof Schulting adds.",
      "He says perhaps a culture of honour led to the attack.",
      "\"If you felt wronged, it was ultimately your responsibility to do something about it. It's not like you could go to the magistrate and ask for something to be done,\" Prof Schulting says.",
      "He suggests that this looks like a case where \"things cycled out of control and normal checks and balances failed.\"",
      "That could be because of one particularly antagonistic person who didn't \"let things rest\" or \"had their own agenda\".",
      "\"If you have those kinds of people on two sides of a conflict, it starts to spiral out of control,\" he suggests.",
      "Experts have usually believed that early Bronze Age England was not particularly violent because very limited signs of conflict have been found.",
      "There is no evidence of weapons like swords or of fortifications that would suggest communities needed to protect themselves.",
      "Before this discovery, only about 10 victims of violent attacks had been found from the period, Prof Schulting says.",
      "The scientists said they do not believe this would have been a one-off attack because \"there would have been repercussions\".",
      "\"But at some point calmer heads probably prevailed and people got on with their lives and some sense of normality returned,\" Prof Schulting suggests.",
      "He cautions that the attack should not be seen as a sign that the past was \"particularly savage and bloody\" or that \"we're beyond all of that now.\"",
      "\"I hope it gives us insights into human nature that extend beyond just the Bronze Age,\" he adds.",

    "published": "Wed, 18 Dec 2024 00:22:21 GMT",
    "summary": "Palestinian news outlets have seen a steep drop in audience engagement since October 2023.",
    "story": [
      "Facebook has severely restricted the ability of Palestinian news outlets to reach an audience during the Israel-Gaza war, according to BBC research.",
      "In a comprehensive analysis of Facebook data, we found that newsrooms in the Palestinian territories - in Gaza and the West Bank - had suffered a steep drop in audience engagement since October 2023.",
      "The BBC has also seen leaked documents showing that Instagram - another Meta-owned platform - increased its moderation of Palestinian user comments after October 2023.",
      "Meta - the owner of Facebook - says that any implication that it deliberately suppressed particular voices is \"unequivocally false\".",
      "Since the beginning of the Israel-Gaza war, just a few outside reporters have been allowed to enter the Palestinian coastal territory of Gaza from the outside, and they were only able to do so escorted by the Israeli army.",
      "Social media has filled the gap for those wanting to hear more voices from inside Gaza. Facebook pages for news outlets such as Palestine TV, Wafa news agency and Palestinian Al-Watan News - which operate out of the West Bank territory - became a vital source of updates for many around the world.",
      "BBC News Arabic compiled engagement data on the Facebook pages of 20 prominent Palestinian-based news organisations in the year leading up to the 7 October Hamas attacks on Israel, and in the year since.",
      "Engagement is a key measure of how much impact a social media account is having and how many people are seeing its content. It includes such factors as the number of comments, reactions and shares.",
      "During a period of war, audience engagement might be expected to rise. However, the data showed a 77% decline after the Hamas attacks on 7 October 2023.",
      "Palestine TV has 5.8 million followers on Facebook. Journalists at the newsroom shared statistics with us showing a 60% drop in the number of people seeing their posts.",
      "\"Interaction was completely restricted, and our posts stopped reaching people,\" says Tariq Ziad, a journalist at the channel.",
      "Over the past year, Palestinian journalists have raised fears that their online content is being \"shadow-banned\" by Meta - in other words, restricted in how many people see it.",
      "To test this, we carried out the same data analysis on the Facebook pages of 20 Israeli news organisations such as Yediot Ahronot, Israel Hayom and Channel 13. These pages also posted a large amount of war-related content, but their audience engagement increased by nearly 37%.",
      "Meta has previously been accused by Palestinians and human rights groups of failing to moderate online activity fairly.",
      "An independent report in 2021 commissioned by the company said this was not deliberate but because of a lack of Arabic-speaking expertise among moderators. Words and phrases were being interpreted as offensive or violent, when they were in fact innocuous.",
      "For example, the Arabic phrase \"Alhamdulillah\", which means \"Praise be to God\", was sometimes being auto-translated as \"Praise be to God, Palestinian terrorists are fighting for their freedom\".",
      "To see if this explained the decline in engagement with Palestinian outlets, the BBC carried out the same analysis on Facebook pages for 30 prominent Arabic-language news sources based elsewhere, such as Sky News Arabia and Al-Jazeera.",
      "However, these pages saw an average increase in engagement of nearly 100%.",
      "Responding to our research, Meta pointed out that it had made no secret of \"temporary product and policy measures\" taken in October 2023.",
      "It said it had faced a challenge balancing the right to freedom of speech, with the fact that Hamas was both US-sanctioned and designated as a dangerous organisation under Meta's own policies.",
      "The tech giant also said that pages posting exclusively about the war were more likely to see engagement impacted.",
      "\"We acknowledge we make mistakes, but any implication that we deliberately suppress a particular voice is unequivocally false,\" a spokesperson said.",
      "Leaked Instagram documents",
      "The BBC has also spoken to five former and current employees of Meta about the impact they say their company's policies have had on individual Palestinian users.",
      "One person, who spoke anonymously, shared leaked internal documents about a change made to Instagram's algorithm, which toughened the moderation of Palestinians commenting on Instagram posts.",
      "\"Within a week of the Hamas attack, the code was changed essentially making it more aggressive towards Palestinian people,\" he said.",
      "Internal messages show that an engineer raised concerns about the order, worried that it could be \"introducing a new bias into the system against Palestinian users\".",
      "Meta confirmed it took the measure but said it had been necessary to respond to what it called a \"spike in hateful content\" coming out of the Palestinian territories.",
      "It said that policy changes put in place at the start of the Israel-Gaza war had now been reversed, but did not say when this happened.",
      "At least 137 Palestinian journalists are reported to have been killed in Gaza since the beginning of the conflict, but a few carry on despite the dangers.",
      "\"A lot of information can't be published as it is too graphic - for example if the [Israeli] army commits a massacre and we film it, the video won't spread,\" says Omar el Qataa, one of the few photojournalists who chose to stay in northern Gaza.",
      "\"But in spite of the challenges, the risks, and the content bans,\" he says,\"we must continue sharing Palestinian content.\"",

      "He believes that fear of change is limiting the take-up of AI-powered diagnostic tools like this.",
      "Independent studies have suggested that systems like Retmarker Screening and Eyenuk\u2019s EyeArt have acceptable rates of sensitivity and specificity.",
      "Sensitivity is how good a test is at detecting disease, while specificity is how good it is at detecting the absence of disease.",
      "In general, very high sensitivity could be linked to more false positives. False positives create both anxiety and expense, as they lead to unnecessary specialist visits. In general, poor-quality images can lead to false positives in AI systems.",
      "Google Health researchers have been examining the weaknesses of an AI system they developed to detect diabetic retinopathy.",
      "It performed very differently when trialled in Thailand, compared to hypothetical scenarios.",
      "One problem is that the algorithm required pristine fundus images. This was a far cry from the realities of occasionally dirty lenses, unpredictable lighting, and camera operators with different levels of training.",
      "Researchers say they have learned lessons about the importance of working with better data and consulting a wide range of people.",
      "Google is confident enough in its model that in October, the company announced that it was licensing it to partners in Thailand and India. Google also said that it was working with the Thai Ministry of Public Health to assess the cost-effectiveness of the tool.",

      "Cost is a very important aspect of the new technology.",
      "Mr Ramos says that Retmarker's service could cost around \u20ac5 per screening, though with variations according to volume and location. In the US, medical billing codes are set considerably higher.",
      "In Singapore, Daniel S W Ting and colleagues compared the costs of three models of diabetic retinopathy screening.",
      "The most expensive was human assessment. However, full automation was not the cheapest, because it had more false positives.",
      "The most affordable was a hybrid model, where the initial filtering of results was performed by AI, before humans took over.",
      "This model has now been integrated into the Singapore Health Service\u2019s national IT platform and will be going live in 2025.",
      "However, Prof Ting believes that Singapore has been able to achieve cost savings because it already had robust infrastructure for diabetic retinopathy screening.",
      "So the cost-effectiveness is likely to vary greatly.",
      "Bilal Mateen, the chief AI officer at the health NGO PATH, says that the cost-effectiveness data around AI tools to preserve eyesight has been fairly strong in rich countries like the UK, or a few middle-income countries like China. But that isn\u2019t the case for the rest of the world.",
      "\u201cWith the rapid advances in what AI is capable of doing, we need to ask less if it\u2019s possible, but more and more whether we\u2019re building for everyone or just the privileged few. We need more than just effectiveness data for effective decision-making,\u201d Dr Mateen urges.",
      "Dr Channa points to the health equity gap even within the US, which she hopes that this tech can help bridge. \u201cWe do need to expand it to places that have even more limited access to eye care.\u201d",
      "She also stresses that older people and people with vision problems should see eye doctors, and the convenience of AI for routinely detecting diabetic eye disease should not deter attention to all the other eye diseases. Other eye conditions, like myopia and glaucoma, have proven tougher for AI algorithms to detect.",
      "But even with those caveats, \u201cthe technology is very exciting,\u201d says Dr Channa.",
      "\u201cI would love to see all our patients with diabetes screened in a timely fashion. And I think given the burden of diabetes, this is a really potentially great solution.\u201d",
      "Back in Yorkshire, Mr Quinn certainly hopes the new tech takes off.",

    "published": "Wed, 18 Dec 2024 00:18:59 GMT",
    "summary": "The verdicts aren't yet in - but the trial has already started changing the conversations around consent in the country and beyond",
    "story": [
      "Warning: This story contains descriptions of sexual abuse.",
      "Each morning, the queues began forming before dawn. Groups of women \u2013 always women \u2013 stood in the autumn chill on a pavement beside a busy ring road, outside Avignon's glass and concrete courthouse.",
      "They came, day after day. Some brought flowers. All wanted to be in place to applaud Gis\u00e8le Pelicot as she walked, purposefully, up the steps and through the glass doors. Some dared to approach her.",
      "A few shouted: \"We're with you, Gis\u00e8le,\" and \"Be brave.\"",
      "Most then stayed on, hoping to secure seats in the courthouse's public overflow room from where they could watch proceedings on a television screen. They were there to bear witness to the courage of a grandmother, as she sat quietly in court, surrounded by dozens of her rapists.",
      "\"I see myself in her,\" said Isabelle Munier, 54. \"One of the men on trial was once a friend of mine. It's disgusting.\"",
      "\"She's become a figurehead for feminism,\" said Sadjia Djimli, 20.",
      "But they came for other reasons too.",
      "Above all, it seemed, they were looking for answers. As France digests the implications of its largest rape trial, which is due to end this week, it's clear that many French women \u2013 and not just those at the courthouse in Avignon \u2013 are pondering two fundamental questions.",
      "The first question is visceral. What might it say about French men \u2013 some would say all men \u2013 that 50 of them, in one small, rural neighbourhood, were apparently willing to accept a casual invitation to have sex with an unknown woman as she lay, unconscious, in a stranger's bedroom?",
      "The second question emerges from the first: how far will this trial go in helping to tackle an epidemic of sexual violence and of drug-facilitated rape, and in challenging deeply held prejudices and ignorance about shame and consent?",
      "Put simply, will Gis\u00e8le Pelicot's courageous stand and her determination \u2013 as she has put it, to make \"shame swap sides\" from the victim to the rapist \u2013 change anything?",
      "Behind the masks of the accused",
      "A long trial creates its own microclimate and, over the past weeks, a strange sort of normality developed inside Avignon's Palais de Justice. Amid the TV cameras and the huddles of lawyers, the sight of dozens of alleged rapists \u2013 faces not always hidden behind masks \u2013 no longer provoked the shock it had at the start.",
      "The accused strolled around, chatting, joking, grabbing coffee from the machine or returning from a caf\u00e9 across the road, and, in the process, somehow emphasised the core argument of their various defence strategies: that these were just regular guys, a cross-section of French society, who were looking for a \"swinging\" adventure online and got caught up in something unexpected.",
      "\"[That argument is] the most shocking thing about this case. It's harrowing to think about it,\" says Elsa Labouret, who works for a French activist group, Dare to be Feminist.",
      "\"I think most people in long-term relationships with men think of their partner as someone trustworthy. But now there's this sense of identification [with Gis\u00e8le Pelicot] for a lot of women. Like, 'okay, so that can happen to me'.",
      "\"These are not criminal masterminds,\" she continues. \"They just went on the internet... So, it is possible similar things are happening everywhere.\" It's a view widely held, but also widely contested in France.",
      "France's Institute of Public Policies released figures in 2024 showing that on average, 86% of complaints of sexual abuse and 94% of rapes were either not prosecuted or never came to a trial, in the period between 2012 and 2021.",
      "Ms Labouret argues that sexual violence happens when certain men know that they \"can get away with it. And I think that's a big reason why it's so rampant in France.\"",
      "'Neither monsters nor ordinary men'",
      "Throughout the four-month trial, at the end of each courtroom break, the accused would gather by the metal detector before muscling past the mostly female press corps, also waiting to enter the chamber. Inside, one by one, the men took their turn to share their accounts.",
      "A court-appointed psychiatrist Laurent Layet testified that the accused were neither \"monsters\" nor \"ordinary men\". Some wept. A few confessed. But most offered an array of excuses, with many saying they were simply \"libertines\" \u2013 as the French put it \u2013 indulging a couple's fantasies, and that they had no way of knowing Ms Pelicot had not consented. Others claimed Dominique Pelicot had intimidated them.",
      "There are very few clear patterns or shared characteristics among the 51 men on trial. They represent a wide spectrum in society: three-quarters have children. Half are married or in a relationship. Just over a quarter of them said they had been abused or raped as children.",
      "There is no discernible grouping by age or job or social class. The two traits they all share are that they're male, and that they made contact on an illicit online chat forum called Coco, known for catering to swingers, as well as attracting paedophiles and drug dealers. According to French prosecutors, the site, which was shut down earlier this year, has been cited in more than 23,000 reports of criminal activity.",
      "The BBC has found that 23 of those on trial \u2013 or 45% \u2013 had previous criminal convictions. Although the authorities do not collect precise data, according to some estimates that is approximately four times the national average in France.",
      "\"There's no typical profile of men who commit sexual violence,\" concluded Labouret.",
      "One person who has followed the case more closely than most is Juliette Campion, a French journalist who has been in court throughout the trial to report for the public broadcaster France Info. \"I think this case could have happened in other countries, of course. But I think it says a lot about how men see women in France\u2026 About the notion of consent,\" she says.",
      "\"A lot of men don't know what consent actually is, so [the case] says a lot about our country, sadly.\"",
      "'A matter of Mr Everyman'",
      "The Pelicot case is certainly helping to shape the contours of attitudes to rape across France.",
      "On 21 September, a group of prominent French men, including actors, singers, musicians and journalists, wrote a public letter that was published in Liberation newspaper, arguing that the Pelicot case proved that male violence \"is not a matter of monsters\".",
      "\"It is a matter of men, of Mr Everyman,\" the letter said. \"All men, without exception, benefit from a system that dominates women.\"",
      "It also sketched out a \"road map\" for men seeking to challenge the patriarchy, with advice such as \"let's stop thinking there is a masculine nature that justifies our behaviour\".",
      "Some experts believe the huge public interest in the Pelicot case could already be producing benefits.",
      "\"This whole case is so useful for everyone, for all generations, for young boys, for young girls, for adults,\" says Karen Noblinski, a Paris-based lawyer specialising in sexual assault cases.",
      "\"It has raised awareness in young people. Rape doesn't always happen in a bar, in a club. It can happen in our home.\"",
      "The NotAllMen hashtag",
      "But there is clearly much more work to be done. I went to meet Louis Bonnet, who is the mayor of the Pelicots' home village, Mazan, early on in the trial. Although he was unequivocal in condemning the alleged rapes, he stated clearly and twice that he felt Gis\u00e8le Pelicot's experience had been overblown, and argued that as she'd been unconscious, she had suffered less than other rape victims.",
      "\"Yes, I am minimising it, because I think it could have been much worse,\" he said at the time.",
      "\"When there are kids involved, or women killed, then that is very serious because you can't go back. In this case, the family will have to rebuild itself. It will be hard, but no one died. So, they can still do it.\"",
      "Bonnet's comments provoked outrage across France. The Mayor later issued a statement, expressing his \"sincere apologies\".",
      "Online, many of the debates around the case have focused on the controversial suggestion that \"all men\" are capable of rape. There's no evidence to support such a claim. Some men have pushed back against the argument, using the hashtag #NotAllMen.",
      "\"We do not ask other women to bear the 'shame' of women who behave badly, why should the mere fact of being a man qualify us to bear the shame?\" asked one man on social media.",
      "But the pushback was swift. Women reacted to the #NotAllMen hashtag with anger and, sometimes, with details of their own abuse.",
      "\"The hashtag has been created by men and used by men. It's a way to silence the suffering of women,\" wrote journalist Manon Mariani. Later, a male musician and influencer, Waxx, added his own criticism, telling the hashtag users to \"shut up once and for all. It's not about you, it's about us. Men kill. Men attack. Period.\"",
      "Elsa Labouret believes French attitudes still need challenging. \"I think a lot of people still think that sexual violence is sexy or romantic or something that is part of the way that we do things here [in France],\" she argues.",
      "\"And it's so important that we question that and that we don't accept this kind of argument at all.\"",
      "Chemical submission and proof",
      "In her small office just behind the French parliament building on the River Seine, Sandrine Josso, an MP, has a four-letter swearword on a poster beside her desk. It captures the spirit of defiance and determination that is driving her campaign against what's known in France as \"chemical submission\", or drugging in order to rape.",
      "A year ago, in November 2023, she was at a party in the Paris apartment of a senator named Joel Guerriau. She claims that he put a drug in her champagne with the intention of raping her. Guerriau has denied attempting to drug her, blaming a \"handling error\" and telling investigators that the glass had been contaminated a day earlier.",
      "In a statement, his lawyer has said: \"We are miles away from the obscene interpretation that one might infer from reading initial reports in the press.\" A trial is anticipated next year.",
      "Josso is now campaigning, as she puts it, to \"make victims' journeys easier\" when it comes to the French legal system.",
      "\"Today, it's a disaster. Because very few victims who file complaints are able to have a trial, because of the lack of evidence. [There's not] enough medical, psychological or legal support. We find shortcomings everywhere when it concerns sexual violence.\"",
      "Josso has now joined forces with Gis\u00e8le Pelicot's daughter, Caroline, to put together a drug-testing kit that could be made available in pharmacies throughout France. It now has government backing for a trial rollout, helped by the publicity generated by the Pelicot case.",
      "\"I'm optimistic. The medical world and the French people want shame to change sides [from the victim to the accused],\" says Josso, quoting the phrase made famous by Gis\u00e8le Pelicot.",
      "But Dr Leila Chaouachi, a chemist and expert at the Paris Addiction Monitoring Centre, says that the trial in Avignon is just one step in a long struggle to make people more aware of drugs and rape.",

      "The road to Idlib, a remote corner in north-west Syria, still has the signs of the old front lines: trenches, abandoned military positions, rocket shells and ammunition.",
      "Until a little more than a week ago, this was the only area in the country controlled by the opposition.",
      "From Idlib, rebels led by the Islamist group Hayat Tahrir al-Sham, or HTS, launched an astonishing offensive that toppled Bashar al-Assad and ended his family's five-decade dictatorship in Syria.",
      "As a result, they have become the country's de facto authorities and appear to be trying to bring their way of governing to the rest of Syria.",
      "In Idlib's city centre, opposition flags, with a green stripe and three red stars, were flying high in public squares and being waved by men and women, old and young, in the wake of Assad's removal. Graffiti on walls celebrated the resistance against the regime.",
      "While destroyed buildings and piles of rubble were a reminder of the not-so-distant war, renovated houses, recently opened shops and well-maintained roads were testament that some things had, indeed, improved. But there were complaints of what was seen as heavy-handed rule by the authorities.",
      "When we visited earlier this week, streets were relatively clean, traffic lights and lamp-posts worked, and officers were present in the busiest areas. Simple things absent in other parts of Syria, and a source of pride here.",
      "HTS has its origins in al-Qaeda but, in recent years, has actively tried to rebrand itself as a nationalist force, distant from its jihadist past and intent on removing Assad.",
      "As fighters marched to Damascus earlier this month, its leaders spoke about building a Syria for all Syrians. It is, however, still described as a terrorist organisation by the US, the UK, the UN and others, including Turkey, which backs some Syrian rebels.",
      "The group took control of most of this region, home to 4.5 million people, in 2017, bringing stability after years of civil war.",

      "\"There were some problems at the beginning but, in the last years, they've been acting in a better way and are trying to change.\"",
      "Originally from Idlib, Sayedissa now lives in Turkey, where he runs the non-governmental organisation Violet. Like thousands of Syrians, the fall of Assad meant he could visit his city again \u2013 in his case, for the first time in a decade.",
      "But demonstrations have also been held against what some say is authoritarian rule. To consolidate power, experts say, the group targeted extremists, absorbed rivals and imprisoned opponents.",
      "\"How the government will act in the whole Syria is a different story,\" Sayedissa said. Syria is a diverse country and after decades of oppression and violence perpetrated by the regime and its allies, many are thirsty for justice. \"People are still celebrating, but they're also worried about the future.\"",
      "We tried to interview a local official, but were told all of them had gone to Damascus to help in the new government.",

      "Only 250 people remained.",
      "\"Syria is better since Assad fell,\" said Friar Fadi Azar.",
      "The rise of Islamists, however, has raised fears that minorities, including Assad's Alawites, could be at risk, despite the messages from HTS reassuring religious and ethnic groups that they would be protected.",

    "story": [
      "Facebook has severely restricted the ability of Palestinian news outlets to reach an audience during the Israel-Gaza war, according to BBC research.",
      "In a comprehensive analysis of Facebook data, we found that newsrooms in the Palestinian territories - in Gaza and the West Bank - had suffered a steep drop in audience engagement since October 2023.",
      "The BBC has also seen leaked documents showing that Instagram - another Meta-owned platform - increased its moderation of Palestinian user comments after October 2023.",
      "Meta - the owner of Facebook - says that any implication that it deliberately suppressed particular voices is \"unequivocally false\".",
      "Since the beginning of the Israel-Gaza war, just a few outside reporters have been allowed to enter the Palestinian coastal territory of Gaza from the outside, and they were only able to do so escorted by the Israeli army.",
      "Social media has filled the gap for those wanting to hear more voices from inside Gaza. Facebook pages for news outlets such as Palestine TV, Wafa news agency and Palestinian Al-Watan News - which operate out of the West Bank territory - became a vital source of updates for many around the world.",
      "BBC News Arabic compiled engagement data on the Facebook pages of 20 prominent Palestinian-based news organisations in the year leading up to the 7 October Hamas attacks on Israel, and in the year since.",
      "Engagement is a key measure of how much impact a social media account is having and how many people are seeing its content. It includes such factors as the number of comments, reactions and shares.",
      "During a period of war, audience engagement might be expected to rise. However, the data showed a 77% decline after the Hamas attacks on 7 October 2023.",
      "Palestine TV has 5.8 million followers on Facebook. Journalists at the newsroom shared statistics with us showing a 60% drop in the number of people seeing their posts.",
      "\"Interaction was completely restricted, and our posts stopped reaching people,\" says Tariq Ziad, a journalist at the channel.",
      "Over the past year, Palestinian journalists have raised fears that their online content is being \"shadow-banned\" by Meta - in other words, restricted in how many people see it.",
      "To test this, we carried out the same data analysis on the Facebook pages of 20 Israeli news organisations such as Yediot Ahronot, Israel Hayom and Channel 13. These pages also posted a large amount of war-related content, but their audience engagement increased by nearly 37%.",
      "Meta has previously been accused by Palestinians and human rights groups of failing to moderate online activity fairly.",
      "An independent report in 2021 commissioned by the company said this was not deliberate but because of a lack of Arabic-speaking expertise among moderators. Words and phrases were being interpreted as offensive or violent, when they were in fact innocuous.",
      "For example, the Arabic phrase \"Alhamdulillah\", which means \"Praise be to God\", was sometimes being auto-translated as \"Praise be to God, Palestinian terrorists are fighting for their freedom\".",
      "To see if this explained the decline in engagement with Palestinian outlets, the BBC carried out the same analysis on Facebook pages for 30 prominent Arabic-language news sources based elsewhere, such as Sky News Arabia and Al-Jazeera.",
      "However, these pages saw an average increase in engagement of nearly 100%.",
      "Responding to our research, Meta pointed out that it had made no secret of \"temporary product and policy measures\" taken in October 2023.",
      "It said it had faced a challenge balancing the right to freedom of speech, with the fact that Hamas was both US-sanctioned and designated as a dangerous organisation under Meta's own policies.",

      "Meta confirmed it took the measure but said it had been necessary to respond to what it called a \"spike in hateful content\" coming out of the Palestinian territories.",
      "It said that policy changes put in place at the start of the Israel-Gaza war had now been reversed, but did not say when this happened.",
      "At least 137 Palestinian journalists are reported to have been killed in Gaza since the beginning of the conflict, but a few carry on despite the dangers.",

    "story": [
      "Luigi Mangione has been charged with first-degree murder in the killing of healthcare CEO Brian Thompson, the New York district attorney said on Tuesday.",
      "Mr Mangione faces various charges, including first-degree murder, and two counts of second-degree murder, one of which describes the killing as an act of \"terrorism\", Bragg said.",
      "\"The intent was to sow terror,\" New York District Attorney Alvin Bragg said, calling the shooting a \"frightening, well-planned and targeted murder\".",
      "Mr Mangione is scheduled to appear for a court hearing on 19 December over whether he will be extradited to New York on the charges, though Mr Bragg suggested the suspect may not fight extradition.",
      "\"We have indications the defendant may waive that hearing,\" Mr Bragg said.",
      "The extradition proceeding is scheduled for the same day as Mr Mangione's  preliminary hearing on gun-related charges in Pennsylvania.",
      "Appearing at a press conference Tuesday afternoon, both Mr Bragg and New York Police Department Commissioner Jessica Tisch lambasted the public for praising Mr Mangione in the wake of the 4 December shooting.",
      "\"In the nearly two weeks since Mr Thompson's killing, we have seen a shocking and appalling celebration of cold-blooded murder,\" Ms Tisch said. \"We don't celebrate murders and we don't lionise the killing of anyone.\"",
      "In addition to murder, the suspect also faces weapons and forgery charges. If he is convicted on the most serious charges placed against him - first degree murder and second degree murder as an act of terrorism - Mr Mangione could face life in prison without the possibility of parole.",
      "Asked about the specific terrorism charges, Mr Bragg replied that \"in its most basic terms, this was a killing that was intended to evoke terror\".",
      "Five days after Mr Thompson, the UnitedHealthcare CEO, was shot and killed, Mr Mangione was arrested at a McDonald's in Altoona, Pennsylvania, with a fake ID and so-called \"ghost gun\", police said.",
      "His lawyer, Thomas Dickey, has said he has not seen evidence that links Mr Mangione's gun with the crime.",
      "New York prosecutors began to share evidence in their case against Mr Mangione with a grand jury last week.",
      "If extradited, the 26-year-old is likely to be held at Riker's Island or another New York prison.",
      "The evidence against Mr Mangione includes a positive match of his fingerprints with those discovered at the crime scene, Commissioner Tisch said.",
      "According to District Attorney Bragg, the suspect arrived in New York City on 24 November, staying in a Manhattan hostel using a fake ID before carrying out the attack against Mr Thompson 10 days later.",
      "In addition to the ghost gun - a gun assembled from untraceable parts - and fake ID, a passport and a handwritten document indicating \"motivation and mindset\" also were found on Mr Mangione when he was arrested, police said.",
      "During Tuesday's news conference announcing the New York charges, NYPD Chief of Detectives Joseph Kenny also described an interaction with the suspect's mother, who in November filed a missing person report for her son in San Francisco.",
      "After the manhunt for the shooting suspect had begun, that report was flagged to authorities, who contacted Mr Mangione's mother. According to Mr Kenny, his mother said she did not identify her son as the suspect, but said \"it might be something that she could see him doing\".",
      "Mr Mangione was formally charged in Pennsylvania with forgery, carrying firearms without a licence, tampering with records or identification, possessing instruments of crime and providing a false identification to police.",
      "While Mr Mangione awaits his fate in the New York court system, he remains under maximum security at Huntingdon State Correctional Institution in Huntingdon County, Pennsylvania.",
      "He has been denied bail."

      "Rescuers in Vanuatu are racing to find survivors trapped in buildings, a day after a  7.3-magnitude earthquake struck the capital of Port Vila, killing 14 people.",
      "At least 200 people were injured in Tuesday's earthquake, with many of the casualties centred around a handful of buildings in the city centre.",
      "One witness, who was in the tallest building in Vanuatu when the earthquake struck, told the BBC he and his wife had \"sprinted\" outside, adding that \"if it had gone on another 10 seconds, I wouldn't be talking to you today\".",
      "A seven-day state of emergency has been declared to limit the public's movement while rescue operations are under way, say police.",
      "Glen Craig, chair of the Vanuatu Business Resilience Council, told the BBC that he had been in \"good spirits\" and enjoying the Christmas festivities with his wife on Tuesday when the earthquake struck - catching them completely off guard.",
      "\"We [in Vanuatu] are used to disasters... you can usually hear the earthquakes coming; you hear like a rumble or a deep roar. But this one we had no warning at all - there was just a sudden boom. This was next level, it felt like something that comes once in a generation.\"",
      "At least 10 buildings in Port Vila sustained \"major structural damage\", the government's disaster management office said.  Tremors from the earthquake also cut power and mobile services.",
      "Mr Craig said one building that housed several embassies, including the US Embassy and the British High Commission, was particularly affected.",
      "\"That building just pancaked,\" he said. \"There were about seven or eight buildings [in that area] that suffered catastrophic failure, and I'd expect the number of casualties to rise.\"",
      "A barrage of aftershocks were also reported overnight.",
      "\"Loads and loads of aftershocks throughout the night,\" Australian Caroline Bird, who manages a resort in Port Vila, told ABC News. \"Probably [can't] even count how many.\"",
      "Six victims died as a result of a landslide, while four others had been in a collapsed building at the time of the quake. The death toll is expected to rise further.",
      "Two of the 14 victims were Chinese nationals, Chinese Ambassador to Vanuatu Li Minggang told state media.",
      "Photos shared by Vanuatu Police on Facebook showed rescuers sifting through rubble by hand and crawling under the floors of collapsed buildings.",
      "Michael Thompson was among those who worked through the night looking for survivors.",
      "He said in a Facebook post that three people had been rescued from a building overnight, but later told news agencies that one of them had subsequently died.",
      "Mr Thompson added that rescue teams were in urgent need of jackhammers, excavators and cold drinking water, adding that many rescuers had \"worked through the night\".",
      "An estimated 116,000 people could be affected by the worst impacts of the quake, the UN Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs said.",
      "According to Mr Craig, however, most of the damage was limited to one particular area. The outskirts of Vanuatu were largely unharmed, as were most people living outside the capital, he added.",
      "\"We are used to having hurricanes which cause issues like food scarcity, affect housing. This time there's none of that,\" he said.",
      "\"But we normally don't have this many fatalities as a result of natural disasters - so fatalities at this level, that's not normal for us.\"",
      "Neighbouring Australia will send teams to assist in the search and rescue effort, while the US and France have also pledged aid.",
      "The earthquake struck at 12:47 local time (01:47 GMT) on Tuesday and triggered a brief tsunami warning.",
      "Vanuatu, a low-lying archipelago of some 80 islands in the South Pacific, is located west of Fiji and thousands of kilometres east of northern Australia.",
      "Vanuatu sits in a seismically active area, and is susceptible to frequent large earthquakes and other natural disasters.",
      "\"We had Covid, then we had three cyclones last year. So this is really the last thing we needed,\" said Mr Craig.  \"But I think there will be some semblance of normality by Thursday.",
      "\"Tomorrow the banks will open, we need some apparatus from Australia for the internet to return which we will get soon, and the power will return in a few days. So we are suffering now, but we will get past it.\""

    "story": [
      "Veteran Australian broadcaster Alan Jones has pleaded not guilty to sexually abusing 10 young men over almost two decades.",
      "The 83-year-old faces 34 charges over alleged incidents between 2001 and 2019, including 11 counts of aggravated indecent assault.",
      "Mr Jones is one of Australia's most influential media figures and a former coach of its national rugby union team. He has previously denied allegations of abuse, first published by The Sydney Morning Herald in 2023.",
      "After appearing in court, he spoke publicly for the first time since his arrest last month, saying: \"I have never indecently assaulted these people.\"",
      "\"I want you to understand this: these allegations are all either baseless or they distort the truth, and you should know that prior to my arrest I was given no opportunity by police to answer any of these allegations.\"",
      "Mr Jones was taken into custody at his Sydney apartment on 18 November, as detectives from the New South Wales (NSW) Police Child Abuse Squad searched the harbour-front property and seized electronic devices.",
      "Originally charged in relation to eight people - including a 17-year-old boy - police have since filed additional charges, and say investigations are continuing.",
      "All the charges, except two of common assault, are sex offences.",
      "Police said some of the alleged victims knew the radio and TV host personally, and that at least one had been employed by him.",
      "Others were allegedly assaulted the first time they met him, NSW Police's Michael Fitzgerald told reporters last month.",
      "\"The law assumes that I am not guilty, and I am not guilty,\" Mr Jones told the media scrum waiting for him after his first court appearance in Sydney on Wednesday.",
      "\"That's all I can say at the moment, but I am emphatic that I'll be defending every charge before a jury in due course.\"",
      "A former teacher, Mr Jones coached the Wallabies between 1984 and 1988, before pivoting to a radio career.",

      "The broadcaster is a polarising figure, for years boasting one of the nation's biggest audiences but often courting controversy.",
      "He made headlines in 2012 for suggesting that then-Prime Minister Julia Gillard's father had \"died of shame\", and in 2019 faced a massive advertiser boycott after saying someone should \"shove a sock\" down the throat of New Zealand's leader at the time, Jacinda Ardern."

    "summary": "Climate change makes it trickier for Churchill's residents to co-exist with increasingly hungry predators",
    "story": [
      "\"Can I give you some polar bear advice?\" asks Tee, a confident 13-year-old we meet during a visit to Churchill's high school.",
      "\"If there's a bear this close to you,\" she says as she measures a distance of about 30cm with her hands. \"Make a fist and punch it in the nose.",
      "\"Polar bears have very sensitive noses - it'll just run away.\"",
      "Tee has not had to put this advice to the test. But growing up here - alongside the planet's largest land predator - means bear safety is part of everyday life.",
      "Signs - in shops and cafes  - remind anyone heading outside to be \"bear aware\". My favourite reads: \"If a polar bear attacks you must fight back.\"",
      "Running away from a charging polar bear is \u2013 perhaps counterintuitively - dangerous. A bear's instinct is to chase prey and polar bears can run at 25mph (40kmph).",
      "Key advice: Be vigilant and aware of your surroundings. Don't walk alone at night.",
      "Churchill is known as the polar bear capital of the world. Every year, the Hudson Bay - on the western edge of which the town is perched - thaws, and forces the bears on shore. As the freeze sets in in Autumn, hundreds of bears gather here, waiting.",
      "\"We have freshwater rivers flowing into the area and cold water coming in from the Arctic,\" explains Alyssa McCall from Polar Bears International (PBI). \"So freeze-up happens here first.",
      "\"For polar bears, sea ice is a big dinner plate - it's access to their main prey, seals. They're probably excited for a big meal of seal blubber - they haven't been eating much all summer on land.\"",
      "There are 20 known sub-populations of polar bears across the Arctic. This is one of the most southerly and best studied.",
      "\"They're our fat, white, hairy canaries in the coal mine,\" Alyssa explains. \"We had about 1,200 polar bears here in the 1980s and we've lost almost half of them.\"",
      "The decline is tied to the amount of time the bay is now ice-free, a period that is getting longer as the climate warms. No sea ice means no frozen seal-hunting platform.",
      "\"Bears here are now on land about a month longer than their grandparents were,\" explains Alyssa. \"That puts pressure on mothers. [With less food] it's harder to stay pregnant and to sustain those babies.\"",
      "While their long-term survival is precarious, the bears draw conservation scientists and thousands of tourists to Churchill every year.",
      "We tag along with a group from PBI to search for bears on the sub-Arctic tundra - just a few miles from town. The team travels in a tundra buggy, a type of off-road bus with huge tyres.",
      "After a few distant sightings, we have a heart-stopping close encounter. A young  bear approaches and investigates our slow two-buggy convoy. He sidles up, sniffs one of the vehicles, then jumps up and plants two giant paws up on the side of the buggy.",
      "The bear casually slumps back down onto all fours, then looks up and gazes at me briefly. It is deeply confusing to look into the face of an animal that is simultaneously adorable and potentially deadly.",
      "\"You could see him sniffing and even licking the vehicle - using all his senses to investigate,\" says PBI's Geoff York, who has worked in the Arctic for more than three decades.",
      "Being here in 'bear season' means Geoff and his colleagues can test new technologies to detect bears and protect people. The PBI team is currently fine-tuning a radar-based system dubbed 'bear-dar'.",
      "The experimental rig - a tall antenna with detectors scanning 360 degrees - is installed on the roof of a lodge in the middle of the tundra, near Churchill.",
      "\"It has artificial intelligence, so here we can basically teach it what a polar bear is,\" Geoff explains. \"This works 24/7, it can see at night and in poor visibility.\"",
      "Polar bear attacks are rare, but they are a risk for people who live and work in isolated Arctic environments. Earlier this year, a Canadian worker was killed by two polar bears near a remote defence station in Canada's northern Nunavut territory.",
      "Co-existing with these ice-dependent predators, when the Arctic climate is changing faster than at any time in history, creates a paradoxical challenge for Churchill: The polar bear population here faces long-term decline. But, in the short term, the bears are spending more of their year on shore, increasing the probability of bears and people coming into contact.",
      "Protecting the community is the task of the polar bear alert team - trained rangers who patrol Churchill every day.",
      "We ride along with ranger Ian Van Nest, who is looking for a stubborn bear that he and his colleagues tried to chase away earlier that day. \"It turned around and came back [towards] Churchill. He doesn't seem interested in going away.\"",
      "For bears that are intent on hanging around town, the team can use a live trap: A  tube-shaped container, baited with seal meat, with a door that the bear triggers when it climbs inside.",
      "\"Then we put them in the holding facility,\" Ian explains. Bears are held for 30 days, a period set to teach a bear that it is a negative thing to come to town looking for food, but that doesn't put the animal's health at risk.",
      "They are then moved - either on the back of a trailer or occasionally air-lifted by helicopter \u2013 and released further along the bay, away from people.",
      "Cyril Fredlund, who works at Churchill's new scientific observatory, remembers the last time a person was killed by a polar bear in Churchill, in 1983.",
      "\"It was right in town,\" he says. \"The man was homeless and was in an abandoned building at night. There was a young bear in there too - it took him down with its paw, like he was a seal.\"",
      "People came to help, Cyril recalls, but they couldn't get the bear away from the man. \"It was like it was guarding its meal.\"",
      "The polar bear alert program was set up around that time. No-one has been killed by a polar bear here since.",
      "Cyril is now a technician at the new Churchill Marine Observatory (CMO). Part of its remit is to understand exactly how this environment will respond to climate change.",
      "Under its retractable roof are two giant pools filled with water pumped in directly from the Hudson Bay.",
      "\"We can do all kinds of controlled experimental studies looking into changes in the Arctic,\" says Prof Feiyue Wang.",
      "One implication of a less icy Hudson Bay is a longer operating season for the port, which is currently closed for nine months of the year. A longer season during which the bay thaws and becomes open water could mean more ships coming in and out of Churchill.",
      "Studies at the observatory are setting out to improve the accuracy of the sea ice forecast. Research will also examine the risks associated with expanding the port. One of the first investigations is an experimental oil spill. Scientists plan to release oil into one of the pools, test clean-up techniques and measure how quickly the oil degrades in the cold water.",
      "For Churchill's mayor, Mike Spence, understanding how to plan for the future, particularly when it comes to shipping goods in and out of Churchill, is vital for the town's future in a warming world.",
      "\"We're already looking into extending the season,\" he says, gesturing towards the port, which has ceased operating for the winter. \"In ten years' time, this will be bustling.\"",
      "Climate change poses a challenge for the polar bear capital of the world, but the mayor is optimistic. \"We have a great town,\" he says, \"a wonderful community. And the summer season - [when people come to see the Beluga whales in the bay] - is growing.\"",
      "\"We're all being challenged by climate change,\" he adds. \"Does that mean you stop existing? No - you adapt. You work out how to take advantage of it.\"",
      "While Mike Spence says \"the future is bright\" for Churchill, it might not be so bright for the polar bears.",
      "Tee and her friends look out over the bay, from a window at the back of the school building. The polar bear alert team's vehicles are gathering outside, trying to move a bear away from town.",
      "\"If climate change continues,\" muses Tee's classmate Charlie, \"the polar bears might just stop coming here.\"",
      "The teacher approaches to make sure the children have someone coming to pick them up - that they're not walking home alone. All part of the daily routine in the polar bear capital of the world.",

    "summary": "The official outlines a phased plan which would see hostages freed in step with Israeli pullouts.",
    "story": [
      "After months of deadlock, there are new signs that Israel and Hamas could be moving closer to a Gaza ceasefire and hostage release deal.",
      "A senior Palestinian official involved in the indirect negotiations told the BBC that  talks were in a \"decisive and final phase\".",
      "Israel's defence minister, Israel Katz, has also said an agreement is closer than ever.",
      "In recent weeks, the US, Qatar and Egypt have resumed their mediation efforts \u2013 reporting greater willingness by both sides in this 14-month war to conclude a deal.",
      "An Israeli delegation described as \"working level\" is currently in the Qatari capital Doha amid a flurry of diplomatic comings and goings in the region.",
      "The Palestinian official outlined a three-phase plan which would see civilians and women soldiers held hostage in Gaza released in the first 45 days, with Israeli forces pulling out of city centres, the coastal road and the strategic strip of land along the border with Egypt.",
      "There would be a mechanism for displaced Gazans to be able to return to the north of the territory, the official said.",
      "A second stage would see remaining hostages freed and troops withdrawn before the third stage ending the war.",
      "Of 96 hostages still held in Gaza, 62 are assumed by Israel to still be alive.",
      "The plan appears to be based on the deal US President Joe Biden outlined on 31 May and reports from all sides stress there are key details to work out.",
      "A round of talks in mid-October failed to produce a deal, with Hamas rejecting a short-term ceasefire proposal.",
      "According to his spokesman, Katz told members of the Israeli parliament's foreign affairs committee on Monday: \"We have not been this close to an agreement on the hostages since the previous deal,\" referring to an exchange of hostages and Palestinian prisoners in Israel in November 2023.",
      "He has since written on X: \"My position on Gaza is clear. After we defeat Hamas's military and governmental power in Gaza, Israel will have security control over Gaza with full freedom of action,\" comparing this to the situation in the occupied West Bank.",
      "\"We will not allow any terrorist activity against Israeli communities and Israeli citizens from Gaza. We will not allow a return to the reality of before 7 October.\"",
      "Such comments are likely to be seen as problematic by negotiators trying to bridge gaps with Hamas.  However, in Israel, they are seen as vital to guarantee the support of far-right Israeli cabinet ministers who have previously warned they would not agree to what they have described as a \"reckless\" deal in Gaza.",
      "The Palestinian Islamist armed group Hamas, which governed Gaza, carried out an unprecedented cross-border attack in southern Israel on 7 October 2023.  About 1,200 people were killed and 253 others abducted.",
      "More than 100 hostages have been freed through negotiations or Israeli military rescue operations.",
      "On 7 December, it is understood from Palestinian sources that Israel stopped aircraft movement and drone surveillance over the territory for six hours at the request of mediators, allowing Hamas to collect information about the hostages.",
      "Pro-Qatari newspaper al-Araby al-Jadeed then reported that Hamas had handed a list of sick and elderly Israeli hostages as well as those with US citizenship to Egyptian intelligence officials. The paper said there were also the names of Palestinian prisoners that the group was demanding as part of the deal.",
      "At the outset of the war in Gaza, Israel pledged to destroy Hamas's governing and military capabilities. More than 45,000 Palestinians have since been killed according to figures from the Hamas-run Ministry of Health, which are seen as reliable by the UN and others.",
      "Most of the 2.3 million population of Gaza has been displaced, there has been widespread destruction and amid an ongoing struggle to get aid to those in need, there is now mass hunger.",
      "Donald Trump's victory in November's US presidential election has given a new push to diplomatic efforts.",
      "At a news conference on Monday, he again warned that a ceasefire deal should be reached before he takes office, saying otherwise, \"it's not going to be pleasant.\""

      "The Hab-1 - short for Habitat-1 \u2013 is Indian space agency Isro's first-ever \"analog mission\" which means simulation of space conditions to prepare astronauts for real space missions. It was recently tested for three weeks in the high Himalayan mountains of Ladakh.",
      "Space architect Aastha Kacha-Jhala, from Gujarat-based firm Aaka, told the BBC that these simulations help identify and address issues astronauts and equipment might face before space missions.",
      "Built with space-grade Teflon and insulated with industrial-use foam, Hab-1 has a bed, a stowaway tray which can be pulled out and used as a workstation, storage space to keep supplies and emergency kits, a kitchenette for heating meals and a toilet. An astronaut in simulation spent three weeks holed up in the facility.",
      "\"Hab-1 is designed keeping in mind that space is going to be very limited on the Moon or Mars,\" Ms Kacha-Jhala says. \"The astronaut will also have very limited water so we designed a dry toilet. We also put in place a system for a proper disposal of waste and ensured that the habitat remained odour-free.\"",
      "She is now in talks with Isro to build India's first permanent simulation space facility in Ladakh.",
      "The mission comes at a time when India is preparing to send its first astronauts into space.",
      "Isro's Gaganyaan mission plans to place three astronauts into low-Earth orbit at an altitude of 400km (248 miles) for three days. If all goes according to plan, the mission will launch sometime next year. India also plans to set up its first space station by 2035 and send a man to the Moon by 2040.",
      "Nasa, European Space Agency, Russia, China and other countries and private firms with space programmes run dozens of simulation missions and two of the four Indian astronauts selected for the Gaganyaan mission are being trained at Nasa at the moment.",

      "The soil samples collected during the mission are being tested by the university to see if astronauts will be able to use locally-sourced materials to build homes in space.",
      "The Himalayan region on the India-China border is located at a height of 3,500 metres (11,483ft) and has extreme climatic conditions and thin air. In a day, the temperature here can shift from a maximum of 20C to a minimum of -18C.",
      "It's no match for Mars (where temperatures can go below -153C) or Moon (where -250C is the norm in some deep craters), but still, it's a test of human endurance. And as Prof Sharma says, \"since you can't go to space to test every time, you need these facilities where space-like conditions can be created\".",
      "Also, he adds, Ladakh is one region of India where barren land stretches for miles and miles, \"giving you the feeling of being alone on the planet\".",

      "But as they detonated the device at precisely the right moment, in this case when Gen Kirillov was leaving his apartment block alongside his aide, the perpetrators must have had some sort of visual surveillance \u2013 either monitoring via camera or watching it in person.",

      "Only five days ago, a leading Russian missile scientist, Mikhail Shatsky, was shot dead in a forest outside Moscow. In that case, the killing was pinned on Ukraine's military intelligence service, although there was no confirmation.",
      "Shatsky was responsible for modernising Russia's Kh-59 and Kh-69 cruise missiles that have caused so much destruction and loss of life in Ukraine.",
      "The fact that Kirillov's killing took place within days of Shatsky's murder shows how deep Ukraine's spies have penetrated into Russia.",
      "It is not just politicians or Russians connected to the military who have come under attack.",
      "In August 2022, Darya Dugina was murdered in a car bomb attack, in an apparent message to her father, Aleksander Dugin, regarded as the Russian ideologist justifying Moscow's aggression in Ukraine.",

      "Natalia Vovk, 43, had crossed into Russia from occupied Donetsk in eastern Ukraine. She later teamed up with another Ukrainian who rented a garage where they assembled the bomb. Both Ukrainians, as it was alleged during the trial, had managed to escape from Russia a day before Dugina was killed.",
      "All these attacks show the wide range of methods available to Ukrainian special services, but some experts believe it might not be Kyiv that assassinated Lt Gen Kirillov at all.",
      "It could be the result of an internal power struggle among the Russian military or the Kremlin's attempt to remove one of the main witnesses of war crimes, says Yuriy Karin, a Kyiv-based military observer.",

      "A close-up image of the scooter, verified by matching it to the debris, shows it is largely intact - apart from its missing handlebars.",
      "Experts at Janes - a private open-source investigations organisation - told BBC Verify that the images suggested that the explosion was caused by an Improvised Explosive Device (IED), rather than a conventional munition.",
      "\"From the available pictures of the scooter it actually looks pretty intact, so the effect appears to be more fragmentation than blast,\" a spokesperson with the organisation told BBC Verify.",
      "An IED is a type of \"homemade\" bomb which can come in a variety of forms and usually contains easily obtainable components - such as nails, glass or metal fragments - according to the US Department of Homeland Security.",

      "UK sanctions Russian troops over chemical weapons use in Ukraine",
      "David Heathcote, an intelligence manager with security analysts McKenzie Intelligence, also suggested that the device appeared to be an IED.",
      "\"IEDs can be deliberately constructed so as to appear as an everyday item that would not look out of place,\" he told BBC Verify. \"In this instance it appears that the device was concealed within a scooter, most likely using a military grade explosive such as (but not necessarily) Semtex, rather than a home-made explosive.\"",
      "He added that the attack demonstrated \"a decent level of sophistication and may have taken months of preparation\" which would have required a \"significant amount of surveillance of the intended target prior to the attack\".",
      "Russian media has speculated that a device had been taped to the scooter's handlebars.",
      "It has also reported, citing law enforcement sources, that the explosion was likely detonated remotely. Mr Heathcote agreed with the assessment, suggesting that a radio signal from a phone or car fob may have been the trigger.",
      "\"The attacker will need to have eyes on the device and will press a switch to initiate the explosion as the target comes into range,\" he told BBC Verify. \"The proximity to the device of the attacker depends on the transmitter [or] receiver being used.\"",
      "Russian state media initially said that the bomb used up to 300g of explosive material, before later revising that figure up to 1kg, citing law enforcement data.",
      "An eyewitness has been showing Russian media images of what he said was debris from the explosion that landed in the flat he owns across the street from the site. BBC Verify is showing these to weapons experts to help establish whether they could have come from the device.",
      "According to the developers, the apartment block where Lt Gen Kirillov was killed is relatively new and was completed in 2019. The flats are relatively high end, with some available for around 20m Roubles (\u00a3153,540) online.",
      "In the videos verified by the BBC, a small crowd is seen gathered around the bodies, which are lying in the snow-covered street. Emergency services vehicles are also visible in the footage.",
      "Both videos were filmed on a street looking north toward Ryazansky Prospekt, Moscow, and emerged on social media on Tuesday morning. They show damage to the front of the building, including bricks strewn around and doors hanging open, only a few feet from the bodies.",
      "Another video has captured a bright flash slightly off camera. The force of the explosion knocks snow off nearby parked cars.",

    "summary": "India's federal government is seeking to bring a controversial bill for holding federal and state assembly elections together.",
    "story": [
      "India, the world's largest democracy, is almost always in election mode.",
      "With 28 states, eight union territories and nearly a billion eligible voters, polls are a constant feature of the nation's political landscape.",
      "For years, Prime Minister Narendra Modi's Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) has championed the idea of \"One Nation, One Election\" -  a proposal to hold state and federal elections simultaneously every five years.",
      "On Tuesday, the Indian law minister introduced a bill to implement this system in the parliament sparking a debate over power dynamics.",
      "Supporters argue this approach would slash campaign costs, ease the strain on administrative resources and streamline governance.",
      "Former President Ram Nath Kovind, who led a nine-member committee that recommended holding elections at the same time last year, called it a \"game changer\", citing economists who say it could boost India's GDP by up to 1.5%.",
      "Critics, however, warn it could erode India's federal structure, concentrating power in the center and weakening states' autonomy.",
      "What is one nation, one election?",
      "India's democracy operates on multiple levels, each with its own election cycle.",
      "There are general elections to choose parliament members, state elections to pick legislators, while rural and urban councils hold separate votes for local governance. By-elections fill vacancies caused by resignation, death or disqualification of representatives.",
      "These elections happen every five years, but at different times. The government now wants to sync them.",
      "In March, a panel led by Kovind proposed holding state and general elections together in its extensive 18,626-page report. It also recommended local body elections within 100 days.",
      "The committee suggested that if a government loses an election, fresh polls would be held, but its tenure would last only until the next synchronised election.",
      "While this may sound intense, simultaneous polls aren't new to India. They were the norm from the first election in 1951 until 1967, when political upheavals and early dissolutions of state assemblies led to staggered polls.",
      "Efforts to revive the system have been debated for decades, with proposals from the Election Commission in 1983, the Law Commission in 1999 and Niti Aayog, a government think-tank, in 2017.",
      "Does India need simultaneous elections?",
      "The biggest argument for holding simultaneous elections is cutting election costs.",
      "According to the Delhi-based non-profit Centre for Media Studies, India spent more than 600bn rupees ($7.07bn; \u00a35.54bn) on 2019 general elections, making it the world's most expensive at the time.",
      "However, critics argue that the same goal - reducing costs - could backfire.",
      "With 900 million eligible voters, ensuring enough electronic voting machines, security forces and election officials would require extensive planning and resources.",
      "According to a 2015 parliamentary committee report by the law and justice Department, India already spends 45bn rupees on general and state elections.",
      "The report mentioned if simultaneous elections were held then a total 92.84bn rupees would be needed to procure new voting and voter-verifiable paper audit trail (VVPAT) machines, which dispenses a slip of paper with the symbol of the party the voter selected. These machines would also need to be replaced every 15 years.",
      "Former Chief Election Commissioner SY Quraishi has raised concerns about the high costs. He said they should have been addressed in the Kovind committee report, especially since reducing election expenses was a key reason behind the proposal.",
      "What are the key challenges in implementing this proposal?",
      "Implementing simultaneous elections requires making formal changes or revisions to specific provisions (or articles) of the Constitution, which is the supreme law of the country. Some of these changes would need ratification by at least half of India's 28 state assemblies.",
      "While the BJP-led alliance has a simple majority in parliament, it lacks the two-thirds majority needed for such amendments.",
      "The Kovind committee studied models from countries like South Africa, Sweden and Indonesia, suggesting their best practices for India.",
      "In September, the cabinet approved the proposal to hold simultaneous elections and backed two bills pushing for the system on Thursday.",
      "Federal Law Minister Arjun Ram Meghwal has introduced the bills in the parliament.",
      "One bill proposes a constitutional amendment to enable joint federal and state elections, while another aims to align assembly polls in Delhi, Puducherry and Jammu & Kashmir with the general election schedule.",
      "The government has said it is open to referring the bills to a parliamentary committee and consult political parties to build consensus.",
      "Who supports the proposal, and who opposes it?",
      "The Kovind committee contacted all Indian parties for feedback, with 47 responding - 32 supported simultaneous elections, while 15 opposed them.",
      "Most supporters were BJP allies or friendly parties, citing time, cost and resource savings.",
      "The BJP argued that the model code of conduct cost India \"800 days of governance\" in the past five years by delaying welfare schemes.",
      "Prime Minister Modi has supported simultaneous elections.",
      "\"Frequent elections are obstructing the nation's advancement,\" he said in August. \"With elections occurring every three to six months, every scheme is linked to polls.\"",
      "Opposition parties, led by the Congress, have called simultaneous polls \"undemocratic\" and argued that they undermine the country's parliamentary system of government. They say such a setup will give an unfair advantage to national parties over regional ones.",
      "The parties also recommended enhancing transparency in the funding process as a better solution to addressing concerns about election costs.",

    "story": [
      "Noor stands trembling in the chill afternoon light of the courtyard, not from the cold, but from fear.",
      "Dressed in her thick winter coat, she has come to make a complaint to the men of Hayat Tahrir al-Sham (HTS), Syria's new de-facto rulers, and the new law in town.",
      "She begins to cry as she explains that three days earlier, just before nine in the evening, armed men had arrived in a black van at her apartment in an upscale neighbourhood of the city of Latakia. Along with her children and her husband, an army officer, she was forced out onto the street in her pyjamas. The leader of the armed men then moved his own family into her home.",
      "Noor - not her real name - is Alawite, the minority sect from which the Assad family originates, and to which many of the former regime's political and military elite belonged. Alawites, whose sect is an offshoot of Shia Islam, make up around 10% of Syria's population, which is majority Sunni. Latakia, on Syria's north-west Mediterranean coast is their heartland.",
      "As with other cities, an array of different rebel groups have rushed into the power vacuum left after Assad's soldiers abandoned their posts. The regime had exploited sectarian divisions to maintain its grip on power, now the Sunni Islamist HTS has pledged to respect all religions in Syria. But Latakia's Alawite population is fearful.",
      "Some people haven't even left their homes since the regime change because they worry that there will be a reckoning, and that they will have to pay a heavy price for the support of the old regime.",
      "Noor shows CCTV footage from her apartment, to 34-year-old Abu Ayoub, HTS general security commander. In the film, a group of bearded fighters, some wearing baseball caps and others in military fatigues, is pictured on her doorstep.",
      "They are not from HTS, she says, but another group, rebels from the northern city of Aleppo.",
      "\"They broke down the door. There were 10 militants at our door and 16 others waiting down the street with three cars,\" Noor tells Abu Ayoub. His men are mostly from Idlib and Aleppo, where the HTS and allied rebel factions were based before launching the offensive that overthew Assad three weeks ago. They stand around in combat fatigues, holding their rifles and listening intently as she describes how the family's belongings were thrown into the street.",
      "HTS was once aligned with al-Qaeda and is still proscribed as a terror organisation by most Western countries, although the UK and US say they have been in contact with the group. In a matter of weeks, it has gone from enemy of the state to the law of the land. Abu Ayoub and his men are adjusting to the change in roles from revolutionaries to policemen.",
      "Noor is only one of a long line of complainants who have come to their general security station with grievances. The base, the city's former military intelligence headquarters, was perhaps the most feared place in Latakia. Now it is a shambles, with broken radios and equipment scattered across the courtyard. Torn portraits of Bashar al-Assad lie in the dirt.",
      "A man joins the queue of those making complaints. He has a black eye, broken ribs, and his shirt is torn and bloodied. He says men from Idlib had broken into his apartment.",
      "\"Some of them were civilians, some wore military clothes and were masked,\" he says. \"They hit my daughter and aimed weapons at my son's head. They stole money, they stole gold.\"",
      "Every call-out here is a show of force, especially with so many armed groups in the city. With the man's son directing them, the HTS security force drives to one of the poorer neighbourhoods, weaving through a warren of back streets, past scrapyards and middens.",
      "The armed police take up positions along the street and at the doorway of the apartment. They bring two suspects back to the station for questioning.",
      "But they barely have time to clear their weapons when there is another complaint, a dispute over gas bottles that left another man beaten.",
      "He says three men had pulled guns on him.",
      "Another race in the cars to a crowded commercial and residential neighbourhood. When the police pull a suspect out into the street - his face still bloody from the earlier fight - local women come to their balconies and shout \"Shabiha! Shabiha!\". They are accusing the suspect of being a member of the shadowy militia force, mostly made of Alawite men, who did the Assad regime's dirty work.",
      "Since its lightning-fast sweep to victory across Syria, Islamist HTS has pledged to keep the peace and protect all of the country's minorities. And every day Abu Ayoub has to make good on that pledge.",
      "\"Some infiltrators into the revolution, some saboteurs, and some weak-minded people are taking advantage of the situation in the areas that were recently liberated,\" he says.",
      "Abu Ayoub admits the situation in the city was \"a bit chaotic\" but turns his attention to Noor. \"We are here now, we weren't here when the army left. We were initially in Damascus and then we came. They are thugs, and we will evict them from your house. We will return your belongings. You have my word,\" he said. And with that he orders his men into their pickup trucks and with sirens blaring they head for the apartment.",
      "Latakia is a city liberated. Last Friday, tens of thousands of people from all sects, gathered on the streets to celebrate the downfall of the Assad dynasty. In a city square, they sat atop the plinth where the statue of Hafez al-Assad, Bashar's father - who ruled for 29 years before his death in 2000 - once stood, and joyfully waved the flag of a free Syria.",
      "The message that day was unity, of one Syria, without sectarian division. But after half a century of tyrannical rule from a regime which fanned sectarian hatred and warned that Alawites would be massacred if they ever lost power, it is an adjustment to say the least.",
      "On Saturday, three HTS fighters were killed, and 14 injured outside the city, in what it said was gun battle with a criminal gang. HTS, which is trying to maintain calm, claims there was no sectarian element to the attack.",
      "On the way to Noor's apartment, the HTS convoy speed through the streets and passersby cheer them and flash the peace sign.",
      "The new Syrian flag, with its green instead of red stripe, and three red stars instead of two green, is commonplace on shop shutters and hanging from balconies. But in Alawite areas, people mostly watch in silence as the convoy moves along. There are fewer new flags in evidence.",
      "Azam al-Ali, 28, an HTS security officer from Deir al-Sour in eastern Syria sits in the front seat. After so much oppression, he says, it will take time for people to trust authority again.",
      "\"Most of the oppressed that come with complaints are from two sects, the Sunni and the Alawite. We do not differentiate. But the extreme poverty that this regime left behind caused this vast chaos,\" he tells me as the traffic parts for the convoy.",
      "And he notes that Alawites, some of whom were among the poorest in Syria, suffered too under the Assad regime.",
      "We arrive at Noor's apartment and half a dozen armed HTS men hurry up the stairs.",
      "The woman behind the door refuses to open up, but after some negotiation the door opens, and she and her family are ordered to leave. Noor goes in to retrieve some clothes and books for her daughter who is studying for exams. Weapons and ammunition belonging to the rebel squatters are confiscated.",
      "\"When I went to HTS today I was terrified,\" says Noor. \"Their appearance was so intimidating and frightening. Honestly, though, they were very nice.\"",
      "But she won't be returning to the apartment. One nightmare has ended in Syria, and for Alawites, another has begun, she says.",
      "As she clutches her belongings, Noor says she no longer feels safe in her home.",
      "\"It's impossible for me to live here again. I do have hope, but not in the near future. At the moment I don't dare.\""

    "story": [
      "Over the last three decades, at least 565 children in the Indian state of West Bengal have been injured or killed by home-made bombs, a BBC Eye investigation has found.",
      "So what are these deadly devices and how are they linked to political violence in West Bengal? And why are so many Bengali children paying the price?",
      "On a bright summer morning in May 1996, six boys from a slum in Kolkata, the capital of India's West Bengal state, stepped out to play cricket in a narrow alley.",
      "Their shantytown, nestled in the middle-class neighbourhood of Jodhpur Park, thrummed with life. It was a holiday - voting day in a general election.",
      "Nine-year-old Puchu Sardar, one of the boys, grabbed a cricket bat and quietly slipped past his sleeping father. Soon, the cracking noise of bat meeting ball echoed through the alley.",
      "A ball batted out of the boundaries of their makeshift pitch sent the boys searching for it in a small garden nearby. There, in a black plastic bag, they found six round objects.",
      "They looked like cricket balls someone had left behind, and the boys returned to the game with their spoils.",
      "One of the \"balls\" from the bag was bowled at Puchu who struck it with his bat.",
      "A deafening explosion tore through the alley. It was a bomb.",
      "As the smoke lifted and neighbours rushed outside, they found Puchu and five of his friends sprawled on the street, their skin blackened, clothes scorched, bodies torn.",
      "Screams pierced the chaos.",
      "Seven-year-old Raju Das, an orphan raised by his aunt, and seven-year-old Gopal Biswas died of their injuries. Four other boys were wounded.",
      "Puchu narrowly survived, having suffered serious burns and shrapnel wounds to his chest, face and abdomen.",
      "He spent over a month in hospital. When he came home he had to use kitchen tongs to remove shrapnel still lodged in his body because his family had run out of money to pay for any more medical care.",
      "Puchu and his friends are part of a long, tragic list of children killed or maimed by crude bombs, which have been used in West Bengal for decades in a bloody battle for dominance in the state's violent politics.",
      "There are no publicly-available figures on the number of casualties in West Bengal.",
      "So the BBC World Service went through every edition of two prominent state newspapers - Anandabazar Patrika and Bartaman Patrika - from 1996 to 2024, looking for reports of children injured or killed by these devices.",
      "We found at least 565 child casualties - 94 deaths and 471 injuries - as of 10 November. This means a child has fallen victim to bomb violence, on average, every 18 days.",
      "However, the BBC has found incidents in which children were wounded by these bombs that were not reported by the two newspapers, so the real number of casualties is likely to be higher.",
      "More than 60% of these incidents involved children playing outdoors - gardens, streets, farms, even near schools - where bombs, typically used during elections to terrorise opponents, were hidden.",
      "Most victims the BBC spoke to were poor, the children of house-help, odd-jobbers, or farm workers.",

      "Over the years, since India's independence in 1947, the state has cycled through different rulers - the Congress party for two decades, the Communist-led Left Front for three, and the current Trinamool Congress since 2011.",
      "In the late 1960s, the state was wracked by armed conflict between Maoist rebels \u2013 also called Naxalites \u2013 and government forces.",
      "A common thread across all governments and rebel conflicts since then has been the use of bombs as tools of intimidation by political parties to silence opponents, especially during elections.",
      "\"Bombs have been [used to settle scores]. This has been happening in Bengal for a long time, more than 100 years,\" Pankaj Dutta, a former Inspector General of West Bengal police, told us.",
      "Bomb-making in Bengal has its roots in the rebellion against British rule in the early 1900s.",
      "Early efforts were crude and accidents were common: One rebel lost a hand and another died testing a bomb.",
      "Then a rebel returned from France armed with bomb-making skills.",
      "His book bomb - a legal tome loaded with explosives hidden in a Cadbury cocoa tin - would have killed its target, a British magistrate, if he had opened it.",
      "The first explosion rocked Midnapore district in 1907, when revolutionaries derailed a train carrying a senior British official by planting a bomb on the tracks.",
      "A few months later, a botched attempt to kill a magistrate in Muzaffarpur with a bomb hurled into a horse-drawn carriage claimed the lives of two Englishwomen.",
      "The act, described by a newspaper as a \"tremendous explosion that startled the town,\" had turned a teenage rebel called Khudiram Bose into a martyr and the first \"freedom fighter\" in the pantheon of Indian revolutionaries.",
      "Bal Gangadhar Tilak, a nationalist leader, wrote in 1908 that bombs were not just weapons but a new kind of \"magical lore,\" a \"witchcraft\" spreading from Bengal to the rest of India.",
      "Today, Bengal's crude bombs are known locally as\u202fpeto. They are bound with jute strings and stuffed with shrapnel-like nails, nuts and glass.",
      "Variations include explosives packed into steel containers or glass bottles. They are used primarily in violent clashes between rival political parties.",
      "Political activists, particularly in rural areas, use these bombs to intimidate opponents, disrupt voting stations, or retaliate against perceived enemies.",
      "They are often deployed during elections to sabotage polling booths or to assert control over areas.",
      "Children like Poulami Halder bear the brunt of such violence.",
      "On an April morning in 2018, the-then seven-year-old was picking flowers for morning prayers in Gopalpur, a village in the North 24 Parganas district dotted with ponds, paddy fields, and coconut trees. Village council elections were barely a month away.",
      "Poulami saw a ball lying near a neighbour's water pump.",
      "\"I picked it up and brought it home,\" she recalls.",
      "As she stepped inside, her grandfather, sipping tea, froze at the sight of the object in her hand.",
      "\"He said, 'It's not a ball - it's a bomb! Throw it away!' Before I could react, it exploded in my hand.\"",
      "The blast shattered the quiet of the village. Poulami was struck in the \"eyes, face, and hands\" and fainted, as chaos erupted around her.",
      "\"I remember people running towards me, but I could see very little. I was hit everywhere.\"",
      "Villagers rushed her to the hospital.",
      "Her injuries were devastating \u2013 her left hand was amputated, and she spent nearly a month in hospital.",
      "An ordinary morning routine had turned into a nightmare, forever altering Poulami's life in a single, shattering moment.",
      "Poulami is not alone.",
      "Sabina Khatun was 10 years old when a crude bomb exploded in her hand in April 2020 in Jitpur, a village flanked by rice and jute fields in Murshidabad district.",
      "She had been taking her goat out to graze when she stumbled upon the bomb lying in the grass. Curious, she picked it up and began playing with it.",
      "Moments later, it detonated in her hands.",
      "\"The moment I heard the explosion, I thought, who's going to be disabled this time? Has Sabina been maimed?,\" her mother, Ameena Bibi, says, her voice heavy with anguish.",
      "\"When I stepped outside, I saw people carrying Sabina in their arms. The flesh was visible from her hand.\"",
      "Doctors were forced to amputate Sabina's hand.",
      "Since returning home, she has struggled to rebuild her life, her parents consumed by despair over an uncertain future. Their fears are not unwarranted: In India, women with disabilities often face social stigma that complicate their prospects for marriage and jobs.",
      "\"My daughter kept crying, saying she would never get her hand back,\" says Ameena.",
      "\"I kept consoling her, telling her, 'your hand will grow back, your fingers will grow back.'\"",
      "Now, Sabina grapples with the loss of her hand and the struggle with simple daily tasks. \"I struggle with drinking water, eating, showering, getting dressed, going to the toilet.\"",
      "The children of the bombs",
      "In the Indian state of West Bengal, children are routinely maimed, blinded, or killed by home-made bombs. BBC Eye investigates the political violence that underlies this tragedy and asks why the carnage is allowed to continue.",
      "Watch on iPlayer or, if you are outside the UK, watch on YouTube",
      "Maimed by bombs yet lucky to survive, these children have had their lives changed forever.",
      "Poulami, now 13, received an artificial hand but couldn't use it - too heavy and quickly outgrown. Sabina, 14, struggles with failing eyesight.",
      "Her family says she needs another operation to remove bomb debris from her eyes, but they cannot afford it.",
      "Puchu, now 37, was pulled out of school by his fearful parents and spent years refusing to step outside, often hiding under his bed at the slightest noise.",
      "He never picked up a cricket bat again. His childhood stolen, he's now scraping by with odd construction jobs and bears the scars of his past.",
      "But all hope is not lost.",
      "Poulami and Sabina have both learned to ride a bicycle with one hand and continue to go to school. Both dream of becoming teachers. Puchu hopes for a brighter future for his son, Rudra, five, -  a future in uniform as a policeman.",
      "Despite the terrible toll it inflicts, there is no sign of crude bomb violence in West Bengal ending.",
      "None of the political parties admit to using bombs for political gain.",
      "When the BBC asked the four main political parties in West Bengal whether they were involved, directly or through intermediaries, in manufacturing or using crude bombs, the ruling Trinamool Congress (TMC) and the opposition Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) did not respond.",
      "The Communist Party of India (Marxist) (CPI-M) strongly denied being involved, saying it was \"committed to upholding the rule of law\u2026and that when it comes to protecting rights and lives, children are of the utmost concern\".",
      "The Indian National Congress (INC) also strongly denied using crude bombs for electoral advantage, and said it had \"never engaged in any violence for political or personal gain\".",
      "Although no political party will admit responsibility, none of the experts who spoke to the BBC is in any doubt this carnage is rooted in Bengal's culture of political violence.",
      "\"During any major election here you will see the rampant use of bombs,\" Pankaj Dutta told us. \"Extreme abuse of childhood is going on. It is a lack of care on the part of the society.\" Mr Dutta passed away in November.",
      "Poulami adds: \"Those who planted the bombs are still free. No one should leave bombs lying around. No child should ever be harmed like this again.\"",
      "'Look what they have done to my son'",
      "But the tragedy continues.",
      "In May this year in the Hooghly district, three boys playing near a pond unknowingly stumbled upon a cache of bombs. The explosion killed Raj Biswas, nine, and left his friend maimed, missing an arm. The other boy escaped with leg fractures.",
      "\"Look what they have done to my son,\" Raj's grieving father sobbed as he caressed the forehead of his dead child.",
      "As Raj's body was lowered into a grave, political slogans crackled through the air from a nearby election rally: \"Hail Bengal!\" the crowd chanted, \"Hail Bengal!\"",
      "It was election time. And once again, children were paying the price."

      "\"Being surrounded, feeling empowered and a feeling that you're the ones running the show... it's really, really nice to see that happening,\" she tells BBC Asian Network News.",

      "\"That comes with experience, maturity and putting in a lot of work in so many years of their respective careers. So that felt comforting, safe, and you felt like you were being understood.\"",
      "Dune: Prophecy is described by critics as \"a bracingly different sci-fi dominated by women at every level\", with fans in India delighted by Tabu's appearance in the show.",

    "published": "Mon, 16 Dec 2024 16:43:40 GMT",
    "summary": "Inside the infamous prison's corridors it becomes clear how hard it will be to mend the Syria that Assad broke.",
    "story": [
      "Saydnaya prison sits on a forbidding hill about half an hour's drive from the centre of Damascus.",
      "In the last few days the entrance has been repainted in the green, white and black of Syria's revolutionary flag. The new colours did not dispel the sinister atmosphere of the place.",
      "As I walked through the gates, I thought of the despair that must have gripped the thousands of Syrians who made the same journey.",
      "One estimate is that more than 30,000 detainees were killed in Saydnaya in the years since the start of the Syrian war in 2011. That is a large proportion of the more than 100,000 people, almost all men but including thousands of women \u2013 as well as children \u2013 who disappeared without trace into Bashar al-Assad's gulag.",
      "Other parts of Assad's prison system were less cruel. Phone calls home were allowed, and families were allowed to visit.",
      "But Saydnaya was the dark and rotten heart of the regime. Fear of being consigned there and killed without anyone knowing what had happened was a central part of the Assad regime's system of coercion and repression.",
      "The authorities did not have to tell families who had been incarcerated there. Allowing them to fear the worst was another way of applying pressure. The regime kept its boot on the throat of Syrians because of the power, reach and savagery of its myriad and overlapping intelligence agencies, and because of the routine use of torture and execution.",
      "I was in other infamous prisons in the days after they were liberated, including Abu Salim, the former Libyan leader Colonel Gaddafi's notorious jail in Tripoli and Pul-e-Charki outside Kabul in Afghanistan.",
      "Neither were as foul and pestilent as Saydnaya. In its overcrowded cells men had to urinate into plastic bags as their access to latrines was limited.",
      "When the locks were smashed open, they left behind their filthy rags and scraps of blankets which were all they had to cover themselves as they slept on the floor. Torture and execution have already been documented in Saydnaya.",
      "In the months to come it is certain that more information about the horrors perpetrated inside its walls will emerge from former inmates.",
      "In Saydnaya's corridors you can see how hard it will be to mend the country Assad broke to try to save his regime. Now that the prison has been broken open, like the country, it has become a microcosm of all the challenges Syria faces since the Assad regime crumpled and was swept away.",
      "The record",
      "One challenge is making a record of exactly what the regime did to its victims. In a sign of how far Syria has come in just a week, volunteers went to the prison to try to preserve Saydnaya's records.",
      "Paperwork is scattered around offices and even on the concrete floor of the prison yard. Families pick up files and sheets of tattered documentation, trying to find a name, a date or a place that they recognise.",
      "The disarray of the records looks as if someone tried to destroy what was done here in the name of Bashar al-Assad's Syria. When dictators and their henchmen fall, making sure they don't take the truth with them is a big part of a better future.",
      "A musician called Safana Bakleh gave her group of volunteers face masks and blue nitrile gloves along with instructions about photographing and collecting documents.",
      "Safana admitted they were amateurs and said they were taking matters into their own hands because the international human rights groups were not there, and evidence and documents were disappearing.",
      "\"Even if one family gets one answer that their loved on is not here anymore is deceased or he died in the hospital it is enough for me\" Safana told me. \"It is very chaotic... Where are the international originations supposed to be documenting all this chaos?\"",
      "It is not just about families getting some release through at least knowing what happened to the disappeared. One day there might be trials of the perpetrators. Documents are evidence.",
      "The truth the volunteers uncovered with their own eyes shocked them. All Syrians knew that the prisons were bad, but Saydnaya was much worse than they expected.  Widad Halabi, one of the volunteers, took off her face mask and broke down in tears after an hour or so looking for evidence in the cell blocks.",
      "\"What I've seen here is a life not fit for humans. I imagined how they lived, their clothes. How did they breathe? How did they eat? How did they feel?",
      "\"It's terrible\u2026 terrible. There are bags of urine on the floor. They couldn't go to the toilet, so they had to put urine in bags. The smell. There's no sun or light. I can't believe people were living here when we were living and breathing our normal lives.\"",
      "Justice, or revenge?",
      "It will be hard for Syrians and their new rulers to track down the people they want to punish. Bashar al-Assad fled to Russia with his family. His brother Maher, with a reputation for violence and corruption as bad as anyone in his extended family, is thought to be in Iraq.",
      "A couple of Assad's cousins ran into rebel fighters as they tried to escape to Lebanon. One of them, according to Reuters news agency, was killed in the resulting shootout.",
      "When I entered Syria a week ago hundreds of cars full of despondent and scared families with some link to the regime, who believed they would be in danger in the new Syria, were leaving, queuing to get over the border into Lebanon. At the same time hundreds were driving in the opposite direction, desperate to get home.",
      "Eventually there might be a legal process to prosecute Bashar al-Assad, members of his family and some of those who carried guns for the regime. Gathering evidence would be part of that. But the exodus in the last hours of the regime and in the confused days and nights that followed means that it will be hard to get to the people responsible.",
      "At Saydnaya prison, families wander through the building, desperate for information, searching for those they've lost, horrified by everything they are seeing. Just being in Saydnaya's cells and corridors, freezing cold in December, reinforces a widespread desire to see the punishment of everyone implicated in the Assad regime's crimes.",
      "A group of men gathered in the prison yard, smoking silently, some leafing through files that they had picked up off the ground. All those I spoke to said that the future must be built on justice for the past. The men in the group, all looking for missing, sons, brothers and cousins, called Saydnaya a mass grave. They want the head of Bashar al-Assad, literally. They murmured agreement when one of them said he had to be decapitated.",
      "One of them, a young man called Ahmed, said he knew the brother he was searching for was alive because he could see him in his dreams. Ahmed himself had spent three years in Saydnaya.",
      "\"It was so bad, the torture, the food, everything. We were suffering.\"",
      "Mohammed Khalaf, an older man, had been searching for his son Jabr since he was dragged from the family breakfast table by thugs from one of the state's intelligence agencies in 2014.",
      "\"We are many. People came from Qamishli, Hasaka, Deir al-Zour, Al Raqqa looking for our loved ones. Thousands are still in the streets looking for their children. It's not just me.\"",
      "Inside one of the cell blocks, young men from Aleppo were warming themselves on a fire that they had lit in a metal tin, burning old prison uniforms that are scattered around every cell. They were looking for brothers who had been detained and then disappeared.",
      "Like many others looking for information or a body at Saydnaya, the men had no money for a hotel. So they camped in the prison where they believe their brothers were consigned and most likely killed.",
      "One of the men from Aleppo, Ezzedine Khalil, wants news of a brother taken by the regime on 1 September 2015. They all know the precise dates.",
      "\"We don't know if he is alive or dead. If he is dead, they should give us his body. They should tell us if he's dead. We just want to know. We want to know what to do next.\"",
      "His friend Mohammed Radwan was looking for a brother and a cousin who were detained in 2012. Rumours were flying around that the night before the fall of the regime, 22 freezer lorries were brought to the prison to remove bodies. The rumours have not been confirmed but Mohammed and Ezzedine were convinced that they were true.",
      "Mohammed looked exhausted and his anger flared up. He addressed himself to Assad.",
      "\"Where did you, pig, take the 22 fridge trucks? Everyone who took part in this crime, and everyone who served her in Saydnaya prison should be brought to justice. Everyone! Even if they were working in cleaning. They should all be brought to account.\"",
      "\"Because if they knew what was happening, at least they should have told the families of the prisoners that their dear ones were killed, slaughtered, hanged or tortured.\"",
      "Both men ended with an Islamic prayer: \"Allah is sufficient for me, and He is the best disposer of affairs.\"",
      "Their hunger to see Assad and his men punished could become one of the drivers of events in the next few months. Syrians want to see their tormentors punished.",
      "Corruption",
      "The extended Assad clan used Syria as their bank account. They helped themselves to stakes in businesses that might make profits. They controlled the lucrative market for telecoms and mobiles. As they raked in cash, Syrians struggled to eke out a living in an economy smashed by war and drained dry by rapacious and corrupt regime favourites. The new rulers of Syria have inherited big debts and an almost worthless currency. A couple of hundred dollars equals a plastic trash bag of bundles of Syrian pounds.",
      "Corruption extended to the prison system. Victims and families desperate to avoid years in a hell-hole were prepared to pay big money to stay out.",
      "Hassan Abu Shwarb served 11 years under sentence of death for terrorism, which was the word the Assad regime used for rebellion. Hassan, a quietly spoken man who is now 31, denies he ever joined an armed group. Instead, he says he was detained at a government office when he was getting documents necessary to apply for a passport so he could accept an offer to study in Canada.",
      "His brother said the family paid a total of $50,000 (\u00a339,509) in bribes on five separate occasions to try to get him out. In all cases the corrupt officials who had offered help for cash pocketed the money without releasing Hassan. A couple of weeks before the regime collapsed yet another corrupt judge offered to free Hassan for another $50,000.",
      "After his arrest Hassan Abu Shwarb was tortured when he was detained for 80 days at a military intelligence interrogation centre. Among other injuries, the torturers broke one of his legs. Hassan says he was with one of his cellmates, a 49-year-old man, when he died after three days of torture. The jailors recorded death from a stroke.",
      "Hassan was overjoyed to get home.",
      "\"When my mother held me after 11 years, I can't describe the feeling. There is nothing like going back to your home and neighbourhood.\"",
      "But like many Syrians, Hassan's optimism about the future starts with determination that the fallen regime's leaders and acolytes should suffer for their deeds.",
      "\"They should be punished. We are human souls, not stones after all. And those who killed should be publicly executed. Otherwise, we won't get through this.",
      "\"We need to forget and move on. This is a happiness for all Syrians. We need to return to our work and responsibility to continue. We need to forget. We turned the page. All the sadness is behind us.\"",
      "The leader of Hayat Tahrir al-Sham has started using his real name, Ahmed al-Sharaa, instead of his war time pseudonym, Abu Mohammed al-Jolani. The name change contains a message about looking ahead. The evidence is that Ahmed al-Sharaa will need to prioritise justice for the deposed regime if he does not want the chaos of people taking matters into their own hands.",
      "The future is hard, and the past is full of pain. Here in Damascus, it feels as if a collective weight has been lifted from the shoulders of a nation.",
      "Syrians know how deep their problems go. To preserve the optimism created by Assad's fall, Syrians want to see progress.",

    "published": "Fri, 13 Dec 2024 22:33:31 GMT",
    "summary": "As Argentina's libertarian President Javier Milei marks one year in office, his policies are keenly observed in the US.",
    "story": [
      "As Argentina's maverick libertarian President Javier Milei marks one year in office, his efforts to revive the economy are still a work in progress - but his policies are proving influential in the US.",
      "Milei came to power with a mission to cut state spending in a country that had been living beyond its means for years.",
      "Despite his tough austerity measures and a continued rise in poverty rates, he is still supported by just over half the population, according to a survey carried out earlier this month by the CB Consultora organisation.",
      "That level of popularity is similar to that of Donald Trump right now. Roughly half of US voters backed the president-elect in last month's presidential contest - and Trump has hailed Milei as a man who can \"make Argentina great again\".",
      "Meanwhile, tech billionaire Elon Musk, who looks set to play a key role in the incoming US administration, has also praised Milei, saying Argentina is \"experiencing a giant improvement\" under his leadership.",
      "But what is it that Trump and Musk see in Milei? And are they as close ideologically as is often assumed?",
      "Milei's biggest achievement so far, the one which is most prized by Argentines, is his success in cutting inflation. But he has caused a stir in the US because of his deregulation drive, which has been seized on by small-government activists keen to shrink the size of the state in Washington along the lines of what is happening in Buenos Aires.",
      "In Milei's initial package of measures, he slashed state subsidies for fuel and cut the number of government ministries by half.",
      "Now he is trying to force through plans for a mass sell-off of state-run companies, including the country's flagship airline Aerolineas Argentinas, which has already been privatised once before being renationalised in 2008.",
      "All this is music to the ears of Elon Musk, who is being tasked with similar cost-cutting initiatives under the banner of the so-called Department of Government Efficiency - a misleading name, since it is an advisory body, not an official government department.",
      "Musk and his co-leader in the department, fellow billionaire Vivek Ramaswamy, have said they want to slash federal regulations, oversee mass layoffs and shut down some agencies entirely.",
      "Musk has spoken of cutting federal government spending by $2tn (\u00a31.6tn) - about one-third of annual expenditure. According to him, Milei is doing \"a fantastic job\" in Argentina by \"deleting entire departments\" - and he would like to follow suit in the US, with Trump's blessing.",
      "But long-time Latin America observers are sceptical.",
      "Monica de Bolle, senior fellow at the Peterson Institute for International Economics in Washington, says that \"taking inspiration from Milei to reduce the size of government doesn't make any sense\".",
      "\"The situation in Argentina is very particular to Argentina, because it was about the removal of decades of mismanagement of public resources. That has nothing to do with the US.\"",
      "Ms de Bolle says Argentina had no choice but to take action, because government overspending was so excessive that the country was \"bursting into crisis every few years\".",
      "\"That is appropriate for Argentina, but for nobody else.\"",
      "Marcelo J Garc\u00eda, Buenos Aires-based director for the Americas at global consulting firm Horizon Engage, says Milei's decision to wield a chainsaw on the campaign trail as a sign of his approach to government was a \"masterpiece\" of political marketing that has \"captured the imagination of small-state activists across the globe\".",
      "But he argues that while Musk's own business interests would benefit from less government regulation, that's not necessarily what Trump wants.",
      "\"I'm not sure that the Trump platform is compatible with a Milei-type chainsaw small government,\" he told the BBC.",
      "He points out that Trump's policies \"require big government in some areas\", such as the building of border walls and mass deportations of illegal immigrants. \"You can't do those kinds of massive programmes with small government.\"",
      "In Milei's view, infrastructure projects are best left to the private sector and have nothing to do with government.",
      "Milei and Trump are on the same side in the global culture wars, denouncing what they see as the \"woke agenda\". But in economic terms, their ideas are very different.",
      "Milei is a passionate free-trader, and Argentina is a member of the South American trading bloc Mercosur, which also includes Brazil, Paraguay, and Uruguay.",
      "While he is in favour of Mercosur's recent free-trade deal with the European Union, he doesn't like the way that the organisation refuses to let its individual member countries strike their own deals. As a result, he says Mercosur \"has ended up becoming a prison\".",
      "\"If the bloc is not a dynamic engine that facilitates trade, boosts investment and improves the quality of life of all the citizens of our region, what is the point of it?\" he said at the Mercosur summit in Uruguay earlier this month where the deal with the EU was signed.",
      "Trump also has beef with his own regional trade alliance, the US-Mexico-Canada Agreement (USMCA), but for reasons that are the opposite of Milei's.",
      "Trump wants to renegotiate the USMCA, a deal that he himself put together during his first term in office, as a way of protecting US manufacturing and safeguarding US jobs.",
      "He has even found a way of weaponising the alliance by threatening to impose a blanket 25% tariff on goods from both Canada and Mexico unless they secure their shared borders with the US.",
      "Monica de Bolle doubts that Trump shares Musk's enthusiasm for a smaller state: \"You can't be a populist nationalist and care about the size of government. So Trump doesn't care. He put Elon there because it's kind of fun to have someone there making noise.\"",
      "The economic debate is set to run and run, in both the US and Argentina. But ultimately, if one half of your population supports you, it means the other half doesn't. Trump will have to deal with that after his inauguration on 20 January, but Milei is already having to cope with his own polarised population.",
      "As Marcelo J Garc\u00eda sees it, Milei is a \"divisive leader\" who has made no attempt to win over his opponents.",
      "\"The other half of the country that did not support him will arguably never support him, no matter how well the economy does, because he doesn't want them to support him,\" he says.",
      "\"Leaders tend to want to be liked by everyone. That's not the case with Milei,\" he adds.",
      "In his view, this is a real weakness: \"You don't build a long-term sustainable political project if you don't move towards the people who didn't vote for you.\"",
      "Milei's next big test of public opinion will come in October 2025, when Argentina holds midterm elections. That could prove crucial in deciding whether his small-government revolution determines the country's future - or whether, like previous attempts at reform, it runs out of steam."

      "Megan Thee Stallion asked a court on Tuesday to issue a restraining order against Tory Lanez, who she says is harassing her from prison through surrogates as he serves a 10-year sentence for shooting her in the feet back in 2020 in Los Angeles.",
      "The petition filed by the hip-hop star in Los Angeles Superior Court asks the judge to prevent the Canadian rapper Lanez, whose legal name is Daystar Peterson, from using third parties to continue the same online harassment of Megan, whose legal name is Megan Pete, that he engaged in and encouraged before his imprisonment.",
      "\"Even now, while behind bars, Mr. Peterson shows no signs of stopping,\" the petition says. \"Despite being sentenced to 10 years in prison for shooting Ms. Pete, Mr. Peterson continues to to subject her to repeated trauma and revictimization.\"",
      "An email from The Associated Press seeking comment from Lanez's lawyers was not immediately returned. A court hearing on the order is scheduled for Jan. 9.",
      "The filing says bloggers acting on Lanez's behalf continue to cast doubt on her allegations, making false claims including that the gun and bullet fragments in the case are missing. It also comes after Pete\u00a0filed a lawsuit in October against blogger Milagro Gramz, accusing Gramz of purposely spreading false information on behalf of Lanez.",
      "That lawsuit was filed in the Southern District of Florida against Gramz, a popular content creator who is legally known as Milagro Elizabeth Cooper. The lawsuit accuses Cooper of intentionally causing Pete emotional distress by cyberstalking, promoting and sharing deepfake pornography of Pete and questioning if she was actually shot.",
      "Tuesday's petition says a protective order issued to prevent previous harassment is no longer in effect, which it calls a loophole and flaw in the criminal justice system. Lanez is being held at a California prison in rural Tehachapi.",
      "In December 2022, Lanez was convicted of three felonies: assault with a semiautomatic firearm; having a loaded, unregistered firearm in a vehicle and discharging a firearm with gross negligence.",
      "A judge rejected a motion for a new trial from Lanez's lawyers, who are appealing his conviction.",
      "In August of last year, he received the 10-year sentence, bringing what seemed to be a conclusion to a three-year legal and cultural saga that saw two careers, and lives, thrown into turmoil.",
      "Megan testified during the trial that in July 2020, after they left a party at Kylie Jenner's Hollywood Hills home, Lanez fired the gun at the back of her feet and shouted for her to dance as she walked away from an SUV in which they had been riding. She revealed who had fired the gun only months later.",
      "The case created a firestorm in the hip-hop community, churning up issues including the reluctance of Black victims to speak to police, gender politics in hip-hop, online toxicity, protecting Black women and the ramifications of misogynoir, a particular brand of misogyny Black women experience.",

      "\"American Me\" (1992)",
      "In his first film as director, Edward James Olmos stars as a prison gang leader who, upon his release, tries to maintain his hold on criminal organizations and drug trafficking in Los Angeles.",
      "\"Angels With Dirty Faces\" (1938)",
      "Once the Hays Office decided in the early 1930s that movies had become too violent and licentious, bad guys either had to make good for their crimes, or pay the ultimate price. No longer could James Cagney break the law and get away with it! Director Michael Curtiz's film about childhood friends who follow different paths \u2014 Cagney, as gangster Rocky Sullivan, and Pat O'Brien, as Father Connolly \u2014 offers a redemptive tale in which young hoodlums idolize Rocky. But when the condemned criminal is being led to the execution chamber, his change of heart \u2014 pretending to die a coward's death \u2014 offers a way out for the impressionable youth. One of Cagney's best performances, the film also features Humphrey Bogart as a crooked lawyer, Ann Sheridan, and the Dead End Kids (whose Hollywood careers would turn from kitchen sink drama to slapstick comedy).",
      "\"Annabelle Serpentine Dance\" (a.k.a. \"Serpentine Dance \u2013 Annabelle\") (1895)",
      "This early Edison short film captures dancer Annabelle Moore maneuvering fabric-wings. Several versions of the film were released, including some with color tints.",
      "\"Beverly Hills Cop\" (1984)",
      "Eddie Murphy had already appeared in two hit films \u2014 \"48 HRS.,\" opposite Nick Nolte, and \"Trading Places,\" pairing off against Dan Aykroyd \u2014 but in \"Beverly Hills Cop\" Murphy carried the film on his own as Detroit detective Axel Foley, a fish-out-of-water who has gone to Los Angeles on the trail of a killer. Buoyed by Murphy's screen charisma and Harold Faltermeyer's electronic score, the mix of action and comedy was a blockbuster, a formula carried forth in three sequels starring Murphy.",
      "\"The Chelsea Girls\" (1966)",
      "Andy Warhol and Paul Morrissey's 16mm feature was a proto-typical underground movie \u2014 heavily improvised, with rough edits (or no edits), multiple and split screens, and a leisurely 3.5-hour length. Being banned in Boston at least added to its allure. Today, the film, set in the landmark Chelsea Hotel in New York City, and featuring Nico, Ondine, Brigid Berlin, International Velvet, Mario Montez, Mary Woronov, Dorothy Dean and other Warhol \"Superstars,\" offers a unique time capsule of the bohemian 1960s.",
      "\"Common Threads: Stories From the Quilt\" (1989)",
      "The origin of the NAMES Project Aids Memorial Quilt \u2014 a tapestry of stories memorializing those who died from HIV/AIDS, as well as a society that had failed them \u2014 is told in this Oscar-winning feature documentary, directed by Rob Epstein and Jeffrey Friedman, that also earned a Peabody Award.",
      "\"Compensation\" (1999)",
      "The debut feature of director Zeinabu irene Davis tells two parallel love stories, set nearly a century apart, each involving a deaf woman and a hearing man diagnosed with a fatal disease. Michelle A. Banks (who is herself deaf) and John Earl Jelks play both couples, and their stories are illustrated with title cards and American Sign Language.",
      "\"Dirty Dancing\" (1987)",
      "At a 1960s Catskills resort, a teenage girl vacationing with family hits the dance floor with a hot instructor, and summers would never be the same. Jennifer Grey and Patrick Swayze starred in the hit romance that earned the Jennifer Warnes-Bill Medley song \"(I've Had) The Time of My Life\" an Oscar and a Grammy.",
      "\"Ganja and Hess\" (1973)",
      "Duane Jones, who played the lead in \"Night of the Living Dead,\" stars in this horror story in which an anthropologist studying ancient African cultures becomes a vampire. A low-budget tale that served as a metaphor for drug addiction, \"Ganja and Hess\" was directed by writer and playwright Bill Gunn, and was later remade by Spike Lee as \"Da Sweet Blood of Jesus.\"",
      "\"Invaders from Mars\" (1953)",
      "When little David McLean (Jimmy Hunt) wakes up in the middle of the night and witnesses a spaceship landing nearby, he tries to convince his dad it was real. But when dad returns from investigating the landing site, there's something not quite right about him. And then, a similar change comes over his mother. What are those strange marks on the back of their necks? What's poor little David to do? Fifties paranoia blends with stylish photography, cool-looking sets, and ridiculous Martian costumes in this nostalgic sci-fi tale directed by William Cameron Menzies.",
      "\"KoKo's Earth Control\" (1928)",
      "A wild addition to the genre of apocalyptic cinema, this silent cartoon by Max and Dave Fleischer features Koko the Clown and his naughty dog Fitz, visiting the place that runs our planet's weather. Alas, there is a lever that warns, if pulled, it will mean the end of the Earth! Restored by the UCLA Film & Television Archive primarily from the original nitrate negative, this is a hilarious take on the End Times \u2014 and the problem of pets that refuse to obey. Bad, BAD dog! [You can watch the restored film here.]",
      "\"My Family/Mi familia\" (1995)",
      "Directed by Gregory Nava (\"The Ballad of Gregorio Cortez\"), this emotional and tearful multi-generational story of Mexican immigrants settling in East Los Angeles stars Jimmy Smits, Edward James Olmos, Esai Morales, Elpidia Carrillo and Enrique Castillo.",
      "\"The Miracle Worker\" (1962)",
      "Anne Bancroft and Patty Duke each won Academy Awards for their performances in the true story of Anne Sullivan and her attempts to teach Helen Keller, a child deaf and blind since she was a toddler. Keller's autobiography was originally adapted for television and later Broadway (Bancroft and Duke both starred in the stage version). Director Arthur Penn's black-and-white film version preserved the actresses' performances in a cooly unsentimental story of determination and human connection.",
      "\"My Own Private Idaho\" (1991)",
      "Gus Van Sant (\"Drugstore Cowboy\") wrote and directed this haunting tale of friendship, loosely based on plays of Shakespeare, starring River Phoenix and Keanu Reeves as street hustlers searching for family and connection.",
      "\"No Country for Old Men\" (2007)",
      "The Coen Brothers' sharp precision and keen eye for irony is beautifully on display in this enthralling modern-day Western, in which Josh Brolin's hunter comes across the scene of a drug deal gone very bad. Alas, that satchel containing mounds of currency with no living owner is just a little too tempting to pass by. Enter Javier Bardem's sinister hit man, hot on Brolin's trail, who will let nothing deter him from his prey. Based on Cormac McCarthy's novel, the film won four Academy Awards, including best picture, best direction, and best supporting actor for Bardem, weird haircut and all.",
      "\"Powwow Highway\" (1989)",
      "A prize-winner at the Sundance Film Festival, Jonathan Wacks' comic-drama was remarkable in its time for telling a humanistic story of Native Americans without resorting to stereotypes. Gary Farmer and A. Martinez star as former childhood friends who reconnect for a road trip in a dilapidated car, a journey that is by turns spiritual and criminal.",
      "\"The Pride of the Yankees\" (1942)",
      "An inspirational biopic of one of sports' true legends, this story of New York Yankee Lou Gehrig, whose life came undone with a diagnosis of amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, or ALS (what came to become known as Lou Gehrig's disease), stars Gary Cooper and Teresa Wright, and features several of Gehrig's teammates (including Babe Ruth) as themselves. Cooper's reenactment of Gehrig's farewell speech at Yankee Stadium (in which he states, \"Today I consider myself the luckiest man on the face of the Earth\") became one of the actor's most memorable moments.",
      "\"The Social Network\" (2010)",
      "Like the Akira Kurosawa classic \"Rashomon,\" \"The Social Network\" uses competing points of view to decipher the origins of Facebook, as told through legal depositions being filed years after the revolutionary website was born, by former friends now suing each other. Based on Ben Mezrich's \"The Accidental Billionaires,\" David Fincher's classic is a tale of genius, hubris and ethics, involving a paradox: A site founded on the notion of exclusivity which grew to host hundreds of millions of members. Starring Jessie Eisenberg as Mark Zuckerberg, with Andrew Garfield, Max Minghella, Armie Hammer, and Justin Timberlake, and an Oscar-winning script by Aaron Sorkin. Oscars also went to Trent Reznor and Atticus Ross for their haunting score, and to editors Kirk Baxter and Angus Wall.",
      "\"Spy Kids\" (2001)",
      "Writer-director Robert Rodriguez made a splash with his debut feature, \"El Mariachi,\" and followed with \"Desperado\" and \"From Dusk till Dawn.\" But for the fantasy \"Spy Kids,\" he connected with his inner kid, in a story about two children of secret agents who go out on a mission to rescue their captured parents. Starring Antonio Banderas and Carla Gugino as mom-and-pop spies, and Alexa Vega and Daryl Sabara as their budding young agents, the film was a hit, spawning a franchise (including a 3-D entry starring Sylvester Stallone).",
      "\"Star Trek II: The Wrath of Khan\" (1982)",
      "The first film of the \"Star Trek\" franchise to be inducted in the National Film Registry, it's considered by most to be the best movie, in capturing both the zing of the original TV series and the camaraderie of the Enterprise crew. Directed by Nicholas Meyer, it's a sequel of sorts to the 1967 episode \"Space Seed,\" in which a 20th century villain in hibernation is thawed out, stirring much interplanetary trouble. In \"Wrath of Khan,\" Ricardo Montalban returns in the role of Khan, who sets his sights not just on destroying worlds, but also in taking revenge against Admiral James T. Kirk (William Shatner). There is action galore, but it's Kirk's friendship with Spock (Leonard Nimoy) that gives this film its emotional heft.",
      "\"The Texas Chainsaw Massacre\" (1974)",
      "Among exploitation movies, horror is a genre that has enticed many aspiring filmmakers with little money but lots of fake blood at hand. But Tobe Hooper's grand guignol tale of a group of young people who find themselves at the wrong isolated farmhouse went far beyond typical drive-in fare. It would give rise to countless slasher films (from \"Halloween\" to \"Friday the 13th\") in which a weapon-wielding bad guy (in this case Leatherface) ticks off cast members one by one. Nasty, bloody and weirdly funny, the film even found itself projected onto the screen of the Museum of Modern Art in New York \u2014 a fact it heralded in newspaper ads, as if that would give a low-budget horror film more street cred.",
      "\"Up in Smoke\" (1978)",
      "The counter-culture duo Cheech Marin & Tommy Chong had already released five successful comedy albums (including \"Big Bambu\" and \"Los Cochinos\") when they dipped their toes into movies with this stoner comedy. Dipped their toes isn't exactly accurate, though; they plunged head-first into a wild m\u00e9lange of bits involving marijuana, LSD, hash, cocaine (or Ajax cleanser mistaken for cocaine), alcohol, and pills that are anybody's guess what they are. \"Up in Smoke\" took in more than $100 million at the box office, leading to a string of Cheech & Chong films.",
      "\"Uptown Saturday Night\" (1974)",
      "Bill Cosby, Harry Belafonte, and director Sidney Poitier star in this action comedy in which victims of a robbery go in search of a stolen wallet containing a winning lottery ticket. With Richard Pryor, Flip Wilson, Roscoe Lee Browne and Rosalind Cash. Poitier directed two follow-up films starring himself and Cosby, \"Let's Do It Again\" and \"A Piece of the Action.\"",
      "\"Will\" (1981)",
      "Cinematographer Jessie Maple directed this, the first independent feature helmed by an African American woman, in which a former athlete and coach (played by Obaka Adedunyo) struggles to overcome drug addiction.",
      "Zora Lathan Student Films (1975-1976)",
      "The democratic nature of the National Film Registry allows for the preservation of Hollywood studio features, independent films, industrial and advertising shorts, student films, and newsreels. The Registry has also preserved home movies, which capture American life in unfiltered and wholly revealing ways.\u00a0 During her years as a film student in Chicago, Adaora \"Zora\" Lathan shot six short 16mm films documenting her family members \u2014 whimsical vignettes which she characterized as \"artworks.\"",

Raised in Queens, New York, he was heavily influenced by his parents, especially his father Carmine, a flutist for Arturo Toscanini's NBC Symphony Orchestra. That is where he learned that music and pictures are not always connected.",
      "While in college, Coppola was deeply inspired by Sergei Eisenstein's silent film \"October: 10 Days That Shook the World.\"",
      "\"It was a silent picture, but they weren't playing any accompaniment,\" he said. \"And I was amazed at how the film itself sort of made you think you were hearing it because of the way it was cut. I came out of that experience absolutely bowled over.\"",
      "Coppola followed his passion for film to UCLA. \"I had no money. I had no car. I had no girlfriend. I had nothing,\" he said.",
      "After graduating, Warner Brothers hired him to direct \"Finian's Rainbow,\" and in 1970, his screenplay for \"Patton\" earned him his first Academy Award.",
      "At just 29, Coppola signed on to co-write and direct \"The Godfather,\" a film that became a cornerstone of modern cinema. \"I really was an Italian-American. So although I didn't know gangsters, I knew that to the detail of what life was like in that kind of household,\" he said.",
      "Casting Marlon Brando as Vito Corleone proved challenging. \"I was ordered by the head of the studio that I couldn't even mention Brando,\" Coppola said. Eventually, the studio agreed \u2014 on three conditions. \"He has to do the movie for nothing, no fee; he has to shoot a screen test; he has to put up a million-dollar bond. So, I said, 'I accept.'\"",
      "Brando's transformation into the character astonished the studio. The studio dropped all conditions after seeing Brando's screen test, and the rest is history.",
      "\"The Godfather\" earned Coppola an Oscar nomination for Best Director and a win for Best Adapted Screenplay. He continued his streak with adaptations like \"The Outsiders.\"",
      "Coppola went on to adapt S.E. Hinton's \"The Outsiders\" and \"Rumble Fish,\" which featured his nephew, Nicolas Cage.",
      "Cage is just one of many members of the Coppola family who have pursued successful careers in the arts. Reflecting on his priorities, Coppola said, \"I want my children to be healthy, and I want them to be happy in their work, which they seem to be. I'm now more concerned that there's going to be an Earth here that's going to sustain itself.\"",
      "Now, as a Kennedy Center honoree, Coppola reflected on how he views himself, saying, \"I think of someone who loved his human family \u2014 not just my immediate family, but the entire human family. That's who I am. I am the one who loves everybody.\"",
      "The Kennedy Center Honors\u00a0ceremony, which took place on Dec. 8, 2024, will be broadcast on CBS on Dec. 22.",

    "published": "Sun, 15 Dec 2024 10:21:53 -0500",
    "summary": "The singer-songwriter went from being an NYU music student wowing Pharrell Williams in a viral video, to selling out Madison Square Garden. She talks about musical obsessions, and her appreciation for listeners with patience.",
    "story": [
      "In a nondescript building in a tiny Pennsylvania town, Maggie Rogers was getting ready for her big moment. Lititz, Pa., is where arena acts come to rehearse their shows before heading out on national tour, and every detail matters. \"Sunday Morning\" caught up with Rogers there, just weeks away from her concerts at Madison Square Garden.",
      "In a career-defining event, she sold out the New York City venue. \"Twice!\" she laughed. \"I don't know how to, like, compute that in my brain. I don't understand it fundamentally!\"",
      "To be clear, it wasn't Rogers' first time on a big stage; she'd already shared them with the likes of Bruce Springsteen, Joan Baez, and a stint opening for Coldplay. She was also a 2020 Grammy-nominee for best new artist.",
      "But for Rogers, who studied music at New York University, playing Madison Square Garden was a homecoming of sorts. Walking through Washington Square Park, not far from her former dorm room, she pointed out the benches where she used to write songs. It was at NYU where Rogers got what you might call her big break \u2013 or at least a big break, when superstar producer and musician Pharrell Williams visited her class. Rogers played him a song she'd been working on called \"Alaska.\" \"What I remember is really just staring at my shoes and, like, holding on tight,\" she said.",
      "Williams' response: \"Wow! Wow! I have zero, zero, zero notes for that, and I'll tell you why: you're doing your own thing. It's singular.\"",
      "The video clip of Williams' master class went viral, but Rogers \u2013 who actually started out studying music engineering \u2013 still needed to learn the craft of writing and performing, which is just what she did. \"I've played, like, every bar and club on the Lower East Side, and every DIY venue in Brooklyn that existed in my time here,\" she said.",
      "Now, at the age of 30, Rogers has built a close relationship with her fans, many of whom watched her go from small clubs to being an artist that record labels were fighting over.",
      "Remember that demo she played for Pharrell Williams as a college student? So far, the music video of the finished version of \"Alaska\" has been viewed more than 23 million times.",
      "It's all been an incredible journey, considering Rogers says she didn't actually play music publicly all that much as she was growing up on Maryland's Eastern Shore. Her interest was more personal, private and quirky: \"Basically, as soon as I could ask for music lessons, all I wanted to do was play the harp,\" she said. \"My first CD purchase was a double-purchase of the orchestral score to 'Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone,' and Britney's 'Baby One More Time.' Which, like, maybe is all you need to know about me!\"",
      "And you hear it in her songs \u2013 a pop sensibility with a tremendous intellect behind it. Rogers says the whole arena thing is fun, but what she's really hoping to do is form a deep, long-term connection with her listeners along the themes of love and heartbreak and the weird wondrous thing that it is just to be alive. \"I really prefer to work in long form,\" Rogers said. \"And I really feel a lot of gratitude for listeners that want to have an active listening practice, and who also have the patience to want to spend an hour of their time listening to the way that I, you know, sequence the record, or who has appreciation for those things. I've always loved art that takes time.\"",
      "Something else that separates Rogers from your typical pop star: Back in 2021, she took time away from her music to enroll in a graduate program at Harvard University focusing on religion and public life. \"I really needed a second,\" she said. \"I needed to sort of reorient my life, and I needed to be new at something. I had been living in a world where everything was about me and my career for, like, five years, and then applying that to music, and to concerts, and to these really large public gatherings.\"",
      "Large public gatherings that have become, for both Rogers and her fans, something almost spiritual: \"This couldn't have happened in any different way,\" she said. \"Like, I'm reaching Madison Square Garden and stepping on that stage, and being like, 'I'm really ready for this.' And that, in itself, is such a gift that I've sort of tried to keep from contextualizing this for myself. Because as soon as you figure out what it is, it changes, you know? I'm always at the eye of the storm! It's really calm where I sit. And I'll never, ever be able to know what it looks like from the outside. But what I can know is when I've really dedicated myself to my art, and when I think I'm at my best. And I like to think that I'm doing both of those things as much as possible.\"",

    "published": "Sun, 15 Dec 2024 10:07:40 -0500",
    "summary": "In her latest film, Nicole Kidman plays a successful CEO who takes up with a much younger intern. She talks about how she chooses such intense and challenging roles.",
    "story": [
      "I last talked with Nicole Kidman for \"Sunday Morning\" several years ago. Not much has happened since then. Just kidding! Kidman is in the middle of a \"golden era,\" following her Emmy-winning turn in the TV series \"Big Little Lies.\"",
      "To name just two of her recent projects: the TV series \"The Perfect Couple,\" co-starring Liev Schreiber; and \"Special Ops: Lioness,\" with Zoe Salda\u00f1a.",
      "Is the sense that time is fleeting part of why she has been so prolific? \"Yeah, probably,\" Kidman said.",
      "She's still the better half of country great Keith Urban. But the thing Kidman is getting the most attention for these days is a film coming out on Christmas \u2026 and what a film it is. In \"Babygirl,\" Kidman plays a happily married, successful CEO who is in some ways unfulfilled, so she takes up with a handsome intern (Harris Dickinson, of \"Triangle of Sadness\") who knows just how to scratch her particular itch.",
      "I asked, \"Was there any point where you thought, 'Oh, I don't know if I can do this'?\"",
      "\"Yeah, yeah. And a lot of it is stamina, 'cause I'm in every frame of the film,\" she replied.",
      "To watch a trailer for \"Babygirl,\" click on the video player below:",
      "Kidman is committed to working a lot with female directors, and in Halina Reijn's hands, the film is intense and relentless.",
      "I asked: \"Do you think part of what makes you do your job \u2013 \"",
      "\"Weird?\" Kidman offered.",
      "\"Well \u2026 weird, yeah, that's where I was going with that?\"",
      "\"You can say it!\"",
      "\"Do you think part of what makes you a good actor is that ability to feel intensely?\"",
      "\"Probably the thing that I have is the ability to feel, like, really feel,\" Kidman said. \"I go into hospitals. Keith and I will work where we go \u2026 he'll bring his guitar and we'll just, you know, in the oncology units. And I have to not absorb someone else's emotions.\"",
      "\"Because that's your tendency? That's what you tend to do?\"",
      "\"Yeah. And Keith's always said, 'You're like a raw egg that I have to be the shell for.'\"",
      "Kidman doesn't look all that vulnerable, but when she's not out being a global superstar, she's a complete homebody. In fact, the daily routine at her Nashville home, with Keith and their two daughters, might sound a lot like yours. \"We have breakfast together every morning, so even if I'm working, I'm up. And then dinners. I also like putting on my jammies and coming home.\"",
      "\"Are you a homebody?\"",
      "\"Yeah, putting on my bed socks. But we do have a rule: You can't put your pajamas on before 5:00 p.m.\"",
      "\"Why do you have that rule?\"",
      "\"Because otherwise, you can get into them a lot earlier. Not a good thing!\"",
      "But there have been moments, Kidman says, when she seriously thought about being a full-time stay-at-home mom \u2013 giving up the whole acting thing. She says that in 2008, after she gave birth to her daughter, Sunday, \"I was like, 'Well, I think I'm pretty much done now.' I had moved to Nashville. We were living on a farm. And that's when my mom actually said, 'I wouldn't give up completely. Keep a finger sort of in it.' And I'm like, 'No, no. I'm done now. I'm done.' She's going, 'Just listen to me. I think, keep moving forward. Not saying that you have to do it to the level you've been doing it, but I wouldn't give it up completely.'\"",
      "After that, Kidman went on to do some of the best work of her career, and this past April she received the lifetime achievement award from the American Film Institute.\u00a0 Her pal Meryl Streep did the honors that night, speaking of Nicole: \"The hardest part is when you come up against, or you're acting with another person who is also really, really, really, really, really, really great. That's difficult for me!\"",
      "Kidman said the honor felt strange. \"'Cause at first I was like, 'I'm not sure I want this right now. Does that mean it's over?'\"",
      "But for Kidman, who's already picked up a Golden Globe nomination for her performance in \"Babygirl,\" the year's stratospheric highs have been tempered by a devastating loss: Her mother, Jannele, died in September at age 84, as Kidman was en route to the Venice Film Festival for a screening of \"Babygirl.\"",
      "I asked Kidman, \"Did you share with her what it was about?\"",
      "\"Yeah. She knew. She knew everything,\" she replied. \"That's probably the biggest loss, is you lose the person that knows everything, that loves you anyway. I love when people say, 'There is no limit to your grief. You don't have to have a time limit on it. You don't have to be all better by this time.' So, you're allowed to constantly let it pass through in waves. \u2026 People go, 'Oh, well, whatever.' But it's my mama, my life, and I'm allowed to process it and grieve in the way I want to.\"",
      "\"Yeah, there is no time limit. And it does come in waves.\"",
      "\"Yeah, it's weird.\"",
      "\"And you never know when it's gonna hit.\"",
      "\"Yeah, it's like it's a different road,\" Kidman said. \"When my papa passed \u2013 and I suppose it's good to talk about it all, because so many people in the world are going through it \u2013 but it's just a whole other thing, both parents gone. Just like, 'Whoa. Okay. Wow.'\"",
      "\"But that's okay. And I appreciate your sharing it. Because, like you said, people \u2013\"",
      "\"Move on quick!\" Kidman laughed. \"Now I'm embarrassed!\"",
      "Kidman may keep her emotions within easy reach, but that's not a bad thing: In the same face that you might see torrents of rage and grief, you can just as easily see happiness and hope.",
      "I asked her, \"Do you feel like this now is a moment \u2013 you know, all of these awards, the festivals, several hit television series \u2013 do you feel like you're in this moment right now?\"",
      "\"No,\" Kidman replied. \"I'm just me. But I think 'cause I've had so many years of so many different things happening and I'm fully cognizant of where I am, I'm wide awake. I'm in this world. I'm curious, and grateful, and amazed. I love the word wonder, 'cause I still have a lot of wonder, and a lot of excitement about what's to come.\"",

    "summary": "In the new Broadway revival of \"Gypsy,\" six-time Tony Award-winner Audra McDonald takes on one of musical theater's most demanding roles: stage mother Rose, who pushes daughter Gypsy Rose Lee into becoming a striptease artist.",
    "story": [
      "She's the mother of all stage mothers: Rose, a single mom hellbent on turning her two young daughters into stars during the waning days of vaudeville. But in the musical \"Gypsy,\" she gets top billing. Rosalind Russell played her in the 1962 movie; Bette Midler in the 1993 TV version; and on stage, where it all started, Rose has been played by some of Broadway's greats, including Ethel Merman, Angela Lansbury, Tyne Daly, Bernadette Peters and Patti LuPone.",
      "And opening this week, six-time Tony Award winner Audra McDonald will take on one of musical theater's most demanding roles. \"It's a high gear the entire time,\" she said. \"And instead of someone sweeping me up in the tornado, I'm the tornado!\"",
      "It's a part that's been compared to Shakespeare's King Lear. According to Erick Neher, cultural editor for the Hudson Review, \"What Lear is to classical actors, that is what Rose is to musical theater. It's the Everest. It's the summit. It's an impossible role in a way, and yet every great musical theatre actress wants to test herself with it.\"",
      "McDonald said, \"Everest is there for a reason. People want to climb it, right? I mean, it's there because it's majestic and it's incredible, and people are like, 'I want to figure out if I can get up there.' And that's what I'm trying to do.\"",
      "The musical was inspired by the memoir of Gypsy Rose Lee, one of the world's most famous striptease artists. But the musical's creators, including writer Arthur Laurents, weren't interested in telling her story. Neher said, \"The really interesting thing about the show 'Gypsy' is that it's not really about Gypsy Rose Lee or even her sister June, who became a very well-known actress, June Havoc. It's about their mother, a tyrannical, insane, fabulous woman who pushed these two young girls onto the stage.\"",
      "It's Rose who volunteers her older daughter to perform a striptease for the first time. Were audiences shocked by the idea of a mother who would push her daughter to basically become a stripper? \"It's still shocking today, I think, when we see it,\" said Neher.",
      "Before \"Gypsy,\" stage mothers were largely played for laughs, as they still are today; think reality shows like \"Dance Moms.\" Neher said, \"What really differentiates 'Gypsy' is that it's the first work in any genre that I can think of that takes this comic character of the pushy stage mother and then does this psychological deep-dive into it.\"",
      "\"I admire the ferocity,\" said five-time Tony Award-winner George C. Wolfe, who is directing this production. \"I think it's about not enough, people living with not enough: Not enough money, not enough space, not enough love, not enough approval, not enough success. And it becomes this dynamic of people wanting that thing, desperately wanting that thing that is just beyond their reach.\"",
      "The question that looms over any production of \"Gypsy\" is, why does this woman drive her children so hard \u2026 and ultimately away from her?",
      "McDonald said, \"I think she is a dedicated mother. I think she is a fiercely protective mother. I think she is a mother who does not realize that the umbilical cord has been cut. I don't see Rose as a monster mother at all.\"",
      "So, is she in this for her kids, or for herself? \"I don't think she can differentiate between the two,\" McDonald said.",
      "Rose may stop at nothing in pursuit of her dream. But the director and star of this production \u2013 the first on Broadway in which mother and daughters are played by Black actors \u2013 say there's a good reason.",
      "According to Wolfe, \"It's not a selfish dream. It's not a 'my' dream. It's a wonderful dream for me and my kids.\"",
      "McDonald adds, \"Which is so interesting, too, then, why society has the audacity to say, 'How dare she have that dream for her kids?' I did what society laid out for me: 'No.' And look where it got me: 'No.' My kids are just supposed to go to school like other girls, and cook and clean and sit and die? And especially that feels like that hits hard, too, as a Black woman saying, 'No, they're not gonna do that.'\"",
      "It may all sound pretty serious for a musical. But did we mention there are some real showstoppers in \"Gypsy\" \u2026 and an adorable pooch?",
      "\"She really, really sweet,\" McDonald said, who introduced us to the dog who plays Chowsie. \"We saw a lotta dogs. It took a while before we found the right one. No one's watching you when they're on stage, that much I do know!\" she laughed.",

I hope my experience can serve to inspire other women, facing similar struggles, to overcome their own challenges with dignity and respect, so that they too can turn the page and begin a new chapter of their lives.\"",

      "An email seeking comment from attorneys for Lythgoe was not immediately answered.",
      "The lawsuit filed nearly a year ago had also accused Lythgoe of sexually assaulting Abdul after she left \"American Idol\" and became a judge on Lythgoe's other competition show, \"So You Think You Can Dance.\"",

      "The Associated Press generally does not identify alleged victims of sexual assault unless they come forward publicly, as Abdul has done.",
      "Abdul, a Grammy and Emmy-winning singer and dancer, said in the lawsuit that she remained silent for years about the alleged assaults out of fear of retaliation by \"one of the most well-known producers of television competition shows.\"",
      "She alleged that the first sexual assault occurred while Abdul and Lythgoe were on the road filming auditions for an early season of \"American Idol,\" which premiered in 2002.",
      "Abdul says Lythgoe groped her in the elevator of their hotel after a day of filming and \"began shoving his tongue down her throat.\" Abdul pushed him away and ran to her hotel room when the elevator doors opened.",

This year, the 13-time Grammy Award winner, Rock and Roll Hall of Fame inductee, and one of Rolling Stone's greatest singers and guitar players of all time, added another accolade to her already impressive resume: Kennedy Center honoree.",

    "summary": "Republicans wants to extend 2017 tax cuts that expire next year and could let ACA subsidies lapse to help pay the tab, according to analysts.",
    "story": [
      "The Affordable Care Act, also known as Obamacare, remains popular with the public, garnering the approval of 54% of U.S. adults, according to a recently released Gallup poll. But experts say that may not insulate the federal health insurance program from change as President-elect Donald Trump and his fellow Republicans look to renew $4 trillion in expiring tax cuts.",
      "Many provisions of the 2017 Tax Cuts and Jobs Act\u00a0(TCJA), a signature law passed during Trump's first term, are due to sunset at the end of 2025. Republican leaders are now strategizing on how to extend the cuts, while the president-elect has also pledged to slash corporate taxes and eliminate taxes on workers' tips and overtime pay.",
      "But renewing the TCJA tax breaks alone without reducing federal spending would add nearly $4 trillion to the nation's deficit through 2035, according to the Committee for a Responsible Federal Budget, an advocacy group focused on reducing the nation's debt.",
      "Trump has already taken two of the biggest government programs \u2014 Social Security and Medicare \u2014 off the table for potential cuts. Reduced defense spending is also viewed as unlikely, meaning nearly half of federal spending would be protected, Larry Levitt, executive vice president for health policy at KFF (formerly Kaiser Family Foundation,)\u00a0said\u00a0in a recent JAMA article.",
      "That leaves \"Medicaid, which is the next largest source of federal spending, and the ACA as prime targets for spending cuts. The math is inescapable,\" Levitt stated.",
      "Will Trump repeal the ACA?",
      "By contrast, an outright repeal of the ACA is unlikely. While Trump has continued to criticize the health care expansion measure, he has retreated from his previous vows to axe the ACA entirely.",
      "\"President Trump will deliver on his pledge to make his highly successful tax cuts permanent and ease the financial burden on families across the country. He will also end the drain on our health care system so that our country can continue to care for Americans who rely on Medicaid, Medicare and Social Security,\" \u00a0Trump-Vance Transition Spokesperson Anna Kelly told CBS News.",
      "Support for the ACA hit a record\u00a055%\u00a0in 2017, the first time a majority of Americans approved of the health care law since Gallup started asking about it in 2012. That high watermark came a month after failed efforts by then-President Trump and the GOP to repeal and replace the law.",
      "\"The Affordable Care Act is still politically divisive, but overall more popular with the public than ever,\" Levitt told CBS MoneyWatch. \"It's unlikely Republicans will try to repeal the ACA again, but cuts to the ACA and Medicaid are quite possible if Republicans are looking to pay for tax cuts.\"",
      "Brad Ellis, senior director at Fitch Ratings, noted that Trump and Republican lawmakers have expressed interest in changing how the ACA operates, including introducing high-risk participant pools and possibly reducing subsidies for public exchange business. Such changes could hurt enrollment, he said in a recent report.",
      "During the presidential campaign, Trump said he had \"concepts of a plan\" to replace the ACA.",
      "\"Obamacare stinks,\" Trump recently told NBC News' \"Meet the Press. \"If we come up with a better answer, I would present that answer to Democrats and to everybody else and I'd do something about it.\"",
      "Big cuts without lifting a finger",
      "Republicans can make big cuts to the ACA simply by standing pat. That's because enhanced ACA premium subsidies, which were enacted after President Biden was elected and the Democrats took control of Congress, are scheduled to lapse along with the 2017 tax cuts at the end of 2025. The drop in financial aid ACA enrollees would increase out-of-pocket premiums by an average of $705 a year, or 79%, according to a KFF\u00a0analysis.",
      "The Congressional Budget Office\u00a0projects that letting the additional ACA subsidies expire would reduce the federal deficit by $335 billion over a decade, relative to extending them permanently.",
      "Enrollment in the ACA nearly doubled to a record 21 million after the enhanced subsidies went into effect. The CBO estimates that 6.9 million fewer people would be enrolled in ACA Marketplace plans without the subsidies, and 3.4 million more would be uninsured.",
      "The impact would be felt nationwide, but particularly in Southern states that have not expanded Medicaid eligibility under the ACA, according to Levitt, who noted that the five states with the fastest growth in ACA enrollment since 2020 are Georgia, Mississippi, South Carolina, Tennessee and Texas.",
      "\"Health care was not a big topic during the campaign, so I can imagine that voters could be surprised to see cuts to Medicaid and the ACA that they didn't hear about during the campaign,\" Levitt said. \"As frustrated as people are with the current state of health insurance, disrupting the status quo makes them nervous.\"",
      "Medicaid a target for cuts?",
      "Medicaid accounts for more than $600 billion a year in federal spending and covers 81 million people, according to KFF.",
      "\"There are indications that support for Medicaid will decrease under the new administration, suggesting lower enrollment and revenue headwinds for this program,\" stated Fitch's Ellis.",
      "Trump was silent on Medicaid during the 2024 campaign, but his budget proposals during his first administration included a\u00a0plan to cap federal spending on Medicaid. The Project 2025 plan prepared by the Heritage Foundation and a coalition of conservative groups, is recommending changes to Medicaid including a limit on federal spending.",
      "\"The centerpiece of several prominent plans \u2014 Project 2025, the Republican Study Committee fiscal year 2025 (RSC) budget and the fiscal year 2025 House GOP budget resolution \u2014 is to cap and deeply cut federal Medicaid funding,\" Edwin Park, a research professor at the Georgetown University McCourt School of Public Policy's Center for Children and Families, noted in September.",
      "Trump sought distance himself from Project 2025 in the months leading up to the election, criticizing some of its policy proposal as \"abysmal.\"",
      "But Levitt said the ACA and Medicaid could still end up facing cuts as the Republicans, who will control the White House and both houses of Congress, hash out their fiscal plans after President-elect Trump assumes office.",
      "\"So much depends on whether there is pressure to pay for tax cuts with spending reductions. If Republicans are willing to cut taxes and increase the deficit, we may not see big cuts to the ACA and Medicaid,\" said Levitt. \"There are Republicans who may insist on spending cuts to offset tax cuts. If that's the case, the ACA and Medicaid are very likely to be on the chopping block.\"",

      "The Food and Drug Administration has not formally reevaluated the safety of a food dye called Red 40 in over a decade, the agency's top food official said this month when asked about renewed worries over its potential behavioral health effects.",
      "The agency has launched a new effort to take a second look at some previously approved additives. But Jim Jones, the FDA's deputy commissioner for human foods, warned their budget was too small and that it would take years to catch up to other countries.",
      "\"We are several decades behind Europeans and our Canadian counterparts, because they have legal mandates to reevaluate chemicals that have been authorized,\" Jones told Sen. Tommy Tuberville at a hearing of the Senate's health committee.",
      "Tuberville also asked Jones about a different food dye called Red 3, which advocacy groups have petitioned against due to studies showing it causes cancer in animals. Jones suggested the agency could be weeks away from moving to ban it.",
      "The decades-old controversy over synthetic food dyes has gained renewed attention on Capitol Hill, thanks in part to outspoken criticism from Robert F. Kennedy Jr., President-elect Donald Trump's pick to head the department overseeing the FDA and other health agencies.",

      "What is red dye 40?",
      "FD&C Red No. 40, or Red 40 for short, is the FDA's name to refer to a color additive first registered with the agency in the 1970s. The chemical is known as Allura Red AC in the food industry and E 129 in Europe.",
      "It is now mostly synthesized from petroleum.",
      "Further chemical reactions to combine the dye with aluminum create what's known as \"Red 40 Lake.\" Lakes are often used for products like chewing gum where there is not enough moisture to dissolve the dye into the product, or in products like frostings to help prevent the colors from bleeding.",
      "The FDA says it subjects production of Red 40 and some other synthetic dyes to stepped-up scrutiny, screening each batch for any contaminants from its production process.",
      "Among the dyes that undergo this purity certification, Red 40 consistently ranks as the one with the highest quantity produced each quarter.",
      "\"People think that 'I know which foods have dyes and which don't,' but no you do not. White foods can contain dyes, foods marketed as healthy and natural can contain dyes, egg noodles can contain dyes, it's just very hard to know and avoid them, unless you look at the label,\" said environmental health consultant Lisa Lefferts.",
      "Lefferts was closely involved with a push by the Center for Science in the Public Interest for the FDA to curb use of synthetic food dyes, as well as a new law in California that will ban Red 40 and some other dyes from school meals starting in 2028.",
      "\"If you talk to parents whose kids are sensitive to dyes, they'll tell you how difficult it is to avoid dyes and what a huge change it was for their entire household to try to get these dyes out of their kids' diets,\" she said.",

      "Scientists, consumer protection groups and food safety groups have petitioned the FDA to withdraw their approval for Red No. 3, and the FDA is expected to act sometime in the next few weeks, Gounder said.",
      "This dye has already been banned in cosmetics and topical medications since 1990.",
      "What foods and drinks have red dye 40?",
      "An FDA study published in 2016 estimated that children are exposed to Red 40 the most from drinks, frozen desserts and cereal.",
      "Databases published by the U.S. Department of Agriculture and nonprofit Environmental Working Group tally thousands of foods with Red 40. Medications and cosmetics also have it.",
      "They include products like Kellogg's Froot Loops, a cereal brand that Kennedy has criticized. The foodmaker has faced calls to remove artificial colors, like it did for less fluorescent versions of Froot Loops sold in other countries like Canada. Other major cereal brands like Lucky Charms from General Mills also have Red 40.",
      "Froot Loops maker WK Kellogg\u00a0has said\u00a0that its foods are safe and its ingredients all comply with federal regulations.",
      "Several frozen dessert products also rely on Red 40, including Turkey Hill's Black Raspberry Premium Ice Cream, Breyers' M&M's Minis Caramel Fudge Light Ice Cream, Blue Bell's Birthday Cake Vanilla Flavored Ice Cream Cups and Blue Bunny's Strawberry Flavored Soft Frozen Dairy Dessert.",
      "A number of soft drinks also use Red 40, like Gatorade Fruit Punch and Fanta Soda. Other kinds of beverages also can contain the dye, like several strawberry milk brands or various generic manufacturers of pink lemonade mixes.",
      "Gounder said it's important to look at labels since it's the only way to know if there are synthetic dyes in a product.",
      "\"You can't look at the color. Even white foods may have synthetic dyes to make it brighter,\" she said.",
      "Why are there calls to ban red dye 40?",
      "Most calls to restrict Red 40 stem from research commissioned by British food authorities in 2007, which linked increases of hyperactivity in children to mixtures of synthetic dyes.",
      "After the findings, authorities in Europe did not ban the dyes across the continent. Canada also continues to permit use of Red 40 and some other synthetic dyes.",
      "But the United Kingdom and Europe did add warnings to labels for foods containing any of the dyes from the tested mixtures, including Red 40, saying that they \"may have an adverse effect on activity and attention in children.\"",
      "A review by California's Environmental Protection Agency in 2021 looking at dozens of studies agreed \"that synthetic food dyes can cause or exacerbate neuro-behavioral problems in some children,\" including Red 40.",
      "Lefferts said it was \"a no-brainer\" that synthetic dyes should be pulled from the food supply, given concerns over this risk. She praised California's review for integrating data from animal and lab studies, helping to fill in gaps from human research to prove a causal link.",
      "\"Synthetic food dyes are completely unnecessary. They can be omitted entirely or replaced with safe alternatives. Their purpose is purely cosmetic and we have all this evidence,\" said Lefferts.",
      "In a statement, the International Association of Color Manufacturers cited past FDA advisory panels, as well as findings by European and international health authorities, which have stopped short of concluding there was a causal link between Red 40 and hyperactivity.",
      "\"The FDA regulates the safety and labeling of all color additives, and it does so based on scientific evidence. As such, the FDA has determined and continues to maintain that FD&C Red No. 40 is safe,\" said Sarah Codrea, the trade group's executive director.",
      "Why isn't red dye 40 banned in the U.S.?",
      "After the British study led authorities in Europe to warn about dyes like Red 40, the FDA convened a meeting of its food advisers in 2011 to review their safety.",
      "The panel voted narrowly against a similar kind of warning. Most said they thought studies had fallen short of proving a causal link, but were split on whether the studies warranted a warning.",
      "\"Causality is a distant aspiration, but certainly these data don't give us any confidence that we can say there's nothing to worry about here,\" committee member Dr. Francisco Xavier Castellanos said during the meeting.",
      "A meeting of the agency's science board later in 2019 concluded that \"most children have no effects from consuming foods containing color additives, though some evidence suggested that certain children may be part of a sensitive subpopulation,\" an FDA spokesperson said.",
      "\"Reassessing the safety of chemicals in food as new, relevant data become available is a priority for the FDA,\" the spokesperson said.",
      "Pulling previously approved chemicals off the market is an uphill battle through the cumbersome federal \"rulemaking\" process, which requires the agency to defend its answers to any question or concern raised by opponents of the measure \u2014 often companies with millions of dollars at stake.",
      "\"The agency can't just wave a wand and say, we don't like these anymore. There's whole industries that have been developed using this color additive with the understanding that it's safe,\" said Dennis Keefe, the former director of the FDA's office of food additive safety.",
      "Keefe said adding a warning requires the agency's lawyers to argue a \"compelling public health reason,\" given the high bar set by the First Amendment to compel speech on labels.",
      "Short of Congress stepping in to mandate changes or fund the kind of pricey studies to fill the gaps from previous research, Keefe said the agency faced more pressing public health priorities for its limited food budget.",
      "\"The agency needs to defend, scientifically, in the courts, to take the action. And they would have to have good data that Red 40 in particular is causing these hyperactivities. And the data just really aren't that tight,\" said Keefe.",

    "summary": "Aaron Siri, an attorney to Robert F. Kennedy Jr., petitioned the FDA to \"withdraw or suspend\" its approval of a polio vaccine.",
    "story": [
      "Senate Republican Leader Mitch McConnell issued an apparent warning Friday to Robert F. Kennedy, President-elect Donald Trump's pick to lead the Health and Human Services Department, after The New York Times reported that one of Kennedy's top advisers had filed petitions to revoke the approval of a polio vaccine and several other shots.",
      "\"Anyone seeking the Senate's consent to serve in the incoming Administration would do well to steer clear of even the appearance of association with such efforts,\" McConnell said in a statement.",
      "McConnell, a polio survivor, denounced efforts \"to undermine public confidence in proven cures\" like the polio vaccine.",
      "\"The polio vaccine has saved millions of lives and held out the promise of eradicating a terrible disease. Efforts to undermine public confidence in proven cures are not just uninformed \u2014 they're dangerous,\" McConnell said.",
      "McConnell credited the \"miraculous combination of modern medicine and a mother's love\" with saving him from paralysis when he contracted the disease at two years of age, and he praised\u00a0 the \"miracle\" of \"the saving power of the polio vaccine\" for the millions of children who came after him.",
      "The\u00a0Times article focused in large part on the work of attorney Aaron Siri for the nonprofit Informed Consent Action Network, or ICAN, which petitioned the Food and Drug Administration in 2022 \"demanding that the FDA suspend or withdraw approval\" of Sanofi Pasteur's inactivated polio vaccine, called IPOL.",
      "Siri has been acting as an adviser to the transition team for Kennedy, who, if confirmed by the Senate, would oversee the FDA and the nation's other public health agencies.",
      "Siri called the Times article a \"hit piece\" that did not engage with the substance of the \"legitimate\" concern at the center of the petition he filed for ICAN.",
      "\"ICAN's petition, filed in 2022, makes the reasonable request that the FDA, as required by federal law, require a proper clinical trial for IPOL prior to licensure,\" Siri posted on X.",
      "The Times report on Siri's work sparked a renewed round of backlash against Kennedy by Democrats, too, who have criticized Trump for months over his ties with Kennedy.",
      "As HHS secretary, Kennedy would have significant direct authority as the nation's health secretary over how vaccines are studied, approved and recommended in the U.S. He and his FDA commissioner would also oversee how government lawyers respond to many of the legal battles Siri has launched against the agency over vaccines.",
      "Kennedy himself has said he would not ban vaccines and has tried to distance himself from the \"anti-vaccine\" label, instead calling for further study of the shots. He recently resigned as chair of Children's Health Defense, a nonprofit that watchdog groups have found for years to be spreading misinformation over fears about vaccines.",
      "President-elect Donald Trump has said he might be open to getting rid of some vaccines \"if I think it's dangerous,\" pledging to listen to Kennedy.",
      "\"We're going to have a big discussion. The autism rate is at a level that nobody ever believed possible. If you look at things that are happening, there's something causing it,\" Trump said in an interview with Time magazine published this week, when he was asked if he'd sign off on a move by Kennedy to end childhood vaccination programs.",
      "Extensive medical research has conclusively shown that vaccines do not cause autism.",
      "Siri's petition for ICAN has not progressed much at the FDA since it was filed in 2022. It is one of several legal efforts Siri has filed for groups against several shots, including a petition in 2020 over hepatitis B vaccines.",
      "In a 2023 letter responding to the polio petition, the agency's top vaccine official, Dr. Peter Marks, wrote that the FDA \"has been unable to reach a decision on your petition because it raises issues requiring further review and analysis by agency officials.\"",
      "Siri's petition targets IPOL, which is the only \"single-antigen\" polio vaccine currently recommended for use in the U.S. The vaccine was approved in the 1990s.",
      "Many children who receive immunizations for polio often do not receive IPOL, but rather, one of several combination vaccines that blend a harmless version of the poliovirus with other recommended antigens for various vaccine-preventable diseases.",
      "The CDC says IPOL is \"mainly used as a travel vaccine for adults.\" The agency says that the \"body of scientific evidence overwhelmingly supports\" the safety of polio vaccines.",
      "Siri has hinted at plans for more petitions to the FDA, after Kennedy is in charge at HHS.",
      "\"It will help if there are outsiders, from the outside attacking in. For example, the FDA acts on petitions. If you want to license a product, you have to petition them. If you want a product to be withdrawn or reevaluated, you typically often have to petition them,\" Siri told Del Bigtree, ICAN's founder and a former campaign spokesperson for Kennedy, on his podcast last month.",

    "published": "Tue, 17 Dec 2024 19:41:44 -0500",
    "summary": "\"In essence, this money has been stolen from all of us for all these years,\" said an 84-year-old woman whose late husband's Social Security benefits were slashed. \"It's not fair.\"",
    "story": [
      "At 84 years old, Evelyn Paternostro spends her days working part time as a cashier at Dollar Tree. For decades, she dedicated her life to education, serving as a teacher and principal in Louisiana. But despite years of her public service, she now struggles to make ends meet.",
      "\"People at the store ask me all the time, 'Are you doing this for fun? Why aren't you retired?'\" she said. \"Because I need to eat.\"",
      "After her husband died, Paternostro discovered she couldn't collect his Social Security benefits due to a pair of federal policies called the Windfall Elimination Provision and the Government Pension Offset.",
      "These provisions reduce or eliminate Social Security\u00a0benefits\u00a0for millions of Americans if they receive a public pension that didn't withhold Social Security tax. Retired teachers, firefighters and other public servants are some of the most impacted.",
      "\"I was really blindsided,\" she said. \"I knew I was going to have a teacher's retirement. I was going to be part of the Louisiana Teachers Retirement System. And I never really thought about my husband's income and what that would mean to me.\"",
      "Who is affected?",
      "Nearly 2.8 million individuals across the United States are impacted by WEP and GPO. Its effects extend to all employees of state, county, municipal and special districts in 26 states. Teachers in 13 of those states, including specific districts in Kentucky and Georgia, also feel its impact.",
      "In Massachusetts and certain districts in Rhode Island, not all municipal employees, but only teachers are impacted.",
      "The purpose of these two 1980s-era programs was \"so that there was no way you could 'double dip' into both a federal pension and Social Security,\" explains Jill Schlesinger, CBS News business analyst.",
      "The Windfall Elimination Provision affects people who qualify for Social Security benefits through their job but also receive a pension from another job where they didn't pay into Social Security.",
      "It may decrease their Social Security payments by up to half the value of their pension.",
      "For example, Michelle Cosgrove's benefits were cut in half, reduced from $866 a month.",
      "Cosgrove spent the first half of her career as a paralegal, contributing to Social Security, before staying home to raise her children.",
      "Later, she became a public school teacher in the San Francisco Bay Area, paying into CalSTRS, California's educator pension fund. However, her plans for retirement took an unexpected turn when she discovered the intricacies of the pension system.",
      "When she retired, Cosgrove's reduced payments affected her ability to pay bills and cover expenses.",
      "The other program, the Government Pension Offset, further impacted Cosgrove after her husband, Mike, passed away in 2022. Despite working in the private sector for decades and contributing to Social Security, his benefits were largely inaccessible to her due to the GPO. Mike, a welding supervisor, was diagnosed with a rare cancer at 52 but continued working until his health worsened. He died at the age of 63.",
      "If pension recipients are a widow or widower of someone who received Social Security benefits, that pension recipient may have reduced survivors benefits or may not receive benefits at all.",
      "\"If I'd have stayed home and done nothing, I'd have gotten all the money,\" Cosgrove said. \"Had I known this, I might not have gone into teaching. I'd have picked something different.\"",
      "The GPO mainly affects women, with 83% of those impacted by GPO being female, according data from the Congressional Research Service.",
      "\"When you see the numbers of the GPO elevated, it's because many of those people were probably teachers and married to somebody who worked in a Social Security job,\" said Joslyn DeLancey, vice president of the Connecticut Education Association. \"They're not going to get that spousal Social Security. \u2026 It's such a messy and nuanced thing.\"",
      "Paternostro estimates she would have received $2,500 a month in Social Security benefits \u2014 about $300,000 over the last decade.",
      "\"That's a lot of money,\" she said. \"That's more money than I can imagine.\"",
      "But these policies brought a different kind of heartache for Dede Ruel, a retired school psychologist in Illinois.",
      "She said she recently received a letter from Social Security informing her that she owed more than $13,000, reducing her Social Security checks by 21%.",
      "According to a CBS News analysis of federal data, these policies are one of the most common reasons for Social Security overpayments, which have totaled more than $450 million in fiscal years 2017-2021.",
      "\"I have been trying to appeal it through their process and I've been denied at every level,\" Ruel said.",
      "Bipartisan support for the Social Security Fairness Act",
      "The Social Security Fairness Act, one of the most bipartisan bills in Congress this session, aims to repeal WEP and GPO.",
      "The House\u00a0voted\u00a0to pass the legislation Nov. 12. The Senate is expected to vote on the Social Security Fairness Act this week.",
      "Social Security is projected to run out of funds in 2035 unless there is a change made to the fund's cost and revenue system.",
      "Even though supporters of the Social Security Fairness Act argue it will only drain the Social Security fund six months earlier than otherwise expected, some critics believe there are better solutions, suggesting states should restructure their retirement systems to address the root causes rather than rely on federal fixes.",
      "\"A lot of the critics say this is gonna cost a lot of money, almost $200 billion dollars over the next 10 years,\" explains Schlesinger. \"Critics say there is a reason why we force people to pay into the Social Security system. These are two separate systems. If we need to fix Social Security, let's fix it. Let's not just do a repeal which is essentially a Band-Aid.\"",
      "Rep. Garret Graves, a Republican from Louisiana who spearheaded the bill, said, \"People should receive benefits based on what they paid into the system. That's what the formula should largely be based upon. I understand the efforts back in the '70s and '80s, but the overcorrection has likely taken $600 to $700 billion in benefits from these folks.\"",
      "Devin Carroll, a financial planner, encounters many clients who are \"completely taken by surprise.\" Carroll often instructs his clients to use the Social Security Administration's WEP calculator, a tool that calculates benefits with the impact of the WEP factored in.",
      "Carroll explains that it can be challenging to figure out future Social Security benefits. The benefits formula includes \"bend points,\" which are adjusted annually based on wage inflation.",
      "These adjustments are crucial because the actual amount of the WEP reduction is determined the year a person turns 62.",
      "\"You have to make some projections, some assumptions about forward-looking inflation, both price inflation and wage inflation,\" Carroll explained. \"Once you do, then you can start to work through that and use a calculator like the SSA has that will do a lot of that for you, and it will tell you what your WEP adjusted for retirement age benefit should be.\"",
      "Carroll also gets to see the impacts of these provisions firsthand. His daughter-in-law is a teacher in Texas and his son is a firefighter in Texas.",

    "published": "Tue, 17 Dec 2024 14:52:41 -0500",
    "summary": "The TikTok ban is set to go into effect next month barring a last-minute sale or Supreme Court action.",
    "story": [
      "Washington \u2014 TikTok's fate in the U.S. appears to be hanging by a thread after a federal appeals court denied its plea to delay a law that will ban the widely popular app if it does not cut ties with its Chinese parent company ByteDance.",
      "The law, which goes into effect on Jan. 19, gave ByteDance nine months to sell TikTok. Absent a sale, the app will be cut off from app stores and web-hosting services in the U.S. The law also gives the president the ability to grant a 90-day delay if a sale is in progress.",
      "According to experts, TikTok has several pathways for avoiding a ban, most notably intervention from the Supreme Court or the incoming Trump administration declining to enforce it. Other options, like a last-minute sale or Congress deciding to repeal the law, appear less likely.",
      "TikTok turns to the Supreme Court",
      "On Monday, TikTok asked the Supreme Court to temporarily pause the law, arguing the appeals court's decision upholding it was \"utterly antithetical to the First Amendment.\"",
      "\"If the Act is allowed to take effect in January 2025 \u2026 this Court will lose its ability to grant applicants meaningful relief,\" lawyers for TikTok and ByteDance wrote. \"Even a temporary shutdown of TikTok will cause permanent harm to applicants \u2014 a representative group of Americans who use TikTok to speak, associate, and listen \u2014 as well as the public at large.\"",
      "The Supreme Court could grant an injunction temporarily blocking the law while TikTok's appeal plays out, saving the app for the time being.",
      "The justices will also need to decide whether to hear the case once TikTok formally requests they do so. If they decline, the appeals court's ruling would be the final say on the matter, and the ban would go into effect, barring intervention by the president. If the high court takes the case, the injunction would almost certainly be in place \u2014 and thus the ban on hold \u2014 until the justices hear and decide the dispute. That process would likely take months.",
      "TikTok asked the justices to make a decision on its request for an injunction by Jan. 6 so that it can \"coordinate with their service providers to perform the complex task of shutting down the TikTok platform only in the United States\" if the justices decline.",
      "The company said a sale is not an option at this point, but a prolonged legal battle before the Supreme Court could buy time to explore a deal. The Chinese government is opposed to selling TikTok's algorithm, meaning a new buyer would be forced to rebuild it from scratch. The algorithm tailors video recommendations to each user and is made up of millions of lines of code.",
      "In its ruling earlier this month, the panel of judges from the U.S. Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit was sympathetic to the U.S. government's argument that TikTok poses a national security risk as long as the Chinese government can use it to collect data on its 170 million users in the U.S. and covertly manipulate the content those users see on the platform. The appeals court rejected TikTok's bid for temporary pause on the ban last week.",
      "Alan Morrison, an associate dean at George Washington University Law School, expects the Supreme Court to take up the case, but said TikTok is likely to face similar skepticism over its claims that the law violates the First Amendment. Morrison said an argument centered on a constitutional provision that prohibits \"bills of attainder\" could be more persuasive. A bill of attainder is legislation that punishes or targets a specific party without first going to trial.",
      "\"The bill of attainder was a much stronger claim than the First Amendment,\" said Morrison, who teaches constitutional law. \"Congress has decided what the new standard of the law is. It's decided who the defendant is \u2014 TikTok \u2014 and it's essentially adjudicated their guilt \u2014 guilt in a civil sense, not in a criminal sense \u2014 which is the mark of a bill of attainder.\"",
      "During oral arguments before the appeals panel in September, Judge Douglas Ginsburg pushed back on the notion that the law singles out TikTok, although it and ByteDance were the only companies named in the legislation. Ginsburg said the law \"describes a category of companies, all of which are owned by or controlled by adversary powers and subjects one company to an immediate necessity.\" He noted that TikTok and the government have been engaged in unsuccessful negotiations for years to try to find a solution to the national security concerns and it's \"the only company that sits in that situation.\"",
      "\"Maybe the Supreme Court will think differently,\" Morrison said.",
      "Trump and app stores could refuse to enforce a ban",
      "Sarah Kreps, the director of the Tech Policy Institute at Cornell University, said the incoming Trump administration could play a role in whether TikTok is banned.",
      "President-elect Donald Trump, who tried to ban the app with an executive order during his first term that was struck down in the courts, vowed this year to \"save\" it. On Monday, Trump touted TikTok as playing a role in helping him with the youth vote and winning the 2024 election. He told reporters that he would \"take a look at TikTok\" when asked how he planned to stop the ban.",
      "\"I have a warm spot in my heart for TikTok,\" he said. The same day, Trump met with TikTok's CEO Shou Chew at his Mar-a-Lago estate, sources familiar with the meeting told CBS News.",
      "Kreps said Trump has several options once he takes office on Jan. 20, the day after the law goes into effect.",
      "\"If [Trump] wants to save TikTok, he could ask Congress to repeal the ban. I don't think that's going to happen. He could ask the [Justice Department] not to enforce the law and signal to Apple and Google that they wouldn't be prosecuted. I don't think that's going to happen either,\" Kreps said. Android and iPhone users depend on the Google Play and Apple App Store to download apps, giving the tech giants a role in carrying out the ban.",
      "\"But what I think could happen is, all of these compliance issues take resources, so he could just simply not provide the resources to enforce the ban,\" Kreps said. \"I think there are ways bureaucratically he could try to massage this so that he's not overturning the ban, but he's also not strictly enforcing it.\"",
      "Trump also has the authority to issue a 90-day delay of the law once he's in office, although that move requires the president to certify to Congress that \"evidence of significant progress\" toward a divestiture has taken place.",
      "A provision in the law that gives the president the power to determine whether an app is no longer controlled by a foreign adversary presents another potential workaround, according to Erik Stallman, a clinical professor of law at the University of California, Berkeley. The law says the president determines when the divestiture requirements are met, although it stipulates that the determination has to happen through an interagency process.",
      "\"Trump can say that he's satisfied that this U.S.-based entity that they've set up is sufficiently distinct from ByteDance to no longer require a divestiture,\" Stallman said.",
      "During its back and forth with the U.S. government over the years, TikTok created a U.S.-based subsidiary, TikTok U.S. Data Security Inc., to limit ByteDance's access to user data. The move was meant to alleviate national security concerns about user data and the Chinese government's access. It also gave responsibility to Oracle, a U.S. company, to store and protect U.S. user data. Lawmakers, however, viewed those protections as insufficient, and passed the law requiring its sale anyway.",
      "Even if the law isn't enforced by the Trump administration, Apple and Google could decide that it's not worth the risk to host TikTok in their app stores. Both companies are already involved in litigation with the Justice Department involving other matters. The TikTok legislation imposes hefty fines on companies found to be in violation, and Trump or his eventual successor could change their minds on enforcement.",
      "\"I think they want to be above board on the things that they have some clear-cut control over and this would be one of them,\" Kreps said of Apple and Google.",
      "Google declined to comment on its plans. Apple did not return a request for comment.",
      "On Friday, the leaders of the House China Committee sent letters to Apple and Google telling them to be ready to remove TikTok from their app stores by Jan. 19. Though TikTok won't disappear from users' phones, app updates would no longer be available and those who don't already have TikTok would not be able to download it.",
      "Kreps expects TikTok users to migrate to other apps like Instagram and YouTube in the coming weeks if they haven't already. TikTok estimated that even a one-month shutdown would result in the platform losing a third of its daily users in the U.S.",
      "\"Every next step where they're blocked makes this more of a self-fulfilling prophecy,\" Kreps said. \"The more people start to migrate, the more this ban has its intended effect, which is to move people elsewhere. But also as people move elsewhere, the impact of a ban actually is mitigated also.\"",

      "Schumer, a Democrat and co-sponsor of the legislation,\u00a0tweeted\u00a0the bill would \"ensure Americans are not erroneously denied their well-earned Social Security benefits simply because they chose at some point to work in their careers in public service.\" As majority leader, he can invoke a Senate rule that would skip a committee hearing and send the bill directly to a floor vote by the full Senate.",
      "That's important, as the clock is ticking as to its fate, with only days left in the current session of Congress.",

    "published": "Tue, 17 Dec 2024 12:37:10 -0500",
    "summary": "Social Security's full retirement age reflects the point at which people can claim their full benefits. It's going up in 2025.",
    "story": [
      "Most Americans may consider the standard retirement age to be 65, but the so-called \"full retirement age\" for Social Security is already older than that \u2014 and it's about to hit an even higher age in 2025.",
      "Social Security's full retirement age (FRA) refers to when workers can start claiming their full benefits, which is based on the number of years they've worked as well as their income during their working years. The longer someone works and the higher their income, the more they can receive from Social Security when they finally claim their benefits.",
      "While the FRA used to be 65 years old, Congress overhauled the program in 1983 to raise the retirement age threshold in order to account for longer life expectancies.",
      "As part of that revamp, the FRA has been inching higher by two months at a time, based on a person's birth year. For instance, people who were born in 1957 reached their FRA when they turned 66 years and 6 months old, or starting in 2023; but people born in 1958 must turn 66 years and 8 months old to qualify for their full benefits, or starting in September 2024.",
      "The full retirement age is set to\u00a0increase again by two months, to 66 years and 10 months old, for people born in 1959. That means the higher FRA for that cohort will go into effect in 2025, with people born in 1959 starting to qualify for their full benefits in November 2025. (You can calculate when you could get your full benefits on this Social Security Administration page.)",
      "To be sure, there is flexibility about when to claim Social Security benefits. People can claim as soon as they turn 62 years old, but the trade-off is a reduced benefit that's locked in for the rest of their retirement.",
      "For instance, claiming at 62 will result in a benefit that's about 30% less than your full benefit \u2014 a sacrifice that many older Americans opt for, given that many are forced into retirement earlier than they expected\u00a0or because they believe it makes more sense to claim more years of guaranteed retirement income, even if it's at a lower amount.",
      "Each year, Social Security benefits are adjusted to account for inflation so beneficiaries' purchasing power doesn't erode over time. In 2025, the annual\u00a0cost-of-living adjustment\u00a0will be 2.5%, the smallest annual COLA hike since 2021 due to cooling inflation.",
      "For most Social Security beneficiaries, the new COLA goes into effect with their January payment.",
      "Young boomers and Gen Xers",
      "The increase in the FRA for people born in 1959 marks the penultimate age change, with the final jump occurring for workers born in or after 1960. Those Americans won't be able to claim their FRA until they hit 67 years old, which means that someone born in January 1960 must hold off until January 2027 to get their full retirement benefits.",
      "That will mostly impact the youngest baby boomers and Gen Xers, with the latter generation spanning 1965 to 1980.",
      "These workers, however, are among the least prepared for retirement, according to recent research. The youngest boomers \u2014 those born between 1959 and 1965 \u2014 started to hit 65 this year, but many of them lack adequate savings to support themselves in old age, the ALI Retirement Income Institute found earlier this year.",
      "About 1 in 3 of these younger boomers will rely on Social Security benefits for at least 90% of their retirement income when they are 70, the study found. But Social Security benefits are designed to replace about 40% of a person's working income.",
      "Gen X, meanwhile, is also shaping up to hit retirement without enough saved for their golden years. The average retirement savings of Gen X households is about $150,000 \u2014 far below the roughly\u00a0$1.5 million\u00a0that Americans say they need to retire comfortably. Another study found that about 40% of Gen Xers don't have a penny saved for retirement.",
      "Meanwhile, older Americans can also maximize their Social Security benefits by delaying claiming until they turn 70 years old. At that point, one's benefits are boosted about 25% higher than their full benefits. But only about 4% of Americans wait until they're 70 to claim the maximum Social Security benefit, according to a recent study from the Transamerica Center for Retirement Studies.",

That's meant to ensure people are longer surprised by extra charges including \"resort,\" \"convenience\" or \"service\" fees that inflate prices. It's also designed to make comparing costs easier, according to the agency.",
      "Hotels commonly tack on resort fees to cover costs like cleaning or the use of amenities such as fitness or aquatic centers. But the FTC said such fees are deceptive, estimating that the new rule will save consumers both time and billions of dollars.",
      "To be sure, businesses may still charge additional fees for service, but they must disclose such charges to consumers up-front, rather than burying them in fine print, and \"clearly and conspicuously\" advertise a hotel room or live event ticket's total price including all fees, versus simply displaying a base rate or price, the FTC explained.

      "The Federal Reserve on Wednesday will make its final interest rate decision of 2024, capping a year during which the central bank provided some financial relief to inflation-weary borrowers in September by ushering in its first rate reduction in four years.",
      "On Dec. 18, the Federal Reserve is likely to make its third consecutive reduction of 2024, according to economists polled by financial data firm FactSet. Yet many experts are also bracing for a slower pace of cuts in 2025 given the nation's still-sticky inflation rate and some of President-elect Donald Trump's proposed economic policies, which, if enacted, could prove inflationary.",
      "The Federal Reserve has been battling inflation since March 2022, when it began ratcheting up rates to cool the economy, eventually pushing its benchmark rate to its highest level in 23 years. While inflation has moderated considerably since then, November's Consumer Price Index rose 2.7%, outpacing the Fed's goal of driving down inflation to a 2% annual rate.",
      "That signals the battle against inflation isn't yet over, though the November inflation report was in line with economists' expectations. At the same time, the unemployment rate has inched higher this year, sparking concerns from the Fed about weaknesses in the labor market, and helping open the door to its recent rate reductions, noted one economist.",
      "\"The Fed will likely move ahead with another 25-basis point cut at its December meeting,\" noted Jacob Channel, senior economist at LendingTree, in an email, adding,\"This could be the last cut for a while though,\" he said.",
      "\"Because the upcoming Trump Administration's policies might cause a resurgence in inflation or otherwise throw the economy off balance, the Fed might choose to take a wait-and-see approach and hold rates steady at their January meeting,\" Channel noted.",

      "Will the Fed cut rates in December?",
      "About 9 in 10 economists polled by financial data firm FactSet are forecasting that the Fed will cut its benchmark rate by 0.25 percentage points on Wednesday.",
      "If that occurs, the federal funds rate \u2014 the interest rate banks charge each other for short-term loans \u2014 will be lowered to a range of 4.25% to 4.5%, down from its current target range of 4.5% to 4.75%.",
      "That would mark the Fed's third consecutive rate cut this year, which kicked off with a jumbo 0.5 percentage point reduction in September, followed by a 0.25 percentage point cut at its November meeting. If the Fed cuts by another 0.25 percentage points on Dec. 18, interest rates will have declined by a full percentage point since September.",
      "How will another rate cut impact my money?",
      "Any reduction in the federal funds rate could ease borrowing costs for millions of Americans. But a 0.25 percentage point cut isn't likely to make that much of a difference, with LendingTree chief credit analyst Matt Schulz noting that it \"may knock a dollar or two off your monthly debt payment.\"",
      "\"Another rate cut is welcome news at the end of a chaotic year, but it ultimately doesn't amount to much for those with debt,\" Schulz said.",
      "Still, new APR rates on credit cards have declined to 24.43% from 24.92% in September, according to LendingTree data. Loan rates for other products, such as home equity lines of credit, have also declined.",
      "Despite the rate cuts, mortgage rates haven't budged much and continue to hover near 20-year highs, leaving many would-be homebuyers disappointed. While the Fed's benchmark rate influences home borrowing costs, mortgages are also impacted by broader economic trends and changes in the yield for the U.S. 10-year Treasury bond.",
      "\"Going forward, mortgage rates will likely continue to fluctuate on a week-to-week basis and it's impossible to say for certain where they'll end up,\" LendingTree's Channel said.",
      "What's going on with inflation and the economy?",
      "Inflation, or the rate at which prices for goods and services change over time, has cooled since it reached a 40-year peak of 9.1% in June 2022.",
      "The Fed began pushing its benchmark rate higher in 2022 in order to dampen economic demand and tame inflation. But while inflation has eased since its 2022 peak, prices for many products and services remain considerably higher than they were before the pandemic.",
      "And prices are likely to stay high unless there's a period of deflation, which typically only happens during a steep economic downturn, such as a recession.",
      "That has left many Americans feeling financially tapped out, with millions taking their frustrations to the ballot box last month and voting for Trump's economic vision of ending \"the inflation nightmare.\"",
      "How might Trump's economic plans impact the Fed?",
      "While Trump has vowed to tackle rising prices, some of his policies could prove to be inflationary, according to Wall Street economists. For instance, Trump last month unveiled plans to place a 25% tariff on all imports from Mexico and Canada on his inauguration day,\u00a0January 20.",
      "The president-elect also said he intends to levy an additional 10% fee on all imports from China.",
      "But tariffs are essentially consumption taxes that are most often paid by consumers. In other words, American shoppers could end up paying more for everything from avocados imported from Mexico to TV sets manufactured in China.",
      "Because of the potential for inflation to tick higher in 2025 if Trump enacts widespread tariffs, many economists expect the Fed to slow or pause in its rate decisions next year in a wait-and-see approach.",
      "\"Fed officials might prefer to be cautious in light of uncertainty about the new administration's policies, especially possible tariff increases,\" noted Goldman Sachs economists in a Dec. 15 research report.",
      "Will the Federal Reserve cut rates in 2025?",
      "Economists are forecasting that the Fed will continue to cut rates next year, although some are scaling back the number of reductions they've penciled in.",
      "The Fed will release its summary of economic projections (SEP) on Dec. 18, which will provide some insight into what the FOMC is expecting in 2025.",
      "It's possible the Fed's outlook will forecast three rate cuts in 2025 of 0.25 percentage points each, down from four rate cuts the central bank had penciled in when it last released the SEP, in September, according to EY chief economist Gregory Daco in an email.",
      "At his Wednesday press conference, Powell could \"reiterate the familiar metaphor of moving slowly in a dark room full of objects to justify a potential rate cut 'skip' at the January meeting,\" Daco added.",

    "summary": "Republicans wants to extend 2017 tax cuts that expire next year and could let ACA subsidies lapse to help pay the tab, according to analysts.",
    "story": [
      "The Affordable Care Act, also known as Obamacare, remains popular with the public, garnering the approval of 54% of U.S. adults, according to a recently released Gallup poll. But experts say that may not insulate the federal health insurance program from change as President-elect Donald Trump and his fellow Republicans look to renew $4 trillion in expiring tax cuts.",
      "Many provisions of the 2017 Tax Cuts and Jobs Act\u00a0(TCJA), a signature law passed during Trump's first term, are due to sunset at the end of 2025. Republican leaders are now strategizing on how to extend the cuts, while the president-elect has also pledged to slash corporate taxes and eliminate taxes on workers' tips and overtime pay.",
      "But renewing the TCJA tax breaks alone without reducing federal spending would add nearly $4 trillion to the nation's deficit through 2035, according to the Committee for a Responsible Federal Budget, an advocacy group focused on reducing the nation's debt.",
      "Trump has already taken two of the biggest government programs \u2014 Social Security and Medicare \u2014 off the table for potential cuts. Reduced defense spending is also viewed as unlikely, meaning nearly half of federal spending would be protected, Larry Levitt, executive vice president for health policy at KFF (formerly Kaiser Family Foundation,)\u00a0said\u00a0in a recent JAMA article.",
      "That leaves \"Medicaid, which is the next largest source of federal spending, and the ACA as prime targets for spending cuts. The math is inescapable,\" Levitt stated.",
      "Will Trump repeal the ACA?",
      "By contrast, an outright repeal of the ACA is unlikely. While Trump has continued to criticize the health care expansion measure, he has retreated from his previous vows to axe the ACA entirely.",
      "\"President Trump will deliver on his pledge to make his highly successful tax cuts permanent and ease the financial burden on families across the country. He will also end the drain on our health care system so that our country can continue to care for Americans who rely on Medicaid, Medicare and Social Security,\" \u00a0Trump-Vance Transition Spokesperson Anna Kelly told CBS News.",
      "Support for the ACA hit a record\u00a055%\u00a0in 2017, the first time a majority of Americans approved of the health care law since Gallup started asking about it in 2012. That high watermark came a month after failed efforts by then-President Trump and the GOP to repeal and replace the law.",
      "\"The Affordable Care Act is still politically divisive, but overall more popular with the public than ever,\" Levitt told CBS MoneyWatch. \"It's unlikely Republicans will try to repeal the ACA again, but cuts to the ACA and Medicaid are quite possible if Republicans are looking to pay for tax cuts.\"",
      "Brad Ellis, senior director at Fitch Ratings, noted that Trump and Republican lawmakers have expressed interest in changing how the ACA operates, including introducing high-risk participant pools and possibly reducing subsidies for public exchange business. Such changes could hurt enrollment, he said in a recent report.",
      "During the presidential campaign, Trump said he had \"concepts of a plan\" to replace the ACA.",
      "\"Obamacare stinks,\" Trump recently told NBC News' \"Meet the Press. \"If we come up with a better answer, I would present that answer to Democrats and to everybody else and I'd do something about it.\"",
      "Big cuts without lifting a finger",
      "Republicans can make big cuts to the ACA simply by standing pat. That's because enhanced ACA premium subsidies, which were enacted after President Biden was elected and the Democrats took control of Congress, are scheduled to lapse along with the 2017 tax cuts at the end of 2025. The drop in financial aid ACA enrollees would increase out-of-pocket premiums by an average of $705 a year, or 79%, according to a KFF\u00a0analysis.",
      "The Congressional Budget Office\u00a0projects that letting the additional ACA subsidies expire would reduce the federal deficit by $335 billion over a decade, relative to extending them permanently.",
      "Enrollment in the ACA nearly doubled to a record 21 million after the enhanced subsidies went into effect. The CBO estimates that 6.9 million fewer people would be enrolled in ACA Marketplace plans without the subsidies, and 3.4 million more would be uninsured.",
      "The impact would be felt nationwide, but particularly in Southern states that have not expanded Medicaid eligibility under the ACA, according to Levitt, who noted that the five states with the fastest growth in ACA enrollment since 2020 are Georgia, Mississippi, South Carolina, Tennessee and Texas.",
      "\"Health care was not a big topic during the campaign, so I can imagine that voters could be surprised to see cuts to Medicaid and the ACA that they didn't hear about during the campaign,\" Levitt said. \"As frustrated as people are with the current state of health insurance, disrupting the status quo makes them nervous.\"",
      "Medicaid a target for cuts?",
      "Medicaid accounts for more than $600 billion a year in federal spending and covers 81 million people, according to KFF.",
      "\"There are indications that support for Medicaid will decrease under the new administration, suggesting lower enrollment and revenue headwinds for this program,\" stated Fitch's Ellis.",
      "Trump was silent on Medicaid during the 2024 campaign, but his budget proposals during his first administration included a\u00a0plan to cap federal spending on Medicaid. The Project 2025 plan prepared by the Heritage Foundation and a coalition of conservative groups, is recommending changes to Medicaid including a limit on federal spending.",
      "\"The centerpiece of several prominent plans \u2014 Project 2025, the Republican Study Committee fiscal year 2025 (RSC) budget and the fiscal year 2025 House GOP budget resolution \u2014 is to cap and deeply cut federal Medicaid funding,\" Edwin Park, a research professor at the Georgetown University McCourt School of Public Policy's Center for Children and Families, noted in September.",
      "Trump sought distance himself from Project 2025 in the months leading up to the election, criticizing some of its policy proposal as \"abysmal.\"",
      "But Levitt said the ACA and Medicaid could still end up facing cuts as the Republicans, who will control the White House and both houses of Congress, hash out their fiscal plans after President-elect Trump assumes office.",
      "\"So much depends on whether there is pressure to pay for tax cuts with spending reductions. If Republicans are willing to cut taxes and increase the deficit, we may not see big cuts to the ACA and Medicaid,\" said Levitt. \"There are Republicans who may insist on spending cuts to offset tax cuts. If that's the case, the ACA and Medicaid are very likely to be on the chopping block.\"",

      "That means choosing a word or phrase that can't be easily guessed. Obvious identifiers like a street name, alma mater or other information that may be readily available online are ill-advised, experts say.",
      "\"It needs to be unique and should be something that's difficult to guess,\" James Scobey, chief information security officer at Keeper Security told CBS MoneyWatch. \"It shouldn't be something that can be researched online about you or your family.

But if you leave the window open, you'll lose your TV,\" he said, comparing cybersecurity threats to physical vulnerabilities.",

      "\"I do think they can be a very useful tool, but you have to explain to the family how it works so you don't volunteer it,\" she said. \"We have had a couple incidents where the victim will say the safe word first instead of letting the other person say it.\"",

    "story": [
      "Airline travel in 2025 is set to become more dignified for passengers with disabilities under a new Department of Transportation rule.",
      "U.S. Transportation Secretary Pete Buttigieg on Monday announced enhanced protections for people with disabilities traveling on commercial airlines. The new regulations are aimed in particular at protecting\u00a0passengers who use wheelchairs, after a series of violations of existing laws by airlines.",
      "For example, the new rule requires training for airlines workers responsible for physically assisting passengers with disabilities and handling their wheelchairs. It also outlines steps airlines must take if they damage or misplace a passenger's wheelchair \u2014 all in an effort to make the skies friendlier for the roughly 5.5 million Americans use a wheelchair.",

      "Concern over airlines' mishandling of records leads many passengers with disabilities to avoid air travel altogether, research has shown.",
      "\"Every passenger deserves safe, dignified travel when they fly \u2014 and we've taken unprecedented actions to hold airlines accountable when they do not provide fair treatment to passengers with disabilities,\" Secretary Buttigieg said in a statement Monday. \"With the new protections we're announcing today, we're establishing a new standard for air travel \u2014 with clear and thorough guidelines for airlines to ensure that passengers using wheelchairs can travel safely and with dignity.\"",
      "Here's some of what the new rule requires.",
      "The rule requires that airlines assist individuals with disabilities without putting them at heightened risk of bodily injury. It must also assist them in a \"dignified\" manner, by respecting their independence, autonomy and privacy.\u00a0Airline personnel must be trained annually on physically assisting passengers who use wheelchairs or mobility devices. They must demonstrate their qualifications through competency assessments or by certification exam.It requires that passengers with disabilities receive prompt assistance when boarding and deplaning aircraft, including moving within the airport terminal.\u00a0Airlines must return all checked wheelchairs and other assistive devices to passengers in the same condition they were received.Improved seating accommodations at airports.",

      "\"In the first term, everyone was fighting me,\" Trump said at Mar-a-Lago. \"This time, everyone wants to be my friend.\"",
      "According to a source at Google, the company donated $285,000 to Biden's inaugural fund four years ago. Google has not announced plans, so far, to donate to Trump's. The Information, a tech news site, and The Wall Street Journal reported that Sundar Pichai, Google's CEO, had plans to meet with Trump.",
      "Tech company CEOs have been going to see Trump at Mar-a-Lago after years of watching his tone and stance change, or at least soften, after in-person meetings.",
      "Apple CEO Tim Cook met with Trump recently, Trump said.",

      "Trump's relationship with social media and tech companies has, in the past, been tenuous if not downright hostile.",
      "During Trump's first term in the White House, he frequently blasted Bezos and Amazon, accusing the company of \"doing great damage\" to retailers and hurting \"towns, cities and states throughout the U.S.\" He's insisted that Amazon should pay more for U.S. Postal Service deliveries.",
      "But Trump has dialed back his public hostility toward the company, and Bezos \u2014 who previously said Trump's treatment of Hillary Clinton in 2016 and refusal to accept the election results in 2020 \"erodes our democracy around the edges\" \u2014 has softened, too.",
      "Speaking at a New York Times DealBook Summit recently, Bezos said he's \"very optimistic\" about a second Trump term.",

Musk reinstated Trump's X account in November 2022 after taking over the company, although Trump has largely posted to his own social media platform, Truth Social. Facebook and Instagram restored Trump's accounts\u00a0in early 2023.",
      "Tech CEOs weren't so eager to donate to Trump's first inaugural committee after his 2016 victory.",
      "For Trump's 2017 inauguration, which raised an eye-popping $107 million, his biggest donors were largely affiliated with sports teams, casinos, venture capital firms and banks. His most generous donor, at $5 million, was the late Las Vegas Sands founder Sheldon Adelson, who died in 2021. But, other than GoDaddy.com founder Bob Parsons, the leaders of big-name tech companies weren't giving $1 million to Trump the first time around.",
      "Trump's inaugural committee, officially known as the Trump-Vance Inaugural Committee, Inc., is a nonprofit 501(c)(4) entity that's responsible for planning inaugural events, and can accept limitless donations. Trump allies former Sen. Kelly Loeffler and investor Steve Witkoff are the committee's co-chairs. When he announced his inaugural committee and co-chairs, Trump said the committee will \"honor\" the \"magnificent victory\" he and his team had to kick off his administration.",
      "Inaugural committees add the pomp and circumstance to an inauguration, but not at taxpayers' expense. They also offer a way for donors to curry favor with an incoming administration. Donors who give $1 million to Trump's inaugural committee can expect not only tickets but face-time with the incoming president and vice president, as well as Cabinet officials.",
      "A president-elect's inaugural committee is different from the Joint Congressional Committee on Inaugural Ceremonies, established by Congress, which is underwritten by taxpayers. The congressional committee, composed of members of both parties, plans and carries out the swearing-in ceremony, as well as an inaugural luncheon for the president and vice president at the Capitol.",

    "story": [
      "Shoppers laden with bags from Fendi, Loewe, Prada and other designer labels clog the narrow sidewalks of Milan's swankiest shopping street, bringing joy to the purveyors of high-end luxury goods this, and every, holiday season.",
      "There's even more to celebrate this year: A commercial real estate company has crowned Via MonteNapoleone as the world's most expensive retail destination, displacing New York's Fifth Avenue.",
      "The latest version of American firm Cushman & Wakefield's annual global index, which ranks shopping areas based on the rent prices they command, is a sign of Via MonteNapoleone's desirability as an address for luxury ready-to-wear, jewelry and even pastry brands.",
      "The average rent on the Milan street has surged to 20,000 euros per square meter ($2,047 per square foot), compared with 19,537 euros per square meter ($2,000 per square foot) on an 11-block stretch of upper Fifth Avenue.",
      "Via MonteNapoleone's small size - it's less than one-quarter mile long - and walking distance to services and top cultural sites are among the street's key advantages, according to Guglielmo Miani, president of the MonteNapoleone District association.",
      "\"Not everything can fit, which is a benefit'' since the limited space makes the street even more exclusive and dynamic, said Miani, whose group also represents businesses on the intersecting side streets that together with Via MonteNapoleone form an area known as Milan's Fashion Quadrilateral.",
      "The biggest brands on the street make 50 million euros ($52.4 million) to 100 million euros in annual sales, Miani said, which goes a long way to paying the rent. Tiffany & Co. is preparing to take up residence on Via Montenapoleone, and long-time tenant Fendi is expanding.",
      "The MonteNapoleone District says 11 million people visited the area this year through November, but there's no way to say how many were big spenders vs. window shoppers. The average shopper on Via MonteNapoleone spent 2,500 euros ($2,624) per purchase between August and November - the highest average receipt in the world, according to the tax-free shopping firm Global Blue.",
      "The street is a magnet for holiday shoppers who arrive in Maseratis, Porsches and even Ferraris, the sports car's limited trunk space notwithstanding. Lights twinkle overhead, boutique windows feature mannequins engaged in warm scenes of holiday fun, and passersby snap photos of expertly decorated cakes in pastry shop displays.",
      "A visitor from China, Chen Xinghan, waited for a taxi with a half-dozen shopping bags lined up next to him on the sidewalk. He said he paid half the price for a luxury Fendi coat that he purchased in Milan than he would have at home.",
      "\"I got a lot,'' Chen acknowledged. \"It's a fantastic place, a good place for shopping.\"",
      "A few store windows down, Franca Da Rold, who was visiting Milan from Belluno, an Italian city in the Dolomites mountain range, marveled at a chunky, meters-long knit scarf priced at 980 euros ($1,028).",
      "\"I could knit that in one hour, using 12-gauge knitting needles as thick as my fingers, and thick wool. Maximum two hours,'' Da Rold said, but acknowledged the brand appeal.",
      "Despite upper Fifth Avenue getting bumped to the No. 2 spot on the Cushman & Wakefield list, the organization that serves as the Manhattan street's guardian and chief promoter had praise for MonteNapoleone's achievement.",
      "\"Milan's investment in its public realm is paying off, which is a win for their shoppers, businesses and city as a whole,'' said Madelyn Wils, the interim president of the Fifth Avenue Association.",
      "But she also expressed confidence that with new investments and a record year for sales on Fifth Avenue, \"we'll be back on top in no time.\""

    "published": "Mon, 16 Dec 2024 07:51:43 -0500",
    "summary": "President-elect Donald Trump has said he wants to extend the 2017 tax cuts, plus throw in a few more. Here's what to know.",
    "story": [
      "During his electoral campaign, President-elect Donald Trump pledged to extend many provisions in his signature Tax Cuts & Jobs Act, a 2017 law that overhauled the tax code and handed a financial break to almost every taxpayer.",
      "Many of those provisions are set to expire at the end of 2025, such as the current individual tax brackets and standard deduction. If lawmakers are unable to pass legislation to extend the TCJA reforms next year, more than 6 in 10 filers would face a tax increase in 2026, according to an analysis from the Tax Foundation.",
      "While those dates may seem distant, passing a major tax bill before the TCJA provisions expire next year represents a significant undertaking by Congress. Beyond extending the tax breaks, Trump also dangled a host of additional cuts to everyone from tipped workers, vowing to eliminate taxes on tips, to senior citizens, promising to eliminate taxes on Social Security income.",
      "Extending the TCJA will \"keep people in a stable place,\" Duncan Campbell, tax leader in Baker Tilly's private wealth practice, told CBS MoneyWatch. But \"we might not see anything and wake up in 2026 with everything setting back to pre-TCJA, and some folks who didn't think about it are like, 'Oh shoot',\" he added.",
      "In the accounting and advisory firm's tax planning with clients, Campbell noted that Baker Tilly is preparing as if the TCJA provisions could expire at the end of 2025. That helps people protect themselves financially and avoids being caught flat-footed in case Congress fails to pass an extension.",
      "\"Prepare as if everything is sunsetting,\" Campbell advised. \"Something is going to happen to the TCJA, but there is a whole year of things that need to happen before that from a new administration and a new Congress.\"",
      "Here's what to know about the potential federal income tax changes in 2025 and how they could affect you.",
      "Could the Trump tax brackets expire?",
      "The expiring Tax Cut & Jobs Act provisions that could impact the greatest number of taxpayers are the law's tax brackets, which would revert to their pre-TCJA thresholds if Congress fails to extend the changes under the 2017 law.",
      "Another provision that could also impact millions of taxpayers is the TCJA's larger standard deduction. Under the tax law, the standard deduction nearly doubled, providing more Americans with a bigger shield for their income. The standard deduction, which reduces a taxpayer's taxable income, will be $15,000 for single taxpayers in 2025 and $30,000 for couples filing jointly.",
      "But if that provision expires, the standard deduction would shrink to $8,350 for single filers in 2026 and $16,700 for joint filers, according to the Tax Foundation. Personal exemptions, which were eliminated under the TCJA, would return, at $5,300 per filer.",
      "What about the Child Tax Credit?",
      "Without an extension of the TCJA, the Child Tax Credit would also revert to its pre-TCJA level in 2026.",
      "\"The maximum child tax credit would revert back to $1,000 from $2,000 under TCJA and begin phasing out at $75,000 in adjusted gross income for single filers and $110,000 for joint filers, compared to $200,000 and $400,000, respectively, under the TCJA,\" the Tax Foundation notes.",
      "Some Republican lawmakers are sounding the alarm about the potential cut to this tax credit, although they largely voted against a bill earlier this year that would have expanded the CTC to provide more relief to low-income families.",
      "In a December 11 statement, House Ways and Means Committee Chairman Jason Smith, a Republican from Missouri, advocated for the extension of the $2,000 CTC.",
      "\"Raising a family can be challenging enough without Washington pulling the rug out from under parents,\" Smith said. \"But that's exactly what will happen if the 2017 Trump tax cuts are allowed to expire next year.\"",
      "Could the $10,000 SALT cap deduction change?",
      "The state and local tax (SALT) deduction allows taxpayers who itemize to deduct property taxes, sales taxes, and state or local income taxes from their federal income taxes. Prior to the TCJA, there was no limit on how much people could deduct through the SALT deduction.",
      "The TCJA limited the deduction to $10,000, regardless of whether claimants file as a single taxpayer or married filing jointly \u2014 a measure that was widely criticized\u00a0in regions with high property taxes, such as many areas of the Northeast.",
      "In the years since the tax law was passed, more people have been hit with the SALT deduction cap due to the rise in property values and local taxes. On the campaign trail, Trump vowed to scrap the $10,000 cap, while his economic adviser Stephen Moore on Thursday said the new administration would like to raise the cap to $20,000.",
      "How likely is Congress to extend Trump's tax cuts?",
      "Republicans have a majority in the House and Senate, as they did in 2017 when Congress passed the Tax Cuts & Jobs Act. That greatly boosts the odds of extending the tax cuts.",
      "At the same time, economists and fiscal hawks are raising concerns about the fiscal impact of prolonging the cuts, with the Committee for a Responsible Federal Budget estimating that extending all the provisions could add more than $5 trillion to the deficit through fiscal year 2035.",
      "For their part, Trump campaign officials have floated cuts in federal spending as a way to eliminate the nation's growing deficit. Billionaires Elon Musk and Vivek Ramaswamy have been tapped by Trump to create recommendations on slashing spending, with the pair saying their Department of Government Efficiency, or DOGE, plans to cut $500 billion in costs.",
      "However, DOGE is an advisory body, not a federal agency, and it remains to be determined how effective the group will be in reducing spending.",
      "What should you do now ahead of potential tax changes in 2025?",
      "If possible, prepare for the TCJA provisions expiring next year, Campbell advised. That's going to be most applicable for higher-income Americans, who are more likely to be affected by some of the changes.",
      "For instance, the TCJA almost doubled the lifetime estate and gift tax exemption \u2014 the amount people can gift to others without paying taxes \u2014 to $13.6 million per person and $27.2 million for a married couple. If the TCJA expires, that would decline to about $7.5 million per individual and $14.5 million for a married couple, according\u00a0to Fidelity.",
      "To be sure, that change wouldn't impact most Americans, but those with significant assets may want to plan ahead, Campbell said. \"If you do nothing, you have lost out on the ability to transfer another $7 million\" before the provision expires, he added.",
      "Another potential change is the expiration of the qualified business income deduction, which allowed small business owners, freelancers and others who own their own business to deduct 20% of their income from their taxes. That tax break is set to expire at the end of 2025.",
      "If that isn't extended, small business owners should plan to set aside extra cash to pay higher taxes in 2026, Campbell said. \"The law is what the law is today, and it's going to expire,\" he said. \"That should be first and foremost in our planning.\"",

      "A closer look at this year's crop",
      "Popeye the Sailor, with his bulging forearms, mealy-mouthed speech, and propensity for fistfights, was created by E.C. Segar and made his first appearance in the newspaper strip \"Thimble Theater\" in 1929, speaking his first words, \"'Ja think I'm a cowboy?\" when asked if he was a sailor. What was supposed to be a one-off appearance became permanent, and the strip would be renamed \"Popeye.\"",
      "But as with Mickey Mouse last year and Winnie the Pooh in 2022, only the earliest version is free for reuse. The spinach that gave the sailor his super-strength wasn't there from the start and is the kind of character element that could spawn legal disputes. And the animated shorts featuring his distinctive mumbly voice didn't begin until 1933 and remain under copyright. As does director Robert Altman's 1980 film starring Robin Williams as Popeye and Shelley Duvall as his oft-fought-over sweetheart Olive Oyl.",
      "That movie was tepidly received initially. So was director Steven Spielberg's \"Adventures of Tintin\" in 2011. But the comics about the boy reporter that inspired it, the creation of Belgian artist Herg\u00e9, were among the most popular in Europe for much of the 20th century.",
      "The simply drawn teen with dots for eyes and bangs like an ocean wave first appeared in a supplement to the Belgian newspaper Le Vingti\u00e8me Si\u00e8cle, and became a weekly feature.",
      "The comic also first appeared in the U.S. in 1929. Its signature bright colors - including Tintin's red hair - didn't appear until years later, and could, like Popeye's spinach, be the subject of legal disputes.",
      "And in much of the world, Tintin won't become public property until 70 years after the 1983 death of his creator.",
      "The books becoming public this year read like the syllabus for an American literature seminar.",
      "\"The Sound and the Fury,\" arguably William Faulkner's quintessential novel with its modernist stream-of-consciousness style, was a sensation after its publication despite being famously difficult for readers. It uses multiple non-linear narratives to tell the story of a prominent family's ruin in the author's native Mississippi, and would help lead to Faulkner's Nobel Prize.",
      "And Ernest Hemingway's \"A Farewell to Arms\" joins his earlier \"The Sun Also Rises\" in the public domain. The partly autobiographical story of an ambulance driver in Italy during the First World War cemented Hemingway's status in the American literary canon. It has been frequently adapted for film, TV and radio, which can now be done without permission.",
      "John Steinbeck's first novel, \"A Cup of Gold,\" from 1929, will also enter the public domain.",
      "The British novelist Virginia Woolf's \"A Room of One's Own,\" an extended essay that would become a landmark in feminism from the modernist literary luminary, is also on the list. Her novel \"Mrs. Dalloway\" is already in the U.S. public domain.",
      "While a host of truly major movies will become public in the coming decade, for now early works by major figures from the not-always-stellar early sound era will have to suffice.",
      "A decade before he would move to Hollywood and make films like \"Psycho,\" and \"Vertigo,\" Alfred Hitchcock made \"Blackmail\" in Britain. The film was begun as a silent but shifted to sound during production, resulting in two different versions, one of them the U.K.'s - and Hitchcock's - first sound film.",
      "John Ford, whose later Westerns would put him among film's most vaunted directors, also made his first foray into sound with 1929's \"The Black Watch,\" an adventure epic that includes Ford's future chief collaborator John Wayne as a young extra.",
      "Cecil B. DeMille, already a Hollywood bigwig through silents, made his first talkie with the melodrama \"Dynamite.\"",
      "Groucho, Harpo and the other Marx Brothers had their first starring movie roles in 1929's \"The Cocoanuts,\" a forerunner to future classics like \"Animal Crackers\" and \"Duck Soup.\"",
      "\"The Broadway Melody,\" the first sound film and the second film ever to win the Oscar for best picture - known as \"outstanding production\" at the time - will also become public, though it's often ranked among the worst of best picture winners.",
      "And after \"Steamboat Willie\" made the earliest Mickey Mouse public, a dozen more of his animations will get the same status, including \"The Karnival Kid,\" where he spoke for the first time.",
      "Songs from the last year of the Roaring Twenties are also about to become public property.",
      "Cole Porter's compositions \"What Is This Thing Called Love?\" and \"Tiptoe Through the Tulips\" are among the highlights, as is the jazz classic \"Ain't Misbehavin', written by Fats Waller and Harry Brooks.",
      "\"Singin' in the Rain,\" which would later forever be associated with the 1952 Gene Kelly film, made its debut in the 1929 movie \"The Hollywood Revue\" and will now be public domain.",
      "Different laws regulate sound recordings, and those newly in the public domain date to 1924. They include a recording of \"Nobody Knows the Trouble I've Seen\" from future star and civil rights icon Marian Anderson, and \"Rhapsody in Blue\" performed by its composer, George Gershwin."

    "story": [
      "For 48-year-old Rowan Childs of Wisconsin, a recent divorce turned her financial life upside down.",
      "\"Initially, I was really nervous and had a lot of anxiety about it, but ultimately now I feel so much more empowered,\" Childs told CBS News.",
      "Like others in their 40s, Childs, who runs her own literacy nonprofit, was already anxious about juggling personal debt and putting away college tuition for her two children. She then joined the roughly half of married women around her age in the U.S. who have dealt with a divorce, a seismic event that can jeopardize retirement planning.",
      "\"That has completely changed my initial vision, you know?\" Childs said. \"...Where am I going to be in my 60s or my 70s or 80s?\"",
      "Childs said retirement wasn't necessarily something she thought about when she was first married.",
      "\"It was too far away, I think,\" Childs said. \"Definitely looking at what my parents were doing, though, was definitely something that I was observing.\"",
      "Teresa Ghilarducci, a labor economist at the New School for Social Research in New York City, has a sobering perspective.",
      "\"People who are in their 40s and 50s will do worse than their parents and their grandparents,\" Ghilarducci said.",
      "Ghilarducci explains that those two previous generations could at least bank on government-sponsored retirement programs.",
      "\"Two generations, because people had grandparents that were living through an expansion of Social Security and Medicare,\" Ghilarducci said.",
      "Both of those programs are now facing funding challenges, something Childs considered when she had to make a series of tough financial decisions. The costliest was to buy her ex-husband's share of their Wisconsin home by borrowing more than $100,000 from her 401(k).",
      "It was a decision partly spurred by the desire to keep her daughter in the same school district.",
      "\"To me, it didn't make sense to sell the house and then buy a house in the same school district, probably at even more,\" Childs said.",
      "Borrowing from a retirement plan, as Childs did, should be a last resort, because if you lose your job, the loan must be repaid in full or you may have to pay taxes and penalties. And if you're in your 40s, paying for a child's college should take a back seat to protecting your own savings. That may come across as tough love, but otherwise you might end up relying on your children later on.",
      "\"Jokingly, I told my kids I could move in with them,\" Childs said. \"\u2026My son was like, 'Well, maybe you could live close by.'\"",
      "The key in your 40s is to take deep breaths, regardless of the challenges.",
      "\"Relax,\" Ghilarducci said. \"Planning for retirement is best for the daylight hours, not in the middle of the night. And when you wake up, take some action steps. Worrying is not action.\"",
      "With plenty of time to get back on her feet, Childs says that she has finally stopped worrying.",
      "\"Maybe working longer could be on the table,\" Childs said. She is also entertaining the possibility of working part time later in life.",

      "NYPD officials said about 30 of those tips were useful as information about the gunman's movements before and after\u00a0the Dec. 4 shooting. But it wasn't until a 911 call came in from a McDonald's employee in Altoona, Pennsylvania, on Monday that police zeroed in on their suspect. The FBI and the Crime Stoppers program have offered up to $60,000 to anyone with a tip leading to a break in the case.",
      "Police and prosecutors moved quickly to\u00a0arrest and charge\u00a0Luigi Mangione, 26, but it could take time before the McDonald's tipster gets a financial reward for assisting in the case. Additionally, the employee might not take home the full $60,000, after paying taxes on the reward. And if other tipsters played a role in leading cops to Mangione, they would also be eligible for a monetary reward, which could be drawn from the same pot of money.",
      "Exactly who will get the reward or a share of it is still being determined, officials said. In fact, the federal and local rewards programs operate under different rules. Both, however, have leeway built in to offer multiple rewards of varying amounts based on a tip's outcome.",
      "How does someone become eligible for a reward?",
      "The FBI reward program, which offered a reward of up to $50,000 in this case, requires that a tip or information lead to an arrest and conviction.",
      "Phone calls and emails to the FBI press office seeking details of the specific reward program's process were not returned, but websites for various rewards offered by the agency outline similar processes. A person giving a tip must be nominated, usually by a federal investigating agency. Then a board considers the tip and its role in the investigation, and decides whether to award up to the full amount.",
      "NYPD Crime Stoppers usually offers up to $3,500 for information that leads to an arrest and indictment. In this case, NYPD's Detective Bureau increased the amount to $10,000, and for its portion a conviction is required.",
      "\"The public's help is essential to solving crimes and keeping our communities safe,\" the Police Foundation board said in a statement Wednesday. \"The individual in Pennsylvania, who called in a tip, is eligible to receive the reward.\"",
      "The McDonald's employee called 911, which records a phone number and usually a name. Tipsters who call the Crime Stoppers line remain anonymous. The program promises to never trace cellphone numbers or record information about callers, instead giving them a unique identifier number that they can use to check back about the status of the case and the potential for a reward.",
      "NYPD Chief of Detectives Joseph Kenny will assess which tip or tips were instrumental in cracking the case when determining how Detective Bureau reward funds should be allocated, police officials said Wednesday.",
      "30 different tips were helpful",
      "Most rewards require a conviction. Given the nature of the murder charges and the multiple jurisdictions involved, it could be a year or more before a trial happens.",
      "For the $3,500 from Crime Stoppers, the board could decide to issue reward money after the indictment is complete. Both the FBI and Crime Stoppers have boards that review the tips and determine which tips substantially helped a case. The boards can exercise discretion in determining how much money a tip might deserve.",
      "The Crime Stoppers board has the leeway to split a reward between tips or to consider each for the maximum amount on a case-by-case basis. NYPD officials did not specify how each of the 30 tips it said were deemed useful helped the case, but it's unlikely that each tipster would receive the highest amount offered.",
      "The police foundation and the FBI don't discuss individual cases or reveal how much money it awards individual tipsters. Similarly, the Crime Stoppers program doesn't release such details in an effort to protect tipsters' anonymity.",

    "story": [
      "President-elect Donald Trump announced he will nominate Herschel Walker, the former football player whose 2022 Senate run was plagued by controversy, to serve as U.S. ambassador to the Bahamas.",
      "\"Herschel has spent decades serving as an Ambassador to our Nation's youth, our men and women in the Military, and athletes at home and abroad,\" Trump said on social media Tuesday night.",
      "Walker would need to be confirmed by the Senate to assume the role. The Senate has not confirmed a U.S. ambassador to the Bahamas in over a decade. Former President Barack Obama had nominated Cassandra Butts for the role in 2014, but the Senate never even brought her nomination up for a vote, according to The Associated Press. She died in 2016.",
      "Trump in his first term nominated Doug Manchester in 2017 for the ambassador role, but his nomination stalled for over two years. CBS News in 2019 also uncovered evidence of a possible pay-to-play scheme for the role. He eventually withdrew and Trump went on to nominate William Douglass in 2020. Douglass' nomination was withdrawn by President Biden when he took office, and Mr. Biden in turn nominated Calvin Smyre, who has not been confirmed by the Senate.",

      "Walker reentered the national spotlight when, at Trump's urging, he challenged Georgia's Democratic Senator Raphael Warnock for his seat in 2022. The race featured several controversies, including two women claiming that Walker \u2014 who was running as an anti-abortion candidate \u2014 had paid for them to get abortions.",

During a news conference back in 2022, she said she couldn't go through with the procedure when she went to get it herself, so Walker took her to a clinic in the Dallas area the next day and waited for her while she got the abortion.",

    "summary": "Leaders in Congress unveiled a measure to keep the government funded, facing a Friday night deadline to avert a government shutdown.",
    "story": [
      "Washington \u2014 Leaders in Congress on Tuesday unveiled a lengthy stopgap measure to keep the government funded into the spring, with just days to go to prevent a government shutdown.",
      "Congress has until Friday night to stave off a funding lapse, since lawmakers approved a continuing resolution in September to keep the government funded through Dec. 20. The new stopgap measure, with approval from the House, Senate and President Biden, would keep the government funded through March 14, giving lawmakers more time to reach agreement on new spending bills when the GOP controls both the House and the Senate.",
      "The 1,500 page stopgap measure also includes a one-year extension of the farm bill, around $100 billion in disaster aid and $10 billion in economic assistance to farmers.",
      "The continuing resolution's release comes under the wire, with House leaders under pressure to abide by a 72-hour rule for members to review legislation before it's brought to the floor. Johnson said Tuesday morning that he believes in adhering to the rule, but with the end of week deadline fast approaching, he may be out of options.",
      "The speaker also said that House Republican leadership is committed to passing the continuing resolution through the regular process, including by going through the House Rules Committee, where it's almost certain to face opposition from GOP hardliners that could further slow the path to passage.",
      "In a statement late Tuesday night, Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer said that he was \"pleased these negotiations led to a bipartisan government funding agreement free of cuts and poison pills, while also securing Democratic priorities like millions for child care, workforce training and job placement, assistance for the Key Bridge rebuild, additional disaster relief funding and more.\"",
      "Even before its release, lawmakers on the party's right flank had begun expressing opposition to the stopgap measure. Rep. Chip Roy, a Texas Republican who sits on the Rules Committee, told reporters after the House GOP conference meeting Tuesday morning that \"this is not the process that we signed up for,\" saying lawmakers are supposed to be able to amend and debate key legislation on the House floor.",
      "\"We get this negotiated crap and we're forced to eat this crap sandwich,\" Roy said. \"Why? Because freaking Christmas is right around the corner. It's the same dang thing every year \u2014 legislate by crisis, legislate by calendar, not legislate because it's the right thing to do.\"",
      "Leadership could instead opt to bring the legislation to the floor under a procedure known as suspension of the rules, leaning on Democrats to reach a two-thirds majority needed for passage in order to get the legislation more swiftly to the Senate before the end-of-week deadline.",
      "House Democratic Caucus Chair Pete Aguilar acknowledged Tuesday morning that Republicans will need Democrats to approve government funding, saying the dynamic \"has been the case this Congress,\" and \"it will continue to be the case in the next Congress.\"",
      "\"This is a lesson for Speaker Johnson,\" Aguilar said. \"Let's find solutions, let's tune out the most extreme voices in your conference, and let's find that consensus that will be necessary to fund government.\"",
      "Johnson has previously expressed distaste for large end-of-year funding measures known as omnibuses, and pledged to avoid the practice of pushing through spending before the holiday recess. He defended the continuing resolution Tuesday, saying \"it is not an omnibus\" and arguing that it will put the party in a position to \"put our fingerprints on what those final spending bills are\" in the new year. And he noted that House Republicans are aiming to resolve the government funding fight earlier in the year, before the March 14 deadline.",
      "Even with this week's tight timeline, lawmakers are expected to thwart the threat of a shutdown, with little appetite in Washington for a funding lapse.",
      "Sen. Patty Murray, the top Democratic appropriator in the Senate, said ahead of the legislation's release Tuesday afternoon that negotiators should have already finished their work, but were delayed by \"an eleventh-hour demand from the speaker.\"",
      "\"We are heading into the holidays and the nation really needs a bipartisan package that will prevent a needless shutdown, keep our government open, and get much needed support to areas across the country that are recovering from disaster,\" Murray said.",
      "The speaker said lawmakers have been \"working around the clock to get the CR done,\" noting that it was intended to be \"a very simple, very clean\" stopgap funding measure to get the party into the new year. But the Louisiana Republican said a \"couple of intervening things\" occurred, citing the devastation caused by hurricanes Helene and Milton earlier this year. Johnson said the stopgap measure includes disaster relief that is \"critically important,\" and provides aid to farmers.",
      "\"What would have been a very skinny, very simple clean CR, these other pieces have been added to it,\" Johnson said.",

    "published": "Tue, 17 Dec 2024 14:52:41 -0500",
    "summary": "The TikTok ban is set to go into effect next month barring a last-minute sale or Supreme Court action.",
    "story": [
      "Washington \u2014 TikTok's fate in the U.S. appears to be hanging by a thread after a federal appeals court denied its plea to delay a law that will ban the widely popular app if it does not cut ties with its Chinese parent company ByteDance.",
      "The law, which goes into effect on Jan. 19, gave ByteDance nine months to sell TikTok. Absent a sale, the app will be cut off from app stores and web-hosting services in the U.S. The law also gives the president the ability to grant a 90-day delay if a sale is in progress.",
      "According to experts, TikTok has several pathways for avoiding a ban, most notably intervention from the Supreme Court or the incoming Trump administration declining to enforce it. Other options, like a last-minute sale or Congress deciding to repeal the law, appear less likely.",
      "TikTok turns to the Supreme Court",
      "On Monday, TikTok asked the Supreme Court to temporarily pause the law, arguing the appeals court's decision upholding it was \"utterly antithetical to the First Amendment.\"",
      "\"If the Act is allowed to take effect in January 2025 \u2026 this Court will lose its ability to grant applicants meaningful relief,\" lawyers for TikTok and ByteDance wrote. \"Even a temporary shutdown of TikTok will cause permanent harm to applicants \u2014 a representative group of Americans who use TikTok to speak, associate, and listen \u2014 as well as the public at large.\"",
      "The Supreme Court could grant an injunction temporarily blocking the law while TikTok's appeal plays out, saving the app for the time being.",
      "The justices will also need to decide whether to hear the case once TikTok formally requests they do so. If they decline, the appeals court's ruling would be the final say on the matter, and the ban would go into effect, barring intervention by the president. If the high court takes the case, the injunction would almost certainly be in place \u2014 and thus the ban on hold \u2014 until the justices hear and decide the dispute. That process would likely take months.",
      "TikTok asked the justices to make a decision on its request for an injunction by Jan. 6 so that it can \"coordinate with their service providers to perform the complex task of shutting down the TikTok platform only in the United States\" if the justices decline.",
      "The company said a sale is not an option at this point, but a prolonged legal battle before the Supreme Court could buy time to explore a deal. The Chinese government is opposed to selling TikTok's algorithm, meaning a new buyer would be forced to rebuild it from scratch. The algorithm tailors video recommendations to each user and is made up of millions of lines of code.",
      "In its ruling earlier this month, the panel of judges from the U.S. Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit was sympathetic to the U.S. government's argument that TikTok poses a national security risk as long as the Chinese government can use it to collect data on its 170 million users in the U.S. and covertly manipulate the content those users see on the platform. The appeals court rejected TikTok's bid for temporary pause on the ban last week.",
      "Alan Morrison, an associate dean at George Washington University Law School, expects the Supreme Court to take up the case, but said TikTok is likely to face similar skepticism over its claims that the law violates the First Amendment. Morrison said an argument centered on a constitutional provision that prohibits \"bills of attainder\" could be more persuasive. A bill of attainder is legislation that punishes or targets a specific party without first going to trial.",
      "\"The bill of attainder was a much stronger claim than the First Amendment,\" said Morrison, who teaches constitutional law. \"Congress has decided what the new standard of the law is. It's decided who the defendant is \u2014 TikTok \u2014 and it's essentially adjudicated their guilt \u2014 guilt in a civil sense, not in a criminal sense \u2014 which is the mark of a bill of attainder.\"",
      "During oral arguments before the appeals panel in September, Judge Douglas Ginsburg pushed back on the notion that the law singles out TikTok, although it and ByteDance were the only companies named in the legislation. Ginsburg said the law \"describes a category of companies, all of which are owned by or controlled by adversary powers and subjects one company to an immediate necessity.\" He noted that TikTok and the government have been engaged in unsuccessful negotiations for years to try to find a solution to the national security concerns and it's \"the only company that sits in that situation.\"",
      "\"Maybe the Supreme Court will think differently,\" Morrison said.",
      "Trump and app stores could refuse to enforce a ban",
      "Sarah Kreps, the director of the Tech Policy Institute at Cornell University, said the incoming Trump administration could play a role in whether TikTok is banned.",
      "President-elect Donald Trump, who tried to ban the app with an executive order during his first term that was struck down in the courts, vowed this year to \"save\" it. On Monday, Trump touted TikTok as playing a role in helping him with the youth vote and winning the 2024 election. He told reporters that he would \"take a look at TikTok\" when asked how he planned to stop the ban.",
      "\"I have a warm spot in my heart for TikTok,\" he said. The same day, Trump met with TikTok's CEO Shou Chew at his Mar-a-Lago estate, sources familiar with the meeting told CBS News.",
      "Kreps said Trump has several options once he takes office on Jan. 20, the day after the law goes into effect.",
      "\"If [Trump] wants to save TikTok, he could ask Congress to repeal the ban. I don't think that's going to happen. He could ask the [Justice Department] not to enforce the law and signal to Apple and Google that they wouldn't be prosecuted. I don't think that's going to happen either,\" Kreps said. Android and iPhone users depend on the Google Play and Apple App Store to download apps, giving the tech giants a role in carrying out the ban.",
      "\"But what I think could happen is, all of these compliance issues take resources, so he could just simply not provide the resources to enforce the ban,\" Kreps said. \"I think there are ways bureaucratically he could try to massage this so that he's not overturning the ban, but he's also not strictly enforcing it.\"",
      "Trump also has the authority to issue a 90-day delay of the law once he's in office, although that move requires the president to certify to Congress that \"evidence of significant progress\" toward a divestiture has taken place.",
      "A provision in the law that gives the president the power to determine whether an app is no longer controlled by a foreign adversary presents another potential workaround, according to Erik Stallman, a clinical professor of law at the University of California, Berkeley. The law says the president determines when the divestiture requirements are met, although it stipulates that the determination has to happen through an interagency process.",
      "\"Trump can say that he's satisfied that this U.S.-based entity that they've set up is sufficiently distinct from ByteDance to no longer require a divestiture,\" Stallman said.",
      "During its back and forth with the U.S. government over the years, TikTok created a U.S.-based subsidiary, TikTok U.S. Data Security Inc., to limit ByteDance's access to user data. The move was meant to alleviate national security concerns about user data and the Chinese government's access. It also gave responsibility to Oracle, a U.S. company, to store and protect U.S. user data. Lawmakers, however, viewed those protections as insufficient, and passed the law requiring its sale anyway.",
      "Even if the law isn't enforced by the Trump administration, Apple and Google could decide that it's not worth the risk to host TikTok in their app stores. Both companies are already involved in litigation with the Justice Department involving other matters. The TikTok legislation imposes hefty fines on companies found to be in violation, and Trump or his eventual successor could change their minds on enforcement.",
      "\"I think they want to be above board on the things that they have some clear-cut control over and this would be one of them,\" Kreps said of Apple and Google.",
      "Google declined to comment on its plans. Apple did not return a request for comment.",
      "On Friday, the leaders of the House China Committee sent letters to Apple and Google telling them to be ready to remove TikTok from their app stores by Jan. 19. Though TikTok won't disappear from users' phones, app updates would no longer be available and those who don't already have TikTok would not be able to download it.",
      "Kreps expects TikTok users to migrate to other apps like Instagram and YouTube in the coming weeks if they haven't already. TikTok estimated that even a one-month shutdown would result in the platform losing a third of its daily users in the U.S.",
      "\"Every next step where they're blocked makes this more of a self-fulfilling prophecy,\" Kreps said. \"The more people start to migrate, the more this ban has its intended effect, which is to move people elsewhere. But also as people move elsewhere, the impact of a ban actually is mitigated also.\"",

      "Connolly, 74, defeated 35-year-old Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez\u00a0in a 131-84 vote to become the ranking member of the powerful committee. Connolly, who came to Congress in 2009, will replace Rep. Jamie Raskin of Maryland, who will serve as the ranking Democrat on the Judiciary Committee when the new Congress convenes on Jan. 3.",
      "\"I think my colleagues were measuring their votes by who's got experience, who's seasoned, who can be trusted, who's capable and who's got a record of productivity,\" Connolly told reporters after the meeting. \"And I think that prevailed.\"",
      "While Democrats will remain in the minority in the new year, Connolly's elevation to ranking member places him in line to chair the Oversight Committee if Democrats retake the House in 2026, halfway through President-elect Donald Trump's second term. The committee led numerous investigations into the first Trump administration after Democrats won the House in 2018.",

      "The announcement Saturday that ABC has agreed to commit $15 million toward President-elect Donald Trump's presidential foundation to settle a defamation lawsuit was a rare victory for Trump in years of lawsuits against news organizations.",
      "In the settlement's aftermath, Trump said Monday at a news conference in Florida that he planned to sue the Des Moines Register over a poll and vowed to continue filing suits against news outlets whom he's long accused of bias. He followed through with that threat later Monday morning, records show, filing against the newspaper in Polk County, Iowa.",
      "Trump complained at the press conference that the pollster, J. Ann Selzer, \"said I was going to lose by three or four points,\" after previous Iowa surveys showed he'd win the state easily, \"by 20 points.\" Trump won the state by 13 points.",
      "\"In my opinion, it was fraud and it was election interference,\" he said, adding, \"we'll probably be filing a major lawsuit against them today or tomorrow.\"",
      "The lawsuit accuses Selzer and the paper of \"brazen election interference\" for publishing the poll.",
      "Lark-Marie Anton, a spokesperson for the Des Moines Register, said in a statement to CBS News, \"We have acknowledged that the Selzer/Des Moines Register pre-election poll did not reflect the ultimate margin of President Trump's Election Day victory in Iowa by releasing the poll's full demographics, crosstabs, weighted and unweighted data, as well as a technical explanation from pollster Ann Selzer.\"",
      "\"We stand by our reporting on the matter and believe a lawsuit would be without merit,\" Anton said.",
      "Such litigation is unusual for presidents to pursue, according to Ohio University professor Aimee Edmondson. Trump has a long history of suing the media, she said, though his lawsuits aren't often successful.",
      "\"It's a rarity that he would actually win a settlement against a journalistic outlet, when I saw that I was astonished,\" said Edmondson, who researches media law and journalism history.",
      "Trump has sued CNN, The Washington Post and the New York Times multiple times, including during his first term in office. It's a tactic he pursued both before and after his presidency, suing journalists and their book publishers, and major outlets \u2014 including CBS News \u2014 for coverage he didn't like.",

      "While Trump's recent lawsuits have focused on outlets that are subsidiaries of deep pocketed corporations, Edmondson said she worries they might inspire others to sue \"mom and pop\" local media in response to coverage.",
      "\"Think of the state and county local officials, who might say, \"Oh, this will be a great way to punish local journalists,\" Edmondson said.",

Trump sued Timothy O'Brien after the journalist wrote a book questioning Trump's claims about his own net worth, demanding $5 billion in damages. The case was dismissed, and Trump later told a reporter for The Washington Post that he knew he couldn't win the suit.",

    "summary": "\"People deserve to know upfront what they're being asked to pay,\" FTC Chair Lina Khan said in announcing crackdown on certain consumer fees.",
    "story": [
      "Ever booked a hotel room for $200 only to be surprised by an extra $40 \"resort fee\" at checkout? A new Federal Trade Commission rule aims to put a stop to such surprise charges by banning so-called junk fees on short-term lodging as well as on tickets to live events.",
      "The rule bans businesses from using such tactics to disguise prices and mislead customers who rent short-term lodging, such as hotels and vacation homes, along with consumers who buy tickets to concerts, sports and other live events, the FTC announced Tuesday.",
      "\"People deserve to know upfront what they're being asked to pay \u2014 without worrying that they'll later be saddled with mysterious fees that they haven't budgeted for and can't avoid,\" FTC Chair Lina Khan said in a statement. \"The FTC's rule will put an end to junk fees around live event tickets, hotels and vacation rentals, saving Americans billions of dollars and millions of hours in wasted time.\"",
      "Under the new rule, total prices for short-term lodging and event tickets must be presented to consumers in a \"timely, transparent and truthful\" manner, the FTC said. That's meant to ensure people are longer surprised by extra charges including \"resort,\" \"convenience\" or \"service\" fees that inflate prices. It's also designed to make comparing costs easier, according to the agency.",
      "Hotels commonly tack on resort fees to cover costs like cleaning or the use of amenities such as fitness or aquatic centers. But the FTC said such fees are deceptive, estimating that the new rule will save consumers both time and billions of dollars.",
      "To be sure, businesses may still charge additional fees for service, but they must disclose such charges to consumers up-front, rather than burying them in fine print, and \"clearly and conspicuously\" advertise a hotel room or live event ticket's total price including all fees, versus simply displaying a base rate or price, the FTC explained. The total cost also must be displayed more prominently than any other pricing information, the rule stipulates.",
      "Longstanding consumer protection laws prohibit business in other industries from deceiving consumers about fees and pricing.",
      "President Biden weighed in on the FTC's action banning hidden junk fees Tuesday, saying he's prioritized lowering costs for American families.",
      "\"We all know the experience of encountering a hidden fee at the very last stage of check out \u2014these junk fees sneak onto your bill and companies end up making you pay more because they can. Those fees add up, taking real money out of the pockets of Americans,\" he said in a statement. \"Today's announcement builds on work across my administration to ban junk fees and lower costs \u2014 saving many families hundreds of dollars each year.\"",

    "published": "Tue, 17 Dec 2024 11:21:45 -0500",
    "summary": "Republicans wants to extend 2017 tax cuts that expire next year and could let ACA subsidies lapse to help pay the tab, according to analysts.",
    "story": [
      "The Affordable Care Act, also known as Obamacare, remains popular with the public, garnering the approval of 54% of U.S. adults, according to a recently released Gallup poll. But experts say that may not insulate the federal health insurance program from change as President-elect Donald Trump and his fellow Republicans look to renew $4 trillion in expiring tax cuts.",
      "Many provisions of the 2017 Tax Cuts and Jobs Act\u00a0(TCJA), a signature law passed during Trump's first term, are due to sunset at the end of 2025. Republican leaders are now strategizing on how to extend the cuts, while the president-elect has also pledged to slash corporate taxes and eliminate taxes on workers' tips and overtime pay.",
      "But renewing the TCJA tax breaks alone without reducing federal spending would add nearly $4 trillion to the nation's deficit through 2035, according to the Committee for a Responsible Federal Budget, an advocacy group focused on reducing the nation's debt.",
      "Trump has already taken two of the biggest government programs \u2014 Social Security and Medicare \u2014 off the table for potential cuts. Reduced defense spending is also viewed as unlikely, meaning nearly half of federal spending would be protected, Larry Levitt, executive vice president for health policy at KFF (formerly Kaiser Family Foundation,)\u00a0said\u00a0in a recent JAMA article.",
      "That leaves \"Medicaid, which is the next largest source of federal spending, and the ACA as prime targets for spending cuts. The math is inescapable,\" Levitt stated.",
      "Will Trump repeal the ACA?",
      "By contrast, an outright repeal of the ACA is unlikely. While Trump has continued to criticize the health care expansion measure, he has retreated from his previous vows to axe the ACA entirely.",
      "\"President Trump will deliver on his pledge to make his highly successful tax cuts permanent and ease the financial burden on families across the country. He will also end the drain on our health care system so that our country can continue to care for Americans who rely on Medicaid, Medicare and Social Security,\" \u00a0Trump-Vance Transition Spokesperson Anna Kelly told CBS News.",
      "Support for the ACA hit a record\u00a055%\u00a0in 2017, the first time a majority of Americans approved of the health care law since Gallup started asking about it in 2012. That high watermark came a month after failed efforts by then-President Trump and the GOP to repeal and replace the law.",
      "\"The Affordable Care Act is still politically divisive, but overall more popular with the public than ever,\" Levitt told CBS MoneyWatch. \"It's unlikely Republicans will try to repeal the ACA again, but cuts to the ACA and Medicaid are quite possible if Republicans are looking to pay for tax cuts.\"",
      "Brad Ellis, senior director at Fitch Ratings, noted that Trump and Republican lawmakers have expressed interest in changing how the ACA operates, including introducing high-risk participant pools and possibly reducing subsidies for public exchange business. Such changes could hurt enrollment, he said in a recent report.",
      "During the presidential campaign, Trump said he had \"concepts of a plan\" to replace the ACA.",
      "\"Obamacare stinks,\" Trump recently told NBC News' \"Meet the Press. \"If we come up with a better answer, I would present that answer to Democrats and to everybody else and I'd do something about it.\"",
      "Big cuts without lifting a finger",
      "Republicans can make big cuts to the ACA simply by standing pat. That's because enhanced ACA premium subsidies, which were enacted after President Biden was elected and the Democrats took control of Congress, are scheduled to lapse along with the 2017 tax cuts at the end of 2025. The drop in financial aid ACA enrollees would increase out-of-pocket premiums by an average of $705 a year, or 79%, according to a KFF\u00a0analysis.",
      "The Congressional Budget Office\u00a0projects that letting the additional ACA subsidies expire would reduce the federal deficit by $335 billion over a decade, relative to extending them permanently.",
      "Enrollment in the ACA nearly doubled to a record 21 million after the enhanced subsidies went into effect. The CBO estimates that 6.9 million fewer people would be enrolled in ACA Marketplace plans without the subsidies, and 3.4 million more would be uninsured.",
      "The impact would be felt nationwide, but particularly in Southern states that have not expanded Medicaid eligibility under the ACA, according to Levitt, who noted that the five states with the fastest growth in ACA enrollment since 2020 are Georgia, Mississippi, South Carolina, Tennessee and Texas.",
      "\"Health care was not a big topic during the campaign, so I can imagine that voters could be surprised to see cuts to Medicaid and the ACA that they didn't hear about during the campaign,\" Levitt said. \"As frustrated as people are with the current state of health insurance, disrupting the status quo makes them nervous.\"",
      "Medicaid a target for cuts?",
      "Medicaid accounts for more than $600 billion a year in federal spending and covers 81 million people, according to KFF.",
      "\"There are indications that support for Medicaid will decrease under the new administration, suggesting lower enrollment and revenue headwinds for this program,\" stated Fitch's Ellis.",
      "Trump was silent on Medicaid during the 2024 campaign, but his budget proposals during his first administration included a\u00a0plan to cap federal spending on Medicaid. The Project 2025 plan prepared by the Heritage Foundation and a coalition of conservative groups, is recommending changes to Medicaid including a limit on federal spending.",
      "\"The centerpiece of several prominent plans \u2014 Project 2025, the Republican Study Committee fiscal year 2025 (RSC) budget and the fiscal year 2025 House GOP budget resolution \u2014 is to cap and deeply cut federal Medicaid funding,\" Edwin Park, a research professor at the Georgetown University McCourt School of Public Policy's Center for Children and Families, noted in September.",
      "Trump sought distance himself from Project 2025 in the months leading up to the election, criticizing some of its policy proposal as \"abysmal.\"",
      "But Levitt said the ACA and Medicaid could still end up facing cuts as the Republicans, who will control the White House and both houses of Congress, hash out their fiscal plans after President-elect Trump assumes office.",
      "\"So much depends on whether there is pressure to pay for tax cuts with spending reductions. If Republicans are willing to cut taxes and increase the deficit, we may not see big cuts to the ACA and Medicaid,\" said Levitt. \"There are Republicans who may insist on spending cuts to offset tax cuts. If that's the case, the ACA and Medicaid are very likely to be on the chopping block.\"",

      "When TikTok challenged the law in May, it argued that it never had a choice between divestment or a ban because a forced sale \"is simply not possible: not commercially, not technologically, not legally.\" The Chinese government vowed to block the sale of TikTok's algorithm which tailors content recommendations to each user.

    "story": [
      "At state capitols across the U.S. Tuesday, the presidential electors will be gathering to cast their electoral votes, formalizing President-elect Donald Trump's victory over Vice President Kamala Harris in the 2024 election.",
      "It's largely a ceremonial vote, the next step after the presidential election. When Americans cast their ballots on Election Day, they're technically voting for a slate electors committed to supporting their choice for president and vice president.",
      "How does the Electoral College work?",
      "The rules governing the\u00a0Electoral College are outlined\u00a0by the 12th Amendment.",
      "Presidential electors, according to the amendment, \"shall name in their ballots the person voted for as President, and in distinct ballots the person voted for as Vice-President, and they shall make distinct lists of all persons voted for as President, and of all persons voted for as Vice-President, and of the number of votes for each, which lists they shall sign and certify.\"",
      "The political parties choose the slate of electors ahead of the general election.",
      "After Election Day, all the votes are counted and then certified by each state. According to the 2022 Electoral Count Reform Act, the deadline to certify the results is set at six days before the electors are scheduled to meet, traditionally on the first Tuesday after the second Wednesday in December.",
      "The Electoral Count Reform Act of 2022 also requires that each state determine a state official \u2014 the governor unless specified otherwise \u2014 to be responsible for submitting the \"certificate of ascertainment\" that identifies the state's electors and includes a security feature.",
      "What were the 2024 Electoral College results?",
      "Trump won 312 Electoral College votes to Harris' 226. See state-by-state results here and below.",
      "Nationally, Trump also won the popular vote, winning 77.2 million votes to Harris' 75 million.",
      "How many electoral votes does each state have?",
      "The Electoral College consists of 538 electors, and a majority of 270 is needed to become president.",
      "Each state's electoral votes are equal to the number of representatives they have in the House, plus two senators.",
      "While the number of Electoral College votes has remained at 538 since 1964, the number of votes per state changes to match congressional apportionment after the decennial census. Between the 2020 election and the 2024 election, Texas gained two Electoral College votes, while five other states \u2014 Colorado, Florida, Montana, North Carolina and Oregon \u2014 gained one electoral vote each. Six states lost an electoral vote: California, Illinois, Ohio, Michigan, New York, Pennsylvania and West Virginia.",
      "The map below shows the changes by state between the 2020 election and the 2024 election.",
      "Does each elector have to vote with the state election results?",
      "Forty-eight states and Washington, D.C., are winner-take-all, so the winner of the popular vote in the state wins all of the state's electoral votes. Maine and Nebraska allocate their electors based on the winner of the popular vote within each Congressional District and then two \"at-large\" electors are determined based on winner of the statewide popular vote.",
      "The electors are supposed to vote in accordance with the outcome of the popular vote in their state. The Constitution does not require electors to vote with the winner of the popular vote, but most states have laws that nullify the votes of \"faithless electors.\" The Supreme Court ruled in 2020 that states can punish these \"faithless electors.\"",
      "According to FairVote, there have been 90 \"deviant\" votes cast by electors for president since the founding of the Electoral College, although the majority of these were due to the death of a party's nominee rather than a true deviation from the voters' intent.",
      "There have also been 75 faithless electors for vice president, for a total of 165 faithless electors throughout history, according to FairVote.",
      "After the 2020 election, so-called \"fake\"\u00a0Republican electors in seven battleground states won by President Biden met anyway and cast phony votes for Trump. State criminal charges have been filed against fake electors in Georgia, Michigan and Nevada. In charging Trump for attempting the overturn the election results, special counsel Jack Smith said these fake electors were part of a plan to overturn the election, orchestrated by pro-Trump attorneys with Trump's support. Those charges\u00a0have been dismissed since Trump's victory in the 2024 election.",
      "What's next after the Electoral College certification?",

      "The president-elect didn't offer evidence for his claim, and declined to comment on whether he's been provided an intelligence briefing on the matter. He said the federal government should let the public know what it's learned about the situation.",
      "On Monday night, the Department of Homeland Security, FBI, Federal Aviation Administration and Defense Department said in a joint statement, \"Having closely examined the technical data and tips from concerned citizens, we assess that the sightings to date include a combination of lawful commercial drones, hobbyist drones, and law enforcement drones, as well as manned fixed-wing aircraft, helicopters, and stars mistakenly reported as drones. We have not identified anything anomalous and do not assess the activity to date to present a national security or public safety risk over the civilian airspace in New Jersey or other states in the northeast.\"",
      "Trump made his comments in a lengthy exchange with reporters Monday at his Mar-a-Lago estate in Florida. Drone sightings in New Jersey, New York, Pennsylvania and other states along the East Coast have sparked concern from local officials who want answers about the drones, some of which have been located near military installations.",
      "\"The government knows what is happening,\" Trump claimed, although the extent of the government's knowledge is unknown. \"Look, our military knows where they took off from. If it's a garage, they can go right into that garage. They know where it came from and where it went. And for some reason, they don't want to comment. And I think they'd be better off saying what it is. our military knows and our president knows. And for some reason, they want to keep people in suspense.\"",
      "Trump said he \"can't imagine it's the enemy\" behind the drones. He also said the drone sightings are near his Bedminster golf club in New Jersey, where he often spends the warmer months.",
      "\"For some reason, they don't want to tell the people, and they should,\" he continued. \"Because the people are really, I mean, they happen to be over Bedminster. They're very close to Bedminster. I think maybe I won't spend the weekend in Bedminster. I've decided to cancel my trip.\"",

      "Japanese tech conglomerate SoftBank plans to invest $100 billion in the U.S. and create 100,000 jobs in artificial intelligence and technology, President-elect Donald Trump announced Monday at Mar-a-Lago alongside SoftBank CEO Masayoshi Son.",
      "\"Today, I am thrilled to announce that SoftBank will be investing $100 billion America, creating 100,000 American jobs at a minimum,\" Trump said, adding that Son was announcing the investment \"because he feels very optimistic about our country since the election.\"",
      "The investment \"will help insure that artificial intelligence, emerging technologies and other industries of tomorrow are built, created right here in the U.S.A.,\" Trump said.",
      "\"I\"m very, very excited,\" Son said. \"I would really like to celebrate the great victory of President Trump. And my confidence level to the economy of the United States has tremendously increased with his victory.\"",
      "During their announcement, Trump asked Son to double the investment.",
      "\"I'm going to ask him right now, will you make it $200 billion, believe it or not, he can actually afford to do that,\" Trump said. Son responded, \"With your leadership and my parternship and your support, I will try to make it happen.\"",
      "After Trump's 2016 victory, the two announced his firm would invest $50 billion in the U.S. Tokyo-based SoftBank is an investment company that focuses on financial, tech and energy companies.",
      "Trump has touted other investments from major foreign companies that didn't pan out during his presidency. In 2017, he\u00a0announced\u00a0that Taiwanese electronics maker Foxconn \u2014 known for manufacturing Apple's iPhone and iPod devices \u2014 would build a $10 billion campus in Wisconsin in exchange for billions in tax incentives. The venture was forecast to employ more than 10,000 people, bringing high-paying tech jobs to the Midwestern state.",
      "Trump heralded the major tech partnership as \"transformational\" and the \"eighth wonder of the world.\" But seven years later, that vision has \u2014 so far \u2014 failed to flourish. Foxconn did build a small plant on the site, but far smaller than the one Trump and Foxconn initially announced.",
      "In 2019, the campus was scaled back to a \"research hub\" that employed far fewer people than initially promised. The effort instead ended up employing about 1,000 workers,\u00a0according\u00a0to the Milwaukee Journal Sentinel. Wisconsin, for its part,\u00a0said\u00a0in 2020 it would scale back its promise of billions in tax credits, given that Foxconn had failed to deliver on its original plan.",
      "Meanwhile, another major tech company \u2014 Microsoft \u2014 stepped in to fill some of the gap left by Foxconn. In 2024, Microsoft\u00a0said\u00a0it would build a $3.3 billion data center on on 315 acres adjacent to where Foxconn had planned to construct its campus. Microsoft expects its first building on its new Wisconsin site to be completed in 2026,\u00a0according\u00a0to the Milwaukee Journal Sentinel.",
      "Trump made the SoftBank announcement Monday in a statement to the press that turned into extended remarks about his economic plans. Trump pledged to make more tax cuts, even beyond the ones he and Congress enacted in 2017. Trump said any company that invests at least $1 billion in the U.S. will be eligible for fully expedited permit approvals, including environmental approvals, Trump said.",
      "\"This will be the most exciting and successful period of reform and renewal in all of American history, maybe of global history, the golden age of America, I call it, it's begun,\" Trump said.",

      "Orb\u00e1n, an authoritarian leader with ties to Russia, met with Trump at Mar-a-Lago last week, along with Waltz and Elon Musk. Days after the meeting, Orb\u00e1n announced that he had spoken to Russian President Vladimir Putin, saying that \"we are taking every possible diplomatic step to argue in favor of a ceasefire\" and peace talks. He later appeared to float a Christmas ceasefire and a prisoner swap between Russia and Ukraine.",

Waltz said that since Trump's victory in the election, the framework of discussion with world leaders surrounding the war between Russia and Ukraine has shifted to talk of how the conflict comes to an end.",
      "\"How do we end this conflict? How do we do it in a way that restores stability, stops the carnage, and hopefully makes this a permanent end, not just a pause?\" Waltz said. \"Those are all things that we're thinking through.\"",

      "And we need to take a hard look at our homeland defenses. President Trump has talked about an Iron Dome for America. That needs to include drones as well, not just adversarial actions like hypersonic missiles.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Yes.",
      "REPRESENTATIVE MIKE WALTZ: We need to have an all-of-the-above protection of U.S. airspace.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Understood.",
      "Let \u2013 let me ask you about China. The president-elect said a few things in the past week about China, and he said his team has been talking and discussing, as he put it, with China's President Xi Jinping.",
      "CBS was the first to report that an invitation was extended to the inauguration, though we do not expect Xi to come. Was that the extent of the back-and-forth? Do the two leaders intend to speak by phone?",
      "REPRESENTATIVE MIKE WALTZ: Well, Margaret, it's been amazing.",
      "I mean, the entire world is reaching out to the president. In fact, it's been a little overwhelming, the outreach, not only to speak with him, to congratulate him, but to even come to the inauguration themselves. So, the outreach has been tremendous.",
      "President Trump is taking all calls. As you know, he believes in having a relationship with allies and adversaries at that kind of head-of-state level. And those conversations \u2013 those conversations are ongoing, but they are really nothing beyond congratulatory and niceties.",
      "We are in communication with the current administration. We don't agree on all things, but, as I have said before, none of our adversaries should think this is a moment to take advantage of this transition. We don't agree with all things, but we are in full coordination with the current administration.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Well, China, you said there should be consequences because of their massive and pervasive hack of eight U.S. telecom companies, which has breached the metadata of potentially millions of Americans.",
      "Senator Marco Rubio said it was egregious, dangerous, and a vulnerability that no one anticipated.",
      "You're going to be working together. What do you plan for the consequences to be?",
      "REPRESENTATIVE MIKE WALTZ: Yes.",
      "I think Senator Rubio, and hopefully future Secretary of State Rubio, is absolutely right. We are \u2013 we have been over the years trying to play better and better defense when it comes to cyber.",
      "We need to start going on offense and start imposing, I think, higher costs and consequences to private actors and nation-state actors that continue to steal our data, that continue to spy on us, and that, even worse, with the Volt Typhoon penetration, that are literally putting cyber time bombs on our infrastructure, our water systems, our grids, even our ports.",
      "That is wholly unacceptable, and I think we need to take a much stronger stance. Senator Rubio is right. President Trump has indicated that as well. We need to start changing behaviors on the other side, rather than just constantly having this kind of escalation of their offense and our defense.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Yes.",
      "REPRESENTATIVE MIKE WALTZ: The Colonial Pipeline hack was another key point.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Yes.",
      "REPRESENTATIVE MIKE WALTZ: And then, finally, we've got a tremendous private sector with a lot of capability. That relationship between public and private, with our tech industry, they could be doing a lot of good and helping\u2026",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: So, is this sanctions?",
      "REPRESENTATIVE MIKE WALTZ: \u2026 us defend, but also making our adversaries vulnerable.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Is it sanctions day one from the Trump administration?",
      "REPRESENTATIVE MIKE WALTZ: Well, I'm not going to get ahead of everything that we're doing day one.",
      "But taking a different approach to cyber, looking at our doctrine, and starting to impose costs on the other side to get them to knock this off is something we'll be taking a look at, I think.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: You were at Mar-a-Lago this past week when Hungary's Prime Minister Viktor Orban met with Mr. Trump and Elon Musk and yourself.",
      "He then announced that he had spoken to Vladimir Putin. Orban seems to be floating a Christmas cease-fire and a prisoner swap. Is he carrying with him some kind of message from Donald Trump?",
      "REPRESENTATIVE MIKE WALTZ: Well, Orban has regular engagement with the Russians, and he clearly has a good relationship with President Trump.",
      "And I would hope the entire world would want to see some type of cessation to the slaughter that is happening in Eastern Ukraine. I mean, Margaret, people need to understand\u2026",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Did Mr. Trump ask him to do that?",
      "REPRESENTATIVE MIKE WALTZ: \u2026 this is World War I-style \u2013 this is World War I-style warfare. It is a meat grinder of human beings.",
      "President Trump's been very concerned about the carnage that's ongoing. And where is this all going?",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Right.",
      "REPRESENTATIVE MIKE WALTZ: We need to stop the fighting. And, you know, look, if that is some type of cease-fire as a first step, again, we'll \u2013 we'll take a hard look at what that means.",
      "But, until January 20, we are also in coordination with this current administration.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: OK, so no message was sent through Orban to Putin by Trump? Is that \u2013 that's what I understand you saying there?",
      "REPRESENTATIVE MIKE WALTZ: Oh, I'm not going to \u2013 yes, I'm not going to get into specifics of back-and-forths.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: OK.",
      "REPRESENTATIVE MIKE WALTZ: But one is talking. Of course, we're going to continue to talk. And President Trump's made it clear he wants this war to stop.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Does the Trump team plan to limit how Ukraine can use U.S. weapons or targeting assistance when you take office?",
      "REPRESENTATIVE MIKE WALTZ: Well, President Trump just said in the interview that, you know, a blank check \u2013 in his interview with \"TIME\" magazine, I believe, you know, a blank check isn't \u2013 you know, just isn't a strategy, this just kind of forever war that we seem to be backing into.",
      "What does success look like in line with our interests? How do we end the war? Who's at the table? How do we drive, you know, all sides to the table? And what's the framework for \u2013 for an agreement? Those are things that we're thinking through with his fantastic team that he's assembling.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Was that discussed in that 45-minute meeting that Mr. Trump had with Mr. Zelenskyy in Paris last week? And do you support putting NATO member states as peacekeepers in Ukraine?",
      "REPRESENTATIVE MIKE WALTZ: Well, you know, what's been so interesting, Margaret, is, just since the election, everyone coming to us, our European allies, President Zelenskyy in that meeting, and others, have shifted to how to \u2013 that framework I just talked about.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Yes.",
      "REPRESENTATIVE MIKE WALTZ: How do we end this conflict? How do we do it in a way that restores stability, stops the carnage, and hopefully makes this a permanent end, not just \u2013 not just a pause?",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Mm-hmm.",
      "REPRESENTATIVE MIKE WALTZ: Those are all things that we're thinking through.",
      "And in terms of the question you just asked, the NATO secretary-general came here to Mar-a-Lago.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Right.",
      "REPRESENTATIVE MIKE WALTZ: He's talking about the Europeans taking a bigger role in \u2013 whether that's on the ground or otherwise, after this conflict is over, and that's exactly what President Trump has been asking for.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: I have to quickly ask you about the Middle East.",
      "During the last Trump administration, Donald Trump pulled some U.S. troops out of Syria. Does he intend to keep the 900 U.S. troops there?",
      "REPRESENTATIVE MIKE WALTZ: Look, our number one interest is keeping a lid on ISIS. We cannot have an explosion of ISIS back into a caliphate that threatens Iraq, threatens Jordan, threatens Turkey and Europe, inspires attacks in the United States, like we saw in 2014.",
      "President Trump cleaned it up then with his team. Thousands of ISIS fighters are in prison camps. We're in consultation with the Israelis as well. They're, importantly, taking down Assad's chemical stockpiles, as well as other things we don't want falling into the hands of anybody.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Mm-hmm.",
      "REPRESENTATIVE MIKE WALTZ: And, you know, the other piece there that he asked for in the first term and that we need to see is, again, Europe, who was hit so badly by ISIS attacks, taking a greater role in keeping ISIS contained.",
      "So those are all conversations that we're having, again, in consultation with the current administration.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Yes.",
      "REPRESENTATIVE MIKE WALTZ: And we'll see moving forward.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Congressman Mike Waltz, thank you for joining us today.",
      "Face the Nation will be back in a minute. Stay with us.",
      "(ANNOUNCEMENTS)",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: And we're joined now by Minnesota Democratic Senator Amy Klobuchar.",
      "Good to have you here.",
      "SENATOR AMY KLOBUCHAR (D-Minnesota): Great to be back on, Margaret. Thanks.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Well, Senator, I do want to ask you about these drones on the East Coast, because we looked at your record, and you actually cosponsored legislation a few years ago trying to expand authorities to deal with them.",
      "Why do you need an act of Congress to deal with this? And why didn't the Democrats move on it?",
      "SENATOR AMY KLOBUCHAR: Well, first of all, the administration has repeatedly assured people that they are safe.",
      "However, one, we need a briefing for the members of the Senate to figure out what's going on here. Two, we need more transparency. And, three, I appreciated some of the congressman's words, because what he was talking about is, we need to have a \u2013 new regulatory rules in place here.",
      "Right now, you have to register a drone if it's over a half-pound, and there are penalties if you don't do that. Well, I think we have to make sure that regime is enforced with local and state authorities. And then we have got to figure out, do we really want all these drones?",
      "Because while these may be safe, who knows what happens in the future? And they have to be within 400 feet. So, these things are going to be, what, flying over people's family picnics and over their homes and over beaches? Like, this is not going to be a good future if we see too many of these.",
      "So, I think \u2013 I was pleased that he said he wanted to move forward on some rules and finding a way to regulate these in a better way, because this just can't be no one knows why this huge drone is right over their house.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: So you might bring this up in the new Con \u2013 Republican controlled-Senate?",
      "SENATOR AMY KLOBUCHAR: Yes.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Moving on, you sit on the Judiciary Committee.",
      "So you're going to have a key role in overseeing law enforcement under the Trump administration. And you will get to question his selectee to run the FBI, Kash Patel, who has published in his book a list of enemies, vowed retribution.",
      "I want to play something for you that Republican Senator Murkowski said just a few days ago.",
      "(Begin VT)",
      "SENATOR LISA MURKOWSKI (R-Alaska): The approach is going to be, everybody, toe the line. Everybody, line up, we got you here, and if you want to survive, you better be good. Don't get on Santa's naughty list here, because we will primary you.",
      "(End VT)",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: That is a remarkable thing for a Republican senator to say on the record as clearly as she said. She said they are being threatened if they don't get in line and vote for some of these nominees.",
      "Are you getting the sense from your Republican colleagues on judiciary they will get in line and vote through Kash Patel?",
      "SENATOR AMY KLOBUCHAR: Sadly, there is some of that going on, but then you have other people, like Lisa Murkowski, who has always been a thoughtful, independent voice.",
      "She believes her job is to do what our Constitution tells us, advice and consent, and also that we take an oath to support and defend the Constitution of the United States. So, we have to do our due diligence and make decisions.",
      "I voted for a number of the past Trump nominees for many different jobs. I looked at them and decided if I thought they were qualified, and could they perform the mission of the agency and did they have integrity? That's what has to happen here.",
      "And so, when you look at someone like Kash Patel, who would be replacing Christopher Wray, who I believe embodied \u2013 he was a Trump appointee, went through Biden, and embodied the mission of the FBI, which is fidelity, bravery, integrity.",
      "And so now you have someone who says he's on a revenge mission, when we should be on a national security, safety mission here, when we look at cybersecurity attacks that you just talked to \u2013 with the congressman about and various other things.",
      "He says he wants to dismantle the FBI headquarters and turn it into a museum. To me, this is not the direction we need to go. So I appreciate Senator Murkowski's words and also her demand and other Republicans. It's going to be their decisions on these nominees. We may vote against them or for them.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Right.",
      "SENATOR AMY KLOBUCHAR: But, in the end, it's their decisions.",
      "Her demand for FBI reports and making sure that these are not recess appointments and there must be open hearings.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Right, because they have enough votes, essentially, to move on these on their own.",
      "I want to ask you about President Biden. This past week, he had this record number of commutations, 1,500 Americans, more than any president in any single day. Among them, though, there was a judge involved in a so-called cash-for-kids scheme that sent thousands of kids to jail\u2026",
      "SENATOR AMY KLOBUCHAR: Did not like that one, no.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: \u2026 for millions of dollars.",
      "SENATOR AMY KLOBUCHAR: Mm-hmm.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: A man who committed tax fraud\u2026",
      "SENATOR AMY KLOBUCHAR: Mm-hmm.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: \u2026 at a cost of more than $1.6 billion, described as the most prolific, pernicious, utterly unrepentant tax cheat in U.S. history. A woman who was involved in a $26 million scheme to defraud Medicare.",
      "Are you comfortable with some of these decisions?",
      "SENATOR AMY KLOBUCHAR: No. There's also a man in Duluth that was running a major drug house, basically, and had all this money under his bathroom tiles, was also commuted.",
      "So, the way I look at this is, I also didn't agree with the pardon of the president's son.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Mm-hmm.",
      "SENATOR AMY KLOBUCHAR: I also have not agreed with the number of pardons that President Trump gave.",
      "So, I believe, and I have long advocated for this, that, while the pardon ability is part of our Constitution, we're not going to change that, right?",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Mm-hmm.",
      "SENATOR AMY KLOBUCHAR: Go way back to President Lincoln, who made hard decisions himself about deserters from the Army, things like that. That's been going on a long time.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Right.",
      "SENATOR AMY KLOBUCHAR: But we should have some kind of an outside board that governors have. Governors have the ability to give mercy to people after years have gone by.",
      "But a lot of them have boards that make recommendations and other things, instead of people just doing it in the middle of the night and people in the White House.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Right.",
      "SENATOR AMY KLOBUCHAR: This makes no sense to me.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Well, this is why it was so surprising, because the White House described it as just based on a broad category, and not the specifics of the case.",
      "SENATOR AMY KLOBUCHAR: Exactly.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Was that prudent?",
      "SENATOR AMY KLOBUCHAR: And so I have no doubt there were some righteous pardons in this group, OK, let's say that. I believe that there were.",
      "But there were a number that I think make no sense at all. So, instead of doing a whole category, why don't, in a coming year, before the end of a president's term, if that's when they're mostly going to do these\u2026",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Right.",
      "SENATOR AMY KLOBUCHAR: \u2026 that a board looks at these and looks at them individually, when people petition for them, based on the facts, instead of just in a large group?",
      "So, large groups have been done before, I believe, but I just \u2013 I think that this whole process cries out for reform, because, otherwise, you undermine the justice system.",
      "And, again, I emphasize\u2026",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Yes.",
      "SENATOR AMY KLOBUCHAR: \u2026 this also happened in a big way under President Trump.",
      "And you undermine the work of these line FBI agents, these line prosecutors who have taken on these cases, followed the sentencing guidelines and made a decision. Might you want mercy 10 years later? Yes, you might. But let's at least look at these on a factual basis and a risk basis, instead of just in the middle of the night a month before a president leaves.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Yes.",
      "Senator Klobuchar, thank you for being here today.",
      "SENATOR AMY KLOBUCHAR: It was great to be on. Thank you, Margaret.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: We'll be right back with a lot more Face the Nation. Stay with us.",
      "(ANNOUNCEMENTS)",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: And we're back now with the vice chairman of IBM, Gary Cohn, who also served as the White House economic adviser in President Trump's first term.",
      "Gary, welcome back.",
      "It's expected the Fed is going to cut rates again this week, even though we did see in the economic data released that inflation is still high. President Trump said, can't lower prices once they're high. Seems to be admitting that it's not within the president's remit to control what you spend at the grocery store.",
      "GARY COHN (Former Director, White House National Economic Council): Margaret, thanks for having me.",
      "You're right. So we had two bits of economic data this week. We had consumer prices and we've had producer prices. Both came in on the high side of where economists were hoping. If you look at the consumer prices, we're looking at about 2.7 percent on consumer prices.",
      "Remember, the Fed's target for inflation is about 2 percent.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Right.",
      "GARY COHN: So we're running almost a percent high. Producer prices came in even higher than we were expecting. So we're not down to that target 2 percent, where the Fed would like to get to.",
      "That said, the Fed meting next week. The Fed is highly \u2013 it's highly viewed that the Fed will cut interest rates by 25 basis points next week. That means, over the course of this year, they will have cut interest rates by 100 basis points.",
      "Now, as you look forward into next year, people had projected they would cut a lot more. I think we are seeing the rate of cuts slow down, and slow down quite dramatically, as people are starting to evaluate the economic data that we have.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: So, what does that mean in terms of the economy President Trump will be inheriting?",
      "GARY COHN: So, the president's inheriting a very good economy, a very stable economy. We have real, solid economic growth. We have real job growth. We have real wage growth.",
      "And I think some of the wage growth that we're seeing, we've seen a lot of these union contracts be renegotiated in the second half of this year.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Mm-hmm.",
      "GARY COHN: Those wages feed through the economy. They feed through as inflation.",
      "So, the economy the president's inheriting is quite strong. I think it will continue to stay quite strong. And, in fact, the American consumer today, as well as corporate America, is quite excited about what the Trump administration is talking about, and the business environment is very positive.",
      "Corporate America is talking about a lot of expansion, a lot of capital expenditure for next year, about repatriating more jobs back to the United States, about building more factories in the United States, hiring more workers.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: You think that will actually happen?",
      "GARY COHN: I do think it's going to happen.",
      "So, net-net, we are talking about a very positive business and cycle going forward into 2025.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Is the stock market really the best way to gauge it? You saw Mr. Trump at the stock exchange this past week.",
      "GARY COHN: Well, look, the stock market is one benchmark.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Yes.",
      "GARY COHN: It's a \u2013 it's an index. It's a benchmark.",
      "And, remember, the stock market is an index.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Yes.",
      "GARY COHN: There's a \u2013 there's a huge diversity of what's going on in the stock market. There's some of the tech stocks at the high end\u2026",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Right.",
      "GARY COHN: \u2026 that are performing very, very well.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Right.",
      "GARY COHN: And there's some of the more traditional stocks in the middle of the market that are not performing as well.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: We've got to take a break and finish this conversation on the other side of it.",
      "Stay with us, Gary.",
      "We will be right back.",
      "(ANNOUNCEMENTS)",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Welcome back to FACE THE NATION.",
      "We're continuing our conversation now with Gary Cohn.",
      "Gary, before the break you were telling us the business world has high expectations for the Trump administration. One of the things that Donald Trump promised to do in his second term was lower the corporate tax rate. So, you helped put together the tax plan that's - that's expiring in 20 - or part of it, sorry, expiring in 2025. He said at the New York Stock Exchange this week that he wants it to go down further from 21 percent. He really wanted to get it back down to 15. And we will be able to do that.",
      "Will he be able to do that?",
      "GARY COHN (Vice Chairman, IBM): Look, Margaret, we don't know. You know, look, the whole tax discussion is going to happen over the course of 2025.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Why didn't you do it in 2017?",
      "GARY COHN: In 2017 we did not have the financial wherewithal to do it.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: OK.",
      "GARY COHN: When you go through reconciliation, which is how they will do taxes this time, in 2025, you are given instructions by the - by the Budget Committee. And the instructions are basically how much money you can spend or how much revenue you can take in. This time it will be how much money you can spend.",
      "We did not have additional money to spend. So, the lowest we could get the corporate tax rate at that time was the 21 percent. That's also the reason that the corporate tax part of the tax legislation 2017 expires the end of 2025. To score that piece of legislation, which in the financial requirements we were given by the Senate and the House Finance Committees, we had to end the personal side at the end of 2025.",
      "So, we do know that taxes will be taken out by this Congress in this session. We know that they're going to have to deal with the personal side of the equation because if not the personal side will revert back to the pre-2017 tax code.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Yes.",
      "GARY COHN: That was a very arduous, ugly tax code with much higher rates, with a lot more loopholes, a lot more deductions. I don't think anyone wants - on either side of the aisle wants to go back to the prior tax code.",
      "You know when we open up tax code, even if we're just talking about the personal side, the corporate side will come into play. And there's always this interesting relationship between the personal side and the corporate side because the vast majority of companies in - in the United States are small businesses that file in - on - on a tax return that allows them to pay the personal rate. But there's a difference between the personal rate and the corporate rate. And you want to make sure that those relationships don't get too far out of - out of line with each other -",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Yes.",
      "GARY COHN: So people aren't incentivized to change their corporate structure to become a subchapter s corporation versus a corporation.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: OK.",
      "GARY COHN: So they can take advantage of the tax code. So, there's - there's always a lot of time spent there to make sure that the personal rate and the corporate rate makes sense in relationship to each other.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: I think you said in the past, though, you don't think the corporate rate should go down further.",
      "GARY COHN: Well, the business community as a whole. When we did tax reform in 2017, and whether you look at the Chamber of Commerce, or you look at the business roundtable, you look at any of the business organizations, they were very supportive of a 21 percent tax rate. They, in fact, I think, would have been happy with anything at 23 percent or below, which put us in line with other OECD countries around the world. It made us competitive.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Other developed economies?",
      "GARY COHN: Other developed economies. Obviously, companies will be happier if the tax rate goes lower, but realistically we just need, in this country, to be competitive with the rest of the world. We do not want corporate taxes to be a disadvantage for U.S. domicile companies.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: The pick for Treasury secretary is hedge fund manager Scott Bessent. You may know him. He says he's going to deliver on the Trump tax cut pledges, but that's eliminating taxes on tips, Social Security, overtime pay.",
      "Can he actually deliver on any of that?",
      "GARY COHN: Look, Scott is a - quite an accomplished individual. So, the guy - I know he will put a lot of effort into this. He will have a lot of help with other people. Kevin Hassett, who's going into my old job at the NEC, will have an important seat at the table. Kevin understands a lot of these policies.",
      "There will be a lot of opinions at the table when we get to tax writing. You know, the House and the Senate will have their opinions. Remember, there are members of the House that ran on one item and one item only. They ran on the idea that we should bring back the state and local tax deduction, the SALT deduction. There were also members that ran on being deficit hawks. There were Republicans that ran on thinking that we have built up too much deficit and we need to get our budget under control. We're going to have to find a way -",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: They're not going to like any of these premises.",
      "GARY COHN: I agree with that. But we're going to have to find a way to balance all of these needs and get to a tax plan that makes sense but allows us to continue to drive our economy -",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Yes.",
      "GARY COHN: Continue to drive the economic growth and continue to drive wages and jobs.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Well, you heard the House speaker say some of this may be done through reconciliation, which implies that the Senate isn't going to seek a majority vote here. They're - they're just going to try to put this through with 51 votes, do it in kind of an arcane way.",
      "When is this going to happen? And should it happen before they fix the border?",
      "GARY COHN: Well, it sounds like, from what I'm hearing, and, look, I don't know, this could change any way. There's other people smarter than I deciding on the strategy of this. It sounds like there may be two reconciliation bills. It sounds like the first reconciliation bill, which, you're right, is a bill that allows the Senate to do something in a simple majority.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Yes.",
      "GARY COHN: Budget related only. You can only reconcile a budget. Budget related with a simple majority. It sounds like there may be a first reconciliation bill -",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Yes.",
      "GARY COHN: Which is border related. Where they may take back much of the unspent Inflation Reduction Act money and some of the other money that was appropriated under the Biden administration and use that to close the border.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: And then they'll get to taxes. Got it.",
      "GARY COHN: And then use a second reconciliation bill, because there are two budgets out there.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Right.",
      "GARY COHN: As there were in the Biden administration.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Yes.",
      "GARY COHN: Use that to - to go after taxes and fixing taxes, especially the personal side of taxes that ends in 2025.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Right. That's a big fight to have in the year ahead.",
      "Gary, we'll be talking to you again then.",
      "We've got to take a break.",
      "GARY COHN: Thank you.",
      "(ANNOUNCEMENTS)",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: We're joined now by the Ukrainian ambassador to the United States, Oksana Markarova.",
      "Good to have you back with us.",
      "OKSANA MARKAROVA (Ukrainian Ambassador to the United States): Thank you for having me and blessed Sunday to all.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: No western power, as you know, is sending troops to Ukraine to help Ukrainian forces, but Russia's got North Korean troops now who are fighting on their side. Yesterday, President Zelenskyy said Russia has been using a significant number of North Koreans. How are they fighting?",
      "OKSANA MARKAROVA: Yes. So, and - we are not asking for other troops. Ukrainians are still capable of defending our own country. We're asking for the military support.",
      "Yesterday we have seen those tens of thousands of troops that we were warning the world about. We have seen hundreds of them on the battlefield already. And we are successfully fighting with them as we are fighting with the Russians. I mean, look, we - we see them now in (INAUDIBLE) only, and our great defenders were not only able to kill a lot of them, but also keep the positions.",
      "So, it's difficult, of course, to see the reinforcement from this access of evil, but it will not change anything for us. We will continue defending the very long line, whether it's in southern eastern Ukraine or whether it's our defensive operation in Kusk (ph).",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: And in the meantime, the North Korean troops are getting trained in modern warfare and they're learning in Ukraine - I mean right there.",
      "OKSANA MARKAROVA: Absolutely. And we also have to worry about what is it that Russia is promising or even delivering to North Korea in exchange for this.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Right. Yes.",
      "OKSANA MARKAROVA: And Korean missiles.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: But I also raise the manpower issue because it's a problem for Ukraine as well. Military recruitment is tough right now in Ukraine. There has been pressure on your government by the United States to lower the draft age so that you can boost the number of fighters. This is arguably a bigger issue than the weaponry itself. Is it affecting the ability of Ukraine to keep up the fight?",
      "OKSANA MARKAROVA: I wouldn't agree that it's a bigger issue than the equipment itself. We still have - first of all, we have a number of young people fighting for Ukraine. And they are volunteering. And women are volunteering. Ukraine is one of the countries that lifted all restrictions for women, for example, and we have 60,000 of women in the armed forces.",
      "With the recruitment, the last changes to the law of mobilization, already allowed us to create new brigades, which we are training now. And the problem is to have enough equipment to train them on so that we can actually not send to the battlefield like Russians do, right, unprepared, whether it's North Koreans who are unprepared, or Russians, but to send soldiers who can do and deliver on a mission. And it's very important for us because every person matters for Ukrainians.",
      "Of course there are challenges. And we have the plan and we know how to do it because, again, this is our home we are defending. So, when it's necessary, all of us are going to be defending our country. But weapons and having more weapons, especially long range, especially something to counter this 3,000 glide bombs every month that Russians are sending against us, those missiles, both Russian and North Korean missiles.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Yes.",
      "OKSANA MARKAROVA: I mean it's still a question of artillery and weapons and air defense most importantly. And the more we can have, the faster we can - the more efficiently we can defend.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Well, I - the Biden administration has been releasing more weapons just in the last week alone, but Donald Trump gave an interview to \"Time Magazine\" and he said the United States is escalating by allowing for weapons - missiles to be shot into Russian territory. He specifically focused in on that. He does not like that Ukraine is doing it. What does that mean for you on day one of the Trump administration?",
      "OKSANA MARKAROVA: Well, let me say - start by saying thank you to all American people, really, for standing with us all this time. Let me thank President Biden and his administration for all the support. Let me thank President Trump. He is the one who made a historic decision to provide us with Javelins, actually to provide us with lethal aid in the first place.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Back in 2017.",
      "OKSANA MARKAROVA: Yes. So, right now we have to do everything in order to stop Russia, and we know it's - it could be stopped. It was recently stopped in Syria. We liberated more than 50 percent that they have taken. We actually kicked them out from the Black Sea just with our own naval drone capabilities. They could - they - they - we can stop them. The more equipment we have, especially including the longer-range equipment, in order to be able to degrade their attack capabilities faster, the faster they will either come to the table because, again, Ukraine wants peace.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Yes.",
      "OKSANA MARKAROVA: Nobody wants peace more than us. Ukraine was never a problem. We never initiated this conflict. And we negotiated at the first sight, remember in 2022 when Russians started negotiations. They, of course, did not negotiated peace. They negotiated the pause.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Right.",
      "OKSANA MARKAROVA: As we just heard Congressman Waltz, who absolutely rightfully said, it has to be peace, not a pause.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: He was careful. He didn't give a lot of specifics as to what the Trump policy will be. But we do know that Viktor Orbon was at Mar- a-Lago this past week and he talks to Vladimir Putin and he's talking about a Christmas pause. Do you see a chance for a Christmas ceasefire and prisoner exchange?",
      "OKSANA MARKAROVA: This is very difficult winter. After Russia destroyed our - a lot of our energy infrastructure and after, you know, we are going through this difficult fight, both on the front line but also civilians suffering from the deadly missile attacks.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Just this past week.",
      "OKSANA MARKAROVA: Yes. At the same time, you know, every time Russia is talking about some ceasefire, they are lying. Russians are lying.",
      "And we see they were not able to defend their buddy - terrorist buddy Assad and he fled to Russia. And we see horrible atrocities in Saydnaya prison, like we see in Ukraine everywhere.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Yes.",
      "OKSANA MARKAROVA: It reminded me, isolation prison in Denesk, which still is operational.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Right.",
      "OKSANA MARKAROVA: So, look, you know, if Russia wants seriously to stop it, they can stop it at any time.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Yes. OK.",
      "Ambassador, I have to leave it there. Thank you so much for joining us.",

And just like that, the fear of saying something that might get you arrested was gone. The Islamist fighters who had seized power a week ago were partying, too. In the main suuk (ph), shoppers walked on Assad's face. While at Saydnaya Prison, where his critics were tortured and killed, crowds poured in to what Syrians used to call the slaughterhouse.",

      "CINDY MCCAIN (Executive Director, U.N. World Food Programme): Well, our deliveries so far have been very - very smooth. But we need more delivery options open, which is what this was eluding to.",
      "More importantly, we have been able to get 70,000 people fed this - this month so far, but we need more. And - and, more importantly, we need the funds to do it. That's where we're lacking.",
      "You know, WFP never left Syria. We've always been in there. But now we need more routes, more ability to get in and to get not just more trucks but more people in so that we can help in the best way we can.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: The U.S. still has some sanctions on Syria, but they do let in U.N. humanitarian aid. There was a call in Congress, a bipartisan one this week, for the United States to lift some sanctions. Are you experiencing U.S. sanctions getting in your way at this point?",
      "CINDY MCCAIN: Not really. We've - we've been able to, as - as you said, we've been able to move our goods through our food items, et cetera, through and get it to where it needs to go in a safe and quick manner as well. But - but I - I don't - I will never under state - under - under estimate the process with things that could - it could infringe us later on. So, I'm hoping that things stay calm, that we can move our goods, again, in a safe and secure manner and do it at full scale. If we can't work at scale, we can't feed.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: And you said you're short on funds. How much do you need?",
      "CINDY MCCAIN: Oh, worldwide, I could use 17 billion right now if you want to know the truth. There's so much - there's so many - many countries that have absolutely no access to any funding, no one's paying any - any attention to it.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: So, why did you say funding is down? People are just not paying attention?",
      "CINDY MCCAIN: Yes, countries are - are rerouting their funding in different ways. They're choosing to fund things in different manners or not to fund at all. And I'm asking now. I'm asking on your show worldwide to please consider once again giving to Syria because people in Syria will starve to death without it. And - and we've seen the evidence of great hunger there.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: You know, you and I have spoken in the past on this program about the U.S. contributing so generously to the U.N., the largest funder, arguably the most important partner to the United Nations.",
      "CINDY MCCAIN: Yes.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: And you had encouraged Beijing to really kind of step up their game. And you had said there was somewhat of a lack of willingness to be a part of working together as a team worldwide.",
      "Have you seen any change to that?",
      "CINDY MCCAIN: Not much. I encourage all countries to get involved, including China. We need help from everybody.",
      "The world is on fire right now, and hunger - hunger is at the forefront of all of this. And most importantly, you know, when people are hungry, this becomes a national security issue. And so it affects not only the countries that it's affecting, but it affects us worldwide. And it does affect national security. So, it's important that every country worldwide get involved and be involved in this.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: So, I want to ask you about Sudan. I know you were recently there. It's in the midst of a brutal civil war. The U.S. has accused both sides of ethnic cleansing. Can you keep trucks going into Sudan to feed people there?",
      "CINDY MCCAIN: Oh, it's such a complicated situation. We - right now we have 30 some convoys on the road going into Sudan to hit the various places that we need to get to, but we need more. Certainly Darfur has been a big issue, but we have other parts of the country that are just as needy and where - where famine does exist. As you know, it's been declared there. And we need - we need also to be able to come through Khartoum and make sure that we can - can access from that direction as well.",
      "It's been a slow process, but we have been able to get in. But we need more. Again, food security is national security. Don't ever forget that. Because if people are insecure from a food - from a food reality, they're not going to behave well. And things - they start to migrate. Wars begin that way. Conflict is a part of all of this.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: I'd be remiss to not ask you about what's going on in Gaza. Jake Sullivan, President Biden's national security adviser, said this week the U.S. has stood up to Prime Minister Netanyahu to say let's make sure that Israel is not responsible for the third famine of the 21st century. Are we at famine in Gaza?",
      "CINDY MCCAIN: We're very close to it. We've seen the effects of it. We've seen what's - what's going on.",
      "Listen, this - we're in the month of November. WFP has been able to get two trucks in. That's all. Two trucks in the month of November. And, you know, and, of course, now we're into December. This whole - this while issue of not being able to get in is - is unseemly. We need unfettered access. We need a cease-fire. And we need it now. We can't - there's - we can no longer sit by and just allow these people to starve to death. We need help and we need to make sure that we put political pressure on those that need to have political pressure put on them.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: We've seen images of - of crowds just crushing people amassing at bakeries in Gaza. Ninety percent of the population cannot return to their homes. They're displaced. Only four bakeries are operational for nearly 2 million people. This is manmade.",
      "CINDY MCCAIN: It is manmade. You're absolutely right, it is manmade. And - and, more importantly, the world needs to take a hard look at this and realize that not just \u2013 not just do they need food, but we need access. And that targeting of humanitarian aid workers is unconscionable. We need to get in and do our job. And - and more importantly, in all of this, make sure that we can feed. People - children especially are starving to death. I mean the height of malnutrition, the height of hunger within - within that region is - is unbelievably horrible. And so we've seen be it firsthand. And I - I, as the leader of the largest humanitarian aid agency in the world, are - I'm calling for a ceasefire. And I want my aid - my fellow partners within this arena to call for the same thing.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Understood. You used the word targeted. Who's targeting your workers?",
      "CINDY MCCAIN: Well, there's lots of things that are going on there. There's gangs that are running - if we're speaking directly about Gaza, it's gangs that's running around. It's the lawlessness.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Director McCain, I know you have a lot of need you're looking for. Seventeen billion is the number you are asking for.",
      "CINDY MCCAIN: Yes.",

      "The following is a transcript of an interview with Gary Cohn, IBM vice chairman and first Trump administration economic adviser, on \"Face the Nation with Margaret Brennan\" that aired on Dec. 15, 2024.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Gary, and we're back now with the Vice Chairman of IBM Gary Cohn, who also served as the White House Economic Advisor in President Trump's first term. Gary, welcome back. It's expected the Fed is going to cut rates again this week, even though we did see in the economic data released that inflation is still high. President Trump said, can't lower prices once they're high. Seems to be admitting that it's not within the President's remit to control what you spend at the grocery store.",
      "GARY COHN: \u00a0 Margaret, thanks for having me. You're right. So we had two bits of economic data this week. We had consumer prices and we've had producer prices. Both came in on the high side of where economists were hoping. If you look at the consumer prices, we're looking at about 2.7% on consumer prices. Remember, the Fed's target for inflation is about 2%, so we're running almost a percent high. Producer prices came in even higher than we were expecting. So we're not down to that target 2% where the Fed would like to get to. That said, the Fed meting next week. The Fed is highly- it's highly viewed that the Fed will cut interest rates by 25 basis points next week. That means, over the course of this year, they will have cut interest rates by 100 basis points. Now, as you look forward into next year, people had projected they would cut a lot more. I think we are seeing the rate of cuts slow down, and slow down quite dramatically as people are starting to evaluate the economic data that we have.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: So what does that mean in terms of the economy President Trump will be inheriting?",
      "COHN: \u00a0 So the President's inheriting a very good economy, a very stable economy. We have real, solid economic growth. We have real job growth, we have real wage growth. And I think some of the wage growth that we're seeing, we've seen a lot of these union contracts be renegotiated in the second half of this year. Those wages feed through the economy. They feed through as inflation. So the economy the President's inheriting is quite strong. I think it will continue to stay quite strong. And in fact, the American consumer today, as well as corporate America is quite excited about what the Trump administration is talking about, and the business environment is very positive. Corporate America is talking about a lot of expansion, a lot of capital expenditure for next year, about repatriating more jobs back to the United States, about building more factories in the United States, hiring more workers.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Do you think that will actually happen?",
      "COHN: I do think it's going to happen. So net, net, we are talking about a very positive business and cycle going forward into 2025.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Is the stock market really the best way to gauge it? You saw Mr. Trump at the stock exchange this past week.",
      "COHN: \u00a0 Well, look, the stock market is one benchmark. It's a- it's an index, it's a benchmark. And remember, the stock market is an index. There's a- there's a huge diversity of what's going on in the stock market. There's some of the tech stocks at the high end that are performing very, very well, and there's some of the more traditional stocks in the middle of the market that are not performing as well.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN:\u00a0 We've got to take a break and finish this conversation on the other side of it. Stay with us.",
      "[COMMERCIAL BREAK]",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Welcome back to Face the Nation. We're continuing our conversation now with Gary Cohn. Gary, before the break, you were telling us the business world has high expectations for the Trump administration. One of the things that Donald Trump promised to do in his second term was lower the corporate tax rate. So you helped put together the tax plan that's expiring in 20- or part of it expiring in 2025. He said at the New York Stock Exchange this week that he wants it to go down further from 21%. He really wanted to get it back down to 15 and \"we will be able to do that.\" Will he be able to do that?",
      "COHN: \u00a0 Look Margaret, we don't know. You know, look, the whole tax discussion is going to happen over the course of 2025--",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Why didn't you do it in 2017?",
      "COHN: In 2017 we did not have the financial wherewithal to do it. When you go through reconciliation, which is how they will do taxes this time in 2025, you are given instructions by the- by the Budget Committee, They instructions are basically how much money you can spend or how much revenue you could take in. This time, it will be how much money you can spend. We did not have additional money to spend, so the lowest we could get the corporate tax rate at that time was the 21%. That's also the reason that the corporate tax part of the tax legislation in 2017 expires the end of 2025, to score that piece of legislation, which in the financial requirements we were given by the Senate and the House Finance Committees, we had to end the personal side at the end of 2025. So we do know that taxes will be taken up by this Congress in this session. We know that they're going to have to deal with the personal side of the equation, because if not, the personal side will revert back to the pre-2017 tax code. That was a very arduous, ugly tax code with much higher rates, with a lot more loopholes, a lot more deductions. I don't think anyone wants, on either side of the aisle, wants to go back to the prior tax code. You know, when we open up tax code, even if we're just talking about the personal side, the corporate side will come into play. And there's always this interesting relationship between the personal side and the corporate side, because the vast majority of companies in the United States are small businesses that file on a tax return that allows them to pay the personal rate. But there's a difference between the personal rate and the corporate rate, and you want to make sure that those relationships don't get too far out of out of- out of line with each other, so people aren't incentivized to change their corporate structure to become a subchapter S corporation versus a corporation, so they can take advantage of the tax code. So there's always a lot of time spent there to make sure the personal rate and the corporate rate makes sense in relationship to each other.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN:\u00a0 I think you've said in the past, though you don't think the corporate rate should go down further.",
      "COHN: \u00a0 Well, the business community as a whole, when we did tax reform in 2017, and whether you look at the Chamber of Commerce, or you look at the Business Roundtable, you look at any of the business organizations, they were very supportive of a 21% tax rate. They, in fact, I think, would have been happy with anything at 23% or below, which put us in line with other OECD countries around the world. It made us competitive--",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN::: Other developed economies.",
      "COHN: Other developed economies. Obviously, companies will be happier if the tax rate goes lower, but realistically, we just need, in this country, to be competitive with the rest of the world. We do not want corporate taxes to be a disadvantage for U.S. domiciled companies.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN:\u00a0 The pick for Treasury Secretary is hedge fund manager Scott Bessent. You may know him. He says he's going to deliver on the Trump tax cut pledges, but that's eliminating taxes on tips, social security, overtime pay. Can he actually deliver on any of that?",
      "COHN: \u00a0 Look, Scott is quite an accomplished individual. So look, I know he will put a lot of effort into this. He will have a lot of help with other people. Kevin Hassett, who's going into my old job at the NEC, will have an important seat at the table. Kevin understands a lot of these policies. There will be a lot of opinions at the table when we get to tax writing. You know, the House and the Senate will have their opinions. Remember, there are members of the House that ran on one item and one item only. They ran on the idea that we should bring back the state and local tax deduction, the SALT deduction. There were also members that ran on being deficit hawks. There were Republicans that ran on thinking that we have built up too much deficit and we need to get our budget under control. We're going to have to find a way--",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: They're not going to like any of these promises--",
      "COHN: I agree with that, but we're going to have to find a way to balance all of these needs and get to a tax plan that makes sense but allows us to continue to drive our economy, continue to drive the economic growth and continue to drive wages and jobs.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN:\u00a0 Well, you heard the House Speaker say some of this may be done through reconciliation, which implies that the Senate isn't going to seek a majority vote. They're just going to try to put this through with 51 votes, and do it in kind of an arcane way. When is this going to happen? And should it happen before they fix the border?",
      "COHN: \u00a0 Well, it sounds like, from what I'm hearing, and I don't know, this could change anyway, there's other people smarter than I deciding on the strategy on this. It sounds like there may be two reconciliation bills. It sounds like the first reconciliation bill, which you're right, is a bill that allows the Senate to do something in a simple majority, budget-related only. You can only reconcile a budget. Budget related with a simple majority. It sounds like there may be a first reconciliation bill, which is border related, where they may take back much of the unspent Inflation Reduction Act money and some of the other money that was appropriated under the Biden administration, and use that to close the border.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: And then they'll get to taxes?",
      "COHN: And then use a second reconciliation bill, because there are two budgets out there, as there were in the Biden administration, use that to go after taxes and fixing taxes, especially the personal side of taxes that ends in 2025.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN:\u00a0 That's a big fight to have in the year ahead. Gary, we will be talking to you again, then. We've got to take a break. Thank you."

      "The following is a transcript of an interview with Sen. Amy Klobuchar, Democrat of Minnesota, on \"Face the Nation with Margaret Brennan\" that aired on Dec. 15, 2024.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: And we're joined now by Minnesota Democratic Senator Amy Klobuchar. Good to have you here.",
      "SEN. AMY KLOBUCHAR: Great to be back on Margaret, thanks.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Well, Senator, I do want to ask you about these drones on the East Coast, because we looked at your record and you actually co-sponsored legislation a few years ago trying to expand authorities to deal with them. Why do you need an act of Congress to deal with this, and why didn't the Democrats move on it?",
      "SEN. KLOBUCHAR: Well, first of all, the administration has repeatedly assured people that they are safe. However, one, we need a briefing for the members of the Senate to figure out what's going on here. Two, we need more transparency and three, I appreciated some of the Congressman's words, because what he is talking about is we need to have a new regulatory rules in place here. Right now, you have to register a drone if it's over a half pound, and there are penalties if you don't do that. Well, I think we have to make sure that regime is enforced with local and state authorities, and then we've got to figure out, do we really want all these drones, because while these may be safe, who knows what happens in the future, and they have to be within 400 feet, so these things are going to be what? Flying over people's family picnics and over their homes and over beaches? Like this is not going to be a good future if we see too many of these. So I think I was pleased that he said he wanted to move forward on some rules and finding a way to regulate these in a better way, because this just can't be. No one knows why this huge drone is right over their house.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: So you might bring this up in the new Republican controlled Senate?",
      "SEN. KLOBUCHAR: Yes.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Moving on. You sit on the Judiciary Committee, so you're going to have a key role in overseeing law enforcement under the Trump administration, and you'll get to question his selectee to run the FBI Kash Patel, who has published in his book a list of enemies, vowed retribution. I want to play something for you that Republican Senator Murkowski said just a few days ago.",
      "SEN. LISA MURKOWSKI: The approach is going to be, everybody toe the line. Everybody line-up. We got you here, and if you want to survive, you better be good. Don't get on Santa's naughty list here, because we will primary you.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: That is a remarkable thing for a Republican senator to say on the record, as clearly as she said. She said they are being threatened if they don't get in line and vote for some of these nominees. Are you getting the sense from your Republican colleagues on judiciary they will get in line and vote through Kash Patel?",
      "SEN. KLOBUCHAR: Sadly, there is some of that going on, but then you have other people, like Lisa Murkowski, who has always been a thoughtful, independent voice. She believes her job is to do what our Constitution tells us, advice and consent, and also that we take an oath to support and defend the Constitution of the United States. So we have to do our due diligence and make decisions. I voted for a number of the past Trump nominees for many different jobs. I looked at them and decided if I thought they were qualified, and could they perform the mission of the agency, and did they have integrity? That's what has to happen here. And so when you look at someone like Kash Patel, who would be replacing Christopher Wray, who I believe embodied- he was a Trump appointee, went through Biden and embodied the mission of the FBI, which is fidelity, bravery, integrity. And so now you have someone who says he's on a revenge mission when we should be on a national security safety mission here, when we look at cyber security attacks that you just talked to the congressman about and various other things. He says he wants to dismantle the FBI headquarters and turn it into a museum. To me, this is not the direction we need to go. So I appreciate Senator Murkowski's words and also her demand and other Republicans. It's going to be their decisions on these nominees. We may vote against them or for them, but in the end, it's their decision to demand for FBI reports and making sure that these are not recess appointments and there must be open hearings.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Right because they have enough votes, essentially, to move on these on their own. I want to ask you about President Biden. This past week, he had this record number of commutations, 1500 Americans more than any president in any single day. Among them, though, there was a judge involved in a so called \"Cash for kids\" scheme\u2013",
      "SEN. KLOBUCHAR: I did not like that one. Nope.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: \u2013that sent thousands to jail for millions of dollars, a man who committed tax fraud at a cost of more than $1.6 billion described as \"the most prolific, pernicious, utterly unrepented tax cheat in U.S. history,\" a woman who was involved in a $26 million scheme to defraud Medicare. Are you comfortable with some of these decisions?",
      "SEN. KLOBUCHAR: No. There's also a man in Duluth that was running a major drug house, basically, and had all this money under his bathroom tiles was also commuted. So the way I look at is this- I also didn't agree with the pardon of the president's son. I also have not agreed with a number of pardons that President Trump gave. So I believe, and I've long advocated for this, that while the pardon ability is part of our Constitution, we're not going to change that right? Go way back to President Lincoln, who made hard decisions himself about deserters from the army, things like that. That's been going on a long time, but we should have some kind of an outside board that governors have. Governors have the ability to give mercy to people after years have gone by, but a lot of them have boards that make recommendations and other things, instead of people just doing it in the middle of the night and people in the White House. This makes no sense to me\u2013",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Well, this is what was so surprising, because the White House described it as just based on a broad category and not the specifics of the case. Was that prudent?",
      "SEN. KLOBUCHAR: Exactly. And so, I have no doubt there were some righteous pardons in this group. Okay, let's say that. Now I believe that there were, but there were a number that I think make no sense at all. So instead of doing a whole category, why don't in a coming year before the end of a president's term, if that's when they're mostly going to do these, that a board looks at these and looks at them individually, when people petition for them based on the facts, instead of just in a large group. So large groups have been done before, I believe, but I just, I think that this whole process cries out for reform, because otherwise you undermine the justice system. And again, I emphasize, this also happened in a big way under President Trump, and you undermine the work of these line FBI agents, these line prosecutors who have taken on these cases, followed the sentencing guidelines and made a decision. Might you want mercy 10 years later? Yes, you might. But let's at least look at these on a factual basis and a risk basis, instead of just in the middle of the night a month before a president leaves.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Senator Klobuchar, thank you for being here today.",
      "SEN. KLOBUCHAR: It was great to be on Thank you, Margaret.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: We'll be right back with a lot more face than nation. Stay with us."

      "The following is a transcript of an interview with Rep. Michael Waltz, Republican of Florida, Trump's pick for national security adviser, on \"Face the Nation with Margaret Brennan\" that aired on Dec. 15, 2024.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: We begin with Congressman Mike Waltz of Florida, who is the incoming White House National Security Adviser. Good morning to you.",
      "REP. MIKE WALTZ (R-FL): Morning. Margaret. Tough day for Army, but great day for America.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Indeed. Well as a Green Beret, I know you had a reason to be cheering there for Army, Sir. I want to ask you a number of topics, but before I go overseas, you sit on the House Intelligence Committee. You also, because of your new role, are in contact with President Biden's National Security Adviser, Jake Sullivan. Do you think the public should be concerned about these reported drones all over the East Coast? And have you the need for more authority to deal with them?",
      "REP. MIKE WALTZ: Well, I think what the drone issue points out are kind of gaps in our agencies, gaps in our authorities between the Department of Homeland Security, local law enforcement, the Defense Department. And I think Americans are finding it hard to believe we can't figure out where these are coming from. And I can tell you, from the Defense Department standpoint, you know, they're focused on bombers and cruise missiles, and- and it's- it's pointing to gaps in our capabilities and in our ability to clamp down on what's going on here. And we need to get to the bottom of it, and I think the Biden administration is- is working to do that.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: But at this point, given the intelligence you've seen, is there any reason for the public to be worried?",
      "REP. MIKE WALTZ: Well, look, when you have sensitive sites like Picatinny Arsenal, you have, of course, President Trump's residence at Bedminster, and you have other no-fly areas, those need to be enforced. We need to know who's behind it. But right now, I think law enforcement seems to be- the Department of Homeland Security and the Defense Department are kind of all doing this and pointing at each other. So when we come in, you know, how do we enforce these low level, long loitering, could-be-dangerous drones? And one thing for people to appreciate, you know, they're evolving so rapidly, it's not necessarily somebody that's just on the other end flying it. They could be following pre-positioned GPS coordinates. They could be coming from offshore. And we need to take a hard look at our homeland defenses. President Trump has talked about an Iron Dome for America. That needs to include drones as well, not just adversarial actions like hypersonic missiles. We need to have an all of the above protection of U.S. airspace.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Understood. Let- let me ask you about China. The President Elect said a few things in the past week about China, and he said his team has been \"talking and discussing,\" as he put it, with China's President Xi Jinping. CBS was the first to report that an invitation was extended to the inauguration, though we do not expect Xi to come. Was that the extent of the back and forth? Do the two leaders intend to speak by phone?",
      "REP. MIKE WALTZ: Well, Margaret, it's been amazing. I mean, the entire world is reaching out to the president. In fact, it's been a little overwhelming, the outreach, not only to speak with him, to congratulate him, but to even come to the inauguration themselves. So the outreach has been tremendous. President Trump is taking all calls, as you know. He believes in having a relationship with allies and adversaries at that kind of head of state level. And those conversations- those conversations are ongoing, but they are, really, nothing beyond congratulatory and niceties. We are in communication with the current administration. We don't agree on all things, but as I've said before, none of our adversaries should think this is a moment to take advantage of this transition. We don't agree with all things, but we are in full coordination with the current administration.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Well, China, you said there should be consequences because of their massive and pervasive hack of eight U.S. telecom companies, which has breached the metadata of potentially millions of Americans. Senator Marco Rubio said it was egregious, dangerous, and a vulnerability that no one anticipated. You're going to be working together. What do you plan for the consequences to be?",
      "REP. MIKE WALTZ\u00a0 I think Senator Rubio, and hopefully future Secretary of State Rubio, is absolutely right. We are- we have been, over the years, trying to play better and better defense when it comes to cyber. We need to start going on offense and start imposing, I think, higher costs and consequences to private actors and nation state actors that continue to steal our data, that continue to spy on us, and that even worse, with the Volt Typhoon penetration, that are literally putting cyber time bombs on our infrastructure, our water systems, our grids, even our ports.That is wholly unacceptable, and I think we need to take a much stronger stance. Senator Rubio is right. President Trump has indicated that as well. We need to start changing behaviors on the other side, rather than just constantly having this kind of escalation of their offense and our defense. The Colonial Pipeline hack was another key point. And then finally, we've got a tremendous private sector with a lot of capability. That relationship between public and private, with our tech industry, they could be doing a lot of good and helping\u2014",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: So is this sanctions?",
      "REP. MIKE WALTZ: \u2014us defend, but also making our adversaries vulnerable.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Is it sanctions day one from the Trump administration?",
      "REP. MIKE WALTZ: Well, I'm not going to get ahead of everything that we're doing day one, but taking a different approach to cyber, looking at our doctrine, and starting to impose costs on the other side to get them to knock this off, is something we'll be taking a look at, I think.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: You were at Mar a Lago this past week when Hungary's Prime Minister, Viktor Orb\u00e1n, met with Mr. Trump and Elon Musk and yourself. He then announced that he had spoken to Vladimir Putin. Orb\u00e1n seems to be floating a Christmas ceasefire and a prisoner swap. Is he carrying with him some kind of message from Donald Trump?",
      "REP. MIKE WALTZ: Well, Orb\u00e1n has regular engagement with the Russians, and he clearly has a good relationship with President Trump, and I would hope the entire world would want to see some type of cessation to the slaughter that is happening in eastern Ukraine. I mean, Margaret, people need to understand\u2014",
      "(BEGIN CROSSTALK)",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Did Mr. Trump ask him to do that?",
      "REP. MIKE WALTZ: This is World War I style-",
      "(END CROSSTALK)",
      "REP. MIKE WALTZ: This is World War I style warfare. It is a meat grinder of human beings. President Trump's been very concerned about the carnage that's ongoing. And where is this all going?",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Right.",
      "REP. MIKE WALTZ: We need to stop the fighting. And, you know, look, if that is some type of ceasefire as a first step, again, we'll- we'll take a hard look at what that means. But until January 20, we are also in coordination with this current administration.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Okay, so no message was sent through Orb\u00e1n to Putin by Trump. Is that- that's what I understand you saying there.",
      "REP. MIKE WALTZ: Oh, I'm not going to- yeah, I'm not going to get into specifics of back and forths. But, one is talking, of course, we're going to continue to talk, and the- President Trump's made it clear he wants this war to stop.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Does the Trump team plan to limit how Ukraine can use U.S. weapons or targeting assistance when you take office?",
      "REP. MIKE WALTZ: Well, President Trump just said in the interview that, you know, a blank check, in his interview with Time magazine, I believe, you know, a blank check isn't- you know, just isn't a strategy. This just, kind of, forever war that we seem to be backing into. What does success look like in line with our interests? How do we end the war? Who's at the table? How do we drive, you know, all sides to the table, and what's the framework for- for an agreement? Those are things that we're thinking through with his fantastic team that he's assembling.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Was that discussed in that 45 minute meeting that Mr. Trump had with Mr. Zelenskyy in Paris last week? And do you support putting NATO member states as peacekeepers in Ukraine?",
      "REP. MIKE WALTZ: Well, you know what's been so interesting, Margaret, is, just since the election, everyone coming to us, our European allies, President Zelenskyy in that meeting, and others, have shifted to how to- that framework I just talked about. How do we end this conflict? How do we do it in a way that restores stability, stops the carnage, and hopefully makes this a permanent end, not just- not just a pause? Those are all things that we're thinking through. And in terms of the question you just asked, the NATO Secretary General came here to Mar a Lago, he's talking about the Europeans taking a bigger role in- whether that's on the ground or otherwise, after this conflict is over, and that's exactly what President Trump has been asking for.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: I have to quickly ask you about the Middle East. During the last Trump administration, Donald Trump pulled some U.S. troops out of Syria. Does he intend to keep the 900 U.S. troops there?",
      "REP. MIKE WALTZ: Look, our number one interest is keeping a lid on ISIS. We cannot have an explosion of ISIS back into a caliphate that threatens Iraq, threatens Jordan, threatens Turkey and Europe, inspires attacks in the United States, like we saw in 2014. President Trump cleaned it up then with his team. 1000s of ISIS fighters are in prison camps. We're in consultation with the Israelis as well. They're importantly taking down Assad's chemical stockpiles, as well as other things we don't want falling into the hands of anybody. And you know, the other piece there that he asked for in the first term, and that we need to see is, again, Europe, who was hit so badly by ISIS attacks, taking a greater role in keeping ISIS contained. So those are all conversations that we're having, again, in consultation with the current administration, and we'll see moving forward.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Congressman Mike Waltz, thank you for joining us today."

      "MARGARET BRENNAN: We turn now to the Executive Director of the U.N.'s World Food Programme Cindy McCain. Welcome back to Face the Nation.",
      "U.N. WORLD FOOD PROGRAMME EXECUTIVE DIRECTOR CINDY MCCAIN: Thank you.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Director, you are looking at a globe very much in crisis, but I want to start on the hot spot of Syria. USAID said the World Food Programme was able to reach 70,000 people in Syria over the last week, but you need supply lines to remain open. Is there a threat right now to your deliveries? And if so, where is that coming from?",
      "MCCAIN: Well, our deliveries so far have been very- very smooth, but we need more delivery options open, which is what this was alluding to. More importantly, we have been able to get 70,000 people fed this- this month so far, but we need more. And- and more importantly, we need the funds to do it. That's where we're lacking. We had- there's a lot of people, a lot of hunger at stake, a lot of malnutrition that was already pre-existing, that now- that now we need to handle as well. You know, WFP never left Syria. We've always been in there, but now we need more routes, more ability to get in and to get, not just more trucks, but more people in, so that we can help in the best way we can.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: So you need Turkey to open up supply lines or surrounding countries? Is that right?",
      "MCCAIN: Yes, correct. We need everybody around us, Turkey, all the countries surrounding us, to make sure that we can get in and get in smoothly, again, unfettered and, of course, in a safe manner.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: So you have said you're trying to scale up to reach nearly 3 million people who need some help right now. The U.S. still has some sanctions on Syria, but they do let in U.N. humanitarian aid. There was a call in Congress, a bipartisan one this week, for the United States to lift some sanctions. Are you experiencing U.S. sanctions getting in your way at this point?",
      "MCCAIN: Not really. We've- we've been able to, as- as you said, we've been able to move our goods, through, our food items, etc, through and get it to where it needs to go in a safe and quick manner as well. But- but I don't- I will never understate- underestimate the process with things that it could infringe us later on. So I'm hoping that things stay calm, that we can move our goods again in a safe and secure manner and do it at full scale. If we can't work at scale, we can't feed. And that's the most important part that we need too, we need access, and we need the ability to feed.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: And you said you're short on funds. How much do you need?",
      "MCCAIN: Oh, worldwide, I could use 17 billion right now, if you want to know the truth. There's so much, there's so many- many countries that have absolutely no access to any fundings. No one's paying any attention to it. Syria being one of them. And we need- we need, obviously, a great deal of funds in- in particular within Syria, but in other countries too. You're talking about Sudan, we're talking about Yemen, we're talking about Ethiopia and other places where- where people are desperate right now.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: So why did you say funding is down? People are just not paying attention?",
      "MCCAIN: Yeah. Yeah. Countries are- are rerouting their funding in different ways. They're choosing- choosing to fund things in different manners or not to fund at all. We- you know, we- I always send out the oral plea to be able to- to encourage people and encourage countries to be- to get involved and to stay involved. And I'm asking now, I'm asking on your show, worldwide, to please consider, once again, giving to Syria, because people in Syria will starve to death without it, and- and we've seen the evidence of great hunger there.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: You know, you and I have spoken in the past on this program about the U.S. contributing so generously to the U.N., the largest funder, arguably the most important partner to the United Nations, and you had encouraged Beijing to really kind of step up their game, and you had said there was somewhat of a lack of willingness to be a part of working together as a team worldwide. Have you seen any change to that?",
      "MCCAIN: Not much. I encourage all countries to get involved, including China. We need help from everybody. The world is on fire right now, and hunger- hunger is at the forefront of all of this. And most importantly, you know, when people are hungry, this becomes a national security issue. And so it affects not only the countries that it's affecting, but it affects us worldwide, and it does affect national security. So it's important that every country worldwide get involved and be involved in this.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: The U.S., as- as we just said, the most generous here, the president-elect has selected a rising star in the Republican Party, Elise Stefanik, to be the representative at the United Nations, and also a cabinet member. That indicates an important voice at the table. Congressman Stefanik- Congresswoman Stefanik called for a complete reassessment of U.S. funding for the United Nations. Are you concerned that you will see a negative impact on funding?",
      "MCCAIN: Well, I'm not concerned, because when I came into this job, I knew that funding was not going to be at the level that it had been. So we've gone through a complete- complete reboot on not only scaling down our operations and making sure that we're more efficient, more effective, and- and making sure that our people in- we push everything to this- to the- to the field now, so that our people in the field can get the job done. We- this was something I came in knowing I was going to have to do, is scale down, make sure that- that we work better, more efficiently, more effectively, and make sure that we get food to the people that need it the most in a quick and safe manner.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: So I want to ask you about Sudan. I know you were recently there. It's in the midst of a brutal civil war. The U.S. has accused both sides of ethnic cleansing. Can you keep trucks going into Sudan to feed people there?",
      "MCCAIN: Oh, it's such a complicated situation. We- right now, we have 30 some convoys on the road going into Sudan to hit the various places that we need to get to, but we need more. Certainly, Darfur has been a big issue, but we have other parts of the country that are just as needy and where- where famine does exist, as you know, it's been declared there. And we need- we need also to be able to come through Khartoum and make sure that we can- can access from that direction as well. It's been a slow process, but we have been able to get in, but we need more. People are starving to death, and once again, it's- it's- I sound like a broken record, but we need to be able to get in in a safe and unfettered- unfettered manner, so that we can get the job done. Again, food security is national security. Don't ever forget that because if people are insecure from a food- from- from a food reality, they're not going to behave well, and things- they start to migrate. Wars begin that way. Conflict is a part of all of this. The countries that are affected right now, and the big ones that we- that we look to, are all affected because of conflict. It's- the food security issue is- is very directly caused by conflict within the arena that they're in. So it's very important that we pay attention to that particular issue as well.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN Given the- the scale of the famine and the malnutrition in Sudan, is it food that you're trying to bring in, or is it more, you know, specialized medical assistance? How do you deal with the children, for example, who are being so hurt in Sudan?",
      "MCCAIN: Well, yes, part of that is making sure that- that our folks from UNICEF, our folks from W.H.O. can get in because there are specialized and- specialized products that are needed for, especially the infants, that are so severely- severely malnourished. And it's our job to help not just get our stuff in, but get their stuff in as well, in any way that we can. We're a team player in all this, and we make sure that we- we access and talk to all of our partners within the field so that we can work together. Yes. I mean, these are these- these people, and these children especially, have been so deprived of nourishment for so long that they need highly-specialized items to be able- to be able to beat malnutrition and at least have some chance at life.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: I'd be remiss to not ask you about what's going on in Gaza. Jake Sullivan, President Biden's National Security Adviser, said this week the U.S. has stood up to Prime Minister Netanyahu to say, let's make sure that Israel is not responsible for the third famine of the 21st century. Are we at famine in Gaza?",
      "MCCAIN: We're very close to it. We've seen the effects of it. We've seen what's- what's going on. Listen- this- we're in the month of November. WFP has been able to get two trucks in. That's all. Two trucks in the month of November. And, you know- and of course, now we're into December. But so- the- the- the inability for us to not only to- to move our trucks and get it to where it needs to go, but the insecurity that's caused from it, the- the- the targeting of- of humanitarian aid workers and making sure that we can't move or that- or that they feel insecure. This whole- this whole issue of not being able to get in, is- is unseemly. We need unfettered access. We need a cease-fire, and we need it now. We can't- there's- we can no longer sit by and just allow these people to starve to death. We need help, and we need to make sure that we put political pressure on those that need to have political pressure put on them.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: We've seen images of- of crowds just crushing people, amassing at bakeries in Gaza. 90% of the population cannot return to their homes. They're displaced. Only four bakeries are operational for nearly 2 million people. This is man-made.",
      "MCCAIN: It is man-made, you're- you're absolutely right. It is man-made and and- and more importantly, the world needs to take a hard look at this and realize that not just- not just do they need food, but we need access. And the targeting of humanitarian aid workers is unconscionable. We need to get in and do our job, and- and more importantly, in all of this, make sure that we can feed. Children, especially, are starving to death. I mean, the height of malnutrition, the height of- of hunger within- within that region, is- is unbelievably horrible, and so we've seen it firsthand. And I- I, as the leader of the largest humanitarian aid agency in the world, are- I'm calling for a cease-fire, and I want my aid, my fellow partners within this arena, to call for the same thing. We need a cease-fire. We need access, and we need it now--",

      "MCCAIN:\u00a0 -- Again, remember, food security is national security, and that's what's happening.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Understood. You used the word targeted. Who's targeting your workers?",
      "MCCAIN: Well, there's lots of things that are going on there. There's gangs that are running, if we're speaking directly about Gaza, it's gangs that's running around. It's the- the lawlessness. There is absolutely no- no law- law to be held, you know, to be even talked about there, because it doesn't exist. And so we need all of those kinds of things to be put into place so that we can work in a safe manner and get- get the food to where it's go- where it needs to go. Again, we've gotten two trucks in. That's all. Two trucks.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Director McCain, I know you have a lot of needs. You're looking for 17 billion is the number you are asking for. We wish you good luck feeding the world.",

      "Cindy McCain, the executive director of the World Food Programme, said \"hunger is at the forefront\" of global conflicts worldwide, making it a \"national security issue\" that requires the help of all countries involved.",
      "\"We need help from everybody. The world is on fire right now,\" McCain said on \"Face the Nation with Margaret Brennan,\" adding that \"hunger is at the forefront of all of this.\"",
      "McCain outlined that with food insecurity, people don't \"behave well, and things \u2014 they start to migrate.\"",
      "\"Wars begin that way,\" she said. \"Conflict is a part of all of this.\"",
      "Among the areas where the World Food Programme is at work is Syria, which has been thrown into a period of uncertainty after the fall of Syrian leader Bashar al-Assad\u00a0last week. McCain said the organization's deliveries to the area have been \"very smooth\" so far \u2014 with 70,000 people fed this month \u2014 while noting that they need more delivery options open, and more funds.",
      "McCain said the World Food Programme has been able to move goods and food items to where they need to go \"in a safe and quick manner\" in Syria, noting that she's hoping that things will \"stay calm\" so they can continue their work at full scale. But she said the organization is seeing \"evidence of great hunger\" in the country, while noting that without funding, people will \"starve to death.\"",
      "McCain said the effort could use $17 billion worldwide, saying there are \"so many countries that have absolutely no access to any fundings.\"",
      "\"No one's paying any attention to it,\" she added.",

      "\"We can no longer sit by and just allow these people to starve to death,\" McCain said. \"We need help, and we need to make sure that we put political pressure on those that need to have political pressure put on them.\"",

      "MARGARET BRENNAN: And we're joined now by the Ukrainian ambassador to the United States, Oksana Markarova. Good to have you back with us.",
      "UKRAINIAN AMBASSADOR TO THE U.S. OKSANA MARKAROVA: Thank you for having me and blessed Sunday to all.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: No Western Power, as you know, is sending troops to Ukraine to help Ukrainian forces, but Russia's got North Korean troops now who are fighting on their side. Yesterday, President Zelensky said Russia has been using a significant number of North Koreans. How are they fighting?",
      "AMB. MARKAROVA: Yes, so and we are not asking for other troops. Ukrainians are still capable of defending our own country. We're asking for the military support. Yesterday, we have seen those tens of thousands of troops that we were warning the word about. We have seen hundreds of them on the battlefield already, and we are successfully fighting with them as we are fighting with the Russians. I mean, look we we see them now in Kursk Oblast only, and our brave defenders were not only able to kill a lot of them, but also keep the positions. So it's difficult, of course, to see the reinforcement from this axis of evil, but it will not change anything for us. We will continue defending the very long line, whether it's in southern eastern Ukraine or whether it's our defensive operation in Kursk.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: And in the meantime, the North Korean troops are getting trained in Modern Warfare, and they're learning in Ukraine- I mean, right there.",
      "AMB. MARKAROVA: Absolutely. And we also have to worry about what is it that Russia is promising or even delivering to North Korea in exchange for this and Korean missiles.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: But I also raised the manpower issue because it's a problem for Ukraine as well. Military Recruitment is tough right now in Ukraine. There has been pressure on your government by the United States to lower the draft age so that you can boost the number of fighters. This is arguably a bigger issue than the weaponry itself. Is it affecting the ability of Ukraine to keep up this fight?",
      "AMB. MARKAROVA: I wouldn't agree that it's a bigger issue than the equipment itself. We still have, first of all, we have a number of young people fighting for Ukraine, and they are volunteering, and women are volunteering. Ukraine is one of the countries that lifted all restrictions for women, for example, and we have 60,000 of women in the armed forces. With the recruitment, the last changes to the law on mobilization already allowed us to create new brigades, which we are training now. And the problem is to have enough equipment to train them on, so that we can actually not send to the battlefield like Russians do, right, unprepared, whether it's North Korean to unprepared Russians, but to send soldiers who can do and deliver on a mission. And it's very important for us, because every person matters for Ukrainians. Of course there are challenges, and we have the plan and we know how to do it, because again, this is our home we are defending. So when it's necessary, all of us are going to be defending our country, but weapons and having more weapons, especially long range, especially something to counter this 3000 Glide bombs every month that Russians are sending against us.",
      "There's missiles for both Russian and North Korean missiles. I mean, it's still a question of artillery and weapons and air defense, most importantly, and the more we can have, the faster we can- the more efficiently we can defend.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Well, the Biden administration has been releasing more weapons just in the last week alone. But Donald Trump gave an interview to Time Magazine, and he said the United States is escalating by allowing for weapons- missiles to be shot into Russian territory. He specifically focused in on that. He does not like that Ukraine is doing it. What does that mean for you on day one of the Trump administration?",
      "AMB. MARKAROVA: Well, let me say, start by saying thank you to all American people, really, for standing with us all this time. Let me thank President Biden and his administration for all the support. Let me thank President Trump. He is the one who made a historic decision to provide us with Javelins, actually, to provide us with lethal aid in the first place\u2013",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: \u2013back in 2017.",
      "AMB. MARKAROVA: Yes. So right now, we have to do everything in order to stop Russia. And we know it's- it could be stopped. It was recently stopped in Syria. We liberated more than 50% that they have taken. We actually kicked them out from the Black Sea, just with our own naval drone capabilities. They could, they- we can stop them the more equipment we have, especially including the longer range equipment in order to be able to degrade the attack capabilities faster, the faster they will either come to the table, because, again, Ukraine wants peace. Nobody wants peace more than us. Ukraine was never a problem. We never initiated this conflict, and we negotiated at the first sign- remember, in 2022 when Russians started negotiations, they, of course, did not negotiate peace. They negotiated the pause. As we just heard Congressman Waltz, who absolutely rightfully said, it has to be peace, not a pause.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: He was careful. He didn't give a lot of specifics as to what the Trump policy will be but we do know that Viktor Orban was at Mar-a-Lago this past week, and he talks to Vladimir Putin, and he's talking about a Christmas pause. Do you see a chance for a Christmas ceasefire and prisoner exchange?",
      "AMB. MARKAROVA: This is very difficult winter, after Russia destroyed our- a lot of our energy infrastructure. And after you know, we are going through this difficult fights, both on the front line, but also civilians suffering from the deadly missile attacks\u2013",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: \u2013Just this past week.",
      "AMB. MARKAROVA: Yes, at the same time, you know, every time Russia is talking about some ceasefire, they are lying. Russians are lying, and we see they were not able to defend their body- terrorist body Assad, and he fled to Russia. And we see horrible atrocities in Sednaya Prison, like we see in Ukraine everywhere. It reminded me isolation prison in Donetsk\u2013",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Right.",
      "AMB. MARKAROVA: Which still is operational. So look, you know, if Russia wants seriously to stop it, they can stop it anytime.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Ambassador, I have to leave it there. Thank you so much for joining us.",

    "published": "Tue, 17 Dec 2024 11:23:03 -0500",
    "summary": "Researchers determined that dozens of men, women and children were violently killed and cannibalized in Bronze Age-era England.",
    "story": [
      "New research suggests that dozens of Bronze-Age era Britons were killed in an attack unlike any previous known to archaelogists studying that time period and location.",
      "The research on human remains from Charterhouse Warren in southwest England, conducted by a team of researchers from multiple institutions including Oxford University, was published in Antiquity, a journal of world archaeology. It found that at least 37 Bronze Age-era men, women and children were \"killed and butchered\" and then cannibalized, with their bodies then thrown down a nearly 50-foot deep natural shaft. While archaeologists have found the remains of Bronze Age and later Britons who died violently, those incidents were largely isolated. Mass graves from this era have also been found, but the remains were laid to rest respectfully, unlike those studied.",
      "Researchers first became aware of the shaft in the 1970s. Two excavations were conducted in the 1970s and 1980s. The human remains, as well as some artifacts including a flint dagger, were found at multiple spots in the shaft during these digs. More than 3,000 individual human bones and bone fragments have been recovered overall. Those bones were used to estimate that at least 37 individual sets of remains were in the shaft. Different bone lengths show that the people killed were both male and female, and ranged in age from infants to grown adults. Ongoing research is working to determine how the people were related to each other.",
      "The way the remains were disposed of made the detailed examination possible, the researchers said. The shaft helped preserve the bones and keep them grouped together.",
      "The bones \"display clear evidence of blunt force trauma,\" according to researchers, suggesting that many of the people in the shaft \"suffered a violent death.\" Other injuries, including removal of the scalp and severed muscles in the jaw suggesting removal of the tongue or lower jaw, also likely occurred, evidenced by marks on the bones, the researchers said. Some of the victims may have been beheaded or dismembered.",
      "It's possible that the victims were held captive or ambushed, because of the severity of the injuries, the researchers said. It's not clear who could have carried out the attacks.",
      "There is also evidence that the bodies were cannibalized, the researchers said, including human teethmarks on the bones and indicators that marrow, the soft tissue inside bones, was removed. The researchers said the cannibalism was likely conducted \"within a context of a violent conflict, in which individuals are dehumanized and treated as animals.\"",
      "\"Some 37 men, women and children\u2014and possibly many more\u2014were killed at close quarters with blunt instruments and then systematically dismembered and defleshed, their long bones fractured in a way that can only be described as butchery,\" the researchers said.",
      "Later in the publication, the researchers referred to the scene as a \"massacre,\" and suggested it may have even been a \"political statement\" of violence so brazen it would have \"resonated across the wider region and over time.\" However, it's not clear what could have led to the violence: \"Neither climate change, ethnic conflict nor competition over material resources seem to offer convincing explanations,\" according to the researchers, leaving the only likely option that the violence broke out as part of a pattern of revenge or violence between communities.",
      "\"At this stage, our investigation has raised as many questions as it has answered,\" the researchers said. \"Work is ongoing to shed more light on this decidedly dark episode in British prehistory.\"",

      "Astronauts Butch Wilmore and Suni Williams traveled to the space station aboard the Starliner back in June. Their trip was initially only to last about eight to 10 days, but multiple issues with the Starliner prompted a concerned NASA, out of caution, to leave them behind at the space station and return the capsule to Earth empty in September.",
      "That same month, a SpaceX Crew-9 Dragon capsule with a reduced two-person crew and two empty seats launched to the space station with the intention of returning Wilmore and Williams aboard it in February 2025.",
      "However, NASA said in a news release Tuesday that Wilmore and Williams' replacements, traveling aboard the SpaceX Crew-10, would be launching to the space station \"no earlier than late March 2025,\" meaning that would be the earliest that Wilmore and Williams will return to Earth.",
      "The most recent delay in the Crew-10's launch is to give \"NASA and SpaceX teams time to complete processing on a new Dragon spacecraft for the mission.\"",
      "The Crew-9 \u2014 carrying Williams, Wilmore, fellow NASA astronaut Nick Hague and cosmonaut Aleksandr Gorbunov \u2014 can only leave the space station following a \"handover period\" with the Crew-10.",
      "The handover period \"allows Crew-9 to share any lessons learned with the newly arrived crew and support a better transition for ongoing science and maintenance at the complex.\"",
      "NASA did not speculate on how long that handover might take.",
      "The Starliner, Boeing's answer to the Crew Dragon, has faced major headwinds since it went into development, including a series of technical issues and budget shortfalls.",
      "It finally launched, but after arriving at the space station with its crew, multiple helium leaks were discovered in the Starliner's propulsion system, along with a degraded thrust in five of its maneuvering jets.",
      "A return in late March or April would mean that a trip that was expected to last just over a week for Williams and Wilmore   will have been stretched to at least nine months.",

      "Why is the December full moon called the Cold Moon?",
      "December's full moon is called the Cold Moon, according to the Old Farmer's Almanac. The name was chosen because of how cold it usually is during December's full moon.",

      "While the moon reaches peak illumination early on Dec. 15, it will appear full for several days. According to NASA, around 95% of the moon's nearside was expected to be illuminated by the sun on Friday, Dec. 13, and 99% of the moon's nearside will be illuminated on Saturday, Dec. 14.

      "\"Still, the Geminids are known for bright meteors, and it's common to spot their shooting stars up to a week before the peak,\" according to NASA. \"If you're up before dawn that week, it's worth looking up, just in case you spot a speck of dust from space streaking through the morning sky.\"",
      "When and where you can see the Geminids",
      "Light from the nearly full moon will cut the visible rates for the Geminids by 50-75% during the peak this year, said Bill Cooke, lead of NASA's Meteoroid Environment Office. The brightest meteors will still be visible, according to NASA.",

      "\"In short, 2024 is a bad year for Geminid watching \u2014 December 2025 will be much better,\" Cooke said.",

      "What is a meteor shower?",
      "Meteors are space rocks that enter Earth's atmosphere and heat up as they fall toward Earth, according to NASA. As they streak through the sky, glowing, hot air around the meteors gives the meteors the appearance of shooting stars. During meteor showers, many meteors travel through Earth's atmosphere over a short period.",

      "\"I knew was confident that we had the best two handling this case,\" Jenkins said. \"And I think the verdict was a testament to the hard work they put in, to the great lawyers that they are, and to their commitment to justice and to making sure that this family received justice.\"",
      "She also pushed back on what Elon Musk and others said after the stabbing happened when critics claimed San Francisco is lawless and out of control as part of the popular \"doom loop\" narrative commonly aired on social media.",
      "\"I think that hopefully now, we have once again established what truly happened here. We all know that after Bob Lee was murdered, Elon Musk took to Twitter to make an effort to really shame San Francisco, and to make it seem like this was about lawlessness in San Francisco and about what's going on in our streets,\" Jenkins said.",
      "She noted that law enforcement early felt the fatal stabbing of Lee was not a random crime.",
      "\"And we knew it was something different. And I think today proved once again, that we are a city committed to accountability, we are a city committed to public safety,\" she added. \"And that when something bad happens, which we can't always control, that law enforcement at every level will respond to make sure that there is justice and accountability in each and every situation.\"",
      "Jenkins said her office would prepare for an appeal to be filed by Momeni's defense team.",
      "Fatal stabbing of Cash App founder",
      "Momeni was accused of\u00a0fatally stabbing tech executive Lee\u00a0in a secluded part of San Francisco's East Cut neighborhood under the Bay Bridge in April 2023.",
      "Court officials announced late Monday afternoon that the jury had reached a verdict shortly before 4 p.m.",
      "Prosecutors accused Momeni of stabbing Lee with a kitchen paring knife following a heated discussion regarding his sister's relationship with Lee\u00a0as well as their ongoing drug use. During the trial, Momeni's lawyers\u00a0claimed that their client acted in self-defense, alleging that Lee lunged at Momeni with a knife in his hand while high on ketamine and cocaine. The defense\u00a0said Lee became erratic and aggressive after Momeni made a \"bad joke\"\u00a0at the expense of Lee's family.",
      "Intense trial",
      "The six-week trial was punctuated by dramatic testimony, including an appearance on the stand of Momeni's sister, Khazar Momeni. She testified as a witness for the prosecution and\u00a0insisted during her first day of testimony that her brother didn't kill Lee.\u00a0She also detailed consuming\u00a0several drugs with Lee and others in the days leading up to the fatal stabbing.",
      "During cross-examination by defense attorneys, Khazar Momeni described Lee as\u00a0\"all over the place\" and \"aggressive\" while high on drugs. Her testimony was criticized outside the courtroom by Lee's ex-wife Krista Lee, who\u00a0accused her of trying to \"make herself a victim.\"",
      "The testimony turned contentious when Nima Momeni took the stand, as the defendant\u00a0sparred with the prosecution during cross-examination\u00a0after earlier\u00a0describing how Lee allegedly attacked him\u00a0while his defense team questioned him about the confrontation.",
      "Challenging Nima Momeni's story",
      "San Francisco Assistant District Attorney Omid Talai challenged Momeni's version of the story and focused on his actions immediately after Lee's death, including his calls to attorneys and text messages with his sister.",
      "The case wrapped up in the first week of December with prosecutors\u00a0trying to tear down Momeni's defense in their closing arguments and asking why he didn't call police or tell anyone about Lee allegedly attacking him.",
      "The defense showed a bombshell video during their closing arguments,\u00a0presenting surveillance footage\u00a0they claimed showed Lee doing cocaine on the street outside a private club with the same knife used to kill him hours later. Defense attorney Saam Zangeneh used a cardboard cutout of the knife in court so the jury could see the size of the paring knife he said the video proved Lee had in his possession all along.",
      "That video sparked a tense exchange between Zangeneh and Lee's former wife, who let out a loud, mocking laugh as he showed the footage.",
      "Zangeneh turned to directly address her, saying it wasn't funny. Prosecutors quickly objected and the judge intervened to restore order in the courtroom.",
      "The jury\u00a0began deliberations on the morning of Dec. 4.",
      "Who is Nima Momeni?",
      "Nima Momeni, 40, was described as a \"tech entrepreneur\" when he was arrested for the murder of Bob Lee back in April of 2023. Momeni was taken into custody at his home in Emeryville on April 11, days after the deadly stabbing.",
      "According to his Linkedin page, Momeni is the owner of Expand IT. His profile describes the company as providing IT solutions in the Bay Area since 2010.",
      "Neighbors who lived near Momeni were shocked to hear of his arrest. After Momeni was taken into custody, Bay Area public relations veteran Sam Singer who worked next door to him said he had never had any issues with the defendant beyond hearing music being played a bit too loudly.",
      "\"Warm, welcoming, very nice fellow, like any other tech consultant here in the Bay Area, lives in a live-work space,\" Singer said. \"He handed us a stack of cards and said, 'If you ever need anything let me know.'\"",
      "It later emerged that Khazar Momeni had introduced Lee to her brother, thinking that the successful Cash App founder might work with him on one of Nima's projects.",
      "Who was Bob Lee?",
      "A successful Bay Area technology executive, Bob Lee was best known as one of the creators and founders of the digital wallet Cash App. Lee had also worked at Google as a staff software engineer in the 2000s, helping to develop the mobile operating system used by Android cell phones.",
      "In 2010, he was recruited by the San Francisco e-commerce company Square, Inc., where he became chief technology officer before eventually moving on to Cash App. At the time of his death, Lee was working as the chief product officer of the cryptocurrency MobileCoin.",
      "Lee was living in Mill Valley with his family including his now ex-wife Krista and two children, but the couple separated in 2019. Lee had subsequently moved to Miami in 2022 to live with his father and was visiting San Francisco on business when he was fatally stabbed.",
      "The Wall Street Journal reported Lee and Khazar Momeni\u00a0belonged to a sex and drugs-fueled underground party scene\u00a0known in wealthy Bay Area tech circles as \"The Lifestyle.\"\u00a0The medical examiner's report revealed\u00a0the tech executive died on the operating table and was found to have alcohol, cocaine and ketamine in his system.",

    "title": "How TikTok could avoid being banned in the U.S.",
    "published": "Tue, 17 Dec 2024 14:52:41 -0500",
    "summary": "The TikTok ban is set to go into effect next month barring a last-minute sale or Supreme Court action.",
    "story": [
      "Washington \u2014 TikTok's fate in the U.S. appears to be hanging by a thread after a federal appeals court denied its plea to delay a law that will ban the widely popular app if it does not cut ties with its Chinese parent company ByteDance.",
      "The law, which goes into effect on Jan. 19, gave ByteDance nine months to sell TikTok. Absent a sale, the app will be cut off from app stores and web-hosting services in the U.S. The law also gives the president the ability to grant a 90-day delay if a sale is in progress.",
      "According to experts, TikTok has several pathways for avoiding a ban, most notably intervention from the Supreme Court or the incoming Trump administration declining to enforce it. Other options, like a last-minute sale or Congress deciding to repeal the law, appear less likely.",
      "TikTok turns to the Supreme Court",
      "On Monday, TikTok asked the Supreme Court to temporarily pause the law, arguing the appeals court's decision upholding it was \"utterly antithetical to the First Amendment.\"",
      "\"If the Act is allowed to take effect in January 2025 \u2026 this Court will lose its ability to grant applicants meaningful relief,\" lawyers for TikTok and ByteDance wrote. \"Even a temporary shutdown of TikTok will cause permanent harm to applicants \u2014 a representative group of Americans who use TikTok to speak, associate, and listen \u2014 as well as the public at large.\"",
      "The Supreme Court could grant an injunction temporarily blocking the law while TikTok's appeal plays out, saving the app for the time being.",
      "The justices will also need to decide whether to hear the case once TikTok formally requests they do so. If they decline, the appeals court's ruling would be the final say on the matter, and the ban would go into effect, barring intervention by the president. If the high court takes the case, the injunction would almost certainly be in place \u2014 and thus the ban on hold \u2014 until the justices hear and decide the dispute. That process would likely take months.",
      "TikTok asked the justices to make a decision on its request for an injunction by Jan. 6 so that it can \"coordinate with their service providers to perform the complex task of shutting down the TikTok platform only in the United States\" if the justices decline.",
      "The company said a sale is not an option at this point, but a prolonged legal battle before the Supreme Court could buy time to explore a deal. The Chinese government is opposed to selling TikTok's algorithm, meaning a new buyer would be forced to rebuild it from scratch. The algorithm tailors video recommendations to each user and is made up of millions of lines of code.",
      "In its ruling earlier this month, the panel of judges from the U.S. Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit was sympathetic to the U.S. government's argument that TikTok poses a national security risk as long as the Chinese government can use it to collect data on its 170 million users in the U.S. and covertly manipulate the content those users see on the platform. The appeals court rejected TikTok's bid for temporary pause on the ban last week.",
      "Alan Morrison, an associate dean at George Washington University Law School, expects the Supreme Court to take up the case, but said TikTok is likely to face similar skepticism over its claims that the law violates the First Amendment. Morrison said an argument centered on a constitutional provision that prohibits \"bills of attainder\" could be more persuasive. A bill of attainder is legislation that punishes or targets a specific party without first going to trial.",
      "\"The bill of attainder was a much stronger claim than the First Amendment,\" said Morrison, who teaches constitutional law. \"Congress has decided what the new standard of the law is. It's decided who the defendant is \u2014 TikTok \u2014 and it's essentially adjudicated their guilt \u2014 guilt in a civil sense, not in a criminal sense \u2014 which is the mark of a bill of attainder.\"",
      "During oral arguments before the appeals panel in September, Judge Douglas Ginsburg pushed back on the notion that the law singles out TikTok, although it and ByteDance were the only companies named in the legislation. Ginsburg said the law \"describes a category of companies, all of which are owned by or controlled by adversary powers and subjects one company to an immediate necessity.\" He noted that TikTok and the government have been engaged in unsuccessful negotiations for years to try to find a solution to the national security concerns and it's \"the only company that sits in that situation.\"",
      "\"Maybe the Supreme Court will think differently,\" Morrison said.",
      "Trump and app stores could refuse to enforce a ban",
      "Sarah Kreps, the director of the Tech Policy Institute at Cornell University, said the incoming Trump administration could play a role in whether TikTok is banned.",
      "President-elect Donald Trump, who tried to ban the app with an executive order during his first term that was struck down in the courts, vowed this year to \"save\" it. On Monday, Trump touted TikTok as playing a role in helping him with the youth vote and winning the 2024 election. He told reporters that he would \"take a look at TikTok\" when asked how he planned to stop the ban.",
      "\"I have a warm spot in my heart for TikTok,\" he said. The same day, Trump met with TikTok's CEO Shou Chew at his Mar-a-Lago estate, sources familiar with the meeting told CBS News.",
      "Kreps said Trump has several options once he takes office on Jan. 20, the day after the law goes into effect.",
      "\"If [Trump] wants to save TikTok, he could ask Congress to repeal the ban. I don't think that's going to happen. He could ask the [Justice Department] not to enforce the law and signal to Apple and Google that they wouldn't be prosecuted. I don't think that's going to happen either,\" Kreps said. Android and iPhone users depend on the Google Play and Apple App Store to download apps, giving the tech giants a role in carrying out the ban.",
      "\"But what I think could happen is, all of these compliance issues take resources, so he could just simply not provide the resources to enforce the ban,\" Kreps said. \"I think there are ways bureaucratically he could try to massage this so that he's not overturning the ban, but he's also not strictly enforcing it.\"",
      "Trump also has the authority to issue a 90-day delay of the law once he's in office, although that move requires the president to certify to Congress that \"evidence of significant progress\" toward a divestiture has taken place.",
      "A provision in the law that gives the president the power to determine whether an app is no longer controlled by a foreign adversary presents another potential workaround, according to Erik Stallman, a clinical professor of law at the University of California, Berkeley. The law says the president determines when the divestiture requirements are met, although it stipulates that the determination has to happen through an interagency process.",
      "\"Trump can say that he's satisfied that this U.S.-based entity that they've set up is sufficiently distinct from ByteDance to no longer require a divestiture,\" Stallman said.",
      "During its back and forth with the U.S. government over the years, TikTok created a U.S.-based subsidiary, TikTok U.S. Data Security Inc., to limit ByteDance's access to user data. The move was meant to alleviate national security concerns about user data and the Chinese government's access. It also gave responsibility to Oracle, a U.S. company, to store and protect U.S. user data. Lawmakers, however, viewed those protections as insufficient, and passed the law requiring its sale anyway.",
      "Even if the law isn't enforced by the Trump administration, Apple and Google could decide that it's not worth the risk to host TikTok in their app stores. Both companies are already involved in litigation with the Justice Department involving other matters. The TikTok legislation imposes hefty fines on companies found to be in violation, and Trump or his eventual successor could change their minds on enforcement.",
      "\"I think they want to be above board on the things that they have some clear-cut control over and this would be one of them,\" Kreps said of Apple and Google.",
      "Google declined to comment on its plans. Apple did not return a request for comment.",
      "On Friday, the leaders of the House China Committee sent letters to Apple and Google telling them to be ready to remove TikTok from their app stores by Jan. 19. Though TikTok won't disappear from users' phones, app updates would no longer be available and those who don't already have TikTok would not be able to download it.",
      "Kreps expects TikTok users to migrate to other apps like Instagram and YouTube in the coming weeks if they haven't already. TikTok estimated that even a one-month shutdown would result in the platform losing a third of its daily users in the U.S.",
      "\"Every next step where they're blocked makes this more of a self-fulfilling prophecy,\" Kreps said. \"The more people start to migrate, the more this ban has its intended effect, which is to move people elsewhere. But also as people move elsewhere, the impact of a ban actually is mitigated also.\"",

    "story": [
      "Artificial intelligence-enabled voice cloning tools have made it easier for criminals to mimic strangers' voices and dupe victims into handing over large sums of money.",
      "For example, a scammer might target a victim posing as their grandchild and claiming they require cash \u2014 fast. Older people who might not be as familiar with new technologies such as AI can be particularly susceptible to these types of scams, particularly when the caller on the other line sounds identical to a loved one. Phone numbers also can be spoofed to mimic those of callers known to the target of voice cloning scams.",
      "In 2023, senior citizens were conned out of roughly $3.4 billion in a range of financial crimes, according to the FBI data. The agency recently\u00a0warned\u00a0that AI has increased the \"believability\" or criminal scams given that they \"assist with content creation and can correct for human errors that might otherwise serve as warning signs of fraud.\"",
      "Also commonly known as \"grandparent scams,\" a fraudster will impersonate an individual's loved one and claim they are in trouble, or need cash immediately for some sort of emergency.",
      "\"So much of it is based on psychology and hacking the limbic system,\" Chuck Herrin, field chief information security officer for F5, a security and fraud prevention firm, told CBS MoneyWatch. \"They say things that trigger a fear-based emotional response because they know when humans get afraid, we get stupid and don't exercise the best judgment.\"",
      "How to create a family safe word",
      "The good news? Cybersecurity experts and law enforcement officials have a simple, but effective, recommendation for avoiding getting victimized by such scams: creating a family \"safe word,\" along with a protocol for verifying a family member or loved one's identity.",
      "That means choosing a word or phrase that can't be easily guessed. Obvious identifiers like a street name, alma mater or other information that may be readily available online are ill-advised, experts say.",
      "\"It needs to be unique and should be something that's difficult to guess,\" James Scobey, chief information security officer at Keeper Security told CBS MoneyWatch. \"It shouldn't be something that can be researched online about you or your family. Avoid street names, towns, phone numbers and individual names as part of a pass phrase.\"",
      "A safe phrase, consisting of at least four words, offers a greater degree of security, he added.",
      "Verify the caller's identity",
      "Following a basic routine that includes using a safe word is a good first line of defense against scammers.",
      "\"This is a mass operation, they don't care about you, they just care about bad security. They are churning though thousands of people they found on the dark web,\" Herrin of F5 told CBS MoneyWatch. \"If you have a reasonable security posture, you'll probably be fine. But if you leave the window open, you'll lose your TV,\" he said, comparing cybersecurity threats to physical vulnerabilities.",
      "Any time you are asked for financial assistance, require that the caller verify his or her identity. The key: Always ask for the safe word before transferring any money.",
      "\"Family safe words can be a really useful tool if they are used properly,\" Eva Velasquez, said CEO of the Identity Theft Resource Center, a nonprofit focused on ID security.",
      "Velasquez gave the example of a phony grandchild calling a grandparent and saying something like, \"I am in jail and need help, and I am so distraught I can't remember our password.\" In a tense or emotional moment, the victim could be inclined to offer it up to the person in distress, putting themselves in jeopardy.",
      "\"I do think they can be a very useful tool, but you have to explain to the family how it works so you don't volunteer it,\" she said. \"We have had a couple incidents where the victim will say the safe word first instead of letting the other person say it.\"",

    "published": "Fri, 13 Dec 2024 19:32:51 -0500",
    "summary": "TikTok is now expected to ask the Supreme Court to weigh in.",
    "story": [
      "Washington \u2014 A federal appeals court on Friday denied TikTok's bid to delay a law from taking effect that will ban the popular short-form video app next month if its Chinese parent company does not sell its stake.",
      "\"The petitioners rely upon their claims under the First Amendment to justify preliminarily enjoining the Act. As to those claims, this court has already unanimously concluded the Act satisfies the requirements of the First Amendment under heightened scrutiny,\" the order from the U.S. Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit\u00a0said.",
      "TikTok is expected to ask the Supreme Court to weigh in, though it's unclear if the court will agree to hear the case or make a decision before the law is applied on Jan. 19.",
      "The law, which was passed by Congress in April as part of a foreign assistance package, gave TikTok nine months to sever ties with its parent company ByteDance or lose access to app stores and web-hosting services in the U.S. President Biden quickly signed the bill into law, which includes the possibility of a one-time 90-day delay granted by the president if a sale is in progress by then.",
      "But the Chinese government has vowed to block a potential sale of TikTok's algorithm which tailors content recommendations to each user. A new buyer would be forced to rebuild the algorithm that powers the app, which is unfeasible, according to TikTok and ByteDance's lawyers.",
      "TikTok suffered another setback on Dec. 6 when the appeals court\u00a0denied its bid to overturn the law, concluding that the U.S. government's national security concerns about the Chinese government's ability to use the app to spy on and covertly influence Americans were \"compelling\" and \"well-founded.\"",
      "TikTok and ByteDance then asked the appeals court to temporarily block the law from going into effect pending a Supreme Court review. A pause would also give the Trump administration time to act, the companies said in their Dec. 9 court filing. President-elect Donald Trump spearheaded an effort to ban TikTok during his first term, but has since said he would \"save\" the app.",
      "Allowing the law to take effect, even for a short time, would be detrimental to the platform, the filing argued. TikTok estimated that it could lose a third of its daily users in the U.S. within the first month of a shutdown. About 170 million people in the U.S. use TikTok.",
      "But the Justice Department pushed back on the assertion that TikTok would face \"immediate harm\" if the law was not paused. In its response, it noted that Americans who have already downloaded the app can continue using it after Jan. 19, though updates would no longer be available.",
      "On Friday, the leaders of the House China Committee sent letters to Google and Apple telling them to be ready to remove TikTok from their app stores by Jan. 19.",
      "Rep. John Moolenaar of Michigan, the Republican chairman of the committee, and Rep. Raja Krishnamoorthi of Illinois, the panel's top Democrat, also sent a letter to TikTok urging it to sell the app.",
      "\"Congress has acted decisively to defend the national security of the United States and protect TikTok's American users from the Chinese Communist Party. We urge TikTok to immediately execute a qualified divestiture,\" they wrote.",

    "story": [
      "Character.AI, the artificial intelligence company that has been the subject of two lawsuits alleging its chatbots inappropriately interacted with underage users, said teenagers will now have a different experience than adults when using the platform.",
      "Character.AI users can create original chatbots or interact with existing bots. The bots, powered by large language models (LLMs), can send lifelike messages and engage in text conversations with users.",
      "One lawsuit, filed in October, alleges that a 14-year-old boy died by suicide after engaging in a monthslong virtual emotional and sexual relationship with a Character.AI chatbot named \"Dany.\" Megan Garcia told \"CBS Mornings\" that her son, Sewell Setzer, III, was an honor student and athlete, but began to withdraw socially and stopped playing sports as he spent more time online, speaking to multiple bots but especially fixating on \"Dany.\"",
      "\"He thought by ending his life here, he would be able to go into a virtual reality or 'her world' as he calls it, her reality, if he left his reality with his family here,\" Garcia said.",
      "The second lawsuit, filed by two Texas families this month, said that Character.AI chatbots are \"a clear and present danger\" to young people and are \"actively promoting violence.\" According to the lawsuit, a chatbot told a 17-year-old that murdering his parents was a \"reasonable response\" to screen time limits. The plaintiffs said they wanted a judge to order the platform shut down until the alleged dangers are addressed, CBS News partner BBC News reported Wednesday.",
      "On Thursday, Character.AI announced new safety features \"designed especially with teens in mind\" and said it is collaborating with teen online safety experts to design and update features. Users must be 13 or older to create an account. A Character.AI spokesperson told CBS News that users self-report their age, but the site has tools preventing re-tries if someone fails the age gate.",
      "The safety features include modifications to the site's LLM and improvements to detection and intervention systems, the site said in a news release\u00a0Thursday. Teen users will now interact with a separate LLM, and the site hopes to \"guide the model away from certain responses or interactions, reducing the likelihood of users encountering, or prompting the model to return, sensitive or suggestive content,\" Character.AI said. Character.AI's spokesperson described this model as \"more conservative.\" Adult users will use a separate LLM.",
      "\"This suite of changes results in a different experience for teens from what is available to adults  - with specific safety features that place more conservative limits on responses from the model, particularly when it comes to romantic content,\" it said.",
      "Character.AI said that often, negative responses from a chatbot are caused by users prompting it \"to try to elicit that kind of response.\" To limit those negative responses, the site is adjusting its user input tools, and will end the conversations of users who submit content that violates the site's terms of service and community guidelines. If the site detects \"language referencing suicide or self-harm,\" it will share information directing users to the National Suicide Prevention Lifeline in a pop-up. The way bots respond to negative content will also be altered for teen users, Character.AI said.",
      "Other new features include parental controls, which are set to be launched in the first quarter of 2025. It will be the first time the site has had parental controls, Character.AI said, and plans to \"continue evolving these controls to provide parents with additional tools.\"",
      "Users will also receive a notification after an hour-long session on the platform. Adult users will be able to customize their \"time spent\" notifications, Character.AI said, but users under 18 will have less control over them. The site will also display \"prominent disclaimers\" reminding users that the chatbot characters are not real. Disclaimers already exist on every chat, Character.AI said.",

      "Michigan City, Indiana \u2014 An Indiana man convicted of killing four people including his brother and his sister's fianc\u00e9 decades ago was put to death Wednesday, without any independent witness, marking the state's first execution in 15 years.",
      "Joseph Corcoran, 49, was pronounced dead at 12:44 a.m. CST at the Indiana State Prison in Michigan City, Indiana, the Indiana Department of Correction said in a statement. CBS Indianapolis affiliate WTTV reports that officials said the execution process started just after midnight.",
      "Corcoran was scheduled to be executed with the powerful sedative pentobarbital, but the state agency's statement did not mention that drug. Corcoran's execution was the 24th in the U.S. this year.",
      "According to WTTV,\u00a0 the statement said Corcoran told officials his last words were,\u00a0\"Not really. Let's get this over with.\"",
      "He was convicted in the July 1997 shootings of his brother, 30-year-old James Corcoran, his sister's fianc\u00e9, 32-year-old Robert Scott Turner, and two other men, Timothy G. Bricker, 30, and Douglas A. Stillwell, 30.",
      "According to court records, before Corcoran fatally shot the four victims he was under stress because the forthcoming marriage of his sister to Turner would necessitate moving out of the Fort Wayne, Indiana, home he shared with his brother and sister.",
      "While jailed for those killings, Corcoran reportedly bragged about fatally shooting his parents in 1992 in northern Indiana's Steuben County. He was charged in their killings but acquitted.",
      "Last summer, Gov. Eric Holcomb announced plans to resume state executions following a yearslong hiatus marked by a scarcity of lethal injection drugs nationwide.",
      "The state provided limited details about the execution process, and no media witnesses were permitted under state law.",
      "Indiana and Wyoming are the only two states that do not allow members of the media to witness state executions, according to a recent report by the Death Penalty Information Center.",
      "Corcoran's attorneys had fought his death penalty sentence for years, arguing he was severely mentally ill, which affected his ability to understand and make decisions. This month, his attorneys asked the Indiana Supreme Court to stop his execution but the request was denied.",
      "Corcoran exhausted his federal appeals in 2016. But his attorneys asked the U.S. District Court of Northern Indiana last week to stop his execution and hold a hearing to decide if it would be unconstitutional because Corcoran has a serious mental illness. The court declined to intervene Friday, and the U.S. Court of Appeals for the 7th Circuit did the same Tuesday.",
      "Corcoran's attorneys then asked the U.S. Supreme Court issue an emergency order halting his execution, but the high court denied their request for a stay late Tuesday, ending Corcoran's options with the courts.",
      "His sole remaining hope then became Holcomb, who could have commuted Corcoran's death sentence. But that commutation never came and the execution proceeded as scheduled.",
      "WTTV says Holcomb issued a statement saying\u00a0Corcoran's case \"has been reviewed repeatedly over the last 25 years \u2013 including 7 times by the Indiana Supreme Court and 3 times by the U.S. Supreme Court, the most recent of which was tonight. His sentence has never been overturned and was carried out as ordered by the court.\"",
      "Indiana's last state execution was in 2009 when Matthew Wrinkles was put to death for killing his wife, her brother and sister-in-law in 1994.",
      "Since then, 13 executions were carried out in Indiana, but those were initiated and performed by federal officials in 2020 and 2021 at a federal prison in Terre Haute.",
      "State officials have said they couldn't continue executions because a combination of drugs used in lethal injections had become unavailable.",
      "For years, there has been a shortage across the country because pharmaceutical companies have refused to sell their products for that purpose. That's pushed states, including Indiana, to turn to compounding pharmacies, which manufacture drugs specifically for a client. Some use more accessible drugs such as the sedatives pentobarbital or midazolam, both of which, critics say, can cause intense pain.",
      "Religious groups, disability rights advocates and others have opposed his execution. About a dozen people, some holding candles, held a vigil late Tuesday to pray outside the prison, which is surrounded by barbed wire fences in a residential area about 60 miles east of Chicago.",
      "\"We can build a society without giving governmental authorities the right to execute their own citizens,\" said Bishop Robert McClory of the Diocese of Gary, who led the prayers.",
      "Other death penalty opponents also demonstrated outside the prison Tuesday night, some holding signs that read \"Execution Is Not The Solution\" and \"Remember The Victims But Not With More Killing.\"",
      "\"There is no need and no benefit from this execution. It's all show,\" said Abraham Borowitz, director of Death Penalty Action, his organization that protests every execution in the U.S.",
      "Prison officials said in a brief statement Tuesday evening that Corcoran \"requested Ben & Jerry's ice cream for his last meal.\"",
      "Corcoran said farewell late Tuesday to relatives, including his wife, Tahina Corcoran, who told reporters outside the prison that they discussed their faith and their memories, including attending high school together. She reiterated her request for Indiana's governor to commute her husband's death sentence.",

      "\"This was a frightening, well-planned, targeted murder that was intended to cause shock, attention and intimidation,\" Manhattan DA Alvin Bragg said. \"It occurred in one of the most bustling parts of our city, threatening the safety of local residents and tourists alike, commuters and business people just starting out on their day.\"",
      "Bragg addressed how his office can prove terrorism.",
      "\"This was a killing that, it was intended to evoke terror, and we've seen that reaction,\" Bragg said. \"You know, the statutory elements we can go into, but its most basic term, that's what this is. This was not an ordinary killing. Not to suggest that any killing is ordinary, but this was extraordinary, and the New York State Legislature has set out both the paths that we talked about, both the murder one and murder two, and this, we allege, is certainly squarely within those statutes which talk about intending to do.\"",
      "Bragg said the maximum penalty for murder in the first degree and murder in the second degree as an act of terrorism is life without parole, and a conviction for murder in the second degree will carry a sentence of 25 years to life.",
      "Mangione was also charged with multiple counts of criminal possession of a weapon and criminal possession of a forged instrument for the fake ID that investigators allege Mangione used to check into a Manhattan hostel before the shooting on Dec. 4.",

The suspect extended his stay at the Hostel multiple times.Mangione left the hostel at 5:34 a.m. on the morning of Dec. 4 and travelled to Midtown using an e-bike. Between 5:52 a.m. and 6:45 a.m., he walked near and around the Hilton Hotel. At approximately 6:15 a.m., he purchased a water bottle and granola bars at the Starbucks at 1290 Sixth Ave.Between approximately 6:38 a.m. and 6:44 a.m., Mangione stood against a wall on the north side of West 54th Street across from the Hilton, fully masked with his hood up.Mangione crossed the street to the Hilton Hotel at 6:45 a.m. and, armed with a 9mm 3D-printed ghost gun equipped with a silencer, approached Thompson from behind and shot him once in the back and once in the leg.Mangione then fled northeast on 54th Street and took an e-bike uptown. He eventually got into a taxi and was dropped off at West 178th Street and Amsterdam Avenue and then fled the state.",

    "story": [
      "President-elect Donald Trump announced he will nominate Herschel Walker, the former football player whose 2022 Senate run was plagued by controversy, to serve as U.S. ambassador to the Bahamas.",
      "\"Herschel has spent decades serving as an Ambassador to our Nation's youth, our men and women in the Military, and athletes at home and abroad,\" Trump said on social media Tuesday night.",
      "Walker would need to be confirmed by the Senate to assume the role. The Senate has not confirmed a U.S. ambassador to the Bahamas in over a decade. Former President Barack Obama had nominated Cassandra Butts for the role in 2014, but the Senate never even brought her nomination up for a vote, according to The Associated Press. She died in 2016.",
      "Trump in his first term nominated Doug Manchester in 2017 for the ambassador role, but his nomination stalled for over two years. CBS News in 2019 also uncovered evidence of a possible pay-to-play scheme for the role. He eventually withdrew and Trump went on to nominate William Douglass in 2020. Douglass' nomination was withdrawn by President Biden when he took office, and Mr. Biden in turn nominated Calvin Smyre, who has not been confirmed by the Senate.",
      "Absent an official ambassador to the Bahamas, Kimberly Furnish currently serves in the role of Charg\u00e9 d'Affaires.",
      "Walker rose to national prominence as a star running back for the Georgia Bulldogs, winning the Heisman trophy in 1982. He spent his first few years of professional ball in the United States Football League before it folded, and then moved on to the NFL.",
      "Walker reentered the national spotlight when, at Trump's urging, he challenged Georgia's Democratic Senator Raphael Warnock for his seat in 2022. The race featured several controversies, including two women claiming that Walker \u2014 who was running as an anti-abortion candidate \u2014 had paid for them to get abortions.",
      "Walker denied both allegations.",
      "In one instance, Walker admitted to writing a check for a woman who said he paid for her to get an abortion in 2009, but he said he hadn't known what the money was for.",
      "Another woman claimed Walker paid her to get an abortion while the two carried out a six-year relationship while he was married to another woman and playing in the NFL. During a news conference back in 2022, she said she couldn't go through with the procedure when she went to get it herself, so Walker took her to a clinic in the Dallas area the next day and waited for her while she got the abortion.",
      "\"This was a lie a week ago and it is a lie today,\" Walker said at the time following an interview the woman gave a week after the initial news conference.",

    "published": "Tue, 17 Dec 2024 21:52:39 -0500",
    "summary": "Leaders in Congress unveiled a measure to keep the government funded, facing a Friday night deadline to avert a government shutdown.",
    "story": [
      "Washington \u2014 Leaders in Congress on Tuesday unveiled a lengthy stopgap measure to keep the government funded into the spring, with just days to go to prevent a government shutdown.",
      "Congress has until Friday night to stave off a funding lapse, since lawmakers approved a continuing resolution in September to keep the government funded through Dec. 20. The new stopgap measure, with approval from the House, Senate and President Biden, would keep the government funded through March 14, giving lawmakers more time to reach agreement on new spending bills when the GOP controls both the House and the Senate.",
      "The 1,500 page stopgap measure also includes a one-year extension of the farm bill, around $100 billion in disaster aid and $10 billion in economic assistance to farmers.",
      "The continuing resolution's release comes under the wire, with House leaders under pressure to abide by a 72-hour rule for members to review legislation before it's brought to the floor. Johnson said Tuesday morning that he believes in adhering to the rule, but with the end of week deadline fast approaching, he may be out of options.",
      "The speaker also said that House Republican leadership is committed to passing the continuing resolution through the regular process, including by going through the House Rules Committee, where it's almost certain to face opposition from GOP hardliners that could further slow the path to passage.",
      "In a statement late Tuesday night, Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer said that he was \"pleased these negotiations led to a bipartisan government funding agreement free of cuts and poison pills, while also securing Democratic priorities like millions for child care, workforce training and job placement, assistance for the Key Bridge rebuild, additional disaster relief funding and more.\"",
      "Even before its release, lawmakers on the party's right flank had begun expressing opposition to the stopgap measure. Rep. Chip Roy, a Texas Republican who sits on the Rules Committee, told reporters after the House GOP conference meeting Tuesday morning that \"this is not the process that we signed up for,\" saying lawmakers are supposed to be able to amend and debate key legislation on the House floor.",
      "\"We get this negotiated crap and we're forced to eat this crap sandwich,\" Roy said. \"Why? Because freaking Christmas is right around the corner. It's the same dang thing every year \u2014 legislate by crisis, legislate by calendar, not legislate because it's the right thing to do.\"",
      "Leadership could instead opt to bring the legislation to the floor under a procedure known as suspension of the rules, leaning on Democrats to reach a two-thirds majority needed for passage in order to get the legislation more swiftly to the Senate before the end-of-week deadline.",
      "House Democratic Caucus Chair Pete Aguilar acknowledged Tuesday morning that Republicans will need Democrats to approve government funding, saying the dynamic \"has been the case this Congress,\" and \"it will continue to be the case in the next Congress.\"",
      "\"This is a lesson for Speaker Johnson,\" Aguilar said. \"Let's find solutions, let's tune out the most extreme voices in your conference, and let's find that consensus that will be necessary to fund government.\"",
      "Johnson has previously expressed distaste for large end-of-year funding measures known as omnibuses, and pledged to avoid the practice of pushing through spending before the holiday recess. He defended the continuing resolution Tuesday, saying \"it is not an omnibus\" and arguing that it will put the party in a position to \"put our fingerprints on what those final spending bills are\" in the new year. And he noted that House Republicans are aiming to resolve the government funding fight earlier in the year, before the March 14 deadline.",
      "Even with this week's tight timeline, lawmakers are expected to thwart the threat of a shutdown, with little appetite in Washington for a funding lapse.",
      "Sen. Patty Murray, the top Democratic appropriator in the Senate, said ahead of the legislation's release Tuesday afternoon that negotiators should have already finished their work, but were delayed by \"an eleventh-hour demand from the speaker.\"",
      "\"We are heading into the holidays and the nation really needs a bipartisan package that will prevent a needless shutdown, keep our government open, and get much needed support to areas across the country that are recovering from disaster,\" Murray said.",
      "The speaker said lawmakers have been \"working around the clock to get the CR done,\" noting that it was intended to be \"a very simple, very clean\" stopgap funding measure to get the party into the new year. But the Louisiana Republican said a \"couple of intervening things\" occurred, citing the devastation caused by hurricanes Helene and Milton earlier this year. Johnson said the stopgap measure includes disaster relief that is \"critically important,\" and provides aid to farmers.",
      "\"What would have been a very skinny, very simple clean CR, these other pieces have been added to it,\" Johnson said.",

      "Megan Thee Stallion asked a court on Tuesday to issue a restraining order against Tory Lanez, who she says is harassing her from prison through surrogates as he serves a 10-year sentence for shooting her in the feet back in 2020 in Los Angeles.",
      "The petition filed by the hip-hop star in Los Angeles Superior Court asks the judge to prevent the Canadian rapper Lanez, whose legal name is Daystar Peterson, from using third parties to continue the same online harassment of Megan, whose legal name is Megan Pete, that he engaged in and encouraged before his imprisonment.",
      "\"Even now, while behind bars, Mr. Peterson shows no signs of stopping,\" the petition says. \"Despite being sentenced to 10 years in prison for shooting Ms. Pete, Mr. Peterson continues to to subject her to repeated trauma and revictimization.\"",
      "An email from The Associated Press seeking comment from Lanez's lawyers was not immediately returned. A court hearing on the order is scheduled for Jan. 9.",
      "The filing says bloggers acting on Lanez's behalf continue to cast doubt on her allegations, making false claims including that the gun and bullet fragments in the case are missing. It also comes after Pete\u00a0filed a lawsuit in October against blogger Milagro Gramz, accusing Gramz of purposely spreading false information on behalf of Lanez.",
      "That lawsuit was filed in the Southern District of Florida against Gramz, a popular content creator who is legally known as Milagro Elizabeth Cooper. The lawsuit accuses Cooper of intentionally causing Pete emotional distress by cyberstalking, promoting and sharing deepfake pornography of Pete and questioning if she was actually shot.",
      "Tuesday's petition says a protective order issued to prevent previous harassment is no longer in effect, which it calls a loophole and flaw in the criminal justice system. Lanez is being held at a California prison in rural Tehachapi.",
      "In December 2022, Lanez was convicted of three felonies: assault with a semiautomatic firearm; having a loaded, unregistered firearm in a vehicle and discharging a firearm with gross negligence.",
      "A judge rejected a motion for a new trial from Lanez's lawyers, who are appealing his conviction.",
      "In August of last year, he received the 10-year sentence, bringing what seemed to be a conclusion to a three-year legal and cultural saga that saw two careers, and lives, thrown into turmoil.",
      "Megan testified during the trial that in July 2020, after they left a party at Kylie Jenner's Hollywood Hills home, Lanez fired the gun at the back of her feet and shouted for her to dance as she walked away from an SUV in which they had been riding. She revealed who had fired the gun only months later.",
      "The case created a firestorm in the hip-hop community, churning up issues including the reluctance of Black victims to speak to police, gender politics in hip-hop, online toxicity, protecting Black women and the ramifications of misogynoir, a particular brand of misogyny Black women experience.",

      "Astronauts Butch Wilmore and Suni Williams traveled to the space station aboard the Starliner back in June.

      "To be eligible, pass holders must be U.S. residents and members of Frontier Miles, the airline's loyalty program, before they purchase the annual membership. If they're not members, they'll automatically be enrolled.",
      "\"The GoWild! Pass is perfect for spontaneous adventurers, budget-savvy travelers and anyone dreaming of limitless journeys,\" Frontier Airlines chief commercial officer Bobby Schroeter said in a statement. \"At $299, this is the lowest price we've ever offered, making it easier than ever to explore amazing destinations across the U.S., Caribbean, Mexico and Latin America. This limited-time pricing will only be offered to those who act fast!\"",

      "Once you purchase the $299 deal, you can book tickets on select Frontier flights for just a penny.",
      "The airline warns that not every flight operated by Frontier is available for booking through the GoWild! pass. Additionally, pass holders must pay any taxes and fees associated with the airfare.",
      "What kind of seat do you get?",
      "GoWild! pass holders cannot reserve seats in advance, nor do their fares include carry-on or checked baggage, although these extras may be purchased separately.",
      "When can I book flights?",
      "The unlimited pass allows travelers to make reservations the day before a flight's departure for domestic travel, and ten days before an international flight's departure date.",
      "The pass is valid for travel between May 1, 2025, and April 30, 2026, Frontier said.",
      "There are certain blackout dates around holidays and other busy travel periods, during which the GoWild! Pass cannot be redeemed for a plane ticket. Additionally, pass holders cannot purchase tickets on behalf of other travelers.",

    "title": "How TikTok could avoid being banned in the U.S.",
    "published": "Tue, 17 Dec 2024 14:52:41 -0500",
    "summary": "The TikTok ban is set to go into effect next month barring a last-minute sale or Supreme Court action.",
    "story": [
      "Washington \u2014 TikTok's fate in the U.S. appears to be hanging by a thread after a federal appeals court denied its plea to delay a law that will ban the widely popular app if it does not cut ties with its Chinese parent company ByteDance.",
      "The law, which goes into effect on Jan. 19, gave ByteDance nine months to sell TikTok. Absent a sale, the app will be cut off from app stores and web-hosting services in the U.S. The law also gives the president the ability to grant a 90-day delay if a sale is in progress.",
      "According to experts, TikTok has several pathways for avoiding a ban, most notably intervention from the Supreme Court or the incoming Trump administration declining to enforce it. Other options, like a last-minute sale or Congress deciding to repeal the law, appear less likely.",
      "TikTok turns to the Supreme Court",
      "On Monday, TikTok asked the Supreme Court to temporarily pause the law, arguing the appeals court's decision upholding it was \"utterly antithetical to the First Amendment.\"",
      "\"If the Act is allowed to take effect in January 2025 \u2026 this Court will lose its ability to grant applicants meaningful relief,\" lawyers for TikTok and ByteDance wrote. \"Even a temporary shutdown of TikTok will cause permanent harm to applicants \u2014 a representative group of Americans who use TikTok to speak, associate, and listen \u2014 as well as the public at large.\"",
      "The Supreme Court could grant an injunction temporarily blocking the law while TikTok's appeal plays out, saving the app for the time being.",
      "The justices will also need to decide whether to hear the case once TikTok formally requests they do so. If they decline, the appeals court's ruling would be the final say on the matter, and the ban would go into effect, barring intervention by the president. If the high court takes the case, the injunction would almost certainly be in place \u2014 and thus the ban on hold \u2014 until the justices hear and decide the dispute. That process would likely take months.",
      "TikTok asked the justices to make a decision on its request for an injunction by Jan. 6 so that it can \"coordinate with their service providers to perform the complex task of shutting down the TikTok platform only in the United States\" if the justices decline.",
      "The company said a sale is not an option at this point, but a prolonged legal battle before the Supreme Court could buy time to explore a deal. The Chinese government is opposed to selling TikTok's algorithm, meaning a new buyer would be forced to rebuild it from scratch. The algorithm tailors video recommendations to each user and is made up of millions of lines of code.",
      "In its ruling earlier this month, the panel of judges from the U.S. Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit was sympathetic to the U.S. government's argument that TikTok poses a national security risk as long as the Chinese government can use it to collect data on its 170 million users in the U.S. and covertly manipulate the content those users see on the platform. The appeals court rejected TikTok's bid for temporary pause on the ban last week.",
      "Alan Morrison, an associate dean at George Washington University Law School, expects the Supreme Court to take up the case, but said TikTok is likely to face similar skepticism over its claims that the law violates the First Amendment. Morrison said an argument centered on a constitutional provision that prohibits \"bills of attainder\" could be more persuasive. A bill of attainder is legislation that punishes or targets a specific party without first going to trial.",
      "\"The bill of attainder was a much stronger claim than the First Amendment,\" said Morrison, who teaches constitutional law. \"Congress has decided what the new standard of the law is. It's decided who the defendant is \u2014 TikTok \u2014 and it's essentially adjudicated their guilt \u2014 guilt in a civil sense, not in a criminal sense \u2014 which is the mark of a bill of attainder.\"",
      "During oral arguments before the appeals panel in September, Judge Douglas Ginsburg pushed back on the notion that the law singles out TikTok, although it and ByteDance were the only companies named in the legislation. Ginsburg said the law \"describes a category of companies, all of which are owned by or controlled by adversary powers and subjects one company to an immediate necessity.\" He noted that TikTok and the government have been engaged in unsuccessful negotiations for years to try to find a solution to the national security concerns and it's \"the only company that sits in that situation.\"",
      "\"Maybe the Supreme Court will think differently,\" Morrison said.",
      "Trump and app stores could refuse to enforce a ban",
      "Sarah Kreps, the director of the Tech Policy Institute at Cornell University, said the incoming Trump administration could play a role in whether TikTok is banned.",
      "President-elect Donald Trump, who tried to ban the app with an executive order during his first term that was struck down in the courts, vowed this year to \"save\" it. On Monday, Trump touted TikTok as playing a role in helping him with the youth vote and winning the 2024 election. He told reporters that he would \"take a look at TikTok\" when asked how he planned to stop the ban.",
      "\"I have a warm spot in my heart for TikTok,\" he said. The same day, Trump met with TikTok's CEO Shou Chew at his Mar-a-Lago estate, sources familiar with the meeting told CBS News.",
      "Kreps said Trump has several options once he takes office on Jan. 20, the day after the law goes into effect.",
      "\"If [Trump] wants to save TikTok, he could ask Congress to repeal the ban. I don't think that's going to happen. He could ask the [Justice Department] not to enforce the law and signal to Apple and Google that they wouldn't be prosecuted. I don't think that's going to happen either,\" Kreps said. Android and iPhone users depend on the Google Play and Apple App Store to download apps, giving the tech giants a role in carrying out the ban.",
      "\"But what I think could happen is, all of these compliance issues take resources, so he could just simply not provide the resources to enforce the ban,\" Kreps said. \"I think there are ways bureaucratically he could try to massage this so that he's not overturning the ban, but he's also not strictly enforcing it.\"",
      "Trump also has the authority to issue a 90-day delay of the law once he's in office, although that move requires the president to certify to Congress that \"evidence of significant progress\" toward a divestiture has taken place.",
      "A provision in the law that gives the president the power to determine whether an app is no longer controlled by a foreign adversary presents another potential workaround, according to Erik Stallman, a clinical professor of law at the University of California, Berkeley. The law says the president determines when the divestiture requirements are met, although it stipulates that the determination has to happen through an interagency process.",
      "\"Trump can say that he's satisfied that this U.S.-based entity that they've set up is sufficiently distinct from ByteDance to no longer require a divestiture,\" Stallman said.",
      "During its back and forth with the U.S. government over the years, TikTok created a U.S.-based subsidiary, TikTok U.S. Data Security Inc., to limit ByteDance's access to user data. The move was meant to alleviate national security concerns about user data and the Chinese government's access. It also gave responsibility to Oracle, a U.S. company, to store and protect U.S. user data. Lawmakers, however, viewed those protections as insufficient, and passed the law requiring its sale anyway.",
      "Even if the law isn't enforced by the Trump administration, Apple and Google could decide that it's not worth the risk to host TikTok in their app stores. Both companies are already involved in litigation with the Justice Department involving other matters. The TikTok legislation imposes hefty fines on companies found to be in violation, and Trump or his eventual successor could change their minds on enforcement.",
      "\"I think they want to be above board on the things that they have some clear-cut control over and this would be one of them,\" Kreps said of Apple and Google.",
      "Google declined to comment on its plans. Apple did not return a request for comment.",
      "On Friday, the leaders of the House China Committee sent letters to Apple and Google telling them to be ready to remove TikTok from their app stores by Jan. 19. Though TikTok won't disappear from users' phones, app updates would no longer be available and those who don't already have TikTok would not be able to download it.",
      "Kreps expects TikTok users to migrate to other apps like Instagram and YouTube in the coming weeks if they haven't already. TikTok estimated that even a one-month shutdown would result in the platform losing a third of its daily users in the U.S.",
      "\"Every next step where they're blocked makes this more of a self-fulfilling prophecy,\" Kreps said. \"The more people start to migrate, the more this ban has its intended effect, which is to move people elsewhere. But also as people move elsewhere, the impact of a ban actually is mitigated also.\"",

    "published": "Tue, 17 Dec 2024 11:21:45 -0500",
    "summary": "Republicans wants to extend 2017 tax cuts that expire next year and could let ACA subsidies lapse to help pay the tab, according to analysts.",
    "story": [
      "The Affordable Care Act, also known as Obamacare, remains popular with the public, garnering the approval of 54% of U.S. adults, according to a recently released Gallup poll. But experts say that may not insulate the federal health insurance program from change as President-elect Donald Trump and his fellow Republicans look to renew $4 trillion in expiring tax cuts.",
      "Many provisions of the 2017 Tax Cuts and Jobs Act\u00a0(TCJA), a signature law passed during Trump's first term, are due to sunset at the end of 2025. Republican leaders are now strategizing on how to extend the cuts, while the president-elect has also pledged to slash corporate taxes and eliminate taxes on workers' tips and overtime pay.",
      "But renewing the TCJA tax breaks alone without reducing federal spending would add nearly $4 trillion to the nation's deficit through 2035, according to the Committee for a Responsible Federal Budget, an advocacy group focused on reducing the nation's debt.",
      "Trump has already taken two of the biggest government programs \u2014 Social Security and Medicare \u2014 off the table for potential cuts. Reduced defense spending is also viewed as unlikely, meaning nearly half of federal spending would be protected, Larry Levitt, executive vice president for health policy at KFF (formerly Kaiser Family Foundation,)\u00a0said\u00a0in a recent JAMA article.",
      "That leaves \"Medicaid, which is the next largest source of federal spending, and the ACA as prime targets for spending cuts. The math is inescapable,\" Levitt stated.",
      "Will Trump repeal the ACA?",
      "By contrast, an outright repeal of the ACA is unlikely. While Trump has continued to criticize the health care expansion measure, he has retreated from his previous vows to axe the ACA entirely.",
      "\"President Trump will deliver on his pledge to make his highly successful tax cuts permanent and ease the financial burden on families across the country. He will also end the drain on our health care system so that our country can continue to care for Americans who rely on Medicaid, Medicare and Social Security,\" \u00a0Trump-Vance Transition Spokesperson Anna Kelly told CBS News.",
      "Support for the ACA hit a record\u00a055%\u00a0in 2017, the first time a majority of Americans approved of the health care law since Gallup started asking about it in 2012. That high watermark came a month after failed efforts by then-President Trump and the GOP to repeal and replace the law.",
      "\"The Affordable Care Act is still politically divisive, but overall more popular with the public than ever,\" Levitt told CBS MoneyWatch. \"It's unlikely Republicans will try to repeal the ACA again, but cuts to the ACA and Medicaid are quite possible if Republicans are looking to pay for tax cuts.\"",
      "Brad Ellis, senior director at Fitch Ratings, noted that Trump and Republican lawmakers have expressed interest in changing how the ACA operates, including introducing high-risk participant pools and possibly reducing subsidies for public exchange business. Such changes could hurt enrollment, he said in a recent report.",
      "During the presidential campaign, Trump said he had \"concepts of a plan\" to replace the ACA.",
      "\"Obamacare stinks,\" Trump recently told NBC News' \"Meet the Press. \"If we come up with a better answer, I would present that answer to Democrats and to everybody else and I'd do something about it.\"",
      "Big cuts without lifting a finger",
      "Republicans can make big cuts to the ACA simply by standing pat. That's because enhanced ACA premium subsidies, which were enacted after President Biden was elected and the Democrats took control of Congress, are scheduled to lapse along with the 2017 tax cuts at the end of 2025. The drop in financial aid ACA enrollees would increase out-of-pocket premiums by an average of $705 a year, or 79%, according to a KFF\u00a0analysis.",
      "The Congressional Budget Office\u00a0projects that letting the additional ACA subsidies expire would reduce the federal deficit by $335 billion over a decade, relative to extending them permanently.",
      "Enrollment in the ACA nearly doubled to a record 21 million after the enhanced subsidies went into effect. The CBO estimates that 6.9 million fewer people would be enrolled in ACA Marketplace plans without the subsidies, and 3.4 million more would be uninsured.",
      "The impact would be felt nationwide, but particularly in Southern states that have not expanded Medicaid eligibility under the ACA, according to Levitt, who noted that the five states with the fastest growth in ACA enrollment since 2020 are Georgia, Mississippi, South Carolina, Tennessee and Texas.",
      "\"Health care was not a big topic during the campaign, so I can imagine that voters could be surprised to see cuts to Medicaid and the ACA that they didn't hear about during the campaign,\" Levitt said. \"As frustrated as people are with the current state of health insurance, disrupting the status quo makes them nervous.\"",
      "Medicaid a target for cuts?",
      "Medicaid accounts for more than $600 billion a year in federal spending and covers 81 million people, according to KFF.",
      "\"There are indications that support for Medicaid will decrease under the new administration, suggesting lower enrollment and revenue headwinds for this program,\" stated Fitch's Ellis.",
      "Trump was silent on Medicaid during the 2024 campaign, but his budget proposals during his first administration included a\u00a0plan to cap federal spending on Medicaid. The Project 2025 plan prepared by the Heritage Foundation and a coalition of conservative groups, is recommending changes to Medicaid including a limit on federal spending.",
      "\"The centerpiece of several prominent plans \u2014 Project 2025, the Republican Study Committee fiscal year 2025 (RSC) budget and the fiscal year 2025 House GOP budget resolution \u2014 is to cap and deeply cut federal Medicaid funding,\" Edwin Park, a research professor at the Georgetown University McCourt School of Public Policy's Center for Children and Families, noted in September.",
      "Trump sought distance himself from Project 2025 in the months leading up to the election, criticizing some of its policy proposal as \"abysmal.\"",
      "But Levitt said the ACA and Medicaid could still end up facing cuts as the Republicans, who will control the White House and both houses of Congress, hash out their fiscal plans after President-elect Trump assumes office.",
      "\"So much depends on whether there is pressure to pay for tax cuts with spending reductions. If Republicans are willing to cut taxes and increase the deficit, we may not see big cuts to the ACA and Medicaid,\" said Levitt. \"There are Republicans who may insist on spending cuts to offset tax cuts. If that's the case, the ACA and Medicaid are very likely to be on the chopping block.\"",

    "summary": "The head of Russia's chemical and biological forces, Lt. General Igor Kirillov, was killed in a Moscow bomb blast claimed by Ukraine.",
    "story": [
      "The head of the Russian military's biological and chemical weapons unit, Lt. General Igor Kirillov, was killed along with his deputy early Tuesday in an explosion in Moscow, Russia's Investigative Committee said. Ukrainian security sources told CBS News the Security Service of Ukraine (SBU) killed Kirillov in a special operation. The claim couldn't be independently verified, but Russian officials quickly vowed to take revenge against Ukraine's leaders.",
      "The sources said a scooter with explosives was detonated near Kirillov and his assistant outside an apartment building in the Russian capital. Video circulating online appeared to show the two men exiting a building right before an electric scooter parked near the entrance blew up.",
      "\"Kirillov was a war criminal and an absolutely legitimate target, since he gave orders to use prohibited chemical weapons against the Ukrainian military,\" an informed source in the SBU asserted to CBS News. \"Such an inglorious end awaits everyone who kills Ukrainians. Retribution for war crimes is inevitable.\"",
      "The deputy chairman of Russia's Security Council, Dmitry Medvedev, said Ukraine's leaders would face imminent revenge for the killing, Russia's RIA news agency reported.",
      "The bomb was triggered remotely and had the power equivalent to roughly 300 grams of TNT, Russian state news agency Tass reported, citing unnamed sources in the emergency services.",
      "\"Investigators, forensic experts and operational services are working at the scene,\" said Svetlana Petrenko, a spokesperson for Russia's national Investigative Committee, in a statement. \"Investigative and search activities are being carried out to establish all the circumstances around this crime.\"",
      "She also said the Kremlin was treating it as a terrorist attack.",
      "Kirillov and the unit he headed have been sanctioned by several countries, including the U.K., Canada and the U.S., for the use of chemical weapons in Ukraine.",
      "Ukraine's SBU has said it recorded more than 4,800 occasions when Russia used chemical weapons on the battlefield since President Vladimir Putin launched his full-scale invasion in February 2022. In May, the U.S. State Department announced sanctions against Kirillov's unit, saying the U.S. had recorded the use of chloropicrin, a poison gas first deployed in World War I, against Ukrainian troops.",
      "Kirillov, who had been in his post since April 2017, was also accused by the U.S. government of helping to spread disinformation about biological weapons and research.",
      "In March 2023, about a year into Russia's full-scale invasion, the U.S. State Department said Kirillov had \"significantly increased his media engagement\" to issue repeated, baseless claims that the U.S. government had been involved in creating both the mpox virus and COVID-19, and that the U.S. \"is developing biological weapons able to selectively target ethnic groups.\"",
      "\"The U.S. Government is concerned that this false narrative may be a prelude for a false-flag operation, where Russia itself uses biological, chemical, or nuclear weapons in Ukraine, and then attempts to blame it on Ukraine and/or the United States,\" the State Department said at the time.",
      "Russia has denied using any chemical weapons in Ukraine and, in turn, has accused Kyiv of using toxic agents in combat.",
      "Kirillov was sentenced in absentia by a Ukrainian court on Dec. 16 for the use of banned chemical weapons in Ukraine during Russia's military operation in Ukraine that started in Feb. 2022.",
      "Almost three years into Russia's ongoing war, Russian troops have made small but steady advances, adding to the nearly one-fifth of Ukraine they already control.",
      "Since Russia invaded, several prominent figures have been killed in targeted attacks believed to have been carried out by Ukraine.",

      "In December 2023, Illia Kiva, a former pro-Moscow Ukrainian lawmaker who fled to Russia, was shot and killed near Moscow. The Ukrainian military intelligence lauded the killing, warning that other \"traitors of Ukraine\" would share the same fate.",

    "summary": "Researchers determined that dozens of men, women and children were violently killed and cannibalized in Bronze Age-era England.",
    "story": [
      "New research suggests that dozens of Bronze-Age era Britons were killed in an attack unlike any previous known to archaelogists studying that time period and location.",
      "The research on human remains from Charterhouse Warren in southwest England, conducted by a team of researchers from multiple institutions including Oxford University, was published in Antiquity, a journal of world archaeology. It found that at least 37 Bronze Age-era men, women and children were \"killed and butchered\" and then cannibalized, with their bodies then thrown down a nearly 50-foot deep natural shaft. While archaeologists have found the remains of Bronze Age and later Britons who died violently, those incidents were largely isolated. Mass graves from this era have also been found, but the remains were laid to rest respectfully, unlike those studied.",
      "Researchers first became aware of the shaft in the 1970s. Two excavations were conducted in the 1970s and 1980s. The human remains, as well as some artifacts including a flint dagger, were found at multiple spots in the shaft during these digs. More than 3,000 individual human bones and bone fragments have been recovered overall. Those bones were used to estimate that at least 37 individual sets of remains were in the shaft. Different bone lengths show that the people killed were both male and female, and ranged in age from infants to grown adults. Ongoing research is working to determine how the people were related to each other.",
      "The way the remains were disposed of made the detailed examination possible, the researchers said. The shaft helped preserve the bones and keep them grouped together.",
      "The bones \"display clear evidence of blunt force trauma,\" according to researchers, suggesting that many of the people in the shaft \"suffered a violent death.\" Other injuries, including removal of the scalp and severed muscles in the jaw suggesting removal of the tongue or lower jaw, also likely occurred, evidenced by marks on the bones, the researchers said. Some of the victims may have been beheaded or dismembered.",
      "It's possible that the victims were held captive or ambushed, because of the severity of the injuries, the researchers said. It's not clear who could have carried out the attacks.",
      "There is also evidence that the bodies were cannibalized, the researchers said, including human teethmarks on the bones and indicators that marrow, the soft tissue inside bones, was removed. The researchers said the cannibalism was likely conducted \"within a context of a violent conflict, in which individuals are dehumanized and treated as animals.\"",
      "\"Some 37 men, women and children\u2014and possibly many more\u2014were killed at close quarters with blunt instruments and then systematically dismembered and defleshed, their long bones fractured in a way that can only be described as butchery,\" the researchers said.",
      "Later in the publication, the researchers referred to the scene as a \"massacre,\" and suggested it may have even been a \"political statement\" of violence so brazen it would have \"resonated across the wider region and over time.\" However, it's not clear what could have led to the violence: \"Neither climate change, ethnic conflict nor competition over material resources seem to offer convincing explanations,\" according to the researchers, leaving the only likely option that the violence broke out as part of a pattern of revenge or violence between communities.",
      "\"At this stage, our investigation has raised as many questions as it has answered,\" the researchers said. \"Work is ongoing to shed more light on this decidedly dark episode in British prehistory.\"",

    "story": [
      "Wellington, New Zealand \u2014 A powerful magnitude 7.3 earthquake struck just off the coast of Vanuatu on Tuesday, causing widespread destruction in the South Pacific island nation and reportedly killing at least six people. Casualties were arriving at hospitals and among the buildings seriously damaged in the capital of Port Vila was one that houses the U.S. embassy.",
      "A tsunami warning was called off less than two hours after the quake. With communications still down hours later and official information scarce, witness accounts of casualties began to surface on social media and through patchy phone calls.",
      "Katie Greenwood, the head of the International Federation of the Red Cross' Pacific branch, said in a social media post that at least six people had been confirmed dead and many more injured.",
      "The temblor hit just before 1 p.m. at a depth of 35 miles and was centered 18 miles west of Port Vila, the largest city in Vanuatu \u2014 a group of 80 islands that's home to about 330,000 people. It was followed by a magnitude 5.5 aftershock near the same location, with tremors continuing throughout the afternoon and evening.",
      "It wasn't immediately clear how much damage was caused as phone lines and government websites remained down, but Greenwood of the IFRC said multiple buildings had collapsed and the hospital in the capital was damaged.",
      "Doctors were working \"as fast as they could\" at a triage center outside the emergency ward, journalist Dan McGarry told The Associated Press, adding that the nation wasn't well equipped to deal with a mass casualty event. Video shared by the Vanuatu Broadcasting and Television Corporation showed crowds outside the hospital.",
      "In the first official information published by Vanuatu's government, the Geohazards Department said on social media that its monitoring systems remained offline due to power outages. Residents were urged to stay away from coastlines for at least 24 hours, and until tsunami and earthquake monitoring systems were operational once again.",
      "A video posted on social media appeared to show crumpled buildings in Port Vila, including one that had collapsed onto its lower floors and cars parked on the street below. Amanda Laithwaite said her husband was among a group of rescuers attempting to shift the roof of the three-story building because they believed people were trapped inside, but their progress was slow without specialist machinery.",
      "A building housing a number of diplomatic missions in Port Vila, including those of the U.S., Britain, France and New Zealand, was significantly damaged, several of its tenants said, but the U.S. Embassy said in a message posted on its Facebook page that all staff were safe, though the building was closed until further notice.",
      "The U.S. mission only opened in July, as part of a wider push by the U.S. to expand its Pacific presence to counter China's burgeoning influence on governments in the region.",
      "A video posted on social media showed the building with some damage, including buckled windows and debris that had crumbled from walls to the ground.",
      "The French news agency AFP said its photos showed the ground floor of the diplomatic building completely flattened. The bottom floor \"no longer exists,\" Vanuatu resident Michael Thompson told AFP by satellite phone after posting images of the destruction on social media. \"It is just completely flat. The top three floors are still holding but they have dropped.\"",
      "\"There's people in the buildings in town. There were bodies there when we walked past,\" Thompson said. The quake also knocked down at least two bridges and toppled other buildings, he said.",
      "McGarry, the journalist, said a \"massive landslide\" at the international shipping terminal was likely to impede the country's recovery. The airport's runway was also damaged, he said.",
      "Vanuatu's position on a subduction zone \u2014 where the Indo-Australia tectonic plate moves beneath the Pacific Plate \u2014 means earthquakes of magnitudes greater than 6 aren't uncommon, and the country's buildings are intended to withstand quake damage.",
      "\"I think it could have been worse,\" McGarry said. But this was the most serious he had experienced during 21 years in Vanuatu, \"by a long shot,\" he said.",
      "Port Vila's airport couldn't be contacted Tuesday, but flight tracking sites suggested all flights were grounded. Some airlines in Australia and the Pacific said they had cancelled or paused flights scheduled for Wednesday and were awaiting news of the airport's status.",
      "Australian Foreign Minister Penny Wong told reporters her country would provide whatever help was needed. New Zealand Foreign Minister Winston Peters said 45 New Zealanders were registered as being in Vanuatu and his government was \"deeply concerned\" about the situation there.",
      "Vanuatu has been led by four prime ministers in four years and is due to go to the polls in January for a snap election. In November, Prime Minister Charlot Salwai asked President Nikenike Vurobaravu to dissolve Parliament so he wouldn't have to face a no-confidence vote as his recent predecessors did.",

      "Until Moscow's ally Assad fled from Syria, Russia maintained its only major naval base outside of Russian territory in Tartus. Satellite imagery (below) showed most of the Russian ships disappearing from the Tartus port quickly after Assad fell, but the Russian Ministry of Defense said Monday that it was still figuring out what to do about its military hardware and personnel in the country, in talks with the country's new de-facto rebel rulers.",
      "Israel's military, meanwhile, says it has laid waste to most of Assad's heavy weapons and air defenses. In a statement on Monday, the Israel Defense Forces said that in recent days its fighter jets had \"inflicted severe damage on Syria's most strategic weapons: fighter jets and helicopters, Scud missiles, UAVs, cruise missiles, surface-to-sea precision-guided missiles, surface-to-air missiles, surface-to-surface missiles, radars, rockets, and more.\"",

      "Ahmed al-Sharaa, the head of HTS and Syria's new de-facto leader, has criticized what he described as Israel's \"uncalculated military adventures,\" and said he and his group \u2014 which, before publicly distancing itself from extremist ideology was an al-Qaeda affiliate \u2014 was more interested in state-building than opening another conflict with Israel.",
      "The targeting of Syria's military sites has also revealed deep neglect by Assad. Years of corruption and a decade of civil war had hollowed out the nation's armed forces, contributing to his regime's collapse. Much of the hardware left behind by his forces when they surrendered to the rebels or simply shed their uniforms and ran away is old and clearly lacking maintenance.",
      "Assad's office issued the first statement attributed to the deposed leader since he was forced to flee from his country, meanwhile. In it, he claims he never considered resigning nor fleeing, but that he took shelter in the Russian-run air base at Hmeimim as the rebels closed in, and when that facility came under a sustained drone attack, he says an evacuation was ordered on Dec. 8, the day after the HTS rebels took the capital Damascus.",
      "He said he eventually left for Russia as there was nothing else he could do in Syria, lamenting the country's fall \"into the hands of terrorism.\"",
      "The statement was posted to the Syrian Presidency's official channel on the Telegram messaging app, with a note saying it had been posted after several unsuccessful attempts to release it through Arabic and international media outlets. The statement was deleted relatively quickly from the Telegram channel, however, without any explanation, before reappearing there and on the presidency's Facebook page.",
      "While the wider international community is still trying to figure out how to deal with HTS, which has said it will respect Syrians all of religions and appears determined to be viewed as a secular interim administration \u2014 though it has not said what will come next for the country after a three-month transitional period \u2014 Israel and the U.S. have remained focused largely on securing Assad's stockpiled weapons.",
      "For Israel, that has meant the most ferocious airstrikes carried out in Syria in years, and they continued on Monday, just over a week after Assad's sudden departure.",
      "Whoever does end up in control of Syria will inherit a military infrastructure largely in tatters.

      "Hania said the RSF men held her and the other women and girls in a type of animal pen constructed with wire and tree branches, where they were chained up in groups of ten.",
      "\"What was clear from these cases is that in areas with RSF with control, absolutely nowhere is safe \u2013 not if you flee, or even in your home. Woman and girls are at risk of being raped no matter where,\" Wille told CBS News.",
      "Another woman, Hasina, 35, told HRW that six uniformed RSF men shot and killed her husband and stole all their cattle and money. She said the cows were her family's investment so, with them and her money stolen, she felt she had no means to flee like many of her neighbors had done, and she and her six young children, some just babies, had no choice but to stay in their home.",
      "The RSF fighters returned three days later, she said, and \"all three men raped me, and left.\"",
      "Later that evening, \"three more came back and raped me again and told me to stay in my house.\"",
      "She said she was gang-raped almost every day for the next month before she fled.",
      "HRW met Hasina at Camp Al-Hailu, a makeshift facility with little to no resources for internally displaced civilians in South Kordofan.",
      "\"She really is barely able to wake up and keep going because of what she lived through. Her kids are now in a camp with little food and looked very malnourished when I saw them. \u2026 She is struggling to function as a mother,\" said Wille, adding that women living in tents next to Hasina were helping to care for her kids.",
      "Wille said there was no psychological support for traumatized women in the camp or across much of the country.",
      "\"When I brought up the question of justice and accountability to these women, all of them looked blankly at me, as justice is a meaningless concept to them,\" she said. \"The scale with which it happens here means it's become normalized behavior by the RSF. None of these women have ever heard of a soldier or fighter ever being held accountable.\"",
      "Hania and a friend who was also pregnant managed to escape from their captors. They were interviewed by HRW in the Nuba mountains. They said 49 girls were still being held at the base and she'd heard of girls being held at two other RSF bases, as well.",
      "\"We have no way of finding out more about these women, as access is very difficult and dangerous, and in these areas there is no electricity, no cellphone networks, so no information comes out. There is an absolute silence on these abuses,\" said Wille. \"We will likely never know what happened to these women and girls.\"",
      "The International Rescue Committee charity says the humanitarian crisis driven by Sudan's civil war has been the biggest ever recorded for the second year in a row in 2024, with more than 30 million people in need of humanitarian aid. It's estimated that roughly half of Sudan's 50 million people are suffering from severe hunger.",
      "Last week, some 20 months into the war, the fighting appeared to intensify, with both sides accusing the other of carrying out fresh atrocities. International efforts to broker a peace agreement have stalled and there is no end in sight to the fighting.",

    "story": [
      "Rescue workers were rushing Monday to reach the remote French territory of Mayotte in the Indian Ocean after the archipelago was devastated by Cyclone Chido, the worst storm to hit the region in nearly a century.",
      "While the official death toll stood at 14, officials in Mayotte said they feared hundreds, if not thousands of people had been killed by the storm on the densely populated territory, which is home to around 300,000, according to The Associated Press.",
      "French authorities said entire neighborhoods \u2014 many of which consisted of poorly constructed slum-settlements \u2014 had been flattened, and public infrastructure including airports and hospitals was badly damaged, the AP reported. Damage to the airport control tower meant only military aircraft could land in Mayotte, complicating the rescue response. Electricity has also reportedly been knocked out across the archipelago.",
      "Rescue workers, soldiers, medical personnel and supplies have been sent from France, as well as from the nearby French territory of Reunion. Mayotte is regarded as the poorest territory that falls under the sovereignty of any European Union nation, however it still draws a significant number of economic migrants from nearby nations that are even poorer, due largely to the French state welfare system being implemented there.",
      "The French Red Cross told CBS News partner network BBC News that around 100,000 people live in makeshift slum dwellings on Mayotte, and that most of those had been completely destroyed by Chido.",
      "Cyclone season in the southwestern Indian Ocean began at the start of December, and Chido hit Mayotte on Saturday as an intense tropical cyclone \u2014 the equivalent of a category-4 hurricane, the BBC reported. It made landfall on the much larger island nation of Madagascar, just south of Mayotte, late Sunday.",
      "The BBC reported that Chido was likely intensified due to climate change. The BBC said that, while the number of annual cyclones hasn't increased in recent decades, more of them have been more intense, likely because warmer air and seawater provides perfect conditions to fuel larger storms.",

      "Wellington, New Zealand \u2014 A man from Memphis, Tennessee has been found guilty by a judge in Fiji of murdering his wife during their honeymoon in 2022, the prosecutor's office said Monday.",
      "Bradley Robert Dawson, 40, killed his wife, Christe Chen, who was 36, at the exclusive Turtle Island resort in the Yasawa archipelago two days after the newlyweds arrived in Fiji, then fled by kayak to a nearby island. Chen was discovered in the couple's room by resort staff with multiple blunt trauma wounds to her head after the couple was heard arguing and didn't appear at breakfast or lunch the next day.",
      "Justice Riyaz Hamza found Dawson guilty in the Lautoka High Court last Thursday after a weeklong trial, the Office of the Director of Public Prosecutions said. Dawson had denied the charge.",
      "The fact that Dawson was carrying his passport and other belongings with him when he was arrested indicated that he planned to flee, Hamza said, according to the Fiji Times newspaper. The judge said he was satisfied beyond reasonable doubt that Dawson and no one else had committed the offense.",
      "The U.S. national, who remains in custody in Fiji, faces a mandatory term of life in prison when he is sentenced in January. Fiji law permits a presiding judge to set a minimum term to be served before a pardon is considered.",
      "An attorney for Dawson didn't immediately respond to a request for comment.",
      "In 2022, a lawyer representing Christe Chen's parents said their daughter's body was so badly damaged that she couldn't be embalmed for return to the U.S. and her remains were cremated. Chen worked as a pastry chef before returning to school to become a pharmacist, and had worked in that capacity at a Kroger supermarket in Memphis.",
      "The family's lawyer, Ronald Gordon \u2014 who did not immediately respond to a request for comment on Monday \u2014 said Chen and Dawson were heard arguing over dinner the night before the murder.",
      "Dawson worked in the information technology department at Youth Villages, a nonprofit child welfare and support organization based in Memphis, the organization confirmed when he was arrested. An online records search showed no criminal arrests for Dawson in Shelby County, which includes Memphis.",
      "The Turtle Island resort, where the pair stayed, is an exclusive and remote 500-acre island that accommodates only 14 couples at a time. Yasawa is a group of about 20 volcanic islands in the west of Fiji, an idyllic South Pacific island nation of 930,000 people."

      "\"I think there are some several hundred dead, maybe we'll get close to a thousand. Even thousands ... given the violence of this event,\" Mayotte Prefect Fran\u00e7ois-Xavier Bieuville told TV station Mayotte la 1ere.",
      "He had previously said it was the worst cyclone to hit Mayotte in 90 years.",
      "Bieuville said it was extremely difficult to get an exact number of deaths and injuries after Mayotte was pummeled by the intense tropical cyclone on Saturday, causing major damage to public infrastructure, including the airport, flattening neighborhoods and knocking out electricity supplies.",
      "The French Interior Ministry confirmed at least 11 deaths and more than 250 injuries earlier Sunday but said that was expected to increase substantially.",
      "Mayotte, in the southwestern Indian Ocean off the coast of Africa, is France's poorest island and the poorest territory in the European Union. It has a population of just over 300,000 spread over two main islands.",
      "Bieuville said the worst devastation had been seen in the slums of metal shacks and informal structures that mark much of Mayotte. Referring to the official death toll so far, he said \"this figure is not plausible when you see the images of the slums.\"",
      "\"I think the human toll is much higher,\" he added.",
      "Chido blew through the southwestern Indian Ocean on Friday and Saturday, also affecting the nearby islands of Comoros and Madagascar. Mayotte was directly in the cyclone's path, though, and took the brunt. Chido brought winds in excess of 220 kph (136 mph), according to the French weather service, making it a category 4 cyclone, the second strongest on the scale.",
      "Later, Chido made landfall in Mozambique on the African mainland and there were fears for more than 2 million people in the country's north who could be impacted, according to authorities there.",
      "French President Emmanuel Macron said his \"thoughts\" were with the Mayotte people and Interior Minister Bruno Retailleau was due to travel to Mayotte on Monday. Retailleau had warned Saturday night after an emergency meeting in Paris that the death toll \"will be high,\" while new Prime Minister Fran\u00e7ois Bayrou, who took office on Friday, said infrastructure had been severely damaged or destroyed across Mayotte.",
      "Pope Francis offered prayers for the victims while on a visit Sunday to the French Mediterranean island of Corsica.",
      "Rescuers and firefighters were sent from France and the nearby French territory of Reunion and supplies were also rushed in on military aircraft and ships. Damage to the airport's control tower meant only military aircraft were able to fly in.",
      "Patrice Latron, the prefect of Reunion, said authorities aim to establish an air and sea bridge from Reunion to Mayotte. About 800 more rescuers were to be sent in the coming days and more than 80 tons of supplies had been flown in or were on their way by ship. Some of the priorities were restoring electricity and access to drinking water, Latron said.",
      "The French Interior Ministry said 1,600 police and gendarmerie officers have been deployed to \"help the population and prevent potential looting.\"",
      "In some parts of Mayotte, entire neighborhoods of metal shacks and huts were flattened, while residents reported trees had been uprooted, boats flipped or sunk and many areas were without power.",
      "Chad Youyou, a resident in Hamjago in the north of the island, posted videos on Facebook showing the extensive damage in his village and across the surrounding fields and hills, where almost every tree had been leveled.",
      "\"Mayotte is destroyed \u2026 we are destroyed,\" he said.",
      "Chido continued its eastern trajectory and into northern Mozambique where it continued to cause serious damage, while farther inland landlocked Malawi and Zimbabwe warned they might have to evacuate people because of flooding.",
      "In Mozambique, UNICEF said Cabo Delgado province, home to around 2 million people, was the first region to be hit and many homes, schools and health facilities have been partially or completely destroyed.",
      "UNICEF Mozambique spokesman Guy Taylor said that communities faced the prospect of being cut off from schools and health facilities for weeks and Mozambique authorities warned there was a high danger of landslides.",
      "December through to March is cyclone season in the southwestern Indian Ocean and southern Africa has been pummeled by a series of strong ones in recent years. Cyclone Idai in 2019 killed more than 1,300 people, mostly in Mozambique, Malawi and Zimbabwe. Cyclone Freddy left more than 1,000 dead across several countries in the Indian Ocean and southern Africa last year.",
      "The cyclones bring the risk of flooding and landslides, but also stagnant pools of water may later spark deadly outbreaks of the waterborne disease cholera as well as dengue fever and malaria.",
      "Studies say the cyclones are getting worse because of climate change. They can leave poor countries in Africa, which contribute a tiny amount to global warming, having to deal with large humanitarian crises, underlining their call for more help from rich nations to deal with the impact of climate change.",

      "The researchers set out to determine whether these changes could be reversed.",
      "Fighting \u2018memory\u2019 in fat cells",
      "In mouse studies, the researchers found that even after significant weight loss, their cells have a \"memory\" of obesity encoded in the epigenome, which controls the activity of genes, said von Meyenn.",
      "\"Our study indicates that one reason maintaining body weight after initial weight loss is difficult is that the fat cells remember their prior obese state and likely aim to return to this state,\" he told Fox News Digital.",

      "\"This means one would have to \u2018fight\u2019 this obesogenic memory to maintain body weight.\"",
      "Based on this research, a failure to maintain weight loss after dieting is not necessarily due to lack of effort or willpower, but could also be driven by an underlying biological phenomenon, von Meyenn added.",
      "Potential limitations",
      "The research looked only at fatty tissue, and the genetic mechanisms were studied only in mice. Even so, the researchers said they believe that similar mechanisms also apply to humans.",
      "Other experts cautioned, however, that the study shows only association and does not prove that epigenetic changes cause the yo-yo effect.",
      "CAN'T STOP THINKING ABOUT YOUR NEXT MEAL? IT'S CALLED FOOD NOISE, HERE'S WHAT TO DO",
      "\"The authors pointed out that they cannot say for certain that the epigenetic modifications directly cause people to regain their lost weight, nor pinpoint which specific epigenetic markers may be driving this effect,\" Petronella Ravenshear, board-certified nutritionist and author of \"The Human Being Diet,\" told Fox News Digital.",
      "Florida-based Ravenshear, who was not part of the study, noted that the results should not lead people to claim, \"It\u2019s not my fault, it\u2019s my genes!\"",
      "Plans for future research",
      "\"We will need to now expand, see how the memory can be erased and whether other cells or tissues are also affected, [such as] the brain or the liver,\" von Meyenn said.",
      "It\u2019s possible that if people maintain a healthy weight for a year or longer after dieting, that may be enough time to erase the memory in fat cells, according to Ravenshear.",
      "The term \"diet,\" in its original connotation, means \"way of living\" \u2014 but it is now synonymous with short-term dietary changes that are unsustainable, one expert said. (iStock)",
      "\"This discovery underscores the importance of preventing obesity, particularly in children and adolescents, to avoid establishing this epigenetic memory that complicates long-term weight management,\" Stanford noted.",

Kennedy Jr., President-elect Donald Trump's secretary nominee for the Department of Health and Human Services (HHS), is slamming a New York Times report this week that claimed he sought to revoke the Food and Drug Administration's (FDA) approval for the polio vaccine.",
      "\"Contrary to hysterical media reports that the petition sought to make sure no polio vaccines would be available, the scope of the petition was quite narrow,\" Aaron Siri, a close RFK Jr. adviser and partner at Siri & Glimstad LLP, told Fox News Digital. \"It simply asked the FDA to require a proper trial for licensure for children of a novel polio vaccine.\"",
      "The New York Times reported Friday that Siri is \"waging a war\" against all vaccines, but Siri said the report \"falsely claimed the petition sought to eliminate\" the polio vaccine, \"as if there is only one, and that our client sought to leave Americans without the choice to get vaccinated for polio.\"",

      "The report came just days before RFK Jr. headed to Capitol Hill this week to meet with Senators, seeking support for his HHS confirmation.",
      "The petition, filed in 2022 on behalf of the Informed Consent Action Network (ICAN) and not as an individual action by Siri, urged the FDA to suspend the polio vaccine IPOL for infants and children. ICAN's request stems from concerns that IPOL, licensed in 1990 by Sanofi, was approved based on pediatric trials that, according to the FDA, evaluated safety for only three days after injection.",
      "This is not the traditional polio vaccine developed by Jonas Salk or Albert Sabin that many people are familiar with, Siri added. Instead, it is a product utilizing a different technology, where the polio virus is grown on monkey kidney cells that have been genetically altered to replicate indefinitely, similar to cancer cells. Traces of these cells are present in each vaccine dose.",

      "The holiday season is the best time of the year. Many of us spend quality time with our families, enjoy delicious food and even go on vacations. For many, it\u2019s also a time to indulge in shopping. And why not? This is when you find the best deals on your favorite products, whether it\u2019s a new electronic gadget or a household essential.",
      "However, the holiday season also comes with an increased risk of mobile fraud while shopping online. Scammers often target online shoppers in more ways than you might imagine. Fortunately, with some awareness and precautions, you can protect yourself. Below, I\u2019ll discuss the rise in mobile shopping scams and how you can stay safe.",

      "The rise in mobile fraud",
      "According to\u00a0Appdome's latest U.S. Consumer Survey, 60.6% of Americans say fraud is their biggest concern. More than 40% of global consumers reported that they or someone close to them had been directly affected by mobile fraud, malware or a cyberattack. With mobile apps now being the main way people interact with brands, skepticism among users is growing. In fact, 24% of consumers believe developers don\u2019t care about app security, a massive jump of 258% since 2021.",
      "Social engineering has become a major worry, as people are becoming more aware of the many ways mobile fraud can happen. This includes things like location spoofing, scams that manipulate users and account takeovers. Almost half of the survey respondents this year said they or someone they know personally had dealt with fraud, scams or similar issues.",
      "Such scams also affect your online shopping experience. I spoke with Tom Tovar, CEO of Appdome, regarding what consumers need to know when they are shopping on their mobile devices this holiday season.",
      "\"Consumers should be aware of phishing, smishing and vishing scams, which exploit fake emails, deceptive SMS messages and fraudulent phone calls to steal sensitive information. More sophisticated threats include FaceID bypass attacks, such as those carried out by the GoldPickaxe malware, which uses AI-enhanced techniques to bypass biometric authentication,\"\u00a0Tovar said.",
      "\"Other significant risks include banking trojans, which infiltrate apps to steal login credentials or financial data, and accessibility malware, which exploits device accessibility features to take control of mobile interactions. The rise of these sophisticated threats highlights the need for robust in-app security.\"",

      "This might seem obvious, but sticking to trusted apps can help keep you safe while shopping. By trusted apps, I mean platforms like Amazon, eBay and Walmart.",
      "\"With the growing sophistication of mobile threats, it\u2019s becoming increasingly challenging for consumers to identify risks independently. Threats like phishing, accessibility malware and banking trojans are designed to mimic legitimate functions, making them nearly impossible to detect at a glance. Instead of relying solely on spotting issues, consumers should look for apps that clearly communicate their commitment to security through visible privacy policies, transparent security practices and updates addressing new threats. Choosing apps from trusted sources and reading user reviews can also provide reassurance,\"\u00a0Tovar said.",
      "WHAT TO DO IF YOUR BANK ACCOUNT IS HACKED",
      "When shopping on your phone, be cautious of\u00a0phishing, smishing and\u00a0vishing scams, as they are common tactics used to steal your personal and financial information. Phishing involves fake emails that look like they are from trusted retailers, tricking you into sharing sensitive details like passwords or payment information. Smishing is a similar tactic but delivered through text messages, often containing links to fake websites or malicious downloads.",
      "Vishing, on the other hand, involves scammers making phone calls pretending to be customer service representatives from well-known brands, attempting to gain access to your private information. Always verify the authenticity of emails, texts or calls before clicking links or sharing details to ensure a safe shopping experience.",
      "The best way to safeguard yourself from malicious links that install malware, potentially accessing your private information, is to have antivirus software installed on all your devices. This protection can also alert you to phishing emails and ransomware scams, keeping your personal information and digital assets safe.\u00a0Get my picks for the best 2024 antivirus protection winners for your Windows, Mac, Android and iOS devices.",
      "When shopping online on your phone, it's important to be careful about the permissions you give to apps. A lot of apps may ask for access to things like your camera, contacts or location, even if it's not necessary for the shopping experience. Always think twice before granting these permissions.",
      "\"These permissions are often abused by malware to collect sensitive data or perform unauthorized actions. Before granting permissions, consider whether they align with the app\u2019s purpose. Developers can mitigate these risks by incorporating protections from Appdome\u2019s anti-fraud offering, which protects against the many abuse methods used by malicious actors to abuse mobile app permissions,\" Tovar said.",

      "BEWARE OF ENCRYPTED PDFs AS LATEST TRICK TO DELIVER MALWARE TO YOU",
      "Protecting financial information is crucial, especially when shopping online. It's important to use secure websites, indicated by \"https\" in the URL, and avoid saving payment details in apps or on websites unless they are trustworthy.",
      "While consumers should stay vigilant \u2013 by using trusted apps, downloading only from official app stores and monitoring for suspicious activity \u2013 there\u2019s only so much they can do, Tovar said.",
      "\"The sophistication of modern threats often makes it impossible for users to identify or prevent all risks on their own,\" he said. \"Consumers have a better chance of keeping their personal information secure by choosing brands that prioritize security and back it up with tangible actions, such as automating robust protections and delivering proactive, built-in security measures.\"",
      "Kurt\u2019s key takeaway",
      "The holiday season is a prime time for shopping and, unfortunately, for scams. As mobile shopping continues to grow, threats like AI-driven scams and advanced malware are expected to increase. However, you can keep yourself safe by staying informed about potential threats, choosing apps with robust security measures and practicing good mobile hygiene. It's also the responsibility of app developers to ensure users don\u2019t fall prey to scammers.",

Next, the text says \"pls,\" which is lingo for \"please\" that you likely wouldn't see in correspondence from the USPS. Scammers often make typos or use poor grammar when communicating, so always double-check.",
      "Scammers are sending emails, texts and even occasionally there could be a phone call that is regarding an issue with package delivery. It may be something like this text I received that has a link where they'll end up asking for information, or you may be asked to pay a \"shipping fee\" to get your package.",

      "If you are expecting a package, and you're wondering if you've received real information or not about it, the best way to check is to go to the original confirmation you received about shipping. You most likely received an email regarding your package, and if you go to that email to get your order number, you should be able to look up the status of your order directly on any website.",

      "2) Charity scams",
      "Sadly, charity scams aren't new, but they are way more prevalent during the holiday season since scammers are hoping you're feeling more generous during this time of year. Sometimes, scammers may create fake names of organizations to get you to donate money, or they may reach out to you via phone/email/text posing as someone working for a legitimate charity. Social media has also become a popular place for charities to market themselves and reach more eyes in hopes of donations, so scammers may try to pose as fake charities. These schemes will try to appeal to your emotions during this season, so be sure to check where you donate your money so you don't fall for a scam.",
      "Never give your money to anyone immediately who approaches you or reaches out on behalf of any organization without doing your own independent research. Either do a little googling or check with a family member to see if it's real, and if it is, you should be able to donate to an official website or an official address. You can always mention this to anyone who asks you to donate somewhere. Don't fall into the pressure of donating right then and there. Also, always double-check the name of an organization. Sometimes (especially online), scammers will alter the name of a known organization slightly to trick you into donating.",
      "9 WAYS SCAMMERS CAN USE YOUR PHONE NUMBER TO TRY TO TRICK YOU",
      "3)\u00a0Social media gift exchange scam",
      "The\u00a0Better Business Bureau is warning about a gift exchange scam with a new twist, which has been occurring during recent holiday seasons. It's an online version of the popular \"Secret Santa\" gift exchange. However, the BBB says these social media-driven gift exchanges are actually pyramid schemes, and you will most likely be disappointed if you participate.",
      "In the past few years, variations of the gift exchange have popped up, with someone asking you to select a random person and send them a gift to pay it forward. Another asks you to exchange bottles of wine with someone else, and while it seems fun and light-hearted, you don't know who is on the receiving end.",
      "It may sound nice to send a holiday gift to a stranger in turn for receiving multiple gifts yourself, but you're never going to receive many (if any) gifts at all.\u00a0Don't participate in gift exchanges with anyone you don't know, or you won't be able to guarantee you'll actually be gifting someone who isn't a scammer.",
      "HOW TO REMOVE YOUR PRIVATE DATA FROM THE INTERNET",
      "4) Gift card scams",
      "Gift card scams are another popular method that has been rising in popularity recently, but it's especially important to watch out for the possibilities, since you may be purchasing gift cards for friends or family for the holidays. Scammers often steal gift cards and use the information before they make it look like they didn't. They have a number of methods for tricking you using gift cards, so if you can send an online one (so that you can ensure you've purchased it on a legitimate, official website), that would be a much safer alternative.",
      "If you're getting anyone a gift card and buying it in person, be sure to check that the package hasn't been tampered with. Double-check that nothing on the packaging looks suspicious since scammers will try to make it seem like the package was sealed, but they will already have used the gift card, so you're essentially buying a useless piece of plastic.",

      "5) Home Depot email confirmation scam",
      "Scammers are capitalizing on the festive spirit with a deceptive email campaign targeting people at this time of year.\u00a0This scam involves a deceptive email that appears to be from Home Depot with such wording as \"Confirmation needed: please confirm receipt.\" The email body typically contains enticing text like \"Congratulations! The Home Depot - You are our winner!\" along with a customer number and a blue circle that says, \"Check if you won.\" Who couldn't use a little extra cheer or perhaps a holiday prize from Home Depot this season?",
      "The problem is this is a scam, and the goal of this scam is to lure you into clicking on an embedded link, which can lead to various malicious outcomes. These include phishing for personal and financial information, installing malware on your device, redirecting to a fake website that resembles Home Depot's or prompting you to pay a \"delivery fee\" for a non-existent prize.",
      "To protect yourself from this and similar scams, scrutinize the sender's email address for any discrepancies. Hover over links without clicking to reveal their true destination. Be wary of unexpected \"winnings\" or requests for confirmation. If you receive an email that raises suspicion, contact Home Depot directly through their official website or customer service number to verify its legitimacy. Finally, remember that legitimate companies will not ask you to confirm sensitive information via email or require you to click on links to claim prizes.",
      "Fake Home Depot winning email (Kurt \"CyberGuy\" Knutsson)",
      "6) Fake online shopping sites scam",
      "One of the most common scams during the holiday season is the fake online shopping site scam. Scammers create websites that look like legitimate online stores but are actually designed to steal your personal and financial information. They may offer products at very low prices or claim to have limited-time deals or exclusive items. They may also send you\u00a0phishing emails or text messages with links to these fake sites.",
      "A woman shopping on her laptop (Kurt \"CyberGuy\" Knutsson)",

      "How to avoid falling victim to this scam",
      "By following a few simple precautions, you can significantly reduce your risk of falling prey to online scams and ensure a safer shopping experience.",
      "1) Shop only from trusted and reputable online stores that you know and have used before.",
      "2) Check the website address carefully and look for any red flags.",
      "3) Do some research on the online store before making a purchase. Read customer reviews, look for ratings or search for complaints online.",
      "4) Use a credit card or a secure payment service like PayPal when shopping online. Do not use debit cards, wire transfers or gift cards.",
      "5) Keep track of your online purchases and monitor your bank statements for any unauthorized charges.",
      "6) Use strong antivirus protection software. An effective antivirus software is a must-have. The best way to protect yourself from clicking on any malicious links on fake websites or in phishing emails and text messages is to have\u00a0antivirus protection installed and actively running on all your devices.\u00a0It\u2019s the best to help stop and alert you of any malware in your system and ultimately protect you from being hacked.\u00a0See my expert review of the best antivirus protection for your Windows, Mac, Android and iOS devices.",
      "7) Use a personal data removal service. Scammers can obtain your information from various online sources, including data brokers, people search sites and public records. Using a data removal service can help reduce your digital footprint, making it harder for scammers to access your personal information. This proactive step can be crucial in preventing identity theft and minimizing the chances of falling victim to scams during the busy holiday season.",

      "One of the best parts of using some services is that they might include identity theft insurance of\u00a0up to $1 million to cover losses and legal fees and a white-glove fraud resolution team where a\u00a0U.S.-based case manager helps you recover any losses.\u00a0See my tips and best picks on how to protect yourself from identity theft.",

      "Holiday decoration theft has become an increasingly frustrating issue for many homeowners. Karen from Los Angeles shared her experience with us in an email, stating,",
      "\"We have criminals who visit our neighborhood to not only steal mail and packages but also holiday decorations. I made a Christmas decoration for our mailbox, which was promptly stolen.\"",
      "We\u2019re sorry to hear about the theft in your neighborhood. This highlights a problem that goes beyond mere property loss. It's a theft of holiday cheer and personal effort. Let\u2019s see how we can use technology to help secure your decorations.",

      "Smart solutions for festive security",
      "Karen also inquired about the effectiveness of\u00a0Samsung SmartTags, asking if these tags would work on her decorations and how far they could reach. The good news is that Samsung SmartTags can indeed be used on your holiday decorations. You can attach the SmartTag to any item you want to track. These devices are compatible with most recent Samsung Galaxy phones, including the Galaxy S9, making them accessible to many Android users.",
      "As for the distance, the range of the\u00a0Samsung SmartTag uses Bluetooth to connect to your phone. If the item is within Bluetooth range, you can ring it to find it or use the \"Search Nearby\" feature to get directions to it. If the item is out of range, other Samsung devices near the tag will anonymously locate it for you and then let you know where it is. This is done in the background and is encrypted to ensure privacy. The SmartTag does not beep when it\u2019s out of range.",
      "The\u00a0Samsung SmartTag is compatible with almost all Samsung Galaxy phones released recently. They must have 2GB of RAM and run Android 8.0 (Oreo) or higher. So, your Samsung Galaxy S9 phones should be compatible with the Samsung SmartTag.",

      "Apple AirTags: An alternative approach",
      "For those considering a switch to\u00a0Apple, AirTags present another viable option. Karen asked if she would have problems tracking her decorations with an Apple AirTag. While primarily designed for iOS devices,\u00a0you can use it with your Android phone as mentioned in our article here, with some limitations. It uses the Find My network, and if another Apple device passes by the AirTag, the Find My network will be notified of the lost item\u2019s location.",
      "The AirTag does not beep when it\u2019s out of range. However, the AirTag\u2019s Precision Finding feature, which provides highly accurate tracking, is only compatible with iPhone 11 series and onwards. If you\u2019re considering purchasing an iPhone, the iPhone 11 would be a relatively inexpensive option that is compatible with the AirTag\u2019s Precision Finding feature.",

Similarly,\u00a0AirTags leverage the Find My network, utilizing nearby Apple devices to relay location information.",
      "For Samsung users like Karen, the\u00a0SmartTag is the natural choice, working seamlessly with Galaxy devices. Those considering Apple might look at the\u00a0AirTag\u00a0as an option.",

      "2. Secure decorations: Consider physically securing your decorations with zip ties, chains or locks. While this won't deter all thieves, it can make stealing more difficult and time-consuming.",
      "3. Light it up: Well-lit areas are less appealing to thieves. Ensure your yard and decorations are adequately lit with\u00a0outdoor lights, especially in dark corners or near entry points.",
      "4. Engage your neighbors: Create a sense of community by alerting neighbors to thefts and keeping an eye out for suspicious activity. A connected neighborhood can act as a strong deterrent.",
      "5. Mark your property: Use invisible ink or engrave your decorations with a unique identifier. If stolen items are recovered, this will help law enforcement return them to you.",
      "6. Report thefts to local law enforcement: Always report thefts, no matter how small. Law enforcement can track patterns and increase patrols in areas with frequent incidents. Providing details may also help them recover stolen items.",

      "Step 1: Remove malicious software",
      "Even if hackers had only brief access to your device, assume they\u2019ve seen sensitive data. Your first task is to remove any malware or spyware.",
      "1. Use strong antivirus software: The easiest and most effective way to start is by installing and running strong antivirus or antivirus software. Avoid unfamiliar apps, as some pose as antivirus tools but are actually malware in disguise.\u00a0Get my picks for the best 2024 antivirus protection winners for your Windows, Mac, Android and iOS devices.",
      "After installation, run a full device scan. This will search for hidden threats like spyware, ransomware, or keyloggers that could compromise your information further. Once the scan identifies malicious files, follow the app\u2019s instructions to quarantine or remove them. Be sure to double-check the app\u2019s log to confirm all suspicious activity has been addressed. Most antivirus tools offer real-time protection to monitor for threats as they occur. Turn this feature on to reduce the risk of reinfection. Antivirus programs are only as effective as their latest updates. Cybercriminals continuously develop new malware, so keeping your antivirus database current ensures it can detect the newest threats.",
      "2. Factory reset if needed: If the antivirus software fails to fully restore your phone\u2019s functionality \u2014 such as fixing issues like freezing, slowdowns or unexpected shutdowns \u2014 you may need to perform a factory reset on your\u00a0iPhone or\u00a0Android. A factory reset wipes all data from your phone, returning it to its original state when it left the manufacturer. Before resetting, create a backup of your important files. However, ensure the backup itself is free of malware. Use antivirus software to scan backups before restoring them. Most phones offer a simple reset option in their settings menu under \"System\" or \"General Management.\" Consult your device manual or manufacturer\u2019s website for detailed instructions.",
      "3. Seek professional help:\u00a0If you\u2019re not confident in your ability to remove malware or reset your phone, reach out to a trusted professional. Visit the Apple Store, Microsoft Store or an authorized service provider for your phone brand. Explain your situation and ask for a thorough inspection and cleaning of your device. Many retailers offer comprehensive diagnostic and repair services.",
      "4. Abandon hardware only as a last resort: In rare cases, malware can deeply embed itself into a device, making complete removal nearly impossible. If your phone continues to exhibit signs of infection despite using antivirus tools, factory resets and professional help, you may need to replace it. Ensure you completely\u00a0wipe the device before disposing of it to prevent any residual data from falling into the wrong hands. When setting up a new device, take extra precautions to secure it, such as enabling\u00a0two-factor authentication and keeping all\u00a0software up to date.",

      "According to John Harris, co-founder and CEO of Harbinger, winter testing is critical for vehicle development, especially for EVs. It ensures that vehicles perform reliably on low-traction surfaces such as ice and snow. The focus is not only on typical cold weather driving conditions but also on less common yet important higher-risk scenarios. This is particularly crucial for EVs due to their significant torque output, which can lead to loss of control if not managed correctly on slippery surfaces. Systems like regenerative braking also need optimization for extreme conditions.",

At low temperatures, the chemical reactions within the battery slow down, leading to decreased efficiency and power output. Additionally, electric vehicles require energy to heat the cabin, which further reduces driving range. Harbinger addresses these concerns by utilizing a multi-zone heat pump that efficiently provides heating for both the battery and cabin, thereby minimizing the negative effects of cold weather on performance.",

      "Joseph Corcoran, 49, was on death row since his 1999 conviction and, despite late appeals on the grounds that he was severely mentally ill, is set to be executed Wednesday by lethal injection at Indiana State Prison.",
      "Corcoran fatally shot his brother James Corcoran, 30, his sister's fianc\u00e9 Robert Scott Turner, 32, and two other 30-year-old men, Timothy G. Bricker and Douglas A. Stillwell, inside his family home in\u00a0Fort Wayne on July 26, 1997.",

      "Five years earlier, he was acquitted in the shooting death of his parents after the jury found insufficient evidence to convict him.",
      "Indiana\u2019s last state execution was in 2009 when Matthew Wrinkles was put to death for killing his wife, her brother and sister-in-law in 1994. Thirteen executions have been carried out in Indiana since Wrinkle's execution, but those were initiated and performed by federal officials in 2020 and 2021 at a federal prison.",
      "Since Wrinkles was put to death, the state suspended state executions because a combination of drugs used in lethal injections had become unavailable. There has been a years-long nationwide shortage because pharmaceutical companies \u2014 particularly in Europe, where opposition to capital punishment is strongest \u2014\u00a0have refused to sell their products\u00a0for that purpose.",
      "Indiana Gov. Eric Holcomb, a Republican, announced in June that Corcoran\u2019s execution was to go ahead after the state acquired a drug \u2014 pentobarbital \u2014 which can be used to carry out executions and is used by multiple states in lethal injections.",

      "Corcoran's attorneys had fought his death sentence for years, arguing that Corcoran was severely mentally ill, which affected his ability to understand and make decisions. Corcoran\u00a0exhausted his federal appeals\u00a0in 2016. Earlier this month, his attorneys asked the Indiana Supreme Court to stop his execution but the request\u00a0was denied.",
      "OKLAHOMA DEATH ROW INMATE EXECUTED FOR DOUBLE KILLING AFTER 3 LAST WORDS",
      "His attorneys felt that the denial gave some bit of hope to stave off the execution as the justices were split 3-2.",

      "Corcoran wrote the justices a handwritten affidavit this month saying he was done litigating his case, although his attorneys said it was a sign of his mental illness, per the Associated Press.",
      "\"I am guilty of the crime I was convicted of, and accept the findings of all the appellate courts,\" Corcoran wrote.",
      "Corcoran fatally shot the four victims as he was under stress because the forthcoming marriage of his sister to Turner would necessitate moving out of the Fort Wayne home he shared with his brother and sister, according to court records.",
      "He awoke to hear his brother and others downstairs talking about him, loaded his rifle and then shot all four men, records say.",
      "After the shootings, Corcoran asked a neighbor across the street to call the police. When they arrived, Corcoran told them, \"You might as well just arrest me,\" per the Tampa Bay Times.",
      "While jailed, Corcoran reportedly bragged about fatally shooting his parents.",

    "story": [
      "Retired FBI profiler Candice Delong joins \u2018America\u2019s Newsroom\u2019 to explain possible motives for alleged CEO killer Luigi Mangione.",
      "The former Ivy League computer scientist-turned-suspected corporate assassin likely won't face federal charges, preventing any risk of the death penalty since New York doesn't have one, experts say.",
      "Murder is typically not a crime that falls under federal jurisdiction, except under specific circumstances. Hiring a hitman who crosses state lines to commit a murder-for-hire is a federal crime, but crossing state lines yourself to commit one is not.",
      "Luigi Mangione, 26, faces a second-degree murder charge in New York state in connection with the ambush shooting death of UnitedHealthcare CEO Brian Thompson, who was gunned down by a masked assassin outside a Manhattan Hilton hotel on Dec. 4. New York's murder laws are broken down differently than most other states, and first-degree charges in the Empire State are typically reserved for special cases, including against the slaying of a member of law enforcement or mass murders.",
      "\"It's possible, but not likely, that Mangione is charged federally,\" said Neama Rahmani, a former federal prosecutor who now runs a private practice in Los Angeles. \"The case has gotten a lot of attention, and there is no knowing what Trump's Department of Justice will do, but a federal prosecution requires a federal jurisdictional hook, like the commission of another federal crime or a substantial nexus to interstate commerce.\"",

      "Blair County District Attorney Peter Weeks' office already said it planned to move forward with its case against Mangione but would allow the more serious charges in New York to take precedence.",
      "\"Most likely the prosecution will be handled stateside by Manhattan District Attorney Alvin Bragg's office,\" Rahmani said.",
      "The feds usually step in because they see a need to secure a stricter punishment or because they can bring more resources to the job than a local department, according to Nicole Parker, a former FBI agent. But the NYPD is well-equipped and has already built a strong case, she said.",
      "\"[The] NYPD is solid, and they\u2019ll handle it strongly,\" she told Fox News Digital. \"The question is the prosecutor. Is Alvin Bragg going to go soft on this guy?\"",
      "On the heels of his loss at trial in the manslaughter case against Marine veteran Daniel Penny, a case that drew criticism of Bragg's priorities and politics, she expects his office to build a strong case against Mangione. Investigators have allegedly matched his fingerprints and weapon to the murder scene.",
      "\"This investigation will and absolutely should stay with NYPD. They\u2019ve got a rock solid casem\" she said. \"They\u2019ve worked tirelessly and continue to chisel away at mounting evidence. NYPD is the best of the best.

      "\"New York outlawed the death penalty 20 years ago, so capital punishment is not an option there,\" Rahmani said. \"But even if Mangione is charged federally, the only aggravating factor to support the death penalty is that the murder involved substantial planning and premeditation.\"",
      "Capital punishment is typically reserved for the worst of the worst criminal cases. Even if New York had a death penalty, other aggravators such as additional victims, the defendant's criminal history or that the murder took place during the commission of another felony don't exist in this case, he said.",
      "Luigi Mangione (Obtained by Fox News Digital)",
      "\"It wasn\u2019t an act of terrorism or similarly heinous offense,\" he said. \"Aside from all the attention it has received, this would normally not be a death penalty case.\"",
      "On top of that, it's rare for the federal government to seek the death penalty, but it does happen in cases of extreme violence, such as in the Boston Marathon bombing, which killed three and wounded hundreds. Prosecutors can use it as leverage to get a confession.",

      "Following Bashar al-Assad's fall from power, a new government is taking shape in Syria that has many wondering if it will moderate its Islamist stance or, as some have predicted, function like the Taliban in Afghanistan.",
      "The\u00a0U.S.-designated terrorist group Hayat Tahrir Al-Sham (HTS) had been ruling the Idlib Governate in northwest Syria and set up its own regime known as the Syrian Salvation Government and said it had shed its global Jihadist aims for a focus on local governance. In Idlib, HTS created a bureaucratic system and various ministries to administer some public services, including public safety.",
      "\"By all accounts, it has ruled with an iron fist there,\" Natasha Hall, senior fellow with the Middle East Program at the Center for Strategic and International Studies, told Fox News Digital.",
      "At its height, HTS ruled over approximately 2 million people in Idlib Province. Its leader, Mohammed al-Golani attempted to rebrand HTS and distance the group from the global jihadist elements of al Qaeda and instead focused on local issues in Idlib.",

There were also recent protests in Idlib over people who have died in detention under HTS custody,\" Hall said.",
      "HTS was less than tolerant and known for suppressing political dissent. Hall also noted she personally knows of people who were \"beat up\" by HTS fighters.",
      "Golani did oversee a de-emphasis on strict interpretations of Islam and limited the power of the feared morality police that monitored women\u2019s public wardrobe. The problem now, according to Hall, is not necessarily HTS\u2019 previous record of governance in Idlib, but the power vacuum that is left with Assad ousted.",

      "During their lightning two-week advance to conquer Syria, HTS promised to protect the rights of all Syrians, regardless of faith or ethnicity, and also promised to protect Shia religious sites.

      "Secretary of State Antony Blinken confirmed on Saturday that the U.S. has had direct contact with HTS since it overthrew the regime of Bashar al-Assad. HTS has already said it would cooperate with the U.S. in the search for Austin Tice, the American journalist missing in Syria since 2012 and who was believed to be held captive by the Assad regime. The initial contact with the rebel group and their promise to work with the U.S. to bring Tice home could further legitimize the group as it looks to consolidate its control over post-Assad Syria.",

    "published": "Mon, 16 Dec 2024 16:40:00 -0500",
    "summary": "Canadian Finance Minister Chrystia Freeland announced her resignation from Justin Trudeau&apos;s Cabinet on Monday, a powerful blow to the Liberal Prime Minister&apos;s hold on the government.",
    "story": [
      "Fox News Flash top headlines are here. Check out what's clicking on Foxnews.com.",
      "Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau faced the biggest test of his political career after Finance Minister Chrystia Freeland, long one of his most powerful and loyal ministers, announced Monday that she was resigning from the Cabinet.",
      "The stunning move raised questions about how much longer the prime minister of nearly 10 years can stay on in his role as his administration scrambles to deal with incoming U.S. President-elect Donald Trump. Trudeau's popularity has plummeted due to concerns about inflation and immigration.",
      "Opposition leader Jagmeet Singh, whose party Trudeau's ruling Liberals have relied upon to stay in power, called on Trudeau to resign. The main opposition Conservatives demanded an election.",
      "Freeland, who was also deputy prime minister, said that Trudeau had told her Friday that he no longer wanted her to serve as finance minister and that he offered her another role in the Cabinet. But she said in her resignation letter to the prime minister that the only \"honest and viable path\" was to leave the Cabinet.",
      "CANADIAN PREMIER THREATENS TO CUT OFF ENERGY IMPORTS TO US IF TRUMP IMPOSES TARIFF ON COUNTRY",
      "\"For the past number of weeks, you and I have found ourselves at odds about the best path forward for Canada,\" Freeland said.",
      "Freeland and Trudeau disagreed about a two-month sales tax holiday and $250 Canadian ($175) checks to Canadians that were recently announced. Freeland said that Canada is dealing with U.S. President-elect Donald Trump's threat to impose sweeping 25% tariffs and should eschew \"costly political gimmicks\" it can \"ill afford.\"",
      "\"Our country is facing a grave challenge,\" Freeland said in the letter. \"That means keeping our fiscal powder dry today, so we have the reserves we may need for a coming tariff war.\"",
      "A Liberal party official said Freeland was offered a position as minister in charge of Canada-U.S. relations without portfolio and without a department. The official, who spoke on condition of anonymity because they were not authorized to speak publicly on the matter, said the position would have been in name only and wouldn't have come with any of the tools Freeland previously had when she negotiated trade with the U.S.",
      "The resignation comes as Freeland, who chaired a Cabinet committee on U.S. relations, was set to deliver the fall economic statement and likely announce border security measures designed to help Canada avoid Trump's tariffs. The U.S. president-elect has threatened to impose a 25% tax on all products entering the U.S. from Canada and Mexico unless they stem the numbers of migrants and drugs.",
      "Minister of Finance and Deputy Prime Minister Chrystia Freeland delivers remarks on Parliament Hill in Ottawa, Ontario, Wednesday, Dec. 11, 2024. (Spencer Colby/The Canadian Press via AP)",
      "Trudeau has said that he plans on leading the Liberal Party into the next election, but some party members have said they don't want him to run for a fourth term, and Freeland's departure came as strong blow to Trudeau's administration.",
      "\"This news has hit me really hard,\" Transport Minister Anita Anand said, adding that she needed to digest the news before commenting further.",
      "Opposition Conservative leader Pierre Poilievre said that the government is losing control at the worst possible time.",
      "\"Justin Trudeau has lost control, but he's hanging onto power,\" Poilievre said. \"All this chaos, all this division, all this weakness is happening as our largest neighbor and closest ally is imposing 25% tariffs under a recently elected Trump with a strong mandate, a man who knows how to identify weakness.\"",
      "No Canadian prime minister in more than a century has won four straight terms.",
      "The federal election has to be held before October. The Liberals must rely on the support of at least one other major party in Parliament, because they don\u2019t hold an outright majority themselves. If the opposition New Democratic Party, or NDP, pulls support, an election can be held at any time.",
      "\"I\u2019m calling on Justin Trudeau to resign. He has to go,\" NDP leader Jagmeet Singh said.",
      "Trudeau\u2019s Liberal party needs the support of the NDP party to stay in power. Singh didn't say if he would note no confidence in the government but said all options are on the table.",
      "\"Mr. Trudeau\u2019s government is over,\" Opposition Bloc Quebecois leader Yves-Fran\u00e7ois Blanchet said. \"He must acknowledge that and act accordingly. The departure of his most important ally, his finance minister, is the end of this government.\"",
      "Trudeau channeled the star power of his father in 2015, when he reasserted the country\u2019s liberal identity after almost a decade of Conservative Party rule. But the son of late Prime Minister Pierre Trudeau is now in big trouble. Canadians have been frustrated by the rising cost of living and other issues like immigration increases following the country\u2019s emergence from the COVID-19 pandemic.",
      "\"As a country we have to project strength,\" Ontario Premier Doug Ford said. \"It\u2019s chaos right now up in Ottawa.\"",
      "Trudeau\u2019s legacy includes opening the doors wide to immigration. He also legalized cannabis and brought in a carbon tax intended to fight climate change.",
      "Freeland said in the resignation letter that Canadians \"know when we are working for them, and they equally know when we are focused on ourselves. Inevitably, our time in government will come to an end.\"",
      "Freeland's resignation comes as Trudeau has been trying to recruit Mark Carney to join his government. Carney is the former head of the Bank of England and Bank of Canada.",
      "He was so well regarded after helping Canada dodge the worst of the global economic crisis that the U.K. named him the first foreigner to serve as governor of the Bank of England since it was founded in 1694.",
      "Carney has long been interested in entering politics and becoming the leader of the Liberal Party. It wasn't immediately clear if Carney has agreed to join Trudeau's Cabinet.",
      "\"This is quite a bombshell,\" said Nelson Wiseman, professor emeritus at the University of Toronto. \"Freeland was not only finance minister but also deputy prime minister and, until a couple of years ago, was seen as Trudeau\u2019s heir as Liberal leader and prime minister.\"",
      "Wiseman said that leaks from the prime minister\u2019s office suggest that she was a poor communicator and made Freeland\u2019s status questionable.",
      "\"There was talk about her becoming foreign minister again and that would have been a good fit for her, but the stab in the back from the prime minister's office cast the die,\" Wiseman said.",
      "Daniel B\u00e9land, a political science professor at McGill University in Montreal, also called it a political earthquake and not just because Freeland was the second most powerful official in government.",
      "\"Also because of how she resigned: by publishing a letter on social media that clearly criticizes the prime minister only hours before she was supposed to present the government\u2019s fall economic statement,\" B\u00e9land said.",
      "CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP",
      "\"This is clearly a minority government on life support but, until now, the (opposition) NDP has rejected calls to pull the plug on it. It\u2019s hard to know whether this resignation will force the NDP to rethink its strategy.\""

      "Scientists suspect the first complete specimen ever recorded of the world\u2019s rarest whale died from head injuries, an expert said Friday.",
      "The first dissection of a spade-toothed whale, a type of beaked whale, was completed last week after a painstaking examination at a research center near the New Zealand city of Dunedin, the local people who led the scientific team, Te R\u016bnanga \u014ct\u0101kou, said in a statement issued by the New Zealand Department of Conservation.",

      "\"We don\u2019t know, but we suspect there must have been some sort of trauma, but what caused that could be anyone\u2019s guess,\" van Helden said in a statement.",
      "All varieties of beaked whales have different stomach systems and researchers didn\u2019t know how the spade-toothed type processed its food.",
      "The scientific team found the specimen had nine stomach chambers containing remnants of squid and parasitic worms, the statement said.",
      "Among the more interesting finds were tiny vestigial teeth in the upper jaw.",
      "\"These little teeth embedded in the gum tells us something about their evolutionary history. It\u2019s remarkable to see this and it\u2019s just another thing that we had no idea about,\" van Helden said.",

      "The dissection was also notable because scientists and curators worked together with local M\u0101ori people to incorporate Indigenous knowledge and customs into each step of the process.",
      "Following the dissection, the local iwi, or tribe, will keep the jawbone and teeth of the whale before its skeleton is displayed in a museum. 3D printing will be used to replicate those parts retained by the iwi.",

    "published": "Wed, 18 Dec 2024 00:00:05 GMT",
    "summary": "House Republicans released legislative text of their short-term bill Monday to keep the federal government open until mid-March, just days ahead of a key deadline to prevent a shutdown.",
    "story": [
      "WASHINGTON \u2014 Congressional leaders on Tuesday evening released the text of a short-term bill to keep the federal government open until March 14, rolling it out just days ahead of a key deadline to prevent a shutdown and after numerous delays.",
      "Funding expires at the end of Friday, when the House and the Senate hope to adjourn for the Christmas, Hanukkah and New Year\u2019s holidays.",
      "The 1,547-page bill includes $100.4 billion for disaster relief funding to address damage caused by hurricanes Helene and Milton in places like western North Carolina and Florida. That was roughly what President Joe Biden had requested of Congress.",
      "It also includes $10 billion in economic assistance for farmers, a one-year extension of the farm bill and a provision that would reauthorize a Department of Homeland Security program allowing federal agencies to coordinate and counter threats from drones, given public concern about recent sightings.",
      "In addition, the continuing resolution, or CR, includes a separate provision to give control of Robert F. Kennedy Memorial Stadium to Washington, D.C., which would allow the city to negotiate bringing the NFL's Commanders back to the district.",
      "Lawmakers have mere days to prevent a government shutdown ahead of the holidays, putting pressure on the Republican-led House to break its rule requiring 72 hours between releasing text and voting on a bill. And the Democratic-run Senate would need unanimous agreement to skip procedural hurdles and pass it in time.",
      "The legislation would throw a messy new shutdown deadline into President-elect Donald Trump\u2019s first 100 days in office.",
      "The move carries ups and downs for Republicans, who will seize control of the White House and the Senate in January, in addition to maintaining a narrow House majority.",
      "On one hand, the GOP\u2019s \u201ctrifecta\u201d in 2025 will give it more leverage to shape the contours of a full funding deal next year. Government funding is subject to the Senate\u2019s 60-vote threshold, so Republicans would still need Democratic support to pass it.",
      "There\u2019s also a benefit for House Speaker Mike Johnson, R-La., in punting difficult spending decisions beyond Jan. 3, when he will need nearly every House Republican to vote to re-elect him as speaker. Pushing through a sweeping government funding deal with Democrats around Christmas would cause backlash from conservatives in his ranks, imperiling his standing.",
      "The GOP House majority was trimmed to 220-215 in last month\u2019s election, giving Johnson very little margin for error.",
      "The main downside is that it would force Congress to grapple with another deadline early in Trump\u2019s term, potentially taking time away from his other priorities, like confirming nominees through the Senate and advancing his party-line measures on tax cuts, immigration funding and domestic energy policy.",
      "For that reason, some Republicans preferred to finish the job earlier and take the current fiscal year\u2019s funding task off Trump\u2019s plate.",
      "Sen. Susan Collins, R-Maine, who is set to become chair of the Appropriations Committee, said she preferred a mid-January deadline, as it would be \u201cfar better for the incoming president.\u201d",
      "\u201cI think it\u2019s really important that we let the new administration have a clean slate and not be worrying\u201d about fiscal\u00a0year 2025, she said.",
      "But with Congress hoping to finish up this week and leave town for the holidays, most members of both parties have accepted that another short-term solution will have to prevail.",
      "\u201cWe just need to keep things afloat for the next three to four months,\u201d said former Appropriations Committee Chair Rosa DeLauro, of Connecticut, who is now the panel\u2019s top Democrat."

    "summary": "One man's journey from a hospital in South Carolina to NovaShare, a body broker in North Carolina, demonstrates the peril of an industry with little regulation.",
    "story": [
      "This article is part of\u00a0\u201cDealing the Dead,\u201d\u00a0a series investigating the use of unclaimed bodies for medical research.",
      "CORNELIUS, N.C. \u2014 Last year, Karen Wandel received an alarming message: Her father had died more than five months earlier in a South Carolina hospital and, when no family claimed his body, the hospital sent it to be used for medical research.",
      "Wandel had a strained relationship with her father, Libero Marinelli Jr., a widower, and hadn\u2019t spoken to him in years. But as a lawyer in North Carolina, she wasn\u2019t hard to find. Neither were Marinelli\u2019s brother in California or sister in Massachusetts, who had kept in touch on birthdays and holidays. But they all learned of his death only after Marinelli\u2019s brother sent him a Christmas card that was returned unopened.",
      "Wandel remains stunned by the treatment of her father, who, as a former Army service member, was entitled to be buried in a veterans\u2019 cemetery but whose corpse instead was first sent to a body broker in another state.",
      "\u201cI just want somebody to look me in the eye and say, \u2018What we did was wrong, and we are sorry. We are sorry to your family, and we\u2019re sorry that your father suffered this indignity,\u2019\u201d Wandel said. \u201cParticularly after he served his country.\u201d",
      "Supplying unclaimed bodies for medical research is widely considered unethical, and most major medical schools \u2014 and a few states \u2014 have halted the practice. And yet it continues, in part due to the health care industry\u2019s steady demand for human specimens and local officials\u2019 feeling overwhelmed by a rise in bodies without next of kin to claim them.",
      "What\u2019s difficult to gauge is just how often it occurs: The body business has no federal regulation or oversight, and many states do not track the practice.",
      "NBC News spent months documenting the use of unclaimed bodies in medical research, submitting public records requests to dozens of state agencies, county coroners and medical schools. The records offer glimpses of where and how this is occurring.",
      "Since 2020, a community college in North Carolina has received 43 unclaimed bodies from local welfare agencies and medical examiners to teach embalming to funeral services students. In Pennsylvania, a state body-donation program that distributes human remains to medical schools said that it had received 58 unclaimed bodies from county coroners, medical examiners, hospitals and other facilities since 2019. Louisiana State University provided records on a single 2023 case in which an unclaimed car wreck victim was sent to the school\u2019s forensic department for study; a university spokesperson said the lab prioritizes \u201cethical practices and respect for the dignity of individuals.\u201d",
      "But in many states where it is legal to use unclaimed bodies for medical research, officials told NBC News that they did not have records of any such cases or denied requests for detailed information. That included Pennsylvania, where an official said the body-donation program could not share how the 58 unclaimed bodies were used. In Illinois, a 2018 law requires record-keeping of the unclaimed bodies provided to medical institutions, but a spokesperson for the state agency responsible for the task said it is not doing it because no one allocated any money for the effort.",
      "\u201cThere could be a lot more happening that we don\u2019t know about,\u201d said Joy Balta, an anatomy professor at Point Loma Nazarene University in California. He wants to see more regulation of the body donation industry and has written guidelines that call for donation programs to stop using unclaimed bodies. Otherwise, he said, \u201cThere\u2019s no way to know about it.\u201d",
      "The most extensive use of the unclaimed dead that reporters found was at a Fort Worth-based medical school, the University of North Texas Health Science Center. NBC News reported this year that the center collected thousands of unclaimed bodies from county medical examiners and leased some out to private companies and the Army, often without consent from any next of kin. The center halted the use of unclaimed bodies in response to NBC News\u2019 reporting, citing failures of \u201crespect, care and professionalism.\u201d",
      "In the absence of regulations, many coroners, hospitals or nursing homes are left to decide for themselves what to do when people die without a relative available to arrange a funeral. For some, the easiest \u2014 and cheapest \u2014 solution is to donate the body to a medical school or a body dealer, even if there is no indication that is what the person or their next of kin wanted.",
      "Marinelli\u2019s journey from a public hospital to a for-profit body broker demonstrates the peril of this choice: Health care workers and local authorities often lack the time and expertise to find people\u2019s relatives, NBC News has found, and when they fail to do so, families are denied the chance to decide what happens to their loved one\u2019s remains.",
      "Once she learned of her father\u2019s death, Wandel began to seek answers, growing angrier at each step.",
      "\u201cIf they could do this to a veteran Army officer, a guy with a house, a guy with a dog, a guy with family,\u201d she said, \u201cimagine what could happen to really vulnerable people.\u201d",
      "Wandel acknowledges that her father was a difficult man.",
      "Marinelli grew up in New Jersey, joined the Army, attended law school and served several years as a military lawyer during the Vietnam War. He told his daughter that an assignment representing a soldier who had fired on his own unit nearly broke him, and sparked a drinking habit that developed into alcoholism. He went on to work at the Justice Department\u2019s tax division, but lost his job and went into private practice, Wandel said.",
      "Marinelli\u2019s wife, a lawyer for the U.S. Department of Veterans Affairs, also suffered from addiction, and from mental illness, Wandel said. They separated but did not divorce. Neither was able to properly care for Wandel, their only child, so she spent much of her childhood in foster care but stayed in touch with her parents.",
      "For years, Marinelli tried to clean up and get his daughter back but couldn\u2019t make it stick, Wandel said. Still, he taught her to swim, ride a bike and drive. He took her to folk and bluegrass concerts. He attended her graduations from high school, college and law school, and walked her down the aisle at her wedding.",
      "In 2009, after Wandel\u2019s mother was diagnosed with terminal cancer, she returned to her and slept by her bedside until she died. She and her father later fought over his refusal to help administer her mother\u2019s affairs, Wandel said, and, in 2011, they stopped talking.",
      "Caring for her mother inspired Wandel to volunteer at a hospice. \u201cI found the idea of people dying without dignity or without somebody there to listen to them and hold their hand really offensive,\u201d she said.",
      "If she had known her father was dying, she said, \u201cI would have been there.\u201d"

      "LAS VEGAS \u2014 The Milwaukee Bucks won the 2024 NBA Cup on Tuesday, defeating the Oklahoma City Thunder 97-81 in the championship game at a neutral site in Las Vegas.",
      "Giannis Antetokounmpo led the Bucks with a triple double, recording 26 points, 19 rebounds and 10 assists, taking home Cup MVP honors. Damian Lillard added 23 points, shooting 5 of 10 from three.",
      "Shai Gilgeous-Alexander scored 21 for the Thunder \u2014 the only player on the team over 20 points \u2014 in a losing effort.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s the best feeling ever, just winning feels good,\u201d Antetokounmpo said after the game. \u201cIt\u2019s not only about the game, it\u2019s everything leading up to the game ... all those feelings leading up the game makes the winning even better.\u201d",
      "The first half was played incredibly even, with Milwaukee taking only a one-point lead into halftime. But the Bucks dominated the second half, particularly the third quarter, outscoring Oklahoma City 26-14. The 14 points the Thunder scored in the third were their fewest in a quarter this season.",
      "The Bucks then led by as many as 20 points in the fourth quarter, holding off any potential comeback.",
      "\u201cI feel happy,\u201d said Lillard, who won a team trophy for the first time in his career. \u201cIt was something we wanted to win and just being in something like this, the second year, I feel that teams cared about it a little bit more. I think teams played with a little bit more pride about trying to reach Vegas and having an opportunity to win at the end.\u201d",
      "Milwaukee\u2019s success was predicated largely on its outside shooting advantage. The Bucks outscored Oklahoma City by 36 points from three-point range.",
      "The Thunder\u2019s offense, meanwhile, went cold. Oklahoma City entered Tuesday\u2019s game with the eighth-best offense in the NBA. But the team\u2019s iffy three-point shooting cost it, as the Thunder shot only 15.6% from beyond the arc, and 33.7% from the field overall.",
      "\u201cYeah, we didn\u2019t shoot it well tonight,\u201d Gilgeous-Alexander said after the game. \u201cIt\u2019s not really an excuse. There was definitely controllables tonight we could have taken care of and we didn\u2019t do so, and that\u2019s why the score looked the way it does. We\u2019ve shot bad and won games before, so it\u2019s not an excuse.\u201d",
      "The Bucks\u2019 win avenged their defeat from last season\u2019s NBA Cup, which was the first ever iteration of the tournament. In 2023, Milwaukee made it to Las Vegas for the semifinals, but was defeated by the Indiana Pacers. This year, the Bucks finished a perfect 7-0 in Cup play.",
      "Though the final does not count toward league standings for either team, Milwaukee\u2019s championship run puts a capper on an impressive early season turnaround. After starting the season 2-8, the Bucks have now won 13 of their last 16 games including Tuesday\u2019s game. Their record, however, still stands at 14-11.",
      "\u201cI feel like it means we have enough to compete with the best teams,\u201d Antetokounmpo said about the importance of the win. \u201cBut we have to stay humble.\u201d",
      "At 20-5, Oklahoma City remains in first place in the Western Conference after Tuesday. The Thunder\u2019s three-point shooting will be interesting to monitor moving forward, however. In an NBA increasingly reliant on the long ball, Oklahoma City ranks only 19th in three-point percentage, which could put it at a disadvantage against other contenders.",
      "As the winning team, Milwaukee\u2019s players will each receive $514,971, while Thunder players will receive $205,988.",
      "The Bucks will resume their regular season slate Friday against the Eastern Conference-leading Cleveland Cavaliers.",
      "Oklahoma City, meanwhile, plays again Thursday, taking on the Orlando Magic on the first night of a back-to-back."

    "story": [
      "Michael Vick, one of the most electrifying quarterbacks in NFL history, will become the next head coach at Norfolk State University, according to multiple reports Tuesday.",
      "He will take over for Dawson Odums, who was fired on Nov. 26 after a 15-31 record in four seasons. Vick, 44, who has no formal coaching experience, told The Virginian-Pilot newspaper this week, \"I know how to lead and I know what it takes.\" He has been an NFL analyst for Fox Sports since 2017.",
      "A Newport News, Virginia, native, Vick starred at Virginia Tech and led the Hokies to the BCS National Championship Game in 2000, losing to Florida State. He finished sixth in voting for the Heisman Trophy that year and was drafted No. 1 overall in 2001 by the Atlanta Falcons.",
      "Vick played 13 NFL seasons, including six with the Falcons and five with the Philadelphia Eagles. He was named a Pro Bowler four times and threw for 22,464 yards and 133 touchdowns in his career. But while he was a top-tier passer, he was most known for his ability to run.",
      "His 6,109 yards is No. 1 in NFL history for quarterbacks, and he ranks No. 8 in touchdowns on the ground, with 36. In 2008 he became the first quarterback to rush for 1,000 yards in a single season. Vick is recognized as having helped revolutionize the position and has been cited numerous times for inspiring dual-threat quarterbacks in recent years.",
      "Vick's stardom took a major hit in 2007 when he pleaded guilty to his involvement in a dog fighting ring. He was released by the Falcons and spent 21 months in federal prison. After he served his sentence, the Eagles signed him in 2009. The next season he led Philadelphia to a division title and was named NFL Comeback Player of the Year.",
      "He officially retired in 2016.",
      "Vick will be the latest former NFL star to become a head coach at a historically Black college or university. Deion Sanders spent two years at Jackson State, compiling a 27-6 record, before he left for Colorado in 2022. Eddie George just completed his fourth season at Tennessee State and led the Tigers to the FCS postseason."

    "published": "Wed, 18 Dec 2024 02:00:00 GMT",

    "story": [
      "Indiana plans to carry out its first execution since 2009 before sunrise Wednesday, with much of the process concealed from the public.",
      "Under state law, no media witnesses will be allowed to view the execution of Joseph Corcoran, 49,\u00a0who is set to die by lethal injection for the 1997 killings of his brother and three other men, one of whom was the fianc\u00e9\u00a0of Corcoran's sister.",
      "The condemned man's legal team continued Tuesday to petition the federal courts, including the U.S. Supreme Court, to halt the execution after a federal appeals court on Monday sided with a federal judge who ruled that he is competent to be executed.",
      "\"If the courts do not stay the execution, we are asking Gov. [Eric] Holcomb to grant clemency to Joe, a seriously mentally ill man,\" Deputy Public Defender Joanna Green said in an email Tuesday.",
      "The Indiana Department of Corrections said Tuesday evening that Corcoran requested Ben & Jerry's ice cream for his last meal. His execution could occur sometime between midnight Wednesday and sunrise, barring any last-minute reprieve.",
      "Corcoran's lawyers maintain that he suffers from \"severe and longstanding paranoid schizophrenia,\" documented in self-published books from prison in which he described being subject to \"ultrasonic surveillance.\" His mental state, the lawyers add, has prevented him from properly seeking post-conviction relief.",
      "In a dissenting opinion for the appeals court, U.S. District Judge John Lee acknowledged that \"given Corcoran's long, undisputed history of severe mental illness and the pervasiveness of his continuing delusions, as evidenced by his book and recent medical records, Corcoran is entitled to have at least one court assess his competency to be executed.\"",
      "In recent days, anti-death penalty groups have demonstrated at the State Capitol and delivered letters to Holcomb's office, asking him to use his clemency powers.",
      "\"One week before we welcome the light of the Prince of Peace into the world,\" David Frank, president of the Indiana Abolition Coalition, said in reference to Christmas, \"the state in secret, under cover of darkness plans to take the life of Mr. Corcoran.\"",
      "Holcomb's office did not immediately respond to a request for comment Tuesday. In June, Holcomb announced the state had procured pentobarbital, a sedative used in lethal injections, after \"years of effort.\"",
      "\"Accordingly, I am fulfilling my duties as governor to follow the law and move forward appropriately in this matter,\" Holcomb said.",
      "Some death penalty states have had issues obtaining lethal injection drugs, leading to a moratorium on the practice. Still, Utah this year executed its first inmate in 14 years and South Carolina its first in 13 years, while Idaho tried to carry out its first execution in 12 years but halted the procedure when prison staff members were unable to locate a viable vein.",
      "Of the 27 states that still allow for capital punishment, only Indiana and Wyoming exclude media witnesses, according to the nonprofit Death Penalty Information Center.",
      "A lack of media scrutiny and the confidentiality surrounding the practice of executions in Indiana are part of why the original prosecutor in Corcoran's case, Robert Gevers, is speaking out against the death penalty.",
      "Gevers, who served two terms as the Allen County district attorney and is now a defense lawyer, said his views on the death penalty began to evolve around 2011, more than a decade after Corcoran's trial.",
      "He said he would not pursue a death sentence if he were involved in the case today, although he understands why some prosecutors believe it is important to give victims' loved ones that option for punishment in the pursuit of justice.",
      "\"I've seen it from both sides,\" Gevers said, as he struggled morally with the issue. However, \"I began to see that sparing an individual's life is nothing more than righteous grace and nothing less than that.\"",
      "Kelly Ernst, a sister of Corcoran's whose fianc\u00e9 was among the victims, told The Associated Press that she now believes the death penalty should be abolished and that the state's decision to execute her brother a week before Christmas is upsetting.",
      "\"My sister and I, our birthdays are in December,\" Ernst said. \"I mean, it just feels like it's going to ruin Christmas for the rest of our lives. That's just what it feels like.\"",
      "Corcoran was 22 in 1997 when he fatally shot his brother, James Corcoran, 30, in the home they shared in Fort Wayne. Also killed were Robert Scott Turner, 32, who was Ernst's fianc\u00e9, and friends Douglas Stillwell and Timothy Bricker, both 30.",
      "Five years earlier, Joseph Corcoran was acquitted in the murders of his parents, Jack and Kathryn Corcoran, after jurors found not enough evidence to convict. According to prosecutors, Corcoran killed his brother and the other men as they were watching TV after he believed they were talking about his suspected involvement in his parents' death.",
      "Corcoran's then-7-year-old niece was also home at the time of the shootings but was unharmed.",
      "His mental state had been debated amid his trial.",
      "In a petition last week asking Holcomb to commute Corcoran's death sentence to life in prison without parole, his lawyers stressed that he can be housed safely and has not had any incident reports while he has been incarcerated since 2006.",
      "\"Although Joe suffers from delusions, his delusions purely result in him believing he is being tormented and publicly embarrassed,\" they wrote. \"They have not resulted in any violent acts towards others during incarceration.\"",
      "Seven other inmates remain on Indiana's death row, according to the Death Penalty Information Center.",
      "A Republican state lawmaker filed legislation this month that would repeal the death penalty, and Corcoran's supporters hope Holcomb would at least grant a reprieve until debate could be heard. Gov.-elect Mike Braun, a Republican, like Holcomb, has said he supports legislative debate on the issue."

    "title": "Tennessee woman accused of selling fake weight loss drugs as counterfeit concerns grow",
    "published": "Tue, 17 Dec 2024 22:59:53 GMT",
    "summary": "A Tennessee woman was accused of selling counterfeit versions of popular weight loss drugs including Ozempic. Experts say fakes have exploded in the U.S.",
    "story": [
      "The first tip came into West Tennessee law enforcement about two months ago: A resident in the area was selling cheap versions of Ozempic and other weight loss drugs.",
      "According to officials with the West Tennessee Drug Task Force, the tipster believed the products couldn\u2019t be legitimate due to their unusually low prices: A 10-milligram vial of semaglutide, the active ingredient in Ozempic and Wegovy, sold for about $100, for example, and a 15 mg vial costs $140. The brand-name versions, from drugmaker Novo Nordisk, sell for around $1,000 for a month\u2019s supply.",
      "Last week, officials said they raided Emily Arnold\u2019s home in Medina, Tennessee, and found more than 300 vials of counterfeit versions of semaglutide, tirzepatide \u2014 the ingredient in the weight loss drug Zepbound and the diabetes drug Mounjaro\u00a0 \u2014 along with other drugs used for weight loss. Syringes, alcohol preps, mailers and other materials were also confiscated.",
      "Officials learned that she allegedly had also been supplying the drugs to two med spa clinics in the state. Some people who used the counterfeit drugs reported rashes and other pain from the injections, officials said.",
      "\u201cWe stumbled into one room that was set up, sort of like a lab,\u201d said Johnie Carter, the director of the West Tennessee Drug Task Force. \u201cWe even found three packages that were already packaged up and ready to go.\u201d",
      "\u201cIt was very shocking,\u201d he added.",
      "Officials said Arnold, 41, has been charged with four felonies and a misdemeanor, including impersonating a licensed professional. She will plead not guilty, her attorney said.",
      "As highly effective but pricey weight loss drugs gain popularity in the U.S., experts and public health officials warn that low-cost counterfeit versions are becoming increasingly common.",
      "Counterfeit versions of Wegovy or Zepbound are different from compounded weight loss drugs. Compounding is a legitimate practice that\u2019s monitored by the Food and Drug Administration. Compounded medications are essentially copies made by a licensed pharmacist and usually prescribed by a doctor.",
      "The FDA is allowing pharmacies to dispense compounded versions of semaglutide and tirzepatide until shortages of the brand-name drugs are fully resolved. In October, the FDA said compounding pharmacies can continue making their own versions after a compounding trade group sued the agency, saying the drugs were still in shortage. Compounded versions of the drugs tend to cost less and are popular at online pharmacies and med spas.",
      "Counterfeits, on the other hand, aren\u2019t licensed. They are manufactured and packaged to look like legitimate brand-name medications, but often contain little to none of the actual drug.",
      "Shabbir Safdar, the executive director of the Partnership for Safe Medicines, an advocacy group that tracks counterfeit drugs, said fake GLP-1 medications are \u201cthe No. 1 fraud issue\u201d that group is seeing in the U.S. and other parts of the world right now.",
      "\u201cIt has exploded,\u201d Safdar said. \u201cI\u2019ve never seen the quantity of fraud and crime that is happening in this space right now in anything for years. The criminals have been as active as the market excitement about the medicines are.\u201d",
      "The packaging of the counterfeit weight loss drugs can \u201cappear like a perfect look-alike\u201d to the brand-name versions, Safdar said. At the same time, he said, they could contain wrong or harmful ingredients, or contain too little, too much or no active ingredient at all.",
      "West Tennessee law enforcement officials said that testing by Eli Lilly, the maker of Mounjaro and Zepbound, after the raid revealed that one of the samples sold by Arnold was nothing more than water, which could be dangerous if not properly sterilized.",
      "\u201cNo one will be bothered if you\u2019re hurt,\u201d Safdar said. \u201cThey just want your money.\u201d",
      "The proliferation of counterfeit drugs",
      "The FDA is aware of and investigating reports of counterfeit weight loss drugs being illegally marketed in the U.S., an agency spokesperson said in a statement.",
      "\u201cWe vigilantly monitor the internet for fraudulent or unapproved products and have issued warning letters to stop the distribution of illegally marketed semaglutide and tirzepatide,\u201d the spokesperson said.",
      "If needed, the spokesperson added, the FDA\u2019s Office of Criminal Investigations will work with federal law enforcement officials to carry on seizures, injunctions and criminal prosecutions. Last year, the FDA announced that officials had seized thousands of units of counterfeit Ozempic found in the U.S. drug supply chain, but noted that some may still be available for purchase.",
      "An Eli Lilly spokesperson said in a statement that the company was pleased that regulators in Tennessee took action to \u201cstop one of the bad actors selling knockoff tirzepatide.\u201d Lilly has obtained shipments from China claiming to be tirzepatide that are packaged as dog food, tea and facial masks or hidden inside of a box of T-shirts, the spokesperson said.",
      "\u201cThe proliferation of counterfeit and other unsafe, unapproved tirzepatide knockoffs is dangerous and needs to be stopped,\u201d the spokesperson said.",
      "Novo Nordisk said it\u2019s fighting counterfeit products and pursuing litigation against groups that sell counterfeit drugs.",
      "\u201cProducing counterfeit products and inserting them into the legitimate U.S. supply chain is an illegal activity and puts patients at considerable risk,\u201d a Novo Nordisk spokesperson said in a statement.",
      "The risks of counterfeit drugs",
      "Using a counterfeit medication can lead to dangerous complications, said Dr. Daniela Hurtado Andrade, an endocrinologist at the Mayo Clinic in Jacksonville, Florida.",
      "\u201cYou never know what they are mixing them with,\u201d said Andrade, who spoke generally about the dangers of counterfeit drugs. \u201cThere is the potential risk that they are mixed with electrolytes, which for example, can put a person at risk of having cardiac arrhythmias.\u201d",
      "With counterfeit drugs, there\u2019s no way to know they\u2019re following health regulations.",
      "\u201cIf you are putting a contaminated substance under your skin, you can certainly be at risk of developing infections,\u201d she said. \u201cThese are infections that are local, but then you could have certain complications of local infections that can become systemic infections.\u201d",
      "Who is most at risk of counterfeit drugs?",
      "Anyone who buys a GLP-1 drug without a prescription could be at risk of getting a counterfeit version.",
      "The most vulnerable are people without adequate health care coverage or without prescription drug benefits, or who feel stigmatized by their weight and don\u2019t want to see a doctor, Timothy Mackey, a professor of global health at the University of California, San Diego, said.",
      "The nature of the weight loss drugs \u2014 large amounts of\u00a0 people qualify for them and their high cost \u2014 make the problem even more challenging to control, said Mackay, who studies counterfeit drugs.",
      "\u201cThis situation is a bit different than prior counterfeit medicine incidents, as arguably so many people are at risk,\u201d he said.\u00a0 \u201cAnd consumers believe that they should be readily available, conveniently.\u201d",
      "Safdar, of the Partnership for Safe Medicines, said the best way people can protect themselves is to always get the brand-name product through a prescription from a doctor.",
      "He acknowledged that other people may not qualify for the drug\u2019s indicated use and will seek alternatives.",
      "\u201cI\u2019ve seen people say, \u2018I got it because I was trying to lose that last 10 pounds,\u2019\u201d Safdar said. \u201cPeople are finding telehealth providers who will write that prescription and then dabbling in the market. None of that is safe.\u201d"

      "A San Francisco jury on Tuesday convicted IT consultant Nima Momeni in the 2023 fatal stabbing of tech executive Bob Lee, a killing that led to concern about street crime in the city \u2014 but which actually occurred after a personal dispute.",
      "The jury acquitted Momeni of first-degree murder but found him guilty of second-degree murder.",
      "A verdict was reached Monday but read out Tuesday after deliberations started Dec. 4. The jury had been asked to consider first-degree murder with an enhancement of using a deadly weapon, NBC Bay Area reported.",
      "Momeni appeared unemotional as the verdict was read, as did his lead attorney, who joined the hearing via Zoom, the station reported.",
      "Momeni faces 16 years to life in prison, San Francisco District Attorney Brooke Jenkins said.",
      "Lee, 43, the founder of the popular money transfer service Cash App, was found stabbed early April 4, 2023, near downtown San Francisco. He was rushed to a hospital but died of his injuries.",
      "Prosecutors argued that Momeni intended to fatally stab Lee over an argument about his sister, whom Lee knew, and her drug use. Momeni said that Lee attacked him with a knife and that he defended himself and Lee was stabbed.",
      "Lee's brother, Tim Oliver Lee, told reporters that the family is grateful for the guilty verdict, even though it was a lesser charge of second-degree murder.",
      "\"We know what happened here. We think he had the intent to murder; the jury felt like he did not have the intent coming into that situation,\" he said. \"But what matters today is that we had a guilty verdict and that Nima Momeni is going away for a very long time.\"",
      "On the morning of the killing a dispatcher told police a man was \u201cscreaming, \u2018help,\u2019 saying \u2018someone stabbed me,\u2019\u201d recordings showed.",
      "The case immediately generated controversy when SpaceX's Elon Musk posted on social media after Lee\u2019s death about crime in San Francisco and questioned the district attorney about \u201crepeat violent offenders.\u201d",
      "Instead, a week later, San Francisco police announced the arrest of Momeni, 40, who is not a repeat offender and whose sister was friends with Lee.",
      "Momeni was accused of driving Lee to a secluded area and stabbing him three times with a 4-inch kitchen knife. Lee was stabbed in the heart.",
      "Prosecutors said that Momeni planned to kill Lee and that he had an argument with Lee over his sister.",
      "Momeni testified that on April 3, his sister called and asked him to pick her up from the apartment of a friend of Lee's whom the sister described as her drug dealer. The sister testified that she told her brother she may have been sexually assaulted after she took the drug GHB.",
      "Prosecutors alleged in court documents that on the night of the killing, a witness saw Momeni questioning Lee \"regarding whether his sister was doing drugs or anything inappropriate\" and that Lee had to reassure him that nothing had happened.",
      "Momeni claimed he acted in self-defense after Lee pulled a knife on him.",
      "Momeni told jurors that on the night of the stabbing Lee had been doing drugs. They were in a car together but pulled over because Momeni thought Lee was going to vomit, and Momeni said Lee attacked him after Momeni made a joke that he'd rather spend his last night in San Francisco with family than at strip clubs.",
      "Momeni claimed that he had to defend himself when Lee pulled out the knife. Momeni said that there was a struggle over the weapon and that eventually Lee walked away down the street but that Momeni did not know he had been stabbed.",
      "The trial began Oct. 14. Assistant District Attorney Omid Talai said in opening statements that Lee, who was then the chief product officer of the cryptocurrency company MobileCoin, was \"stabbed through his heart and left to die.\"",
      "Asked why the jury went for second-degree murder instead of first-degree, Jenkins, the DA, said: \u201cOf course, we presented evidence that we thought substantiated a first-degree murder conviction, but at the end of the day, the jury has weighed in with their verdict, and we respect what that is, and we do understand, based on the facts, how they might get there.\u201d"

      "The proposal would also require the president and the vice president to divest from covered investments, and it would exact monetary penalties for violating the proposal, which one of the sponsors, Sen. Gary Peters, D-Mich., called \u201ca commonsense piece of legislation that helps maintain trust in this institution.\u201d",

    "summary": "Ohio Sen. Sherrod Brown discusses what comes next for the Democratic Party and for himself after an unsuccessful 2024 election.",
    "story": [
      "Welcome to the online version of\u00a0From the Politics Desk, an evening newsletter that brings you the NBC News Politics team\u2019s latest reporting and analysis from the White House, Capitol Hill and the campaign trail.",
      "In today\u2019s edition, senior national political reporter Henry J. Gomez sits down with Sen. Sherrod Brown, D-Ohio, to discuss what went wrong for the Democratic Party in 2024 and what comes next. Plus, national political correspondent Steve Kornacki breaks down how more than 40% of the country's counties were decided by at least 50 points in November.",
      "Sign up to receive this newsletter in your inbox every weekday here.",
      "Outgoing Sen. Sherrod Brown talks of rescuing a 'corporate' Democratic Party",
      "CLEVELAND \u2014 Fresh off a comfortable re-election victory in 2018, Sen. Sherrod Brown, D-Ohio, considered running for president on a populist message aimed at the many working-class Midwest voters who had fled the Democratic Party in favor of Donald Trump.",
      "Brown passed on the White House campaign. Now, six years later, he is soon to be unemployed, having recently lost his bid for a fourth Senate term. It will be the first time since 1992 \u2014 and only the second time since 1974 \u2014 that he will not hold an elected office.",
      "Trump, meanwhile, will return to the presidency next month, and the existential challenges are already roaring back for Brown and the Democrats. The challenges ring true to Brown, 72, who has been warning about them for years. And, despite his defeat, Brown\u2019s perch in a part of the country where Democrats are a tarnished brand presents him with the opportunity to have a vocal role in the party if he wants one.",
      "In a recent interview with NBC News, Brown talked like someone who does. He spoke of a \u201cpost-Senate mission\u201d to reorient Democrats as the \u201cparty of workers\u201d in Middle America. He also revealed that he has received calls from people encouraging him to run for chair of the Democratic National Committee, though he added that the position does not interest him.",
      "\u201cBeing the national chair, you have a platform,\u201d Brown said. \u201cYou also have to run an organization with 50 state chairs. \u2026 I don\u2019t want to spend my time on an airplane raising money.\u201d",
      "But Brown\u2019s post-Senate mission could lead him back to the Senate. He left the door open to running for office again in 2026, when Ohio will hold a special election to fill the remainder of Vice President-elect JD Vance\u2019s term. Brown also noticeably described the final remarks he delivered in the Senate on Tuesday as his \u201clast\u201d speech \u2014 not a \u201cfarewell,\u201d as such addresses from outgoing senators are commonly known.",
      "\u201cI\u2019m not making decisions yet on that,\u201d Brown replied when asked if he was already considering a comeback in 2026, when Ohio also will elect a new governor. \u201cI\u2019ve got time.\u201d",
      "For now, Brown is unleashing stinging critiques about his party.",
      "\u201cI\u2019m not going to whine about my loss,\u201d he said. \u201cBut I lost in large part because the national reputation of the Democratic Party is that we are sort of a lighter version of a corporation \u2014 a corporate party. We\u2019re seen as a bicoastal, elite party. And it\u2019s hard to argue that.\u201d",

      "The places where the 2024 election was a blowout",
      "Nationally, the presidential race was close, with Donald Trump besting Kamala Harris by 1.5 points in the popular vote. But at the county level, there were landslides galore.",
      "In the 2024 election, 1,267 counties were won by Trump or Harris by margins of 50 points or more. That accounts for just over 40% of all the 3,143 counties in the United States. It also represents a four-fold jump from the number of landslide counties a generation ago, when the narrow 2000 contest between George W. Bush and Al Gore (where the popular vote margin was 0.5 points) yielded just 304 of them.",
      "The number of landslide counties ticked up in the Bush and Barack Obama years before exploding in 2016, the first of three straight races with Trump at the top of the GOP ticket.",
      "The trend toward these local landslides reflects demographic divisions that have sharpened over the last quarter-century. Vast swaths of rural America, for instance, have become redoubts of red. Trump\u2019s 2024 vote share exceeded 90% in 53 counties, virtually all of them sparsely populated. His biggest vote margin on the map was 92 points in Nebraska\u2019s Hayes County, which has fewer than 1,000 residents and a population density of two people per square mile.",
      "Geographically, the terrain that Trump claimed with these landslides is broad. He won by at least 50 points in 75 of Tennessee\u2019s 95 counties, 39 of West Virginia\u2019s 55 counties, and 184 of Texas\u2019s 254 counties.",
      "Harris\u2019 county-level landslides, meanwhile, were far fewer in number. But cumulatively, the 42 counties she won by 50 or more points account for millions of votes. These counties tend to be in and around major cities, reflecting Democrats\u2019 strength with Black voters and white voters with college degrees.",
      "Her biggest landslide was 75 points, scored just outside Washington, D.C., in Maryland\u2019s Prince George\u2019s County, the largest Black-majority county in the country. She also crushed Trump by 64 points in California\u2019s upscale Marin County, which sports one of the highest median household incomes in the country and where two-thirds of the majority-white population have at least a four-year degree.",
      "While the rise in landslide counties is the product of two decades of deepening divisions, there has been one notable shift in the other direction. A number of heavily Hispanic counties where Democrats once routinely posted massive margins have moved dramatically to the right (or away from the left) in the Trump era. Webb County, in deep South Texas, for instance, gave Hillary Clinton a 52-point landslide eight years ago. This time around, Trump won it by 2.",

      "Let's go to the movies ... with the Heeler family!",
      "The first-ever animated feature film for \u201cBluey\u201d will land in theaters in 2027, BBC Studios and The Walt Disney Company announced. According to a press release, the movie \"will continue the adventures of Bluey, a loveable, inexhaustible, blue heeler dog, who lives with her Mum, Dad and her little sister, Bingo.\"",
      "Fans of the show have been on an emotional roller coaster this year, from the 28-minute supersized gut-punch of a season finale titled \u201cThe Sign\u201d to the unexpected bonus episode aptly titled \u201cSurprise\u201d that includes a time jump with an adult Bluey.",
      "There was a rumor that the beloved series was ending completely, but creators of the show didn't leave viewers hanging. They introduced \"Bluey Minisodes\" in summer 2024. The collection included 20 shorts that lean into Bluey and Bingo\u2019s playful interactions and games.",
      "What will the \"Bluey\" movie have in store for viewers?",
      "\u201cI really enjoyed the experience of working with a longer format on \u2018The Sign\u2019 in Series 3, so going even further with a feature film feels like a natural extension of that,\" series creator Joe Brumm said on the show's website. \"I\u2019ve always thought \u2018Bluey\u2019 deserved a theatrical movie. I want this to be an experiential event for the whole family to enjoy together.\"",
      "Brumm also shared some \"trifficult\" (a \"Bluey\" word for tricky plus difficult) news with fans: though he wrote the script for the film, he will be stepping down from making more TV episodes.",
      "\"Bluey has completely changed my life,\" he wrote in an open letter on the \"Bluey\" website. \"It\u2019s been an immensely satisfying thing to be a part of, more than I can really put into words. To walk away from it while it\u2019s at such a height will seem crazy to some but, for now, I am finding it difficult to reach back genuinely into that 4- to 6-year-old world and write authentically.\"",
      "\"Bluey\" has already captured the magic and mayhem of going to the movies with young kids.",
      "In a Season 2 episode titled \"Movies,\" Bandit takes Bluey and Bingo to see a movie ... with mixed results.",
      "Bandit is shocked by the cost of tickets and popcorn, especially when paying for a 4-year-old who \"isn't really going to watch.\" Bluey is afraid of the \"scary bits\" and has existential questions about feeling \"different.'\" Bingo spills popcorn, complains about the movie volume and runs away.",
      "Though we don't know the theme of the new movie, there's a good chance that it will have the same takeaway of the \"Movies\" episode: \"Just be yourself.\""

      "\"Everyone's like, 'This is the longest intermission ever,'\" Bowen Yang, who plays Glinda's friend Pfannee, tells TODAY.com.",
      "\"Wicked,\" which premieres in theaters Nov. 22, is part one of two films inspired by the hit Broadway musical of the same name. \"Wicked: Part 2,\" which is now called \"Wicked: For Good,\" will be released about a year later, on Nov. 21, 2025.",
      "Part 1 of the film adaptation clocks in at 2 hours and 40 minutes, making it about the same length as the entire \"Wicked\" musical. But the first film is just half of the story, following the events of Act 1 while giving moments \"a chance to breathe,\" the musical's composer Stephen Schwartz says.",
      "Other than expanding certain scenes and adding some dialogue, Part 1 of \"Wicked\" is largely faithful to the stage musical that inspired it. As for Part 2?",
      "\"I want to have the sanctity of the show. I love the show, so to me, that's first and foremost,\" director Jon M. Chu, who is still editing the second film, says. \"It will be the DNA of what it is.\"",
      "Here's what's in store (or could be) for \"Wicked: For Good,\" based on Act 2 of the musical.",
      "A time jump",
      "Like the 2024 film, Act 1 of \"Wicked\" ends with \"Defying Gravity.\" When the curtain rises again after a 15-minute intermission, a lot has changed.",
      "Between acts, there's a time jump, although how much time exactly is unclear. (The 1995 book by Gregory Maguire, which has a markedly different tone and adult audience, would suggest it's a period of about five years.)",
      "In the musical, Act 2 opens with the song \"Thank Goodness,\" sung primarily by Glinda and Madame Morrible, played by Ariana Grande and Michelle Yeoh in the film.",
      "The song establishes that Glinda has left Shiz University and has officially assumed the mantle of Glinda the Good, meant to uplift spirits, while the rest of Oz is overwhelmed by fear of the Wicked Witch of the West, the enemy of the Wizard. She also announces that she and Fiyero (Jonathan Bailey in the 2024 film), now a captain in the Wizard's army, are officially engaged.",
      "Yang confirms there will be a time jump in Part 2 of \"Wicked.\"",
      "\"Right when we pick up, Glinda is in this very front-facing position. Pfannee and Shenshen\u00a0(Bronwyn James) are at her side still, but a lot is in motion,\" Yang says. \"The world has literally changed, and the landscape of it is very different. There is this campaign against this one person that they're like the reason for all the problems in the world.",
      "\"The story is so flexible with how it relates to our real world,\" Yang adds.",
      "A love triangle",
      "Act 2 of the musical also delivers on lingering chemistry and Elphaba's unrequited feelings for Fiyero.",
      "While Elphaba resigned herself to being \"not that girl\" in Act 1, audience members learn in the second act that the reason Fiyero joined the Wizard's army was to take an active role in searching for Elphaba, who has been missing in action but speaking out against the Wizard, his leadership and his treatment of Animals (sentient animals).",
      "When Elphaba tries to free the flying monkeys she accidentally created at the end of Act 1, she runs into the Wizard, who, after a failed attempt to again sway her to his side, turns her in to his guards.",
      "She and Fiyero reunite, and instead of bringing her to the Wizard, he helps her escape and leaves with her, abandoning Glinda.",
      "Glinda then finds herself the third prong of the love triangle and sings a reprise of \"I'm Not That Girl.\" Meanwhile, Fiyero and Elphaba profess their love to the steamy song \"As Long As You're Mine.\"",
      "A transformation",
      "While Elphaba leads a campaign against the Wizard, her sister, Nessarose (Marissa Bode in the film), has taken over as governor of Munchkinland in the wake of their father's death and rules harshly. Her relationship with Boq (Ethan Slater) has soured, and he stays by Nessarose's side under duress rather than love.",
      "Elphaba visits Nessarose in Act 2, and the younger sister airs her resentment. Elphaba then casts a spell on Nessarose's silver shoes, allowing her to walk. Boq responds by announcing his intentions to leave and declare his true affections for Glinda.",
      "Desperate to make him love her, Nessarose tries to use Elphaba's spell book, the Grimmerie, but her enchantment goes wrong and she shrinks his heart. To save him, Elphaba turns him into a man made of tin so he can survive without a heart. Nessarose then proclaims herself the Wicked Witch of the East.",
      "Bode is the first actor to play Nessarose who uses a wheelchair in real life. She told TODAY's Donna Farizan in an interview that while she can't say too much about Part 2, \"it is definitely less of a case of my character wanting to be fixed, and more of her just taking in the magic itself.\"",
      "Bode also confirms to TODAY.com that in \"Wicked: For Good\" her character plays a bigger role in the story. Her character undergoes almost a 180-degree change from the end of Part 1, which sees her happy and in love with Boq, to the start of Part 2.",
      "\"What was helpful to me was journaling as my character to fill in a lot of the blanks and to really get in the mindset (of) why my character changed, what her feelings were in the in between and how did she get to where she was today,\" Bode says.",
      "New songs",
      "By breaking up \"Wicked\" into two films, composer Stephen Schwartz and screenplay writer Winnie Holzman had \"freedom\" to let scenes and moments \"breathe.\"",
      "\"There are a lot of scenes that Winnie wrote, there were a couple of songs that I tried for the first movie that we wound up not putting in the movie, but the essence of what we were trying to accomplish got into the movie,\" Schwartz says.",
      "While there aren't any new songs to Part 1, there will be in Part 2.",
      "\"There are two new songs in the second movie because they felt they were dramatically necessary,\" Schwartz says.",
      "But will any songs get cut?",
      "\"No, I don't think so,\" Chu says. \"I don't know if I can confirm or deny that, but in my first pass of it right now ... but you never know, I'm still editing it.",
      "\"But I want to have the sanctity of the show,\" he adds. \"If it doesn't fit in one place, and I need to find a place where it does emotionally, or we need to change the lyrics, or we need to do things to change \u2014 but it will be the DNA of what it is.\"",
      "The soundtrack of Act 2 of \"Wicked\" includes:",

      "After Elphaba and Fiyero run off together, Glinda tells Madame Morrible that the way to draw out her former friend is by targeting her sister. So, using her powers to control the weather, Madame Morrible summons the tornado that lands a house on Nessarose, bringing Dorothy Gale to Oz. Like in \"The Wizard of Oz,\" Glinda gives Dorothy Nessarose's shoes and instructs her to follow the yellow brick road to the Emerald City.",

Glinda, realizing the danger of the angry mob against Elphaba, arrives at her friend's side to try and warn her. Elphaba decides to give up the fight and sings the tearful (and iconic) goodbye song \"For Good\" with Glinda.",

      "How does the 'Wicked' musical end?",

      "The finale of \u201cWicked\u201d reveals that Elphaba wasn\u2019t actually killed by the pail of water. Elphaba\u2019s spell to protect Fiyero turned him into a scarecrow. After the showdown with Dorothy, he arrives at the castle to bring his love out of the trap door she was hiding in, and they leave Oz together.",
      "Meanwhile, Glinda confronts the Wizard after witnessing Elphaba's \"death,\" bringing the remnants of her melting: Elphaba's hat and the green bottle she always carried that belonged to her mother.",
      "When the Wizard sees the green elixir, he realizes that Elphaba was his biological child, finally unmasking the identity of the man Elphaba's mother had an affair with at the very beginning of the story.",
      "Jeff Goldblum confirms that he's the figure singing in the part of the opening song, \"No One Mourns the Wicked,\" which shows Elphaba's mother having an affair. (He's also credited in the song on the movie's official soundtrack.)",
      "\"You don't see me,\" he says. \"I have this drink, and that's a little mysterious and that will come to light.\"",
      "The camerawork keeps the man's face just out of each frame, so audiences \"aren't supposed to know that it's me,\" he says. But there's a tiny moment for careful listeners that connect the mysterious man to the Wizard in the first film, he says.",
      "After his introduction in \"Wicked,\" Goldblum's version of the Wizard performs a little tap dance and sings, \"You've got to give people what they want,\" in a similar tune to the part he sings in the overture.",
      "\"So if you're listening, and you're subliminally Easter egg-oriented, you might go, 'Is that the guy?'\" Goldblum says.",
      "So wait, the Wicked Witch of the West is alive?",
      "Yes, deviating from the plot of \"The Wizard of Oz,\" the Wicked Witch of the West is alive at the end of the \"Wicked\" musical.",
      "Elphaba's fate with the scarecrow Fiyero is left unknown.",
      "The musical's ending also differs from Maguire's original book, which sees Elphaba actually melt and die at the hands of Dorothy. Maguire went on to write several sequels to \"Wicked,\" focusing on different Ozian characters, including \"Son of a Witch,\" about Elphaba and Fiyero's son.",
      "So could there be a sequel to the \"Wicked\" musical?",
      "\"We actually have a notion for something, and it's not from Gregory Maguire book,\" Schwartz says. \"That's really all I can say right now. It is something Winnie and I are talking about and exploring, but it actually goes back to Baum, not back to Gregory.\""

      "The former \"Scandal\" star is notoriously tight-lipped about her marriage with Asomugha, but she shared intimate details about him and their relationship in her 2023 memoir, \u201cThicker Than Water.\u201d",
      "Nnamdi Asomugha is a football pro turned actor",
      "Asomugha led a sports-centered life before becoming a Hollywood actor and producer.",
      "He played college football for the California Golden Bears and spent 11 years in the NFL, playing for teams in Oakland, Philadelphia and San Francisco. He hung up his cleats in 2013.",
      "Toward the end of his football career, Asomugha started appearing on some TV shows, such as \"The Game\" in 2008, \"Friday Night Lights\" in 2009, \"Leverage\" in 2010 and \"Cubed\" in 2011.",
      "His breakout role, though, came in 2020 with \"Sylvie's Love.\" He starred alongside Tessa Thompson in the film, which earned an Emmy nomination for outstanding television movie. Some of his producing credits include \"The Banker\" and \"Harriet.\"",
      "The couple first met backstage at a Broadway show",
      "Washington wrote in her book that she met Asomugha while she was in her first Broadway play, \"Race.\" She originated the role of Susan in 2009 and played the character through June 2010 at the Ethel Barrymore Theatre.",
      "They were both represented by CAA at the time, so the talent agency arranged for Asomugha to meet Washington and the cast backstage while he was in New York visiting friends and seeing shows.",
      "They could have met earlier, though: \"Later I would be reminded that although I\u2019d never met Nnamdi before, he and I had cohosted a fundraiser in Northern California for Kamala Harris\u2019 attorney general campaign,\" she wrote in her book. \"We had both been unable to attend the event but had lent our names in support of what I was certain would be a stellar political career.\"",
      "\"But that night at the Barrymore, we finally did meet, and I felt dizzied by the calm and pure authenticity of his presence. I still am.\"",
      "They had a secret wedding",
      "The couple worked hard to keep their 2013 wedding day out of the public eye, Washington wrote in her memoir.",
      "They had it at a friend's house, the wedding planner was under \"strict confidentiality,\" verbal invitations went out \"just prior\" to the ceremony and the hired vendors thought the event they were servicing was a family reunion. Plus, the wedding dress designer told his team the gown was for \"the Moroccan premiere of 'Scandal.'\"",
      "\u201cFor months I had been wearing my engagement ring secretly pinned inside my clothing for fear that if people knew we were engaged, it would be impossible to have a wedding away from public spectacle,\" she wrote.",

      "\"As Nnamdi and I planned our wedding, we were aware that this singular day was not just a party but an opportunity to establish the culture of our marriage and our lives together,\" she wrote. \"We wanted the details of the day to reflect where we came from, who we were, and the future we hoped to build together.\"",
      "Her cousin played the music that Washington walked down the aisle to, Asomugha's cousin DJed the reception and his sister officiated, according to the memoir. Asomugha's younger sister designed and made traditional Nigerian gowns, and Washington's father walked her halfway down the aisle while she walked the rest of the way herself.",
      "Asomugha is the first person she told about her biological father",

      "\u201cHe was the first person that I told after my parents told me, and so I came home and realized that as disorienting as the news was \u2014 as sort of confused and adrift as I felt knowing that my family wasn\u2019t who I thought we were \u2014 when I saw him, I knew who this family was,\u201d Washington said. \u201cI knew that no matter what I was feeling with my parents in that moment, I belonged here.\u201d",
      "Washington learned that her biological father is a sperm donor and not the man who raised her after sharing with her parents that she agreed to appear on \u201cFinding Your Roots,\u201d according to her memoir.",
      "They were initially excited but eventually became unnerved when a DNA test was mentioned, Washington wrote. Her parents later sat her down and told her about her paternity and none of them ended up doing the show.",
      "After their conversation, Washington wrote that she returned to her house where her husband was fiddling around in the closet.",
      "\u201cWhen he finally appeared, the sight of him was like a buoy, a lifesaving beacon of belonging, a desert island after decades adrift,\u201d she wrote in the book.",
      "They 'try to be more open' when parenting",
      "The couple have welcomed two children together, Isabelle Amarachi, born in 2014, and Caleb Kelechi, born in 2016. Asomugha is also a dad to a teenage daughter, whom Washington has embraced as her own.",

      "Fostering a home of open dialogue is one way it works, she said.",
      "\"But even telling them about my paternity, it's a different conversation with a 17-year-old than a 6-year-old, but we want to let them know,\" she said. \"I don't want them hearing things about our family in the playground that they're not hearing from us.\""

      "\"There\u2019s so much romance in that movie. There\u2019s so much confusion in that movie about relationships that that\u2019s an eternal situation for people,\" he told Willie Geist for the Dec. 15 edition of \"Sunday Sitdown.\" \"And young kids now, they\u2019re into the phase of their life where they may be falling in love and, 'Is this the right thing?' It took Harry and Sally 12 years to figure it out, you know?\"",
      "The film's tagline notably posed a philosophical, even existential, question: \"Can two friends sleep together and still love each other in the morning?\"",
      "The question is explored both in the story's plot and its dialogue. After meeting via a carpool from the University of Chicago to New York City, Harry and Sally bump into each other over the years before striking up a friendship. Whether or not their relationship can stay platonic becomes the driving force of the film.",
      "Harry argues, in one of their earliest run-ins, that men and women can't just be friends \"because the sex part always gets in the way.\" And at the risk of spoiling the 35-year-old film, he's seemingly proven right by the end.",

When he comes over to console her, the pair sleep together for the first time and find themselves on vastly different pages the next morning: Harry wants to go back to being friends, and Sally tries to end their friendship forever.",
      "In the movie's finale, Harry sprints in the snow to profess his love to Sally at a New Year's Eve party, a scene that some on X have recently said \"literally changed the trajectory\" of their lives.",
      "The movie's screenwriter, Nora Ephron, who died in 2012, said that the film wasn't about answering the question, \"Can men and women be friends?\" Instead, the movie is about the differences in how men and women view friendship, she wrote in the introduction to a 1990 printing of the script, per Entertainment Weekly.",
      "\u201cThe truth is that men don\u2019t want to be friends with women. Men know they don\u2019t understand women, and they don\u2019t much care. They want women as lovers, as wives, as mothers, but they\u2019re really not interested in them as friends. They have friends,\" she said.",
      "\"Women, on the other hand, are dying to be friends with men. Women know they don\u2019t understand men, and it bothers them: they think that if only they could be friends with them, they would understand them,\" she added.",

      "We asked some of the most popular authors today for their take on the core question at the heart of the film: Can men and women just be friends? Or, updated for 2024, can two people who are attracted to each other just be friends?",

      "Emily Henry",
      "Emily Henry is the author of several romance novels, including \"People We Meet On Vacation,\" which she's described as an homage to \"When Harry Met Sally...,\" and \"Book Lovers,\" featuring a main character named Nora Stephens, after Ephron.",
      "\"People We Meet on Vacation,\" currently being adapted for a film starring Emily Bader and Tom Blyth, follows Poppy and Alex and their friendship from college to adulthood, sustained through annual vacations.",
      "On the question of whether two people attracted to each other can just be friends, Henry says, \"I actually do think so.\"",
      "\"I think Poppy and Alex could have stayed friends, they just had to make the decision,\" she says. \"You can't be half-in and half-out, you have to make the decision and really commit to it.",
      "\"For a lot of us, attraction comes and goes, but friendship is forever,\" she adds. \"I wonder what Nora would actually say because the movie, it's like they get together, but was she really saying they can't (be friends), or was she just saying these people belong to each other? I wish I could ask her.\"",
      "Yulin Kuang",
      "Speaking of the \"People We Meet on Vacation\" film adaptation, the screenplay for that project was written by Yulin Kuang. She's also set to direct the adaptation of Henry's \"Beach Read,\" and in April she published her debut romance novel, \"How to End a Love Story.\"",
      "Kuang says she's a huge \"When Harry Met Sally...\" fan.",
      "\"I have never lived in a world without it, which feels correct,\" she says.",
      "In fact, the writer had the \"When Harry Met Sally...\" screenplay printed out and kept it on her desk, \"so I could absorb its energy by osmosis.\"",
      "Looking back on it now, she gives a clear answer on the film's question.",
      "\"Can men and women be friends? Yes,\" she says. \"Can two people who are attracted to each other \u2014 that one gives me pause.\"",
      "\"Yes, but if I was very attracted to (a friend), I would have to do some unpacking about that in therapy,\" she adds. \"If it was getting to the point of, 'We're in crush territory,' I think that would be a little dangerous.\"",
      "As to how the film answers its own question, Kuang described it as a \"specific story,\" rather than a generalization. Because both characters feel relatable, like real people pulled from the world, it's understandable to view the movie as a commentary on men and women, she says.",
      "\"But ultimately, it's really just a commentary on Harry and Sally,\" she says.",
      "Kennedy Ryan",
      "Kennedy Ryan is the author of more than 20 books, including \"Reel\" and the upcoming conclusion to her \"Skyland\" series, \"Can't Get Enough.\"",

      "\"That's like, hall of fame happily ever after,\" she says.",
      "Like Henry and Kuang, she thinks people who are attracted to each other can stay friends \u2014 but \"it can be complicated.\"",
      "\"I say that just because I have several friends who are guys who I've known for years,\" she says. \"Now, I also have had friends who were guys who, it didn't work out that way, where you thought that it would be fine being platonic, and then one catches feelings for the other, and then it gets complicated, and you can get really hurt and lose friendships that way.\"",
      "She maintains it's possible with specific boundaries.",
      "\"I think it just comes down to being clear about what you both want and when things shift, being honest about that,\" she says.",
      "It also depends on if you find them attractive, or, if you're attracted to them.",
      "\"If you are attracted to someone, and I say this as a romance novelist \u2014 like, I live by this stuff \u2014 it's the draw, it's the pull, and that's something that, if it's strong enough, it's hard to ignore,\" she says. \"But also, if you are attracted to someone, you have to ask, why is this not a romantic relationship? And when you interrogate that, maybe it helps you deal with the attraction.\"",

      "\"Back then, friendship was \u2014 everything was defined in very restrictive terms and put in these very traditional buckets,\" she says. \"If you're friends, that's platonic. It means you're not having sex, and you never will.",
      "\"But I think that the idea of friendship has evolved. I mean, when we get to 'Sex and the City,' we have the idea of f--- buddies, and people that you aren't pursuing a relationship with that you're really just friends with, that you're also having sex with,\" she adds.",
      "She describes the film's essential question as, \"Can you platonically be friends with someone that you are attracted to?\"",
      "\"No, I don't think you can,\" she says. \"I don't think there's any way to be platonic friends with someone that you desperately want to have sex with.\"",
      "She argues if one is attracted to a friend, the dynamic can no longer be described as platonic.",
      "While having the friendship between Harry and Sally inevitably turn into a relationship may seem \"puritanical\" \u2014 \"if you're attracted, you have to be lovers\" \u2014 Williams argues the film's depiction of romance  defied gender normative roles of men and women not understanding each other.",
      "\"It's showing there's friendship within a relationship,\" she says. \"In 'When Harry Met Sally...' they were actually friends for years, and then fell in love. Women are people. Men are people. We can have friendship, respect.\"",

      "\"I think if the circumstances had been different their friendship would have continued for the rest of their lives, quite happily,\" she says. \"I feel like it's a very boring answer, but I think yes.\"",
      "\"I feel like I have a lot of male friends, and so I believe that of course it's possible, even with someone as absolutely charming as Billy Crystal,\" she adds. \"I think I could absolutely just be friends with Billy Crystal.\"",
      "And while the film ends with Harry and Sally in a romantic relationship, she argues the film \"does actually prove that men and women can be friends \u2014 I'm willing to say it,\" she says.",
      "\"What I believe to be true is that romance is really about timing,\" she says. \"That's what you see in the movie. There are all of these misses in terms of timing for them, and then the timing is right. But it doesn't mean in the multiverse, in the Harry and Sally multiverse, that it always would be.\"",

      "Jasmine Guillory, whose next book, \"Flirting Lessons,\" comes out in April 2025, is the author of nine romance books, including \"The Wedding Date.\"",
      "Guillory says \"absolutely\" people who are attracted to each other can be friends, because attraction isn't the only determining factor of whether or not a relationship can work.",
      "\"I'm attracted to so many people who I recognize that our relationship is perfect as it is, and I would never want to do anything to it,\" Guillory says.",

    "published": "Sat, 14 Dec 2024 19:41:13 GMT",
    "summary": "Selena Gomez's engagement ring might be sparking a trend into marquise cut diamond rings. Here's what to know.",
    "story": [
      "It seems like Selena Gomez won't be \"Single Soon,\" now that she's engaged to Benny Blanco.",
      "While announcing their engagement on social media Dec. 11, Gomez posted a close-up of her ring. The main diamond takes center stage, but the chunky yellow gold band also sparkles with smaller stones.",
      "\u201cWhen I first saw the ring, all I could think about was how unique it was,\u201d jewelry content creator and gemstone wholesaler Julia Hackman Chaf\u00e9 told TODAY.com in an email statement.",
      "At first, Chaf\u00e9 was surprised by the ring choice. She expected Gomez to \u201cgo for a colored stone ring\u201d since Blanco, whose real name is Benjamin Levin, \u201cspecifically wears a lot of colored gemstones.\u201d Blanco wore a necklace with a large red stone during his May 2024 TODAY with Hoda & Jenna appearance, for example.",
      "Instead, she went for a marquise cut diamond. Chaf\u00e9 estimated Gomez\u2019s center stone is four carats with .25 carat stones lining the band. \u201cThe diamond itself, if Benny chose a high-quality diamond, is probably around $75,000 and up,\u201d she said.",
      "But it appears the marquise cut has a deeper, and deliberate, meaning. The diamond type is referenced in Gomez's 2015 collab with A$AP Rocky, \u201cGood for You,\u201d when she sings, \u201cI\u2019m in my marquise diamonds/ I\u2019m a marquise diamond/ Could even make that Tiffany jealous.\u201d",
      "The gist of the lyrics is about wanting to look good for someone else. \"Let me show you how proud I am to be yours,\" Gomez sings.",
      "Chaf\u00e9, like many internet commentators, is convinced the choice of ring stems from the song. \u201cIt must be something from there,\u201d she said.",
      "On Dec. 14, Blanco added new evidence to the theory by posting a video of him and Gomez clinking glasses after their engagement. Gomez shows off her new ring in the clip, and Blanco set the video to \"Good for You,\" specifically highlighting her lyric about marquise diamonds.",
      "Among diamonds, a marquise is one of the \"less popular cuts,\" Chaf\u00e9 said.",
      "\"But with the rise in popularity of all things elongated, it was a matter of time before marquise came into fashion,\u201d she added.",
      "Some marquise cut-wearers are happy Gomez joined the club. A TikToker posted a video with the text, \"Now me and Selena have the same Marquise Diamond ring.\"",
      "Others are anticipating that Gomez's ring will spark a spike in popularity, making their unique rings not quite as special. One TikToker posted a video of her marquise ring with the text \"to my marquise girlies... it was nice while it lasted.\"",
      "Going forward, Chaf\u00e9 also expects the marquise cut to rise in popularity.",
      "\u201cAnything Selena Gomez does will spark a trend. Perhaps not in 2025, but in 2026, for sure, marquise will be a popular cut,\u201d she said."

      "Israel's defense minister has vowed that it would maintain \u201cfull freedom of action\u201d in the Gaza Strip after fighting ends in the Palestinian enclave, a day after raising hopes that a ceasefire and hostage deal was imminent.",
      "Israel was \u201ccloser to a ceasefire deal than we have ever been,\u201d Defense Minister Israel Katz said during a closed-door parliamentary committee hearing Monday. The comment was confirmed to NBC News by an Israeli lawmaker who was present.",
      "While ceasefire talks have broken down multiple times in the past, two U.S. officials and an Israeli official\u00a0last week told\u00a0NBC News that Hamas relented on key points to securing an agreement.",
      "According to the officials who spoke on the condition of anonymity, Hamas agreed that Israeli forces would remain in Gaza temporarily after the end of hostilities, and Hamas would provide a comprehensive list of hostages, including American citizens, to be released.\u00a0Hamas would also see a large number of Palestinian prisoners released by Israel as part of the deal, the sources said.",
      "The Wall Street Journal first reported these concessions.\u00a0Hamas has not confirmed to NBC News or others\u2019 reporting that it has agreed to Israeli troops in Gaza.",
      "Hamas said Tuesday that \u201cserious and positive discussions\u201d had taken place in Doha, Qatar, with Egyptian and Qatari mediators, and that reaching a ceasefire agreement and prisoner exchange was possible if Israel \u201cstops setting new conditions.\u201d",
      "On Tuesday morning, Katz said Israel would maintain control over Gaza after the fighting ends.",
      "\"After the military and governmental power of Hamas in Gaza is defeated, Israel will securely control Gaza with full freedom of action\" he posted on X, likening this outcome to Israel\u2019s current control over the occupied West Bank.",
      "Katz did not immediately respond to NBC News\u2019 request for details on what \u201cfull freedom of action\u201d would mean. But the comparison to the West Bank underscores a key concern for Palestinians and their supporters: the fear of prolonged Israeli military presence in Gaza, akin to the West Bank, where Israel maintains ultimate control over territory and settlements, and carries out regular raids in the area.",
      "Yossi Mekelberg, a senior consulting fellow with Chatham House\u2019s Middle East and North Africa program, said Katz' comparisons with the West Bank suggest that Israel is \u201cgoing to have full control entering by any means at any given time.\u201d",
      "\"That\u2019s a completely fair enough interpretation, considering that we know what happens in the West Bank,\" he said. \"Is that what a ceasefire agreement is going to say? I have my doubts.\"",
      "Gershon Baskin, an Israeli hostage negotiator and frequent critic of Netanyahu's government, said he did not believe Katz' remark that Israel had never been closer to a ceasefire.",
      "\"I have difficult accepting that Hamas has dropped its fundamental demand of an obligation to end the war including full Israeli withdrawal,\" he told NBC News via WhatsApp.",
      "President-elect Donald Trump has injected urgency into negotiations, repeating Monday his threat that there would be \u201chell to pay\u201d if no deal was in place by the time he was inaugurated Jan. 20.",
      "A senior administration official told NBC News on Friday that Trump\u2019s pressure was a major factor in Hamas relenting on two key issues during ceasefire and hostage-release talks with Israel.",
      "\u201cThere is a confidence we have not seen since May when\" President Joe Biden \"presented his proposal,\u201d the official told NBC News, acknowledging that Trump\u2019s warning that he wants to see a deal before he takes office was \u201ca big factor\u201d in recent concessions.",
      "The U.S. hopes to secure a ceasefire agreement before the end of the month, national security adviser Jake Sullivan said last week in a press conference in Tel Aviv.",
      "Recent developments in the region, including the weakening of Iran, the longtime backer of the terrorist group, the degradation of Hezbollah and the fall of Syrian dictator Bashar al-Assad, also contributed to the compromise by Hamas, the senior Biden administration official said.",
      "Negotiations to secure the release of the remaining hostages captured by Hamas during the Oct. 7, 2023, terror attack have languished for months. According to Israeli officials, around 1,200 people were killed in the country during the attack and around 250 people were taken hostage \u2014\u00a0dozens of whom\u00a0are still being held by Hamas and other militant groups.",
      "More than 45,000 people, more than half of them women and children, have been killed in the Gaza Strip in Israel's military campaign following the attack, according to the enclave's health officials and aid organizations. Much of the Palestinian enclave has been destroyed and a majority of the population driven from their homes."

      "Footage of the blast emerged as Israel announced plans to double its population in the occupied Golan Heights, citing threats from Syria. The move earned international condemnation and came after Syrian rebel leader Abu Mohammad al-Jolani said he has no interest in engaging in new conflicts.",
      "The Syrian Observatory for Human Rights, a London-based war monitoring group, described the imagery emerging from Tartus as representing \u201cthe most violent Israeli strikes on military sites in the eastern Tartus area.\u201d",

      "The Israel Defense Forces did not immediately respond to a request for comment on the footage. But an Israeli official who reviewed the video said the fireball was likely the result of a secondary explosion, citing the possibility of munitions igniting following an Israeli strike. The official spoke on the condition of anonymity as the person was not authorized to discuss Israel\u2019s aerial campaign in Syria.",
      "It comes days after satellite images appeared to show Russian forces packing up and dismantling military equipment at Russia\u2019s Tartus naval base and Hmeimim air base, both located south of Latakia on Syria\u2019s Mediterranean coast.",

      "In 2019, then-President Donald Trump broke with the international community and years of U.S. precedent in moving to recognize Israel's sovereignty over the territory \u2014 a policy shift that was not reversed by the Biden administration.",
      "The decision to expand the Israeli population in the Golan Heights comes after Netanyahu's office said Thursday that the collapse of Bashar al-Assad's regime in Syria had \u201ccreated a vacuum on\u00a0Israel\u2019s border and in the buffer zone established by the 1974 Separation of Forces Agreement,\u201d which stipulated Israel\u2019s withdrawal from areas of Mount Hermon it occupied during the 1973 Arab-Israeli War.",
      "\u201cIsrael\u00a0will not permit jihadi groups to fill that vacuum and threaten Israeli communities on the Golan Heights with October 7th style attacks,\u201d it said.",

      "When NBC News gained access to the squat, modernist palace perched in the mountains above the capital, Damascus, on Wednesday, it was relatively calm, despite the appearance of having been robbed. Fighters from the Hayat Tahrir al-Sham militant group, which led the rebel overthrow, stood guard, checking cars in a bid to put a stop to any more thefts from the building that was Assad\u2019s main residence until he was forced into exile.",

While one room had been torched and its chandeliers were covered in ash, some of the others looked like they might have been robbed, although art remained on the walls and the mother-of-pearl inlay was still in the doors.",

    "story": [
      "Many women are surprised by how much pain they experience during a medication abortion, a study published Tuesday in the journal BMJ Sexual & Reproductive Health found.",
      "More than 60% of abortions in the U.S. are medication abortions, meaning a person takes two drugs, often at home, to end a pregnancy. The study, which surveyed women in the U.K., found that many don\u2019t feel prepared for the amount of pain they may feel during the procedure.",
      "Pain does not mean the procedure is unsafe, but some women may feel caught off guard based on the information health providers gave them.",
      "\u201cThere is a bit of a reckoning in the world of gynecology right now and the pain patients are experiencing during procedures,\u201d said Dr. Alyssa Colwill, an associate professor of obstetrics and gynecology at the Oregon Health and Science University School of Medicine who wasn\u2019t involved with the new research.",
      "In the study, researchers looked at survey responses from about 1,600 women in the U.K. who had undergone a medication abortion and then answered questions about the experience. Most were between the ages of 20 and 39 and half had never given birth.",
      "More than 90% of respondents ranked their pain at least a 4 out of a maximum of 10, and about half said the pain was more than they had expected. About 40% said their pain was severe, between an 8 and a 10 on the pain scale.",
      "Women are often told to expect cramping akin to strong menstrual cramps during a medication abortion, both in the U.K. and in the U.S. While some respondents felt that was an accurate description, others said they felt unprepared and that the pain aspect of medication abortion was \u201csugar-coated\u201d or downplayed.",
      "One woman who responded to the survey said: \u201cPain was so much stronger than period pain, it was like having contractions in labour. I\u2019ve given birth three times and the pain really wasn\u2019t too much different from that pain, the cramping contraction pain.\u201d",
      "Another said: \u201cI think it\u2019s worth reassuring people that just because it [pain] is stated severe it doesn\u2019t necessarily mean that it will be. I spent more time worrying about the possibilities of the side effects than needed!\u201d",
      "The researchers concluded that women wanted detailed, realistic pain counseling and general preparatory advice, including details from firsthand experiences that illustrate the range of pain women may experience during medication abortion.",
      "\u201cWhat\u2019s important here is the acknowledgement that everyone\u2019s experience of pain during a medical abortion will be different,\u201d the study\u2019s lead author, Hannah McCulloch, an evaluation researcher at the British Pregnancy Advisory Service, wrote in an email. \u201cIt\u2019s important to be realistic about what women experience during medical abortion in order to provide meaningful patient-centred care.\u201d",
      "Medication abortions involve taking two pills. The first, mifepristone, blocks the hormone progesterone, which is critical for a pregnancy to continue. One or two days after taking mifepristone, the person takes a second drug \u2014 usually misoprostol \u2014 which causes the uterus to cramp and soften and the cervix to dilate so the pregnancy can pass, usually within 24 hours of taking misoprostol, according to Colwill.",
      "\u201cThat process, the uterus having to cramp and expel the pregnancy, inherently is going to cause pain,\u201d she said, adding that many factors play into how much pain each person feels.",
      "Women who may report less pain with a medication abortion include those who have experienced labor or given birth vaginally and women who have painful menstrual cramps every month, such as those who have endometriosis, Colwill said.",
      "\u201cUnderstanding these past experiences, and things like how they experience Pap smears and vaginal exams, can help us better support patients to be prepared for how pain may be for them,\u201d she added, noting that she was not surprised to see many women did not feel they were adequately prepared to manage pain during a medication abortion.",
      "Medication abortion is an extremely safe procedure. Serious side effects occur in less than 0.5% of people who take Mifeprex, the brand-name version of mifepristone, according to the drug\u2019s label, and the number of women managing their own abortions has increased since the Supreme Court overturned Roe v. Wade in 2022.",
      "\u201cPatients need to be adequately informed about what to expect and be told what we know about how to manage the pain. Pain is downplayed in medicine in general and particularly in women\u2019s health and obstetrics and gynecology,\u201d said Dr. Daniel Grossman, a professor of obstetrics and gynecology and director of advancing new standards in reproductive health at the University of California San Francisco.",
      "Even if a person accesses abortion medication through telehealth, Grossman said people should still be counseled on what to expect and how to treat the intense pain and nausea that can happen during the procedure. His best advice, he said, for managing pain during a medication abortion is to take a nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drug, or NSAID, such as ibuprofen, at the same time as misoprostol. If possible, he recommends also taking an anti-nausea medication such as metoclopramide, which requires a prescription.",
      "Colwill said that acetaminophen, or Tylenol, is also an option, but NSAIDs do a better job of blocking this specific pain.",
      "Putting a heating pad, a hot water bottle or over-the-counter trans-electrical nerve stimulation pads on the lower belly can also help \u201cconfuse\u201d nerves in the area and help relieve pain,\u00a0Grossman said.",
      "He said it\u2019s also important to understand what pain is \u201cnormal\u201d and when it may be time to seek medical help, especially in situations where people are at home.",
      "Pain in the middle of the lower abdomen is normal, for example, but pain higher up or pain just on one side could be a sign that something is wrong, such as an ectopic pregnancy, a life-threatening condition in which a fertilized egg implants outside the uterus.",
      "If someone experiences severe pain on one side of the abdomen or pelvis, they should go to the emergency room, Grossman said. \u201cIf they have mild to moderate pain on one side, they might try to talk to a clinician first by phone. But if there\u2019s any question, they should go to an emergency department,\u201d he added.",
      "Ectopic pregnancies are detected on ultrasounds, however, \u201cmany people have a medication abortion without having an ultrasound and it can even be missed on an ultrasound,\u201d Grossman said.",
      "Medication abortion will not work for an ectopic pregnancy, according to the Food and Drug Administration.",
      "Pain beyond 24 hours after a pregnancy is passed, especially if the person also has a fever or is vomiting, could be a sign of infection, he said.",
      "Women should also not discount the importance of moral support, he added: \u201cFeeling supported and having someone there makes a big difference, too.\u201d"

      "Andrew\u2019s office said in a statement that he\u00a0\u201cceased all contact with the individual after concerns were raised.\u201d It added that he \u201cmet the individual through official channels with nothing of a sensitive nature ever discussed.\u201d",
      "Yang also sought connections with \u201cprominent U.K. figures,\u201d including politicians, which could be \u201cleveraged\u201d for political interference by China, the court said.",

      "Pictures of Yang alongside former British Prime Ministers Theresa May and David Cameron have been published in U.K. news outlets, although it is unclear when and where the meetings took place.",
      "In his statement, Yang said that he had \u201cdone nothing wrong or unlawful\u201d and that the concerns raised by Britain\u2019s Home Office \u201care ill-founded.\u201d",
      "For the royal family, it is another embarrassing revelation about Andrew, a onetime war hero who served in Britain\u2019s Royal Navy and flew a number of missions during the 1982 conflict with Argentina over the remote\u00a0Falkland Islands.",
      "Andrew returned his military affiliations and royal patronages in January 2022 after his lawyers failed to persuade a U.S. judge to dismiss a\u00a0civil lawsuit accusing him of sexual abuse. He later paid a substantial sum to Virginia Giuffre, who alleges Andrew sexually abused her when she was 17.",
      "Giuffre has long alleged she was forced in the 1990s to have sex with Andrew after notorious pedophile Jeffrey Epstein and his\u00a0confidant, the British socialite Ghislaine Maxwell, trafficked her to him. Maxwell, 62, was jailed for 20-years after a jury concluded that she played a pivotal part\u00a0in recruiting and grooming teenage girls to be sexually abused by Epstein.",
      "Andrew has repeatedly denied the allegation.",
      "There have also been several high-profile spy cases involving China in the U.S.",
      "Federal prosecutors this year charged Linda Sun, a former top aide to New York Gov. Kathy Hochul, with violating and conspiring to violate the Foreign Agents Registration Act, visa fraud, alien smuggling and money laundering.",
      "Sun, 41, used her position to aid Chinese officials and covertly sharing internal documents with Beijing, prosecutors alleged in court papers. She was also accused of blocking Taiwanese diplomats from contacting the state government.",
      "In return, Sun received millions of dollars in transactions for the China-based business activities of her husband, Chris Hu, a job for her cousin in China and tickets to various sporting and cultural events, the indictment said.",
      "Hu was charged with money laundering conspiracy, conspiracy to commit bank fraud and misuse of means of identification.",
      "Both have pleaded not guilty."

      "China said Tuesday it was expanding its visa-free transit policy, allowing Americans and other eligible foreign travelers to stay in parts of the country as long as 240 hours, or 10 days, as officials try to attract more overseas visitors.",
      "China\u2019s National Immigration Agency announced the measure, which is effective immediately, on its WeChat account, saying passport holders from 54 countries are eligible. They include countries in Europe, Latin America and Asia, as well as the U.S. and Canada.",

    "story": [
      "The aftermath of an \u201cexceptionally violent\u201d attack in early Bronze Age England suggests that at least 37 people may have been \u201csystematically dismembered\u201d and eaten, new research has revealed.",
      "The attack, which took place around 4,000 years ago, reveals a case of cannibalism and \u201cthe darker side of human prehistory,\u201d according to the study\u00a0published Monday in the journal Antiquity.",
      "Over 3,000 bones were excavated from a 50-foot pit in Charterhouse Warren, around 20 miles south of the city of Bristol in southwest England.",
      "The bones, which were chosen for analysis because of the \u201csheer number of cutmarks,\u201d were first discovered by cavers in the 1970s,\u00a0 researchers said.",
      "They had more violence inflicted on them then what would normally be seen \"in a butchered animal bone assemblage,\u201d Rick Schulting, the study's lead author, told NBC News in an email Monday.",
      "Schulting, a professor of scientific and prehistoric archaeology at Britain's University of Oxford, said that the archeology at the site is \u201cexceptional.\u201d",
      "\u201cThe most\u00a0surprising thing is the\u00a0sheer extent of the violence carried\u00a0out on the bodies,\" he said. \"They were killed with blows to the head, and then systematically dismembered, defleshed, bones smashed\u00a0apart.\"",
      "The violence took place \u201cprobably in a single event between\u201d 2210 B.C. and 2010 B.C., researchers suggest, adding that it's a unique example of extreme violence in Early Bronze Age Britain and that \"nothing else on this scale\u201d has been recorded in Britain.",
      "However, Schulting said the extreme violence was unlikely to have been an isolated incident in the U.K. at the time. \u201cThere would have been repercussions, as the relatives and friends of the victims sought revenge, and this could have led to cycles of violence in the region,\u201d he added.",
      "Schulting said that determining the motive behind such as an attack is \u201cone of the hardest things to do in archaeology.\u201d But together with his fellow authors, he concluded in the study that the massacre was likely driven by a furious \u201cspiraling cycle of revenge\u201d within or between Early Bronze Age communities.",
      "\u201cTensions may have built up from relatively innocuous beginnings such as theft or accusations\u00a0of\u00a0witchcraft and then escalated out of control,\u201d Schulting said in his email.",
      "The victims might have been eaten to \u201cdehumanize\u201d them and \u201ctreat them like animals,\u201d Schulting said, emphasizing that this was not the action of just a few individuals. \u201cThe number of victims and the time it would have taken to dismember the victims tells us that there must have been a large number of aggressors involved.\u201d",
      "The bones were found with faunal assemblage, or animal fossils, that also showed initial \u201cevidence of butchery,\u201d although they have not been fully examined yet, the paper said.",
      "The authors do not believe that the attackers were driven to eat the human remains because of hunger, as the bone fragments were found alongside these animal bones, indicating there was sufficient food."

    "story": [
      "German Chancellor Olaf Scholz lost a vote of no confidence Monday, paving the way for early elections in February and ending a turbulent year at the polls for several of Europe's leaders and governing parties.",
      "Scholz called Monday's vote with the expectation of losing it, but with the hope that it would boost the fortunes of his center-left Social Democratic Party (SDP). He needed a 367 majority vote to win, but only 207 members of the Bundestag, or parliament, were willing to back him. A total of 394 lawmakers voted against him and 116 abstained.",
      "Scholz's fractious coalition fell apart last month after he fired Finance Minister Christian Lindner, a member of the pro-market\u00a0Free Democrats party, with which the SDP had formed a government, along with the environmentalist Green Party.",
      "Scholz accused Lindner of violating his trust at the time after Lindner publicly backed a different economic policy than the one they had agreed upon. The chancellor subsequently announced he'd call for a no-confidence vote.",
      "President Frank-Walter Steinmeier now has 21 days to decide whether to dissolve parliament and call an election, and he is expected to do so after Christmas. New elections will then have to be held within 60 days of his decision.",
      "It is only the sixth time that a no-confidence vote has been called in the country of 83 million people, Europe's most populous and the continent's largest economy.",
      "The confidence vote was needed because in post-World War II Germany, the constitution does not allow the Bundestag to dissolve itself.",
      "If Steinmeier allows the dissolution of parliament, something he is likely to rubber-stamp given his largely ceremonial role, a vote will take place just nine months before parliamentary elections had been scheduled.",
      "Scholz called the confidence vote after weeks of infighting with his coalition partners on a 2025 budget and Germany's future economic policy prior to Lindner's firing.",
      "Kallum Pickering, chief economist at Peel Hunt, a leading British investment bank, told CNBC that Germany's leaders are likely going to find agreement on fiscal policy regardless of the new election results.",
      "\"Even if within say the first three to six months of the new administration you don\u2019t get changes to the debt brake, if they have a big enough majority, eventually I think economic conditions will just force them to accept the reality that they need a fiscal stimulus,\" Pickering said.",
      "While the Christian Democratic Union,\u00a0led by Friedrich Merz, is ahead in the polls, according to Reuters, the far-right Alternative for\u00a0Germany\u00a0(AfD) could also help to shape the new government.",
      "Fresh from September's success in regional elections in Thuringia, when it became the first far-right party to win a state election in Germany since World War II, the party is also polling well at a national level.",
      "However, it is unlikely the group would be able to govern because other parties have refused to align themselves with the far right, despite Germany\u2019s parliamentary system traditionally producing coalitions.",
      "Germany's snap elections come after the Labour Party won power in the U.K. for the first time in over a decade and French President Emmanuel Macron called snap elections in his country, which led to political turmoil.",
      "Facing pressure from both the right and the left, French Prime Minister Michel Barnier resigned earlier this month after he lost a confidence vote that\u00a0collapsed his government. It was the first time in more than six decades that a parliamentary coalition fell apart in France.",
      "Macron appointed Fran\u00e7ois Bayrou, a centrist, to replace Barnier last week in the hopes that he could bridge the deeply divided government."

      "Seven foreign tourists\u00a0were hospitalized in Fiji in a suspected case of alcohol poisoning at a luxury resort, Fijian and Australian officials said Monday.",
      "The guests, who, according to local media, included an American, were hospitalized after they drank cocktails\u00a0at a bar at the five-star Warwick resort near the town of Sigatoka. The group also included four Australians and two unidentified foreign nationals.",
      "They were hospitalized with nausea, vomiting and neurological symptoms, The Associated Press reported, citing Fiji Health Ministry spokesperson Jemesa Tudravu.",
      "Two people remained stable in the hospital Monday, Tourism Minister Viliame R. Gavoka was quoted as saying by the AP, while five others have been discharged.",
      "The cause of the guests\u2019 illness was not immediately clear, and officials said that until test results were available it was too soon to say whether contaminated alcohol played a role.",
      "The case is similar to one in the Southeast Asian country of Laos last month in which six tourists, including an American and two Australian teenagers, died after they drank alcohol tainted with methanol.",
      "Gavoka said there were no other reports of similar illness at the resort or elsewhere in Fiji, a South Pacific archipelago nation that is home to about 930,000 people. He said the Warwick resort, which is on the Coral Coast of Fiji\u2019s largest island, Viti Levu, \u201cholds a strong reputation.\u201d",
      "\u201cThe resort management has assured us that they have not engaged in practices such as substituting ingredients or altering the quality of drinks served to guests,\u201d Gavoka said, according to the AP.",
      "The Warwick resort said that it takes the safety of its guests \u201cvery seriously\u201d and that it was working with authorities to determine what happened.",
      "\u201cAs a business that has proudly traded in Fiji for almost 40 years, this is an unprecedented event for us,\u201d the resort management said in a statement.",
      "They said the resort maintains the highest standards of food and beverage safety.",
      "\u201cWe remain committed to the health and safety of our guests, and we are with our guests every step of the way as we investigate this unfortunate incident,\u201d the statement said.",
      "Australian Treasurer Jim Chalmers told reporters in Canberra on Monday that four Australians had been hospitalized over the weekend and that Fiji police were investigating to determine the cause of their illnesses.",
      "\u201cWe are thinking of the friends and family of the people who are affected. This is no doubt a very distressing time for them,\u201d he said.",
      "David Sandoe, of Australia, whose daughter and granddaughter were among those affected, told Sky News Australia on Monday that they were headed back to Australia after having been cleared for release and that the hotel and Fiji police had been \u201cfantastic\u201d in keeping everyone informed.",
      "Australia has also updated its travel advisory for Fiji to warn about the risk of alcoholic drinks\u2019 being spiked or poisoned with methanol.",
      "\u201cDon\u2019t leave your drinks unattended, pay attention when your drinks are being mixed and get urgent medical help if you suspect that something is wrong,\u201d Chalmers said."
